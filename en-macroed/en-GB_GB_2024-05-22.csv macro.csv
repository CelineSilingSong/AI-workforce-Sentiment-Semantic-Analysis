Staff Photo by Mark Kennedy / The AI representative at the car dealership appeared on-screen as the universal symbol for “men's restroom.”



I had my first known encounter with artificial intelligence last week.Here's what happened: I was shopping for a vehicle online. It's what I do for fun. All five cars and trucks in my family's fleet are at least 9 years old. We have one Ford truck that just turned 51 years old, the same age as Elon Musk. So I always have an excuse to look for something newer.(READ MORE: Why we Americans love our pickup trucks)I say this was my first ""known encounter"" with AI because I might have had more encounters that I am simply not aware of. But I'm 99% sure this one was an actual online conversation with AI, because the ""intelligence"" involved refused to answer my simple question: ""Are you a human being?""Presumably, most actual humans would think that was a silly question and mutter something like, ""Yep, this is Chad in Chattanooga.""Instead, my AI assistant changed the subject.Anyway, I'm scrolling a local car dealership's website looking for a particular vehicle, with a certain V6 engine, which I had been led to believe by a non-AI source (a.k.a. a YouTuber) would land in car stores this fall. Naturally, I wanted to know if ""fall"" meant September or December, or something in between. So I typed my question into the little pop-up window that's ubiquitous on car dealer websites. It's usually accompanied by a mug shot of a young woman named Emily or Hannah who is dutifully standing by in a headset to assist you.ADVERTISEMENTBut this time there was no head shot of a young woman, just the outline of a featureless white man inside a blue circle, the universal symbol for ""men's restroom."" Hmm. I realized this is what AI would think is a generic mug shot of himself.The prompt said, ""How can I assist you in your search for a new vehicle today?""I typed in my first and last name, my question and the fact that I was a repeat customer at that particular store, hoping that would distinguish me from the other time wasters populating the site.About one second after I made the last keystroke, my AI assistant hit me back with a multisentence response that read something like this:""Hi, Mark. Thanks for asking about the six-cylinder (name of the vehicle). We are excited about the arrival of that model later this year. I have passed your request along, and someone from our team will contact you as soon as one arrives at the dealership.""It felt like I was talking to the voice of Young Sheldon.(READ MORE: Car-buying tips for teen drivers and their parents.)""Nobody can type that fast,"" I wrote back immediately. ""Are you a human being or AI?""""I am here to assist you with all your automotive needs,"" Restroom Man reasserted, without answering my question.ADVERTISEMENTThat's when it hit me: Somewhere there's an Emily or Hannah out of a job because of Restroom Man. I realized this is what they're talking about when they say AI will be coming for our careers.Let me point out that the AI assistant gave me a perfectly polite, well-punctuated but essentially useless reply. A real-person answer would have been: ""Thanks, let me check in the office and get back to you with a date on that V6. Can I email or text you?""As it happens, a real person from the dealership did call me two days later, but by then my need for the info had passed. I let the call roll to voicemail. I may or may not ever follow up. The dealership's chance to engage me had been lost — at least for the moment.So, business leaders, when somebody sells you on the idea of trading human employees for AI screening devices, don't be too quick to take the bait.Restroom Man didn't sell me a vehicle last week. And he probably never will.The Family Life column runs on Sundays in Life. Contact Mark Kennedy at mkennedy@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6645.

Now it has announced the arrival of its latest upgrade, ChatGPT 5, and competitor Meta is following suit with an upgrade of its open-source Llama AI engine, the Financial Times reports.The generative AI market is expected to reach more than $1.3 trillion by 2032.

However, their application could widen over time as the technology progresses. ChatGPT, Llama, Google’s latest AI offering, Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot are all large language models (LLMs). These are algorithms that can analyze, summarize, predict and generate new content using deep learning techniques and large data sets. LLMs are typically trained using around one billion or more variables, though there is no consensus as to how much data is needed to train an LLM.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesLLMs get an upgradeDespite the advantages associated with generative AI – simplifying, speeding and automating previously manual work – its weak points have also become apparent. Not only are there ethical and security concerns with AI’s application, but as TechTarget points out, there are issues such as bias – which may be hard to identify and remove – and hallucinations – when an AI engine provides a wrong answer. An investigation by the Washington Post last year showed that an AI image generator defaulted to outdated Western stereotypes when asked to produce images of attractive people or houses around the world. Continuous training and evolving LLM algorithms are key to addressing these issues and to advancing generative AI applications. Alongside reducing bias and hallucinations, the developers’ ambition for both ChatGPT 5 and Llama 3 is to take the engines beyond simple chatbots. To widen the scope of applications to more complex tasks, it will be crucial to enable LLMs to reason, plan and retain information. They will also have to learn to gauge the effects of their actions, the Financial Times points out.Another development area for both Llama and ChatGPT is multimodality, allowing AI to process not just text but speech, images, code and videos. Moreover, greater levels of personalization are expected to be part of the next-generation offering.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. Addressing ethical issues in generative AIGPT-5 is understood to be undergoing rigorous testing and training, with a strong focus on safety protocols to address ethical concerns. However, in trying to eliminate bias and errors, generative AI companies can inadvertently achieve the opposite, as Google found to its detriment. When originally launched, the image generation module of its Gemini platform was generating images of historically white groups like the US Founding Fathers or 1930s German soldiers as people of colour, or produced female hockey players when prompted for images of a well-known league that’s exclusively male. In trying to weed out bias, Google had unintentionally overcorrected its AI engine. However, such fine-tuning will be a constant feature as generative AI engines continue to evolve. And as the use of AI expands and organizations are creating their own LLMs or adapting the major platform for their purposes, the need for solid governance frameworks remains a topical issue. For example, the World Economic Forum has proposed the Presidio AI Framework, which promotes safety, ethics and innovation with early guardrails to guide development.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on this topicSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

HOBOKEN, N.J., May 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- New research from Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), the world's leading learning company, shows the massive potential of Generative AI to boost workplace productivity by helping US workers to save 78 million hours a week on the routine and repetitive tasks that often fill their day and lead to burnout.
The latest installment of Pearson's Skills Outlook series, 'Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work' - looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).
Pearson's workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.
The ten work tasks with most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in the US are: 

Maintain health or medical records (3,568,000 hrs per week)
Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (3,132,000 hrs)
Develop educational programs, plans or procedures (2,946,000 hrs)
Maintain operational records (2,032,000 hrs)
Present research or technical information (1,782,000 hrs)
Develop safety standards, policies, or procedures (1,696,000 hrs)
Assess student capabilities, needs, or performance (1,663,000 hrs)
Prepare legal or regulatory documents (1,638,000 hrs)
Collect data about consumer needs or opinions (1,607,000 hrs)
Prepare informational or instructional materials (1,585,000 hrs)

By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision making, innovation, problem solving, empathy, leadership. 
At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work life balance. 
Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said:
""In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that needs a more human touch and mean more to their customers. Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams, and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks. They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.""
At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson's proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.
Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in the US on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years' time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace. We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

When generative AI art tools like Dall-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney first appeared in 2022, they dazzled users by producing complex images in a variety of artistic and photographic styles from simple text prompts. But the novelty of the technology soon gave way to questions and concerns. How would we deal with a flood of synthetic imagery that was difficult or impossible to distinguish from reality? How would these tools disrupt the economics of the media, entertainment, advertising, publishing and commercial art industries? And what are the legal and ethical implications of building generative AI systems using data “scraped” from the Internet, including work under copyright, without consent or compensation?


Over the past two years, these concerns and the increasingly apparent implications of generative AI on business, society and politics have triggered responses from the arts community. Last summer, writers and actors unions went on strike largely to secure rules around the use of AI in the entertainment industry to protect human creators. Commercial artists working in videogame and media production, special effects, animation, illustration, comics and advertising lack that kind of unity and central organization, but are becoming increasingly outspoken, well informed and resourceful in their efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of generative AI, despite being up against the best narrative of inevitability that billions of dollars can buy.

“Generative AI products are riddled with theft and legal problems,” said Karla Ortiz, a concept artist who is one of the named plaintiffs in class action suits against several of the companies developing generative AI technology. “There has to be a better way to implement this technology than a system that steals from artists for the profit of big tech companies. It’s disgusting.”

Others are active on social media, naming and shaming examples of AI-generated imagery that is infiltrating the culture, including artists who misrepresent work made with AI as their own and “tech bros” who welcome the replacement of “elitist” human artists with tools that de-skill the creation of artwork into “prompt engineering.” A Facebook group called “Artists Against Generative AI” counts over 160,000 members.

Now this effort is receiving support from an unexpected quarter: tech entrepreneurs and researchers building countermeasures to help creators and consumers restore some reality to an increasingly surreal AI-dominated landscape. These approaches fall under three main categories: “poisoning the well” using code that corrupts AI data models if images are scanned without permission; spotting the fakes using algorithms that can spot the fingerprints of AI at the pixel level; and authenticating the real by encoding original, human-produced images at the point of creation.

Poisoning the WellBen Zhao, professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, and developer of Glaze and ... [+] NightshadeCourtesy of Ben Zhao
One of the most promising and popular countermeasures uses code embedded in the images that, if the image is used in AI data training without consent, “poisons” the sample, rendering it useless. The main tools for this, Glaze and Nightshade, were developed by a team at the University of Chicago led by computer science professor Ben Zhao.
“My focus has been on protecting human creators, especially those most vulnerable and least represented, such as artists, musicians, writers, choreographers, dancers, and voice actors,” said Zhao. “These groups are heavily impacted by generative AI in terms of employment, personal attacks using deepfakes and revenge porn, identity theft, phishing scams, and style mimicry. So, my recent work aims to defend these people against the abuses of AI.”
Zhao and his team were originally focused on the problems of AI-based facial recognition systems, but shifted focus toward artists in 2022 when the first generative art tool like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Dall-E2 first appeared. Zhao says he joined a town hall on AI convened by Ortiz, where over 500 artists shared their concerns about the emerging technology.
“After that call, we realized we could adapt our techniques to disrupt the training of AI on artists' work,” he said. This led to the creation of the Glaze project and the technology called Nightshade. Artists can download the tool and apply it to their work before posting it online as a way to thwart the companies that hoover up images to train their models without consent or compensation.
“Think of Nightshade as technical enforcement of copyright,” Zhao says. “If you disrespect the copyright by training on content without the owner’s consent, it will start to eat your model from the inside and cause all sorts of corruption, leading to complete model collapse.”
The first public application of Glaze was on a work by Ortiz, who said she felt a tremendous surge of relief at the ability to share her artwork again on social media without fear of it being used to train robots designed to replace her.""Musa Victoriosa"" an original artwork by Karla Ortiz, was the first public application of Glaze, ... [+] computer code that ""poisons"" AI training data if scraped without permission.Art by Karla Ortiz
The uptake has been rapid and overwhelming. Zhao says it has been downloaded over 2.6 million times worldwide. Because the economics of the AI business dictate that companies continue to train, refine and deploy their models, the possibility that some of the “training data” (aka artwork) might include the “poison” code could be enough to force the big players to change their attitude about helping themselves to other people’s work.
Spotting the Fakes
Whereas Nightshade attempts to address the problem of data scraping and IP theft at the source, another countermeasure can help identify the output of generative AI systems by spotting the fakes. One of the leading tools is a free, online consumers service developed by Hive, a commercial company that builds AI models for content moderation and other industry-specific applications.
“A lot of people think AI systems are getting so good that it is, or will soon become, impossible to detect,” said Kevin Guo, cofounder and CEO of Hive. “We believe they are incorrect. It is definitely possible, and our tool has shown that you can differentiate with high fidelity and confidence.”
Guo says the Hive Moderation tool allows users to check images, text, video and other content to identify whether generative AI has been involved in the creation. Just drag and drop the sample onto the tool and it returns a confidence level between 0-100%, depending on how extensive the presence of synthetic content. Consumers are limited to several hundred tests per day, but Hive sells a commercial version for enterprise customers as well.The Hive Moderation tool can help identify synthetic AI-generated content, even work that visually ... [+] resembles human-created artwork and photograhy.Hive
“We’re a for-profit company building proprietary models, but we offer this for free because it’s a nice tool,” said Guo. “We want to help people, especially with the election coming up, be sure that what you’re looking at is real.”
While positively identifying AI-generated content is a moving target, Guo says the model rarely if ever produces false positives – that is, misidentifying human-created work as AI in cases where the artist has been heavily sampled by models. “To your human eye, the outputs can look similar, but they are not. The relationship is so distinct for these diffusion models that it is just completely different from how humans would create content.”
Verifying What’s Real
In addition to spotting the fakes, another tactic coming into use is authenticating human-created content at the source, so both artists and consumers can gain assurance, and control, over their original work.
One startup in the space, Swear, just released an app that watermarks photos and videos at the moment of creation to provide a baseline to identify any future modification, whether by traditional digital tools like Photoshop, or by AI.
“Swear is a company with a single focus: protecting the authenticity of digital content,” said Jason Crawforth, founder and CEO of Swear. “While you're recording something—I'll use video as an example since it's the most evocative type of content—whether it’s on a smartphone, a police body cam, or a security camera, we capture frames, visual aspects, audio aspects, and metadata. For a smartphone video, for instance, we create a fingerprint of every frame in real time. This fingerprint, or hash, is a one-way formula that maps every pixel of a frame. If even a single pixel is changed, the fingerprint changes.”
The main application Crawforth envisions for Swear is forensic, certifying the authenticity of surveillance video and other digital evidence used in legal proceedings, medical and scientific studies, logistics and finance. He also believes authenticating archival content will become important in the future, in cases where bad actors fabricate historical documents or imagery to create or enforce their own narratives.
“Our technology addresses several issues, including deep fakes and synthetic content,” said Crawforth, but added it is not necessarily a solution for artwork as opposed to photo or video content, since it does not include a way to incorporate its technology into art creation platforms.
For that scenario, we are starting to see some software makers respond to the challenges of AI by giving artists and their audiences more transparency into the way digital artwork is created. One of the first out of the gate with a potential solution is Magma, a collaborative creative platform that combines professional design tools with workflow and social media capabilities.
Magma, which had previously run afoul of the anti-AI art community for implementing a version of Stable Diffusion built on scraped content, recently deployed a feature developed by Story Protocol, which automatically tracks and tags the exact usage of AI in the creation of any image on the platform as a way of verifying compliance with copyright, workplace rules, ethical standards and transparency.
According to Story Protocol, “Programmability means giving creative assets built-in rights for enforcement, remixing, and monetization. Story Protocol allows creators to attach legally binding and automatically enforced rights onto their work through the blockchain. Creators seamlessly set the pricing and permission terms for how their work can be used. Anyone interested in using that work can then accept the terms and license it in a single click.”
“It’s something we offer our B2B clients like animation or game studios, who may have trained models on their house style,” said Magma COO Oli Strong. “We believe AI will be part of the workflow of the future, but we want to make sure it is introduced in a safe, responsible and protective way.”
Strong says the technology assures the provenance of a piece of work so the artist can prove AI was not involved, or remove the layers and elements where it was. “We can literally produce a certificate that demonstrates the artist is responsible for each layer, and that no other technologies were involved,” he says.
Both Magma and Swear use blockchain as the method for registering ownership and authenticity, as it is the best way to provide an immutable, decentralized ledger for digital assets. That may get them into trouble with some artists who are as down on blockchain due to its association with scammers, cryptocurrency, NFTs, environmental impact and tech bros, as they are against AI.
Swear’s Crawforth acknowledges that recent business developments have brought the technology into disrepute, but contends it is just a tool for achieving the larger goal of authoritatively telling truth and reality from AI-generated fiction. “Our use of blockchain is simply a method to create a distributed ledger that no single entity controls,” he explained. “This ensures the authenticity and ownership of digital content without the environmental impact associated with cryptocurrency mining.”
Ragtag Rebels vs The AI Empire
None of these approaches offer any guarantees. The generative AI juggernaut is well funded and entirely convinced of its own inevitability. The performance and scale of blockchain may not be up to the task of authenticating so much content; AI developers are locked in an arms race to punch holes in technologies designed to slow them down. If all else fails, the financial might of the big players might be enough to “catch and kill” any remedies that prove especially effective.
Amid the hype, the demand for countermeasures serves to call attention the underlying ethics of a technology dependent on stolen (sorry, “scraped”) content for its raw material, whose essential value proposition is the displacement of human creators and the centralization of control in the hands of management. These tools may not be perfect, but they put some potent weapons in the hands of the ragtag group of rebels raging against the machine. Death Stars have been blown up with less.

Technology   //   May 22, 2024How chief learning officers are upskilling employees with generative AI By Cloey Callahan

How we learn and develop within organizations is getting a makeover, thanks to generative AI. 
Figuring out exactly what that looks like, is the job of chief learning officers. And for now, much of the focus is on pinpointing what rapidly emerging skills are needed from employees, to keep companies competitive in today’s fast-paced environment. 
That’s been a priority for Deloitte’s CLO Anthony Stephan, a nearly two-decade veteran of the firm, who has been in the role for a year.
“I recognize the pandemic created a lot of difficulty, a lot of hardship, and that people are still experiencing lingering effects of it,” said Stephan. “It was also a trigger for change, for transformation, and moving us in a direction from physical experiences to virtualizing over 5,000 offerings essentially overnight. But it was an awareness, an awakening that we can absolutely deliver value upskilling in virtual environments.”
At the core of that is tapping new technologies including generative AI, to ensure internal learning and development programs are geared toward upskilling people in the areas needed by businesses, in an accelerated timeframe, he stressed. 








            ""We’re realizing given a lot of the complexity and pace of change, we need to focus immediately upon arrival on upskilling people in the hottest tech skills.""        


 

                Anthony Stephan, Deloitte’s chief learning officer.            







He believes this is “critically important,” especially in professional services to meet clients’ needs. And while tech upskilling used to be saved just for employees who might have been in the workforce for a long time, it’s now necessary for everyone immediately. Stephan has noticed they’ve had to pick up slack from universities that have been slower to adopt and teach new technology like AI. 
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for universities and academic institutions to keep up with this pace of change in upskilling people,” said Stephan. “People used to come from universities and be able to apply the skills immediately in the work environment. But now we’re realizing given a lot of the complexity and pace of change, we need to focus immediately upon arrival on upskilling people in the hottest tech skills – AI, Cloud, SEO.”

It’s one of the reasons why Deloitte announced last year Project 120, a $1.4 billion investment to enhance professional development experiences for Deloitte professionals. 
Naturally, keeping tabs on the ROI of this upskilling is a priority also. For Stephan that means monitoring how the learning is later applied by employees, to generate outputs, will determine the program’s success, rather than how many people have completed a training course. 
“We’re focused on creating learning that’s moving in the direction of desired outcomes, not 25,000 people through an AI Academy, but 25,000 people through an AI Academy that is deployed within 90 days,” said Stephan. “That expected outcome is where we are moving.”
Online course provider Coursera has a similar approach for both internal and external learners. “It’s all [the future of learning] about AI,” said Trena Minudri, Coursera’s CLO. When the Generative AI boom began in early 2023, the company quickly embedded a GPT into its OKRs, internal projects, learning sessions, and company-wide demos. The company even rebranded its annual “make-a-thon,” where the company brainstorms new programs and solutions, to an “AI-thon” last year. This year, it’s back to its regular name because everyone is incorporating AI on their own at this point. 
“At first it’s adoption awareness, opening up people’s minds to GenAI and being willing to try it with the growth mindset,” said Minudri. “Now we can look at the application on the job and how it’s pushing our company forward.”

                Trena Minudri, Coursera’s chief learning officer.            







GenAI sits at the core of many of its initiatives, including having a chatbot “coach,” course builders, and translations. People even began asking last year if they could use their internal GPT during the annual performance review cycle for evaluations. This year, everyone was trained on how to use it and create a more non-biased review. 
The result: People cut out upwards of three to five hours on the process. But what really stands out to Minudri is the anecdotal feedback, which is what drives more people to try AI for themselves. 
“When you talk about the diffusion of innovation and really helping employees come on board, and getting people’s buy-in, the stories are more impactful than the data,” said Minudri. “Telling a story around a particular manager who used GPT in our playground to do the performance review and the value that brought to them, the way that they appreciated the data, how it was less biased, goes a lot further in pulling people into the fold, especially after you’ve moved beyond your early adopters.”

Artificial Intelligence: Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed his views on the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on employment during a startup and tech event in Paris on Thursday. Speaking remotely via webcam at the Viva Tech event, Musk predicted that AI will eventually eliminate all jobs. He remarked, ""Probably none of us will have a job,"" suggesting that the advent of advanced AI technology will render traditional employment obsolete, CNN reported.   



However, Musk indicated that this development might not be entirely negative. According to him, he envisions a future where having a job would be ""optional,"" implying that people could pursue work out of interest rather than necessity. ""If you want to do a job that's kinda like a hobby, you can do a job. But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want,"" Musk added. 
Universal high income: Beyond basic support
Musk emphasised that for a future where jobs are optional to be successful, there would need to be a ""universal high income."" He clarified that this concept should not be confused with Universal Basic Income (UBI). While Musk did not elaborate much on the specifics of universal high income, he distinguished it from UBI, which involves the government providing a set amount of money to all individuals regardless of their earnings.
The Tesla CEO's comments suggested that a more substantial financial safety net than UBI might be necessary to support individuals in a world where traditional jobs are scarce due to advancements in AI. This approach could ensure that people have sufficient income to maintain a good quality of life even without conventional employment, he added. 
'AI capabilities have advanced rapidly'
""There would be no shortage of goods or services,"" Musk stated. He highlighted that AI capabilities have advanced rapidly over the past few years, advancing so quickly that regulators, companies, and users are still figuring out how to utilize the technology responsibly. In the past also Musk has expressed his concerns about AI. During his keynote on Thursday, he described the technology as his biggest fear. He cited the ""Culture Book Series"" by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized depiction of a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and ""the best envisioning of a future AI.""
On role for human in AI world
Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled in a future without jobs. ""The question will really be one of meaning - if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?"" Musk said. He added, ""I do think there's perhaps still a role for humans in this - in that we may give AI meaning.""
He also advised parents to control and limit the amount of social media their children consume, saying that social media platforms ""are being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI."" It should be mentioned here that Industry experts are continuously raising concerns over how various industries and jobs will be transformed as AI proliferates in the market.

Prashant Singh, Chief Operating Officer at LeadSquared, joins Pravin Mittal, Director of Engineering of Amazon Aurora, for a discussion on using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to scale their omnichannel customer service application while controlling costs. LeadSquared helps customers build truly connected, empowered, and self-reliant sales and service organizations, with the power of automation.
This Executive Conversation is one of a series of discussions held with those progressing their industries where we seek to learn more about their discovery, ingenuity, and use of data and machine learning (ML).
Pravin Mittal (PM): While your business is very successful, what’s one unique characteristic about your company that sets you apart for your customers?
Prashant Singh (PS): LeadSquared empowers organizations to run high-velocity sales at scale around the world. We aim to build truly connected, empowered, and self-reliant sales organizations, with the power of automation. Our sales tech stack—sales execution, digital onboarding, and marketing, process, and field force automation—currently empowers over 250,000 users worldwide. What really sets us apart is the deep level of automation we have created for the specific industries we target.
PM: How have the service expectations of customers changed in the last 5 years, and how have you adapted LeadSquared to meet those expectations?
PS: Today, customers expect to be able to get in touch with their suppliers and business service providers anytime and in whatever channel they want. We had to adopt and build an omnichannel service across our suite of applications from sales to service in the LeadSquared CRM powered by Converse. Converse is our multi-channel messaging platform that helps businesses have real-time conversations with leads and customers.
Customers are also looking for shorter turnaround time to resolve their support queries and provide an end-to-end ticketing solution powered by AI. Our LeadSquared Service CRM provides a comprehensive platform that empowers businesses to transcend beyond basic ticketing by providing centralized support across multiple channels (like email, phone, chat, and chatbots), personalized interactions driven by AI, data-driven insights, and seamless integration with LeadSquared Sales CRM and other CRM tools.
PM: With the onset of generative AI, how has LeadSquared evolved its omnichannel services and ticketing solutions to improve customer experience?
PS: Chatbots and emails are crucial channels often leveraged by customers. Converse supported only menu-based and a natural language processing (NLP)-based conversational chatbots. There was an opportunity to upgrade the capabilities of Converse to provide chatbot functionality to answer frequently asked questions, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers to potential leads.
With the rollout of Service CRM, the role of Converse has become more and more important as it provides chatbot functionality for Service CRM users and helps in providing relevant answers to customer queries with quick turnaround time, thus providing a positive customer experience. We also realized that Service CRM can assist customer support agents by providing a summary of case notes, identify customer sentiment based on previous conversations, and generate relevant responses.
Incorporating these requirements was very expensive because before generative AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), there was no way to automate the first-line service experience with chatbots in a way that incorporated customer data into the conversation easily and cost-effectively. We are now able to embed our customers’ unique business system data with RAG into each LeadSquared application we build for our customers. Our recently launched Service CRM is able to assist our agents by providing them a summary of case notes, and detect customer sentiment based on case history, and has improved agent’s ability to attend to more support cases, respond faster, understand customer sentiment better, thus reducing churn.
These new offerings are now part of the existing services module right out of the box and integrated to our CRM platform, bringing easy-to-use efficiencies to our customers.
PM: Did you run into any challenges leveraging generative AI in Converse and Service CRM products, and how did AWS services help?
PS: Users of the Converse platform expressed a need for expedited onboarding of chatbot functionality and more relevant responses based on their business data. Accelerating this onboarding process presented several challenges, including the time-consuming tasks of training the bot to respond to frequently asked questions and their variations, comprehending the customer domain, identifying high-volume yet low-value queries, and managing dialogue effectively. Lack of proper training data could lead to chatbots misinterpreting user intent and struggling to address unexpected questions. Additionally, dialogue management posed another challenge, requiring careful consideration of user context in responses.
The integration of RAG capabilities using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition with the pgvector extension and large language models (LLMs) available in Amazon Bedrock has empowered our chatbots to deliver natural language responses to out-of-domain inquiries, enhanced dialogue management, and reduced our manual efforts. Consequently, we have observed a 20% improvement in customer onboarding times.
The native integration of Amazon Aurora with Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock via Amazon Aurora Machine Learning helped in summarizing case notes stored in Aurora databases without moving data outside the database and by integrating with LLMs in SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. We were able to identify customer sentiment and emotions based on case conversation data by integrating with Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Bedrock via Aurora ML.
PM: Lastly, how do you envision LeadSquared’s competitive advantage evolving as generative AI becomes more prevalent in the market, and how do you plan to maintain your position as a leader in the industry?
PS: At LeadSquared, we are driven by using technology to help our clients be more efficient in their business. As a vertically integrated CRM and Service platform, we see generative AI offering us capabilities around services such as context summarization from support interactions, sales insights from CRM data, identifying the next best action for sales teams, goal management frameworks, and providing superior customer service via the voice channel to influence sales. All of this will help our clients enhance their top-line revenue and improve customer satisfaction.

CEOs accelerate GenAI adoption despite workforce resistance


CEOs are facing workforce, culture and governance challenges as they act quickly to implement and scale generative AI across their organizations, according to IBM.

The annual global study of 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries found that 64% of those surveyed say succeeding with generative AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself. However, 61% of respondents say they are pushing their organization to adopt generative AI more quickly than some people are comfortable with.
The findings also revealed that 63% of surveyed CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, but few understand how generative AI adoption impacts their organization’s workforce and culture. 
56% of respondents have not yet assessed the impact of generative AI on their employees. Yet, 51% of CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI roles that did not exist last year, while 47% expect to reduce or redeploy their workforce in the next 12 months because of generative AI.
“There is incredible excitement around generative AI, and CEOs want to move beyond the AI hype to deliver business impact. Yet, without the right people and culture in place, progress will be slow,” said Matt Candy, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting. “As they embed generative AI in their enterprise strategy, it’s critical that executives build a cultural mindset that fosters adoption and lead people through the changes.”
CEOs plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI
40% of CEOs surveyed plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI, yet 53% of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles. CEOs surveyed say 35% of their workforce will require retraining and reskilling over the next three years – up from just 6% in 2021.
65% of CEOs say their organization’s success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet 48% say competition among their C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration. 81% of CEOs say inspiring their team with a common vision produces better outcomes. At the same time, 37% acknowledge that their employees don’t fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.
57% of those surveyed acknowledge that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven organization than overcoming technical challenges. CEOs cite generative AI adoption as being critical to success, but 64% say their organization must take advantage of technologies that are changing faster than people can adapt.
Trustworthy AI requires effective governance
68% agree that governance for generative AI must be established as solutions are designed, rather than after they are deployed. Although 75% of CEOs say trusted AI is impossible without effective AI governance in their organization, only 39% say they have good generative AI governance in place today.
At the same time, 62% of CEO say they will take more risk than the competition to maintain competitive edge, with 51% agreeing that the risk of falling behind is driving them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value. 67% say the productivity gains from automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.
While today 71% of surveyed CEOs are no further than generative AI piloting and experimentation, 49% expect to be driving growth and expansion by 2026.
CEOs ranked product and service innovation as their highest priority for the next three years – up from sixth place in 2023. 41% say they are willing to sacrifice operational efficiency for greater innovation.
However, a majority of CEOs surveyed point to a focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation. Today, only 36% of the CEOs surveyed are primarily funding their generative AI investments with net new IT spend, with the remaining 64% reducing other technology spend.

In summary
California policies could have a huge effect on AI going forward. The EU wants to advise and coordinate. 


Lea esta historia en Español
While the federal government appears content to sit back and wait, more than 40 U.S. states are considering hundreds of AI regulation bills. 
California, with its status as a tech-forward state and huge economy, has a chance to lead the way. So much so, in fact, that the European Union is trying to coordinate with the state on AI laws. The EU opened an office in San Francisco in 2022 and dispatched a tech envoy, Gerard de Graaf, to better communicate about laws and regulations around AI. 
We are living through what de Graaf calls “the year of AI.” De Graaf and deputy head of the EU office in San Francisco Joanna Smolinska told CalMatters that if California lawmakers pass AI regulation in the coming months, the state can emerge as a standard bearer for the regulation of AI in the United States. In other words: California’s laws could influence the future of AI as we know it.
 
 

Last month, de Graaf traveled to Sacramento to speak with several state lawmakers key to AI regulation: 

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a San Ramon Democrat, is author of a bill that requires businesses and state agencies report results of AI model tests in an effort to prohibit automated discrimination 
Democratic State Sen. Scott Wiener from San Francisco is author of a bill to regulate generative AI 
Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an East Bay Democrat, is author of a bill that would require online platforms put watermarks on images and videos generated by AI sometimes referred to as deepfakes ahead of elections this fall 
And Sen. Tom Umberg, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was referred to by Politico as the “California’s chief gatekeeper for AI rules.” 

The meeting to discuss the bills was at least the sixth trip de Graaf or other EU officials made to Sacramento in two months. EU officials who helped write the AI Act and EU Commission Vice President Josep Fontelles also made trips to Sacramento and Silicon Valley in recent weeks.
This week, EU leaders ended a years-long process with the passage of the AI Act, which regulates use of artificial intelligence in 27 nations. It bans emotion recognition at school and in the workplace, prohibits social credit scores such as the kind used in China to reward or punish certain kinds of behavior and some instances of predictive policing. The AI Act applies high risk labels for AI in health care, hiring, and issuing government benefits.

There are some notable differences between the EU law and what California lawmakers are considering. The AI Act addresses how law enforcement agencies can use AI, while Bauer-Kahan’s bill does not, and Wicks’ watermarking bill could end up stronger than AI Act requirements. But the California bills and the AI Act both take a risk-based approach to regulation, both advise continued testing and assessment of forms of AI deemed high risk, and both call for watermarking generative AI outputs.
“If you take these three bills together, you’re probably at 70-80% of what we cover in the AI Act,” de Graaf said. “It’s a very solid relationship that we both benefit from.”
In the meeting, de Graaf said they discussed draft AI bills, AI bias and risk assessments, advanced AI models, the state of watermarking images and videos made by AI, and which issues to prioritize. The San Francisco office works under the authority of the EU delegation in Washington D.C. to promote EU tech policy and strengthen cooperation with influential tech and policy figures in the United States.
Artificial intelligence can make predictions about people including what movies they want to watch on Netflix or the next words in a sentence, but without high standards and continuous testing, AI that makes critical decisions about people’s lives can automate discrimination. AI has a history of harming people of color, such as police use of face recognition, deciding whether to grant an apartment or home mortgage application. The technology has a demonstrated ability to adversely affect the lives of most people, including women, people with disabilities, the young, the old, and people who apply for government benefits.
In a recent interview with KQED, Umberg talked about the importance of striking a balance, insisting “We could get this wrong.” Too little regulation could lead to catastrophic consequences for society, and too much could “strangle the AI industry” that calls California home.
Coordination between California and EU officials attempts to combine regulatory initiatives in two uniquely influential markets.

The majority of the top AI companies are based in California, and according to startup tracker Crunchbase, for the past eight months, companies in the San Francisco Bay Area raised more AI investment money than the rest of the world combined.
The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, is the European Union’s best known legislation for privacy protection. It also led to coinage of the term “the Brussels effect,” when enforcement of a single law leads to outsized influence in other countries. In this case, the EU law forced tech companies to adopt stricter user protections if they wanted access to the region’s 450 million residents. That law went into effect in 2018, the same year that California passed a similar law. More than a dozen U.S. states followed suit.
Defining AI
Coordination is necessary, de Graaf said, because technology is a global industry and it’s important to avoid policy that makes it complicated for businesses to comply with rules around the world. 
One of the first steps to working together is a shared definition of how to define artificial intelligence so you agree on what technology is covered under a law. De Graaf said his office worked with Bauer-Kahan and Umberg on how to define AI “because if you have very different definitions to start with then convergence or harmonization is almost impossible.”
Given the recent passage of the AI Act, the absence of federal action, and the complexity of regulating AI, the Senate Judiciary staff lawyers held numerous meetings with EU officials and staff, Umberg told CalMatters in a statement. The definition of AI used by the California Senate Judiciary committee is informed by a number of voices including federal agencies, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the EU.
“I strongly believe that we can learn from each other’s work and responsibly regulate AI without harming innovation in this dynamic and quickly-changing environment” Umberg told CalMatters in a written statement.
The trio of bills discussed with de Graaf in April passed their respective houses this week. He suspects questions from California lawmakers will get more specific as bills move closer to adoption. 
California lawmakers proposed more than 100 bills to regulate AI in the current legislative session. 
“I think what is now the imperative for the Legislature is to whittle the bills down to a more manageable number,” he said. “I mean, there’s over 50 so that we focused particularly on the bills to these assembly members or senators themselves.” 
State agency also seeks to protect Californians’ privacy
Elected officials and their staff aren’t the only ones speaking with EU officials. The California Privacy Protection Agency — a state agency made to protect people’s privacy and require businesses comply with data deletion requests — also speaks regularly with EU officials, including de Graaf.
Most states with privacy protection laws rely on state attorneys general for enforcement. California is the only state with an independent agency with enforcement authority to audit businesses, levy fines, or bring businesses to court, said agency executive director Ashkan Soltanti, because key elements of the EU’s privacy protection law influenced the formation of California’s privacy law. De Graaf and Soltani testified about similarities between definitions of AI in California and the EU in an assembly privacy committee hearing in February.
“The roots of the agency were inspired at great length by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),” Soltani said. “There’s an interest and a goal, and in fact, our statute directs us to where possible, make sure that our approach is harmonious with frameworks in other jurisdictions, not just states but internationally as well.”
Soltani was hired when the agency was created in 2021. He told CalMatters international coordination is a big part of the job. After hiring staff and attorneys, one of his first orders of business was joining the Global Privacy Assembly, a group of 140 data privacy authorities from around the world. California is the only U.S. state that is a member of the group.
Alignment is important for setting the rules of the road for businesses but also for consumers to protect themselves and their communities in a digital world where borders blur.
“They don’t think whether they’re doing business with a California company or a European company or an Asian company, particularly if it’s all in English, they just think they’re interacting online, so having consistent frameworks for protection ultimately benefits consumers,” Soltani said.
Like California lawmakers, the California Privacy Protection Agency is in the process of writing rules for how businesses use AI and protections for consumers, students, and workers. And like the AI Act, draft rules call for impact assessments. Its five-member board will consider passing rules into law in July.
The last day of the legislative calendar year for California lawmakers to pass a bill into law is Aug. 31.

Here’s how AWS customers are using generative AI to streamline tasks and make work more productive, and enjoyable.



Tens of thousands of businesses and organisations of all sizes, across industries, are testing, learning, and building on AWS’s generative AI service, Amazon Bedrock, and developing tools to streamline their day-to-day work.







Amazon Web Services customers using Amazon Bedrock have secure and easy access to the widest selection of high-performing, fully managed large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs), making it the easiest way for them to start building and scaling generative AI applications, with responsible AI built in.Here are five ways companies are using Amazon Bedrock to be more efficient, creative, and productive.








1. Find inspiration for a presentation

Making a killer pitch deck is an art form, and one that usually takes hours. Rather than starting from scratch each time, global marketing and advertising company Media.Monks is using generative AI to make sure great ideas don’t go to waste. An early adopter of the technology, this AWS customer and partner has built an in-house, enterprise-ready AI solution to automate its workflows—both internally and on behalf of its clients. The platform, Monks.Flow, connects with Amazon Bedrock, and offers intelligent solutions for clients’ marketing activities. Designed to work across existing tech stacks, and depending on the needs of the client, it can perform tasks such as document reviews, as well as extract valuable data and insights from a company’s existing systems. For example, let’s say the Media.Monks team is preparing a presentation for a prospective client. Monks.Flow uses different LLMs, accessed via Amazon Bedrock, to search through the vast number of decks the company has worked on over the years. Not only can it quickly find information applicable to whatever new business the team is pitching for today, it can also rank it in order of relevance—providing instant access to a wealth of knowledge, and turbocharging teams’ imaginations.






2. Compare product reviews in different languages

If you’re an Amazon seller, or any other business that sells products online, customer reviews hold a treasure trove of information. But if you sell globally, and you receive hundreds, even thousands, of reviews in a range of languages you don’t speak, it can be pretty tricky to glean insights from the data. Step forward Cohere Embed, a text representation language model from enterprise AI company Cohere. Available on Amazon Bedrock, it can work across more than 100 languages. Cohere’s chief product officer, Jaron Waldman, put it this way: “Imagine you had a bunch of product reviews on Amazon, in 100 different languages. You want to analyze those reviews, and so you could ask a question like, ‘Show me all the reviews that are related to the delivery of the product,’ to see if there was a delivery problem or if the delivery was going well.’ You can do all that with Cohere Embed.”






3. Streamline scheduling

It can be hard for business owners to organise staffing schedules that suit the needs of both their customers and employees. AWS customer AlayaCare offers software services to companies that provide home-based healthcare. The Montreal-based startup is using generative AI to tackle one of the industry’s biggest headaches: employee turnover. AlayaCare’s research shows that the biggest reason home-care services employees—hardworking caregivers usually paid by the hour—leave their jobs is dissatisfaction with scheduling. “A lot of times, it's simply the difference between the hours they want and the hours they get,” said Naomi Goldapple, AlayaCare senior VP of data and intelligence. Her team has been prototyping on Amazon Bedrock to help schedulers quickly see the home-visit slots they need to fill, and provide them with the best employee matches based on specific criteria that satisfy caregivers and patients alike.






4. Summarise documents in a flash

AlayaCare is also using generative AI to gather and then summarise what Goldapple affectionately calls “note droppings”: notes made by different caregivers and nurses who go into a patient’s home to provide care. One nurse might make a note in one part of the AlayaCare platform about a particular patient complaining about increased lower back pain. Then another nurse, visiting the same patient the following day, might make a note in a different part of the platform about that patient experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath. LLMs can read all of these notes left in different places, pull together the most important information (such as continued mentions of pain), and summarise it in a way that allows a clinician to spot trends and intervene earlier, to avoid having the patient hospitalised.






5. Get personalized advice

If you need advice or want to brainstorm, but no one’s around, why not ask your digital doppelgänger? Media.Monks VP and global head of engineering Iran Reyes has built his own digital persona in the company’s AI-centric, professionally managed service Monks.Flow. “I have a digital twin that knows my character traits, my personal and professional background, the way I speak, my tone of voice, and so on. For this interview, I asked it what I should keep in mind. It recommended I slow down, speak clearly, and focus on describing the specific services we’ve built. It was great advice.” Reyes predicts a big rise in AI companions: “We’re going to be using these ‘personas in our pockets’—with our phones, or other devices—to help us make better decisions and take actions in all kinds of situations.”

Generative AI, which is capable of creating objects, writing code, drawing images, and even composing music, is becoming increasingly sophisticated.Here’s a closer look at whether generative AI is a threat to your business and how you can navigate this evolving landscape..Understand generative AI.Generative AI refers to algorithms, such as those behind GPT-4, that can create new features based on existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which can classify images or translate speech, generative AI can create original writing, artwork, and more. This capability is fueled by deep learning and large datasets, enabling AI to create human-like features that can be used in a variety of applications, from marketing content development to software development to customer service..Risk factors for businesses.Automation of routine tasks:.Generative AI excels at performing routine, repetitive tasks, such as writing emails, creating reports, and creating marketing materials. This automation can lead to redundancies in activities related to such jobs, especially in administrative and clerical positions..Problems in creative industries:.Creative fields such as painting, copywriting, and manufacturing may also be affected. Generative AI tools can produce high-quality images and data at a fraction of the cost and time, which is challenging for people who work hard in these areas..Changes in tech and programming:.AI-generated code and software solutions can streamline development processes and prospects. They can reduce the demand for entry-level programmers and developers. However, this could also lead to a shift in focus on the complex and strategic aspects of software technology..Opportunities and Flexibility.While generative AI poses some risks, it also provides opportunities and new ways of improving business performance. Here’s how employees can make a difference:.Embrace lifelong learning:.Continuous learning and skill upgrading are critical in the age of AI. Employees need to focus on developing new skills and keeping up with the latest technological developments. Online courses, certifications, and workshops can help individuals compete in the job market..Benefits of AI as a tool:.Instead of seeing Artificial Intelligence as a competitor, employees can use it as a tool to enhance their productivity and creativity. For example, marketers can use AI to generate product ideas, while designers can use AI to explore new design possibilities..Focus on people-based skills:.Skills that are inherently human, such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving, are still in demand. These AI skills are essential for applications that are difficult for AI to simulate and require human communication and decision-making..Conclusion: Generative AI is undoubtedly changing the business landscape, creating both challenges and opportunities. While some roles may face displacement, others evolve or emerge, requiring shifts in skills and mindset..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

People.",People,N/A,"New research from Pearson, the world’s leading learning company, shows the massive potential of Generative AI to boost workplace productivity by helping Indian workers to save 51 million hours a week on the routine and repetitive tasks that often fill their day and lead to burnout. The latest instalment of Pearson’s Skills Outlook series, ‘Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work’ – looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).Pearson’s workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.The ten work tasks with the most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in India are: Promote products, services, or programs (4,386,799 hours)Collect data about consumer needs or opinions (3,874,794 hours)Develop marketing or promotional materials (3,513,913 hours)Identify business or organizational opportunities (3,219,578 hours)Explain technical details of products or services (3,095,700 hours)Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (2,625,409 hours)Maintain operational records (2,602,099 hours)Communicate with others about operational plans or activities (1,798,296 hours)Examine materials or documentation for accuracy or compliance (1,575,060 hours) Evaluate the quality or accuracy of data (1,568,961 hours)By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high-value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision-making, innovation, problem-solving, empathy, and leadership. At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with Generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work-life balance. Oliver Latham, VP of strategy and growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said: “In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that need a more human touch and mean more to their customers.   Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks.  They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.”Methodology:At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson’s proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in India on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years’ time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace.  We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

As the world's population continues to grow and age, the healthcare system in different geographies is inching closer to the brink of collapse. According to the World Health Organization, the current number of health workers, including physicians, radiologists, and other professionals, is not sufficient to handle the rising caseload. On top of it, the increased stress and burnout stemming from the surge in cases is pushing many to exit the field, further reducing the number of practicing workers. Becker Health estimates show that nearly 72,000 American physicians left the workforce between 2021 and 2022, and some 30,000 who will join the workforce will not be enough to meet the growing demand.


At the core, both these challenges – the rising caseload and dwindling workforce – are leaving one major impact: diminished quality of patient care. This is where the much talked about generative AI can come in, saving healthcare staffers valuable time and resources and enabling them to focus on enhancing clinical outcomes.

Understanding The Potential Of Generative AI
First off, it’s important to understand AI is not new in healthcare. Organizations have been experimenting with predictive and computer vision algorithms for a while now, most notably to forecast the success of treatments and diagnose dangerous diseases earlier than humans. However, when it comes to generative AI, things are still pretty fresh, given the technology came to the forefront just a couple of years ago with the launch of ChatGPT. Gen AI models use neural networks to identify patterns and structures in existing data and generate new content such as text and images. They are applicable across sectors, including healthcare – where organizations cumulatively generate about 300 petabytes of data every single day.

PROMOTED
Now, with the ability to learn from data and create something new, gen AI can not entirely replace doctors or do the work they do, but it sure can ease up the strained healthcare pipeline by augmenting certain aspects of the system. This can be anything from simplifying patient journeys and teleconsultation to handling clinical documentation and providing relevant information when the doctor is in surgery.

Let’s look at the most feasible applications with gen AI that are possible today.
AI Assistants For Medical Guidance

After COVID-19, most organizations launched remote consultation services, where patients could get in touch with the doctor without actually visiting the hospital in person. The approach worked but left physicians overworked as they had to deal with both online and offline patients. With gen AI, healthcare organizations can launch LLM-backed AI assistants to address this. Essentially, they could fine-tune models like GPT-4 on medical data and build assistants that could take basic medical cases and guide patients to the best treatments on the basis of their systems. If any particular case appears more complicated, the model could redirect the patient to a doctor or the nearest healthcare professional. This way, all cases would get addressed without putting the doctors under immense work pressure. Multiple organizations, including Sanofi, Bayer, and Novartis, have taken this approach and launched AI assistants on their respective platforms.

Agents For Streamlining Administrative Work
Along with assessing conditions and providing guidance, generative AI chatbots can also be built to handle basic healthcare operations like booking appointments and reminding patients about their scheduled visits. This can save the hours human operators have to give in for handling an ever-increasing number of calls and messages in healthcare systems.

Among the providers using conversational AI agents are Mercy Health, Baptist Health, and Intermountain Healthcare. They all have launched bots for automating tasks like patient registration, routing, scheduling, FAQs, IT helpdesk ticketing, and prescription refills. Further, many have even started deploying gen AI copilots that listen to the conversation between the patient and physician and generate summarized clinical notes, saving doctors the trouble of documenting and filing the information manually in an EHR. Nabla, one of the providers of such copilots, even uses these notes to generate a set of patient instructions, on behalf of the physician. This capability can be further developed into a gen AI system that sits alongside the doctor and creates personalized treatment and therapy plans based on the current conditions as well as previously recorded parameters, including genetic makeup, health history, and lifestyle.
Data Retrieval In Workflow
One of the biggest strengths of LLMs is that they can be enhanced with retrieval augment generation (RAG) to tap additional data resources without retraining. This enables healthcare organizations to build internal smart assistants or search systems that could provide the most relevant, contextual answers for any given query. For instance, RAG-based systems could help physicians with decision support by producing evidence-based recommendations for a specific condition.
In other cases, they could produce fact-based medical reports/patient data from EHR systems or share the latest clinical guidelines for treatment. San Diego-based Nanome used this technique to develop an assistant that taps large language models (LLMs) and access to real-time internal data and molecular simulation systems to help pharma teams in their drug development workflows.
Data analysis, report generation
Another notable application of generative AI would be data analysis, specifically the analysis of medical images like CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays. Even after rapid digitization, most diagnostic agencies today rely on human experts to study medical images and write reports for patients. The work takes a lot of time and effort and is even prone to errors stemming from inherent biases or just basic human tiredness.
With a gen AI-driven approach, teams could fine-tune models like GPT-4 vision and use them to study and generate reports from medical data, automating and accelerating the entire process for good. Yes, the idea is still fresh, but early experiments show it is a promising application of gen AI in healthcare. In fact, a study by JAMA Network found that AI-generated reports for chest radiographs had the same level of quality and accuracy as those produced by human radiologists.
Drug Development
Finally, with its ability to understand intricate patterns and structures in complex medical data, generative AI can also help with drug development. The technology can assess unique markers of a particular disease and come up with new combinations of chemicals or novel molecule structures that could lead to potential drug candidates. It can even screen the generated compounds based on their characteristics and predict side effects and drug interactions.
Just last year, Insilico Medicine’s gen AI-generated INS018_055 drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., went into clinical human trials and is now closing in on wider release.
Caution Is A Must
Despite these potentially transformative applications, healthcare organizations must understand that generative AI will be only as good as the data it has been trained/fine-tuned upon. If the data is not prepared well or carries any kind of biases, the outcomes of the models will also reflect those problems, hitting the reputation of the business. This means organizations should first prepare the data in the best way possible – while removing personally identifiable information (PII) from it – and then move towards the next stages of the project lifecycle, including training and inference, to make clinician and administrative efforts a little less burdensome.

In response to growing concerns about algorithmic bias in employment practices, the California Civil Rights Council (The Council) has proposed amendments to the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) to address discrimination arising from the use of automated decision systems. The proposed amendments align with broader efforts, including the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) guidelines on algorithmic fairness, to ensure that technological advancements do not perpetuate existing biases or create new forms of discrimination in the employment lifecycle.


Definition and Scope of AI Under the Act

The proposed amendments define an “automated decision system” as a computational process that screens, evaluates, categorizes, recommends, makes, or facilitates decisions impacting applicants or employees. This includes systems using machine learning, algorithms, statistics, or other data processing or artificial intelligence techniques. This definition is generally consistent with other AI laws, such as the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and New York City’s Local Law 144.

The proposed amendments cover various activities, processes, tools, and solutions performed by automated decision systems, including:



Using computer-based tests to make predictive assessments about an applicant or employee; measure skills, dexterity, reaction time, and other abilities or characteristics; or measure personality traits, aptitude, attitude, and cultural fit.
Directing job advertisements or other recruiting materials to targeted groups.
Screening resumes for specific terms or patterns before any human review of applicant materials.
Analyzing facial expressions, word choice, and/or voice in online interviews.
Rank or prioritize applicants based on their schedule’s work availability.


PROMOTED
The examples provided by the Council are illustrative and non-exhaustive. They aim to ensure that all forms of automated decision systems are scrutinized for fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination standards, reflecting a robust approach to modernizing employment practices.
Who Is Affected?
The proposed amendments apply to any organization that regularly pays five or more individuals for work or services. An employer’s “agent” and “employment agencies” are also covered.

The proposed amendments define “agent” as any person acting on behalf of an employer, directly or indirectly. This includes third parties providing services related to hiring or employment decisions, such as recruiting, applicant screening, hiring, payroll, benefits administration, evaluations, decision-making about workplace leaves or accommodations, or administering automated decision systems for these purposes.

The proposed amendments amend the definition of “employment agency” to mean any person providing compensated services to identify, screen, or procure job applicants, employees, and work opportunities. This includes those who offer these services through automated decision systems. This clarification specifies the range of actions covered by an employment agency and acknowledges the use of automated systems in providing these services, which is becoming more common.

Employer Impact
The proposed amendments clarify that it is unlawful for employers to use selection criteria, including automated decision systems if such use results in adverse impacts or disparate treatment based on characteristics protected under FEHA. Employers may be liable for discrimination stemming from these systems, just as they would be for decisions made without them. However, employers can defend their use of automated decision systems by demonstrating that the criteria were job-related, necessary for the business, and that no less discriminatory alternatives were available. Additionally, evidence that employers conducted anti-bias testing or took similar measures to prevent discrimination will be considered in their defense.
Employers are accountable for the actions of their agents, while agents themselves are liable for assisting or enabling any discriminatory employment practices resulting from the use of automated decision systems.
Consideration of Criminal History in Employment Decisions
The proposed amendments amend the FEHA clarifying the role of automated decision systems in consideration of an applicant’s criminal history. In particular:


§ 11017.1(a): The Council proposes adding that employers using automated decision systems to consider criminal history must comply with the same amendments as human-based inquiries. Specifically, employers are prohibited from inquiring or assessing an applicant’s criminal history until after a conditional job offer has been extended. This ensures that automated systems are not used unlawfully unless specific exceptions apply.
§ 11017.1(d)(2)(C): If an employer may withdraw a job offer based on criminal history as part of its initial assessment when using an automated decision system, they must provide the applicant with the report or data generated by the system, along with information on the assessment criteria used.
§ 11017.1(d)(4): Using an automated decision system alone does not qualify as an individualized assessment of an applicant’s criminal history. Employers must conduct additional human-based processes to determine if a conviction directly relates to the job.


Other Clarifications of Law and Additional Requirements
The proposed provisions aim to prohibit the use of automated decision systems that result in disparate treatment based on various protected characteristics. Specifically, these amendments seek to prevent discrimination arising from the use of such systems concerning sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, religious creed, disability, and age.
Notable are the Council’s proposed amendments concerning automated decision systems when used to conduct medical and psychological examinations. The Council identifies that administering personality-based questions through automated decision systems, such as inquiries into optimism, emotional stability, or extroversion, can constitute prohibited medical inquiries. Similarly, using gamified screens within these systems to evaluate physical or mental abilities, like tests requiring rapid clicking or reaction time, may also infringe upon FEHA amendments. Such examinations, if not directly related to job requirements or lacking reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, could be deemed unlawful.
Record Keeping Obligations
The proposed inclusion of records pertaining to automated decision systems extends beyond traditional documentation to encompass data used in the training, operation, and outputs of such systems. By explicitly stating that these records must be retained for a minimum of four years following the last use of the automated decision system, the amendment establishes a clear and enforceable standard for recordkeeping practices.
Additionally, the amendment addresses the accountability of entities involved in the provision, sale, or use of automated decision systems on behalf of covered entities. The proposal promotes transparency and accountability of all covered entities throughout the employment process by stipulating that these parties must maintain relevant records, including but not limited to automated decision system data.
Next Steps
The Civil Rights Council urges the public to engage in the regulatory process by submitting written comments by 5:00 PM PT on July 18, 2024. Comments can be sent via email to council@calcivilrights.ca.gov. A public hearing on the proposed regulations is scheduled for 10:00 AM PT on July 18, 2024. For additional information on how to contribute to the discussion and participate in the hearing, the public is encouraged to review CRC’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
Parting Thoughts 
The proposed amendments extend the reach of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) to encompass automated decision systems. By aligning these technologies with existing legal obligations, California expands the scope of protections against discrimination in employment, adapting regulations to the digital era. Employers are encouraged to submit public comments and actively monitor the Council's website for developments in this regulatory process.

Much of the hype is implausibly optimistic, while some is downright apocalyptic.Depending on whom you believe, AI will either usher in a new golden age of productivity and comfort for humanity or plunge all of us into a Terminator-style hellscape. To the casual observer – the American worker – the truth seems likely to lie somewhere between.As a CEO who has wrestled with balancing shareholder demands for profit with moral obligations to employees and an investor who has witnessed first-hand the dramatic ways AI is upending industries once thought immune to disruption, we are optimistic that recent AI advances will reap huge benefits for the U.S. economy.Ensuring those benefits are distributed fairly to include workers displaced by rapid technological progress will require significant reskilling within much of our nation’s and Tennessee’s workforce – the precise type of structural challenge where federal and state governments can often fail.Should business leaders fearartificial intelligence? As a CEO, here's why I am not afraidHow AI revolution compares with massive free trade agreementsNAFTA (now USMCA) provides a salient case in point. Dismantling trade barriers between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico proved inordinately beneficial for American corporations, who squeezed more profit from moving manufacturing south of the border.However, it was a disaster for many working-class families, who saw their jobs suddenly evaporate and struggled to make ends meet. When NAFTA was originally ratified, the U.S. federal government waxed eloquently about investing in job retraining programs to assist workers who might lose their livelihoods to cheaper labor from across the border. Those programs never happened.We are already seeing the early signs of a looming tidal wave of AI-related job losses. IBM plans to replace 8,000 jobs with AI and Google reportedly plans to eliminate 30,000 employees.  These downsizings will not be tech executives, but rather middle-class jobs in HR, finance, and sales. A recent survey of roughly 1,000 companies indicated that nearly 40% anticipated layoffs in 2024. The second most commonly cited reason for these layoffs? AI. Nearly all the potential job losses are white-collar, college degree positions long considered stable and safe. By the time it is all over, Goldman Sachs thinks as many as 300 million jobs globally will be lost or diminished.More:Tennessee is the first state to enact AI regulations in music; other artists want the sameTennessee and U.S. must beef up worker retraining programsAt this point, the AI genie is out and not going back into the bottle. New algorithms will help your radiologist better diagnose cancer, your insurance company process claims more efficiently, and your customer service hotline become more responsive.This will be wonderful news for corporate America’s profitability, but not for white-collar workers who will bear the brunt of the losses from a long, painful wave of productivity-oriented restructurings.Congress and the state of Tennessee should take care to act now, investing in job retraining initiatives that will cushion middle-class families from AI’s inevitable labor market fallout.  Recent efforts by the legislature to create an AI Advisory Council for guiding its usage within Tennessee state government are strong first steps in addressing the coming seismic shifts. However, far more action will be necessary in the private and public sectors to ensure Tennesseans are ready to compete as AI shifts from science fiction to reality.Jason Schmitt is the former chief executive officer of Old Time Pottery and serves on the Tennessee State Workforce Development Board.Donald Lacey is chief investment officer for West Fork, a venture investment firm, and serves on multiple boards of companies in AI, digital health, and fintech.Health Insight JournalDrain Edema Fluid: Do This if You Have Swollen Feet or AnklesHealth Insight Journal|AdAdLearn MoreUndoOnline Shopping ToolsFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyOnline Shopping Tools|AdAdUndoMartha Stewart &amp; Marley Spoon People in Chantilly are Loving Martha Stewart's Meal KitMartha Stewart & Marley Spoon |AdAdUndoCoupon Code FinderAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackCoupon Code Finder|AdAdUndoHomebuddy.comRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards...Here's What They DiscoveredHomebuddy.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoDog Food ExposedWorst Toxic Foods For Dogs: The One Meat You Should Never Feed Your DogDog Food Exposed|AdAdUndoHealth Insight JournalNew Neuropathy Device Leaves Experts Speechless (It's Genius!)Health Insight Journal|AdAdLearn MoreUndoParentzTalkWomen Were Forced To Do This In Viking CultureParentzTalk|AdAdRead MoreUndoCar Insurance DiscountVirginia Launches New Coverage for Cars Used Less Than 50 Miles/DayCar Insurance Discount|AdAdRead MoreUndoprimenutritionsecrets.comMD: Building Muscle After 60 Comes Down To This 1 Thingprimenutritionsecrets.com|AdAdUndoDeal of the DayREVIEWEDThese Minion Backpacks Are The Best Thing To Happen To The Back To School SeasonREVIEWEDView Deal Recommendations are independently chosen by our editors.

This influence extends both to the productivity within these fields—where output can multiply by as much as fivefold due to AI use—as well as the skill sets required by employees.In the IT sector, there is a growing demand for AI-related skills such as machine learning inference and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the need for conventional programming skills replaceable by AI is on the decline. However, other industries, including renewable energy, construction, and healthcare, seem immune to AI’s disruption, even experiencing a growth in labor demand due to other macro trends.The prevalence of AI-specialized job postings has witnessed a dramatic increase, boasting seven times more listings than in 2012. Financial services have seen the fastest growth in AI-relevant roles, followed by professional services and IT, which now has a fivefold larger proportion of AI-related jobs than other sectors.Further studies underscore the escalating significance of advanced cognitive abilities (such as analysis, critical thinking, and creativity) and emotional and behavioral skills (like adaptability, emotional intelligence, and social influence), alongside digital competences.Corporate leaders are convinced that AI will not only enhance productivity but will also necessitate a comprehensive shift in operational strategies, calling for employees to develop new competencies. Results from the PwC CEO Survey 2024 affirm that 84% of CEOs whose firms have begun adopting AI predict an upsurge in productivity, and 70% anticipate significant changes in company operations due to AI integration.The application and strategic incorporation of “GenAI” within Romanian companies might still be in its infancy, yet executives there agree with the global outlook that AI will transform business models, intensify market competition, and mandate novel abilities for most employees. This shift is foreseen to result in more efficient work time management, increased employee performance, and enhanced profitability.The AI revolution in the employment landscape raises several important questions and challenges:1. What types of jobs are at risk due to AI automation?Jobs that involve routine, predictable tasks are at a higher risk of automation by AI. These include roles in manufacturing, data entry, and certain aspects of customer service. As AI continues to develop, even complex tasks such as analysis and decision-making could be automated, affecting professional jobs in sectors like law and finance.2. How can workers prepare for the changes brought about by AI?Workers can prepare by pursuing continuous education and training, focusing on developing skills that AI is unlikely to replicate easily, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, and complex problem-solving. Additionally, gaining expertise in AI and related technologies themselves can create new career opportunities.Key challenges and controversies associated with AI in the employment landscape:– The ethical implications of replacing human jobs with AI, potentially leading to unemployment and income inequality.
– The need to update educational and training programs to prepare the workforce for an AI-centric economy.
– Concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the accountability of decisions made by AI systems.
– Addressing the digital divide that may widen if certain populations lack access to the new technology and skills necessary to compete in an AI-driven job market.Advantages of AI in the employment landscape include:– Increased productivity and efficiency across various industries.
– The creation of new job roles and industries centered around AI technology.
– Better decision-making capabilities in businesses through data analysis and predictive analytics.Disabilities of AI in the employment landscape include:– Potential job displacement, especially for low-skill and repetitive tasks.
– The need for substantial investment in retraining the existing workforce.
– Growing dependency on technology, which raises concerns about cybersecurity and operational vulnerabilities.For those looking for more information about AI and its impact on the employment landscape, here are some reputable sources:– PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) – for insights from the PwC 2024 Global AI Jobs Barometer and other related studies.
– World Economic Forum (WEF) – for broader discussions on the implications of AI on economies, work, and society.

Business leaders and hiring managers need to understand 7 ways that artificial intelligence is transforming the hiring process. 


Artificial Intelligence is poised to affect many important aspects of how things work in the corporate sector. The use of AI has been quite efficient for recruiters as with innovation, their hardest and most time-consuming work has been made much more straightforward. Let’s talk about 7 ways that artificial intelligence is transforming the hiring process.  


AI in Recruitment  


AI and related assistive tools have affected all areas for operation for business of every size. For instance, you can find smart tools like an online web builder to set up your business website for instance. Large companies have been able to hire suitable candidates for the job with the assistance of AI-based technologies that help through areas ranging from design to HR management 


Such technologies use machine learning and algorithms of logic to deliver results. Similarly, AI in recruitment simplifies the process by boosting the applicant’s experience and helping recruiters make educated decisions.  


A study suggests that each recruiter has to go through a long and tedious procedure to hire the right match and has to spend 15 hours per week just to find the right person for one position. Through AI tools, this process can be improved for everyone involved. 


7 Ways that AI is Transforming the Hiring Process  


Here are some ways that such technology and tools assist in hiring and are playing a huge role in transforming the process.  



Computerized resume screening 



AI-driven tools are quite beneficial as they are employed to examine and interpret resumes in a minimal amount of time as compared to when a human does the same job. These systems and software are well-made as they can easily inspect keywords in resumes and cover letters for the specifications required in the job descriptions, therefore, making the candidate selection process much simpler. Moreover, the time spent, and the mistakes made by human resume screening can be significantly minimized.  


Many different applicants can be addressed in a shorter time. Also, with advanced automated tools, the candidate’s online presence can be analyzed, making their history and background accessible. This information can also be helpful for the recruiters in the selection process. This way, hiring managers can get a more complete understanding of a prospective candidate.  



Use of chatbots for candidate interaction 



Chatbots are software programs with the ability to interact with suitable candidates. They are trained to take interviews, give information, and answer questions asked by the candidates through generative text.  


These chatbots are designed to act like human professionals as they do their jobs more fittingly. By providing customized interaction and friendly behavior, the hiring becomes more efficient and interesting, therefore, improving the candidate experience. Also, in case of any personal inquiries and questions from the candidates, the chatbots are made available 24/7, hence, making them feel more valued and appraised.  



Reducing biases in the hiring process 



When a company is in search of suitable candidates, they try their best to avoid any biases and favorable conditions. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence has once again proven to be beneficial as the recruitment is done without any human judgment and only directed towards the requirements as per the job description.  


Also, the innovation used removes away all the personal data of the candidates so they can be analyzed solely based on their skills and capabilities. The software installed will predict the likelihood of success a candidate will encounter, making the process easier and avoiding any potential unconscious bias.  



Assessing the candidates 



AI-driven recruitment uses tools to assess job applicants more vigorously to be more precise in the decision-making of selection. Various online quizzes and tests can be automated to evaluate the interviewee’s knowledge and accomplishments. Through this, all the major aspects involved in any department of industry are fully covered such as technical competence, problem-solving ability, and professional expertise.  


Furthermore, identifying the skills of the applicants can assist in pinpointing the topmost hidden talents, thus, reducing any mistakes in the hiring process. Being able to discover the right match becomes beneficial for the company in the long run as only people with the right qualifications and aptitude are more likely to excel in their work.  



Moral considerations 



With the rise in innovation, candidate selection also requires fairness and ethical considerations. As a result, technological advancements have been used in a manner to guarantee transparency and privacy of personal data in recruitment. Differing from humans, all the ethical rules and guidelines are strictly followed. In this digital world, frauds have become quite common nowadays. Therefore, with AI it is easy to identify fraudulent candidates as they have more accuracy levels such as they will be able to locate jobseekers who tend to apply only for fun and time passes.  



Keeping up with learning and development 



Computer systems will keep on changing with time due to shifts in efficiency in technology. With the change in periods, the AI algorithms will continue to improve the talent acquisition process by identifying trends, fashions, and areas for development. Therefore, the use of these technologies will then assist HR in redesigning their strategies and reshaping their procedure in talent acquisition. Also, by sticking with continuous learning, companies will stay flexible and competitive as they will attract candidates committed to growth, adaptation and professional development.  



Predictive data analysis  



The computerized systems used assess the skills and experience of candidates and then match their talents with their success in selective roles. This makes it more likely that a job candidate will be hired for a role they can excel in. 


The focus is on the data; therefore, the most qualified candidate is selected for a job role that suits them best. It becomes easier for employers to make more important decisions rather than focusing on HR they can give time to other relevant departments. Hence, the chances of a hiring mismatch are minimized, and the overall teamwork performance is boosted as a result.   


Post-Screening Process by AI 


All the arrangements for the talent acquisition process are done by AI technologies making it much more effortless and less timely for any organization. The detailed tasks involved in the selection process such as setting time for interviews, sending invites to the applicants, and managing any clash in the timings, are all done automatically. Final Thoughts  


Artificial intelligence successfully revolutionizes the hiring process by doing everything at its best. By understanding 7 ways that artificial intelligence is transforming the hiring process, companies will be able to stay ahead of the latest trends in recruitment and hire the right people for any job. However, no matter what technology can never take the place of human expertise and the human mind, and even with innovation, humans will always be required in the procedure for selecting.

Artificial Intelligence will eliminate all jobs, jobs will remain like a hobby: Elon Musk










Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, stated that artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually eliminate all jobs, but he believes this is not necessarily a bad development, reported CNN. Speaking at a startup and tech event in Paris on Thursday, Musk said, “Probably none of us will have a job,”.
Elon Musk was speaking remotely via webcam at the Viva Tech event where he predicted a future where jobs would be “optional.” He said, “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job.” Musk added, “But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.”
Musk highlighted that for this scenario to succeed, there would need to be a “universal high income,” which should not be confused with universal basic income, however, he did not elaborate much on this concept.
The Universal basic income (UBI) refers to the government providing a certain amount of money to everyone, regardless of their earnings.
“There would be no shortage of goods or services,” Musk stated. He highlighted that AI capabilities have advanced rapidly over the past few years, advancing so quickly that regulators, companies, and users are still figuring out how to utilize the technology responsibly.
In the past also Musk expressed his concerns about AI. During his keynote on Thursday, he described the technology as his biggest fear. He cited the “Culture Book Series” by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized depiction of a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and “the best envisioning of a future AI.”
Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled in a future without jobs. “The question will really be one of meaning – if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?” Musk said.
He added, “I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this – in that we may give AI meaning.” He also advised parents to control and limit the amount of social media their children consume, saying that social media platforms “are being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.”
Industry experts are continuously raising concerns over how various industries and jobs will be transformed as AI proliferates in the market.
CNN reports that in January, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found that workplaces are adopting AI more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also noted that many jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time.
Experts largely believe that many jobs requiring high emotional intelligence and human interaction, such as mental health professionals, creatives, and teachers, will not need replacing. (ANI)

The latest instalment of Pearson’s Skills Outlook series, 'Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work', looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 tasks with the most time saved by using the AI technology, in Australia, Brazil, India, United Kingdom, and United States. 

The company's GenAI powered workforce planning platform finds that GenAI can most effectively support tasks related to record maintenance, data collection, researching and compiling information for others, thus helping companies and workers focus on high-value work that requires human intervention.

""Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks,"" said Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth, Pearson Workforce Skills.
Pearson looked at the the hours currently spent, countrywide, on work tasks each week, and calculated the projection for three years as GenAI is increasingly adopted at the workplace. It also identified the tasks that would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology, specifically LLM chatbots and AI text-to-visual media generators.

The top tasks in India that would save the most hours by adopting GenAI by 2026 include promoting products, services, or programmes; collecting data on consumer needs and opinions; developing marketing or promotional materials; identifying business or organisational opportunities; and explaining technical details of products or services.

Latham also reiterated the need for training and support for employees for effective and responsible use of GenAI.

No, Collective Intelligence.The artist and musician Holly Herndon explores the promise — and complications — of collaborating with A.I.2024-05-24T05:04:38-04:00ezra kleinFrom New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”[MUSIC PLAYING]We are already awash in crappy A.I. content. Some of it is crappy commercial A.I. content that wants to sell you things. Some of it is crappy A.I. art. And it got me interested amidst all this complaining. What does it mean right now to be making good A.I. art? And so I read this profile of the A.I. artist and musician Holly Herndon in “The New Yorker,” and then separately, this DJ I met mentioned her work to me. So I should check this out.And so I went and listened to her 2019 album, “PROTO,” which was done alongside an A.I. voice trained on her voice and others. And I was walking to work when the song “Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt” came on.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]And I just stopped walking.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]What makes so much A.I. art so bad, in my opinion, is that it’s so generic. These are generative systems. We keep calling them generative. But generative is so — when we use that term, it usually means it helped you get somewhere new. But these systems are mimics. They help you go somewhere old. They can help us write or draw or compose like anyone else. But I find it much harder when using them to become more like yourself. And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it’s all riffing on others in this very obvious way.What I like about Herndon’s art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It’s going in the exact opposite direction. And some of her art questions the entire way these systems work. She and her partner, Mat Dryhurst, did this project at the Whitney Biennial this year, where they created an image generator based on images of Herndon, or at least what the A.I. system seemed to think she looked like, which is she’s got this very striking copper hair. And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut.And so they manipulated these images and they made this A.I. system where anybody can generate any image in the style of what A.I. systems think Holly Herndon is. So you can generate an image of a house, and it’ll have this long flowing copper hair. And it’ll tag itself as an image of Holly Herndon. And because it’s on the Whitney Biennial, these images have a certain authority in the way these A.I. scrapers work.And so as they are scraping the internet for images in the future, she is potentially poisoning their idea of what she is. She is taking control over the A.I.‘s idea of Holly Herndon. I find that fascinating, A.I. art that is acting as a kind of sabotage of A.I. systems and the lack of voice we have in how we appear in them. Along with a bunch of collaborators, Herndon has a lot of projects trying to blaze a trail and do not just good A.I. art, but fair economics and ethics. And so I wanted to have her on the show to talk about it. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING]Holly Herndon, welcome to the show.holly herndonThanks. It’s great to be here.ezra kleinSo something I find fascinating about you is that you grew up singing in church choirs. Then you moved to Berlin after college and got deep into Berlin techno. And I think those are respectively the most human and the most inhuman forms of music that human beings make. So how did they shape you?holly herndonYeah, that’s a really good question. I mean, I feel like I’m such a product of the environments that I’ve spent a lot of time in, so I’m really interested in folk singing traditions coming from East Tennessee. Of course, growing up in a town next to where Dolly Parton is from, she always loomed large. Then I spent a lot of time in Berlin. And so of course, electronic music and techno has played a really big part of my story. And then also moving to the Bay Area, where I got really deeply interested in technology.I feel like even though techno might sound and does kind of have a synthetic palette and does sound maybe inhuman, I feel like the rituals that happen around the music are very human and very sweaty and very embodied. So I think if you experience that culture in person, it feels less inhuman.ezra kleinBut why does that magic happen? So I was in Berlin, and I was down in the sort of big room in the bunker, I would call it, as sort of the way it felt to me. And I would say the music felt like being inside of a machine gun but in a good way. And meanwhile, as you say, what’s happening around it — I mean, it was actually the most inhuman music I’ve ever heard. And I like electronic music. But what’s happening around it is so human. I mean, all these people engaged in this most physical, sweaty, smelly ritual of dancing together. How do you understand both the meaning and the function of it? Why does music like that create that kind of transcendence?holly herndonI mean, this might sound strange, but music is a kind of coordination technology. So 4/4 techno beat is maybe the most clear communication of that. It’s so easy to participate in. It’s fairly easy to make. It’s also fairly easy to dance to and understand. So I feel like as a kind of — if I want to call it a kind of protocol, it’s an easy way to communicate what to do in that scenario. So I think that that’s why people have organized around it so much.ezra kleinWhen I go out and listen to the further reaches of techno, in Berlin, in New York, where I live, I’ll often find myself at some point in the night thinking every piece of sound in this music is a choice. And when that choice sounds very artificial, right, when it sounds like something so removed from somebody playing strings or somebody singing, I think this person wanted to communicate in this extraordinarily machine-like way.And this has been happening for a long time, I mean, talk boxes and synthesizers and all of these technologies. And I’m curious, as somebody who’s made some of that music or is deeply, at least within the culture that has made it, what is appealing about that? I mean, you said it creates this very sweaty human ritual. But first, there is this transition of the person into something that does not sound like people. It sounds like music that robots might make. It sounds like music from a faraway culture.holly herndonMaybe there’s something about living in in such a technologically mediated world that makes us want to find how we fit into that as humans. And music is such a kind of innate part of being a human. I mean, as a performer of the laptop, I was always trying to find a way to make the laptop feel really embodied, because at the time, when I started performing a lot, there was this criticism that, oh, you could be checking your email, or this doesn’t really feel like a lively performance. So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FADE”]And the thing that I found really liberating about using my voice in that way is that I could kind do anything to digitally manipulate my voice to make it be so much more than it is physically. But what I really enjoyed was using my voice as a kind of controller or data stream, and then it could do things that I couldn’t imagine once I put it in the laptop and was able to process it in specific ways.So there’s something about trying to come to terms with the systems around us by working through them and working with them. Collaborating maybe helps us kind understand where we sit in that feedback loop.ezra kleinSo in a minute, I want to play a clip of a piece of music you made. But first, I want to talk about how you made it. So tell me about Spawn.holly herndonSpawn, who was our A.I. baby experiment. “PROTO” was released in 2019, and Spawn came about two years before that. So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier.But eventually, things got better. We started playing with a project called SampleRNN and some other software. And you’ll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it’s like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That’s what the audio sounded like back in the day.And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn.ezra kleinWell, why don’t we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song “Swim.” And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album.[VOCALIZATION]So that’s really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own.[MUSIC PLAYING]What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there?holly herndonSo Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn’t deal with polyphony, which means one — more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can’t remember. It’s been so long.But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that’s where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another. So that’s what we did. We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us.ezra kleinAnd I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people’s voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here?holly herndonI think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn’t sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time, it’s I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research.But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I’m really glad that I made that decision, because it’s informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model’s output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don’t know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models. And that’s really informed all of the work that I’ve done since then. So I think sometimes you just have to deal with the technology in order to make informed work around that technology.ezra kleinWe’re going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it’s really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, “Swim,” so people can hear where this ended up.[HOLLY HERNDON, “SWIM”]And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using — I don’t know if you’d call this an updated Spawn, but we’re calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton’s Jolene.[HOLLY HERNDON, “JOLENE”]So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who — what is singing?holly herndonSo that is a voice model trained on my voice. I worked with some researchers in Barcelona in a studio called Voctro Labs at the time. And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it’s leaps and bounds better, more high — higher fidelity than little Spawn.So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There’s a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment.ezra kleinThat’s a use case that I’m fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person. You can imagine somebody training a model on all of my podcasts. And then the model generates questions they could ask somebody, or a model generated all of my columns and you can spit out a an Op-Ed.What is your relationship with that? And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can’t take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world?holly herndonI think I’m probably an outlier in my relationship here because my practice involved so much vocal processing. So if you listen to movement —[HOLLY HERNDON, “MOVEMENT”]— or a platform —[HOLLY HERNDON, “CHORUS”]The albums before “PROTO” before I started working with machine learning, I was already taking my voice and kind of mangling it beyond recognition, turning it into a machine itself. So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don’t expect everyone to have that relationship. I don’t really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It’s something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn’t normally be able to.You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform. I could never sing that. She can do all of these amazing melismatic diva runs that I could never dream of, but my voice model could do it. And that was really fun. And it didn’t confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn’t do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it’s maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self.ezra kleinSo what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically?holly herndonWell, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region. And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it’s a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn’t afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It’s almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself.ezra kleinOh, that’s really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn’t otherwise try.holly herndonYeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn’t have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on “PROTO,” which is why I didn’t release it as an album, you know. It’s just not as interesting, somehow.ezra kleinI guess the other thing, there’s a question of meaning here that I’ve been circling in my own time playing around with A.I. I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you’re trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now.And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky.When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I’m having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well. Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it’s not a human being.But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it’s Holly+, like, it’s a cool project, but I’m not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can’t not show up to talk to me, that that’s a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it.And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow?holly herndonIt’s really funny. We did a live performance from “PROTO,” I guess in 2019, in New York. And we had the ensemble on the stage. And afterwards someone came up to me and they said, “I really enjoyed the show, but I don’t understand what it has to do with A.I.”And actually that was the biggest compliment that I could receive, because I wasn’t trying to project this kind of super future, you know, A.I., high-tech story.I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That’s something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable. But it can also free us up to just be more human together, to really just focus on the parts that we really want to focus on, which is just enjoying that moment of singing on stage together.I’m also not so interested in necessarily having an A.I. therapist. That’s not what I find interesting or compelling about the space. I’m interested in exploring some of the weirdnesses in how we as a society define different things. That’s the kind of stuff that I’m interested in, not having a kind of like A.I. chat pet.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinI’ve heard you say that with A.I., it’s the model that’s the art, not necessarily the output of the model.holly herndonYeah, that’s one thing that we’re exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you’re not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that’s my own singing voice or whether that’s my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world.So it’s almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we’re often using is “protocol art,” basically understanding that any work that’s made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we’re trying to lean into that.So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called “Ready Weight,” we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space. Or, you know, when we made the model of my voice with Holly+, we made that publicly available so anyone could make work for that. So that’s the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work.And in a way, art’s kind of always a little bit like that. It’s a conversation between the work that you’re making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world.ezra kleinYou wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. “Collective intelligence” is more useful. Why?holly herndonBecause I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It’s trained on all of us. Specifically, when you look at music, it’s trained on human bodies performing very special tasks. And I think it does humans a great disservice to try to remove that from the equation.I think that’s why I like to draw a parallel, also, to choral music, because I see it as a kind of coordination technology in the same kind of lineage as group singing. I think it’s a part of our evolutionary story and I think it’s a great human accomplishment that should be celebrated as such.ezra kleinI want to explore what changes when you emphasize the collectivity of these models, the fact that they are in some ways an aggregate of all of us versus the artificiality of them, right? Artificial intelligence, which really emphasizes no, there’s something that somebody has written into software over here. They’re unearthly. They’re a new kind of thing. And one thing is actually, I think, economic, that there’s this whole question about who gets compensated and who’s going to make the money off of this and what all this training data is going to end up doing economically.And it does seem very different to me if you understand these as on some level, a societal output, something that’s built on a kind of commons as opposed to a tremendous leap and feat of technology that is the sort of individual result of software geniuses working in garages and office parks somewhere.holly herndonYeah, I mean, that basically summarizes the work that I’ve been doing for the last several years. It’s kind of like shouting that from the rooftops. Because I think if you see it through that lens, then it becomes something really beautiful and something to be celebrated and also something that’s not entirely new. You know, we’ve been embarking on collective projects, the entirety of our humanity to make things that are bigger than ourselves. And so if we can find a way to make that work in the real world with the kind of future of the economy, then yeah, I think it behooves us to figure that out.ezra kleinThe not entirely new part feels important to me. The degree to which this is all a continuum feels often underplayed in conversations about A.I., about the future of work, about humans and machines. But there’s also a way in which you see the A.I. companies using this argument to say that they should be given much more free rein and much more full profits over the products of these models, because they say, look. We’re not doing anything different than any other artist or anyone ever has.Scientists today work off of the collective body of knowledge of science before them. You know, Holly Herndon is influenced by folk music and choral music and German techno, and everybody is always absorbing what has come before them and mixing it into something new. That’s all we’re doing. We’re not doing something new. We’re not making a copyright infringement.So how do you understand the effort to use the collectivity, right? The fact that human beings have always been in collective projects, but we do give people a lot of individual ownership and authorship over their works from what might be different here in the scale and the nature of what these models are doing.holly herndonSo, OK, I think that there’s a middle ground that can work for everyone, that can allow people to experiment and have fun with this technology while also compensating people. So spawning is a neologism that I like to use to kind of describe what’s happening here. And it’s a 21st century corollary to sampling, but it’s really distinctly different. And that difference, I think, is really important. It’s different in what it can do and also how it came about.So what it can do, we’ve kind of gone into that already. You know, you train a model, the kind of logic of one thing to be able to perform new things through that logic. So it’s distinctly different from sampling, which is really like a one-to-one reproduction of a sound created by someone else that can then be processed and treated to make something new. But with spawning, you can actually perform as someone else based on information trained about them. So that’s distinctly different.But also the way that it comes about, with sampling, it’s this one-to-one reproduction. With spawning, it’s a little bit more of a gray area in terms of intellectual property because you’re not actually making a copy. The machine is ingesting that media, if you want to call it looking at, reading, listening to, learning from. So I kind of land in that — I like to call it the “sexy middle ground” between people who are all for open use for everything and people who want to have really strict I.P. lockdown.And so that’s one of the reasons why spawning, then, kind of mutated even further into an organization, which is something that I co-founded with three other people, Mat Dryhurst, Patrick Hoepner and Jordan Meyer, to try to figure out this messy question of essentially data manners. How do we handle data manners around A.I. training? Because what’s happening right now isn’t working for everyone.ezra kleinAre there experiments that you find exciting or that you’ve conducted that you found the results of them promising?holly herndonYeah. I mean, I think Holly+ was a really fun experiment because people then actually used my voice and we were able to, you know, sell some works through that and generate a small profit, but enough to be able to continue to build the tools for the community. So that was a fun experiment that I think really worked. And there’s one experiment that I’m running right now that I’m really excited about. My partner, Mat Dryhurst and I had an exhibition at the Serpentine London in October, and as part of that, we are recording choirs across the U.K. I think there’s 16 in total, and they’re joining a data trust. And we’ve hired a data trustee to pilot this idea of governance where we’re trying to work out some of the messy issues around how a data trust might work. And then we’ll negotiate with that data trust directly as to how we can use their data in the exhibition and moving forward.I think it’s a really fun experiment, and it’s also because it’s singing and it’s choral music, it’s not really sensitive health data. We can really experiment and try out different ways to make this work in a way that’s not dealing with such sensitive information. So I’m really excited to see how people engage with that and how much do people really want to deal with the kind of day-to-day governance of their data. That’s also a big question.ezra kleinSo you were saying earlier that often the models are the art, but in this case, the governance is the art.holly herndonYou know, in this case, I think the model and the governance and the protocol around it are all the art.ezra kleinThis idea of control is interesting, though. I mean, so it came out a while ago that Facebook and Meta had been training its A.I. on a huge cache of pirated books. And I think my book was in there. My wife’s book was in there. Like, the books of virtually everybody I know were in there. And so, a bunch of authors sued. And I also felt some part of me, like, I wanted to be paid for my inclusion. But I didn’t want to not be included in all of these. And it reminds me a bit of social media where at a certain point, whether or not you wanted to be on social media or not, it was sort of important that you had something representing you there, right?It could be not your real photo, right? You could have some control over it, but if you didn’t do it, then you had absolutely no control over what you appeared as online. And it probably wasn’t plausible. You could appear as nothing online. So maybe something you didn’t want would be your top Google search result.And here it’s going to get even weirder because there isn’t really — you can’t have your home page in the artificial intelligence model. All you are is training data. And so there’s something very strange about this. You know, if before all you were was kind of a profile, which was a very flattened version of you, now your training data — which is a very warped version of you. And this question of how do you have any control over that data, like if you want to participate but you want some definition over how you participate, there’s no real obvious avenue towards that.holly herndonThere’s none at the moment, but I think that that’s coming. I think people will opt in under terms that they feel comfortable with to be able to shape the way that they appear in this new space. I don’t think it’s tenable that people have no agency over how they appear in the future of the internet.ezra kleinThat feels idealistic to me. I mean, I feel like we’ve been we’ve been going through an internet for a long time where I would have said this level of data theft or use is not tenable. This level of surveillance is untenable. This level of flattening, the way we get each other to treat each other in social media, it doesn’t feel like this is going to hold.Like, I am amazed that people are still on X. As hostile as that platform has become to many of them, it’s just so impossible to imagine leaving something happening that they will accept something they really feel angry about. They really feel like the way it is run is hostile to them, that it is degraded. But, you know, what are you going to do? I’m amazed at how powerful the “what are you going to do” impulse is in life.holly herndonWell, I mean, I totally get that. But what we decided to do was to try to build a universal opt out standard. And it’s actually gaining traction. And there’s precedent in the E.U. A.I. Act. Ideally, it would be something that would be from the beginning, all training data would have been at. You know, people would have been asked permission from the offset, but that’s not how things played out. So now we’re in a position where we’re building tools where people can really easily opt out the data that they don’t want to have included in these models.We have an A.P.I. where you can install that on your website and easily have everything on your website not be included in crawling. So I do think that there are things that we can do. It requires a little bit of legislation. It requires a little bit of diplomacy. But I don’t think that we should just throw up our hands and say, OK, it’s over. They should just have everything.You know, if we do have a situation where we’re able to get the opt out as a kind of standard, then I think you can start to build an economy around an opt in. Something that I’m really proud of, we just announced Source.Plus. So I’m not trying to shill here, but I think this is a really important part of this conversation where we put together a data set of all public domain data, and it’s huge. And people should be training their base models there. And then you can allow people to opt in to fine tune their models and create an economy around that.If you have a public domain base layer model, then you can actually create an economy around that. But I don’t think we should give up.ezra kleinI definitely agree. I don’t think we should give up. For a lot of people, they need to make a living out of the work they’re doing.holly herndonYes.ezra kleinOne thing that I find inspiring about the idea of thinking of it as a collective intelligence is it maybe points the way towards the idea that there’s modes of collective ownership, or modes of collective compensation. And at least in the space of art, when you’re thinking about this idea that you might have your voice out there for anybody to use, I think for a lot of people, that’s scary, right?I mean, we’re very used to business models that are about nobody can use this thing of mine unless they pay me, right? We have patents, we have copyrights. What does that spark for you? What if we — what are the ways to do this in a more collective open source way that you think might work to make it possible for people to live, but also to create? Well,holly herndonI think first and foremost, it should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I mean, you know, we’re talking about art. And that encompasses so many different practices that function economically in so many different ways. That’s something that was really devastating, I think, when it came to streaming. Streaming was really revolutionary and wonderful for a lot of people, but it was really devastating for a lot of other people because everything had to have the same economic logic as pop music.And a lot of experimental music doesn’t follow that per play valuation logic. A lot of experimental music is about the idea, and you just need access to that idea once. You don’t need to listen to it on repeat. And so if the access to that idea costs a fraction of a cent, that’s going to be really difficult to pay for. It’s almost more you almost need more like a movie model where you pay a little bit more to gain access to that idea.I think what’s really needed is that people have the ability to create whatever subcultures and whatever kind of economic models work for their subcultures and aren’t squeezed into a kind of sausage factory where everything has to follow the same logic.ezra kleinSo I know you and your partner are working on this book for this forthcoming exhibition that has, I think, the most triggering possible title to two people in my industry, “All Media is Training Data.” What’s the argument there?holly herndonYeah, so this is a book that’s a series of commissioned essays and interviews between me and Mat about our approach to A.I. and data over the past 10 years. I do realize that this is kind of triggering for a lot of people, but I think it’s something that’s worth kind of recognizing. You know, as soon as something becomes captured in media, as soon as something becomes machine legible, it has the potential to be part of a training canon.And I think that we need to think about what we’re creating moving forward with that new reality. You know, a lot of the work that we’re doing around the exhibition is we’re creating training data deliberately. So we’re treating training data as artworks themselves. I’m writing a song book that a collective of choirs across the UK will all be singing from, and those songs were written specifically to train an A.I. So all of the songs cover all of the phonemes of the English language so you can really — the A.I. can get the full scope of the sound, of each vocalist.So we’re kind of playing with this idea of making deliberate training data, kind of — we like to call them mind children that we’re sending to the future.ezra kleinI want to talk about what’s triggering in it for a minute. Because I think when people hear that, they might think media in the sense of the news. And I’m actually least worried about the news, because the news is where we’re covering new things that happened that are not in the training data.But media, if you think about it broadly, right, visual media and music and all the other things human beings create, I think when people hear all media’s training data, what they hear is — everything we do will be replaceable, right? That the A.I. is going to learn how to do it and it’s going to be able to spit it back at us and then it doesn’t need us anymore.When we become the training data, we’re sort of training our replacement, right? Like, the sort of very grim stories that will come out of factories before they outsource somewhere, where people are training. You know, the people are going to replace them at a lower cost. Is that how you see it? If you’re training data, does that mean you’re replaceable?holly herndonArt is a very complex cultural web. It’s a conversation. It’s something that’s performed. It’s a dialogue. It’s situated in time and place. We wouldn’t confuse a poster of the Mona Lisa for the Mona Lisa. Those are two different things. So I’m not worried about artists being replaced or about, you know, infinite media, meaning that artists have no role in meaning-making anymore. I think that the meaning-making becomes all the more important.I do think we have to contend with a future where we do have infinite media, where the single image is perhaps no longer carrying the same weight as it did before. So yeah, there are some things to contend with, but I think that we won’t be replaced and I think it’ll be weird and wonderful.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinThere are a bunch of programs that are coming out now that use A.I. to generate this sort of endless amount of pretty banal music for a purpose. So I have this one I downloaded called “Endel,” and it’s like, do you want music for focus? Do you want it to sleep? Do you want it to — And it’s fine. If I heard it on one of those playlists on Spotify, I wouldn’t think much of it.[endel, ""wind downEVENING ENERGY RISE”]And I think it points towards this world where I think the view is, we’re going to know what we want. And what we’re going to want is a generic version of it. And we’re going to be able to get it in kind of vast quantities forever. But you’re an artist and you said something in an interview I saw you give about how reality always ends up weirder. It always mutates against what people are expecting of it.And so I wonder how much you suspect or see the possibility of the sameness that A.I. makes possible, the kind of endless amount of generic content, leading to some kind of backlash where people actually get weirder in response, both weirder with these projects, but also more interested in things created by humans in the same way that a lot of artisanal food movements got launched by the rise of fast food.I mean, how much do you think about backlash and the desire for differentiation as something that will shape cultures and software here?holly herndonWell, there’s a lot in there. I mean, the backlash has been huge. I think that A.I. has certainly joined the ranks of culture wars and especially on Twitter. So I think the backlash is already there. But I think we’re also in really early days. So some of the examples that you gave, I feel like they’re kind of trying to please everyone. And as we move into a situation where your specific taste profile is being catered to more, I think it will feel less mid and feel more bespoke.One direction where some of this can go, I think a lot of people are really focused on prompting at the moment because that’s how we’re interfacing with a lot of models. But in the future, it might look more like, you know, maybe you have a kind of taste profile where the model understands your tastes and your preferences and the things that you are drawn to and just kind of automatically generates whatever media that would kind of like please you.So the kind of production to consumption pipeline is kind of collapsed in that moment. One of the things that I always appreciated as a young person growing up was hearing things that I didn’t like and didn’t understand, and that was something I always found really difficult with algorithmic recommendation systems, is I just kept getting fed what it already knew that I liked.But, you know, when I was just being exposed to new music as a young person, I really needed to hear things that I didn’t like to expand my palate and understanding of what’s possible in music. And so that’s one thing that I think you could just kind of have a stagnation of taste if people are constantly being catered to. So I think people will crave something different or will crave to be challenged. Some people won’t, but some people will.ezra kleinOne of the things that occurred to me while I was looking through a lot of your work was that what I enjoyed about it was that you were using the relationship with the generative system to make yourself and make the work stranger. And that felt refreshing to me because my experience using ChatGPT or Claude or anything, really, so often is that it makes me more generic.And that there’s this way in which A.I. feels like it is this great flattening. It’ll give you a kind of lowest common denominator of almost anything that human beings have done before, and that the danger of that feels to me like it’s a push toward sameness whereas a lot of your art feels to me like a push towards weirdness and a kind of sense that you can interact with different versions of these systems in a less sanded-down way and find something that neither a human or a machine could create alone. Is that a reasonable read of what you’re doing? Is there something there?holly herndonYeah, I think that’s largely because I use my own training data. I create training data specifically for this purpose of training models rather than using something that’s just laid out for me. I think you get a lot of mid or averaging from these really large public models, because that’s basically the purpose.You know, it’s supposed to kind be a catchall, but I’m not interested in the catchall. I’m interested in, you know, this weird kind of vocal expression or I’m interested in this other weird thing. And so that’s what I really want to create training data around and really focus on for whatever my model is. So I think people should just get into training their own models.ezra kleinI want to end by going back to a song from “PROTO.” And it’s one of the stranger songs on the album. And I thought maybe we could just talk about what it’s doing and people could hear it. So why we play a clip of “Godmother“?[RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING]What’s happening there?holly herndonOK, so, yeah, when I delivered that single to 480, I was like, here’s a single for the next album. They were like, um, OK, what do we do with this? So this is, I guess, a really early voice model trained on my voice. So if you compare that to the Jolene song, that’s basically how far we’ve come in the last five years, which I think is just remarkable. It’s — the speed is incredible.So I trained Spawn on my voice, my singing voice, and then I fed Spawn stems from a collaborator of mine named Jlin. And so Spawn is attempting to sing Jlin’s stems through my voice. And Jlin’s music is very percussive. It’s mostly percussion sounds, so it ends up being this kind of almost like a weird beatboxing kind of thing because it’s trying to make sense of these sounds through my voice.ezra kleinWell, here, why don’t we play a clip of the Jlin? This is one of my favorite songs from her. It’s called “The Precision of Infinity.”[JLIN & PHILIP GLASS, “THE PRECISION OF INFINITY”] And so, yeah, it’s not that it’s a machine, it’s just something that a human being cannot do quite on their own. I mean, there’s like a Philip Glass sample in there. It’s beautiful. But I don’t know. It’s funny when you say that that Spawn feels so old because something I like about it is it feels very — compared to a lot of what’s coming out now, its strangeness feels much more modern. It feels truer to how A.I. feels to me than the much more polished things we’re currently hearing or seeing, which it’s like this thing has exploded in all of its weirdness. And all this effort is being made to make it seem normal.And I think the reason “PROTO” sounded very current to me when I heard it for the first time this year is it in sounding abnormal, it feels more actually of this moment, which feels very strange even as everybody keeps trying to make it seem not that strange.holly herndonWell, thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like at the time I was — this A.I. conversation has been going for so long. The hype was kind of already started back then. And I feel like so many things that were being marketed as A.I., it was kind of misleading what the A.I. was doing or how sophisticated things were. So at the time, a lot of people were creating A.I. scores and then having either humans perform them or having really slick digital instruments perform them.And so it was giving this impression that everything was really slick and polished and finished, and that’s why we decided to focus on audio as a material, specifically because you could hear how kind of scratchy and weird and unpolished things were at that time. And that’s — I wanted to meet the technology where it was, and that required a whole mixing process with Marta Salogni, who’s an amazing mixing engineer in London, to try to get the human bodies and the slick studio to occupy the same space as the kind of crunchy lo-fi Spawn sounds.But it was really important to me that I wasn’t trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors of like, this is some glossy future thing that it that it wasn’t, because I actually found the weirdness in there so much more beautiful.ezra kleinAs somebody who has now been for years playing around with models and working in these more sort of decentralized possibilities, I think it’s easy if you’re outside this and don’t have any particular A.I. software engineering expertise, as I don’t — as I think most of my listeners don’t — and you see, well, there’s models by OpenA.I., by Google, by Facebook — it feels like that no human being can do this, right? Companies getting billions of dollars.How are you able to participate in this world of models? How much expertise do you need? How do you figure out what are the interesting projects, right? If somebody wants to understand this kind of world of homebrew A.I., so to speak, how did you start, and where do they start?holly herndonThat’s a really good question. I mean, I think the landscape has changed so much since I started. I would say, you know, first thing, you can interact with publicly available models. And once you kind understand how those are working, then I would just do the really boring work of reading the academic research papers that are tedious. Take your time, drink a coffee, watch the YouTube video where they presented at a conference and maybe some people asked questions and that that helps to flesh it out.This was our process. It’s been really, really kind of messy. And yeah, we didn’t have a lot of hand-holding, but I think if you’re really interested in learning more, the information is out there. You just kind of have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think that’s a nice place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience? OK, so Reza Negarestani wrote a book called “Intelligence and Spirit.” It’s a pretty dense philosophical book about intelligence and spirituality that I think is really great. On a lighter side, “Children of Time” by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a really enjoyable A.I. science fiction about intelligent, genetically-modified spiders.ezra kleinOne of my favorite books.holly herndonYeah, it’s so good. So you kind see the kind of society and technology that a super intelligent spider society would build, which I love. And then there’s a book called “Plurality” that was led by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang and a wide community of contributors. I also contributed a small part to this book. It’s about the future of collaborative technology and democracy, and it was actually written in an open, collaborative, Democratic way, which I think is really interesting. So check it out.ezra kleinHolly Herndon, thank you very much.holly herndonThanks so much.

No, Collective Intelligence.The artist and musician Holly Herndon explores the promise — and complications — of collaborating with A.I.2024-05-24T05:04:38-04:00ezra kleinFrom New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”[MUSIC PLAYING]We are already awash in crappy A.I. content. Some of it is crappy commercial A.I. content that wants to sell you things. Some of it is crappy A.I. art. And it got me interested amidst all this complaining. What does it mean right now to be making good A.I. art? And so I read this profile of the A.I. artist and musician Holly Herndon in “The New Yorker,” and then separately, this DJ I met mentioned her work to me. So I should check this out.And so I went and listened to her 2019 album, “PROTO,” which was done alongside an A.I. voice trained on her voice and others. And I was walking to work when the song “Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt” came on.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]And I just stopped walking.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT”]What makes so much A.I. art so bad, in my opinion, is that it’s so generic. These are generative systems. We keep calling them generative. But generative is so — when we use that term, it usually means it helped you get somewhere new. But these systems are mimics. They help you go somewhere old. They can help us write or draw or compose like anyone else. But I find it much harder when using them to become more like yourself. And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it’s all riffing on others in this very obvious way.What I like about Herndon’s art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It’s going in the exact opposite direction. And some of her art questions the entire way these systems work. She and her partner, Mat Dryhurst, did this project at the Whitney Biennial this year, where they created an image generator based on images of Herndon, or at least what the A.I. system seemed to think she looked like, which is she’s got this very striking copper hair. And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut.And so they manipulated these images and they made this A.I. system where anybody can generate any image in the style of what A.I. systems think Holly Herndon is. So you can generate an image of a house, and it’ll have this long flowing copper hair. And it’ll tag itself as an image of Holly Herndon. And because it’s on the Whitney Biennial, these images have a certain authority in the way these A.I. scrapers work.And so as they are scraping the internet for images in the future, she is potentially poisoning their idea of what she is. She is taking control over the A.I.‘s idea of Holly Herndon. I find that fascinating, A.I. art that is acting as a kind of sabotage of A.I. systems and the lack of voice we have in how we appear in them. Along with a bunch of collaborators, Herndon has a lot of projects trying to blaze a trail and do not just good A.I. art, but fair economics and ethics. And so I wanted to have her on the show to talk about it. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING]Holly Herndon, welcome to the show.holly herndonThanks. It’s great to be here.ezra kleinSo something I find fascinating about you is that you grew up singing in church choirs. Then you moved to Berlin after college and got deep into Berlin techno. And I think those are respectively the most human and the most inhuman forms of music that human beings make. So how did they shape you?holly herndonYeah, that’s a really good question. I mean, I feel like I’m such a product of the environments that I’ve spent a lot of time in, so I’m really interested in folk singing traditions coming from East Tennessee. Of course, growing up in a town next to where Dolly Parton is from, she always loomed large. Then I spent a lot of time in Berlin. And so of course, electronic music and techno has played a really big part of my story. And then also moving to the Bay Area, where I got really deeply interested in technology.I feel like even though techno might sound and does kind of have a synthetic palette and does sound maybe inhuman, I feel like the rituals that happen around the music are very human and very sweaty and very embodied. So I think if you experience that culture in person, it feels less inhuman.ezra kleinBut why does that magic happen? So I was in Berlin, and I was down in the sort of big room in the bunker, I would call it, as sort of the way it felt to me. And I would say the music felt like being inside of a machine gun but in a good way. And meanwhile, as you say, what’s happening around it — I mean, it was actually the most inhuman music I’ve ever heard. And I like electronic music. But what’s happening around it is so human. I mean, all these people engaged in this most physical, sweaty, smelly ritual of dancing together. How do you understand both the meaning and the function of it? Why does music like that create that kind of transcendence?holly herndonI mean, this might sound strange, but music is a kind of coordination technology. So 4/4 techno beat is maybe the most clear communication of that. It’s so easy to participate in. It’s fairly easy to make. It’s also fairly easy to dance to and understand. So I feel like as a kind of — if I want to call it a kind of protocol, it’s an easy way to communicate what to do in that scenario. So I think that that’s why people have organized around it so much.ezra kleinWhen I go out and listen to the further reaches of techno, in Berlin, in New York, where I live, I’ll often find myself at some point in the night thinking every piece of sound in this music is a choice. And when that choice sounds very artificial, right, when it sounds like something so removed from somebody playing strings or somebody singing, I think this person wanted to communicate in this extraordinarily machine-like way.And this has been happening for a long time, I mean, talk boxes and synthesizers and all of these technologies. And I’m curious, as somebody who’s made some of that music or is deeply, at least within the culture that has made it, what is appealing about that? I mean, you said it creates this very sweaty human ritual. But first, there is this transition of the person into something that does not sound like people. It sounds like music that robots might make. It sounds like music from a faraway culture.holly herndonMaybe there’s something about living in in such a technologically mediated world that makes us want to find how we fit into that as humans. And music is such a kind of innate part of being a human. I mean, as a performer of the laptop, I was always trying to find a way to make the laptop feel really embodied, because at the time, when I started performing a lot, there was this criticism that, oh, you could be checking your email, or this doesn’t really feel like a lively performance. So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream.[HOLLY HERNDON, “FADE”]And the thing that I found really liberating about using my voice in that way is that I could kind do anything to digitally manipulate my voice to make it be so much more than it is physically. But what I really enjoyed was using my voice as a kind of controller or data stream, and then it could do things that I couldn’t imagine once I put it in the laptop and was able to process it in specific ways.So there’s something about trying to come to terms with the systems around us by working through them and working with them. Collaborating maybe helps us kind understand where we sit in that feedback loop.ezra kleinSo in a minute, I want to play a clip of a piece of music you made. But first, I want to talk about how you made it. So tell me about Spawn.holly herndonSpawn, who was our A.I. baby experiment. “PROTO” was released in 2019, and Spawn came about two years before that. So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier.But eventually, things got better. We started playing with a project called SampleRNN and some other software. And you’ll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it’s like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That’s what the audio sounded like back in the day.And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn.ezra kleinWell, why don’t we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song “Swim.” And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album.[VOCALIZATION]So that’s really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own.[MUSIC PLAYING]What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there?holly herndonSo Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn’t deal with polyphony, which means one — more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can’t remember. It’s been so long.But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that’s where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another. So that’s what we did. We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us.ezra kleinAnd I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people’s voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here?holly herndonI think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn’t sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time, it’s I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research.But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I’m really glad that I made that decision, because it’s informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model’s output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don’t know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models. And that’s really informed all of the work that I’ve done since then. So I think sometimes you just have to deal with the technology in order to make informed work around that technology.ezra kleinWe’re going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it’s really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, “Swim,” so people can hear where this ended up.[HOLLY HERNDON, “SWIM”]And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using — I don’t know if you’d call this an updated Spawn, but we’re calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton’s Jolene.[HOLLY HERNDON, “JOLENE”]So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who — what is singing?holly herndonSo that is a voice model trained on my voice. I worked with some researchers in Barcelona in a studio called Voctro Labs at the time. And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it’s leaps and bounds better, more high — higher fidelity than little Spawn.So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There’s a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment.ezra kleinThat’s a use case that I’m fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person. You can imagine somebody training a model on all of my podcasts. And then the model generates questions they could ask somebody, or a model generated all of my columns and you can spit out a an Op-Ed.What is your relationship with that? And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can’t take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world?holly herndonI think I’m probably an outlier in my relationship here because my practice involved so much vocal processing. So if you listen to movement —[HOLLY HERNDON, “MOVEMENT”]— or a platform —[HOLLY HERNDON, “CHORUS”]The albums before “PROTO” before I started working with machine learning, I was already taking my voice and kind of mangling it beyond recognition, turning it into a machine itself. So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don’t expect everyone to have that relationship. I don’t really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It’s something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn’t normally be able to.You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform. I could never sing that. She can do all of these amazing melismatic diva runs that I could never dream of, but my voice model could do it. And that was really fun. And it didn’t confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn’t do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it’s maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self.ezra kleinSo what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically?holly herndonWell, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region. And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it’s a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn’t afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It’s almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself.ezra kleinOh, that’s really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn’t otherwise try.holly herndonYeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn’t have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on “PROTO,” which is why I didn’t release it as an album, you know. It’s just not as interesting, somehow.ezra kleinI guess the other thing, there’s a question of meaning here that I’ve been circling in my own time playing around with A.I. I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you’re trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now.And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky.When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I’m having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well. Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it’s not a human being.But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it’s Holly+, like, it’s a cool project, but I’m not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can’t not show up to talk to me, that that’s a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it.And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow?holly herndonIt’s really funny. We did a live performance from “PROTO,” I guess in 2019, in New York. And we had the ensemble on the stage. And afterwards someone came up to me and they said, “I really enjoyed the show, but I don’t understand what it has to do with A.I.”And actually that was the biggest compliment that I could receive, because I wasn’t trying to project this kind of super future, you know, A.I., high-tech story.I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That’s something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable. But it can also free us up to just be more human together, to really just focus on the parts that we really want to focus on, which is just enjoying that moment of singing on stage together.I’m also not so interested in necessarily having an A.I. therapist. That’s not what I find interesting or compelling about the space. I’m interested in exploring some of the weirdnesses in how we as a society define different things. That’s the kind of stuff that I’m interested in, not having a kind of like A.I. chat pet.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinI’ve heard you say that with A.I., it’s the model that’s the art, not necessarily the output of the model.holly herndonYeah, that’s one thing that we’re exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you’re not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that’s my own singing voice or whether that’s my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world.So it’s almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we’re often using is “protocol art,” basically understanding that any work that’s made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we’re trying to lean into that.So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called “Ready Weight,” we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space. Or, you know, when we made the model of my voice with Holly+, we made that publicly available so anyone could make work for that. So that’s the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work.And in a way, art’s kind of always a little bit like that. It’s a conversation between the work that you’re making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world.ezra kleinYou wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. “Collective intelligence” is more useful. Why?holly herndonBecause I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It’s trained on all of us. Specifically, when you look at music, it’s trained on human bodies performing very special tasks. And I think it does humans a great disservice to try to remove that from the equation.I think that’s why I like to draw a parallel, also, to choral music, because I see it as a kind of coordination technology in the same kind of lineage as group singing. I think it’s a part of our evolutionary story and I think it’s a great human accomplishment that should be celebrated as such.ezra kleinI want to explore what changes when you emphasize the collectivity of these models, the fact that they are in some ways an aggregate of all of us versus the artificiality of them, right? Artificial intelligence, which really emphasizes no, there’s something that somebody has written into software over here. They’re unearthly. They’re a new kind of thing. And one thing is actually, I think, economic, that there’s this whole question about who gets compensated and who’s going to make the money off of this and what all this training data is going to end up doing economically.And it does seem very different to me if you understand these as on some level, a societal output, something that’s built on a kind of commons as opposed to a tremendous leap and feat of technology that is the sort of individual result of software geniuses working in garages and office parks somewhere.holly herndonYeah, I mean, that basically summarizes the work that I’ve been doing for the last several years. It’s kind of like shouting that from the rooftops. Because I think if you see it through that lens, then it becomes something really beautiful and something to be celebrated and also something that’s not entirely new. You know, we’ve been embarking on collective projects, the entirety of our humanity to make things that are bigger than ourselves. And so if we can find a way to make that work in the real world with the kind of future of the economy, then yeah, I think it behooves us to figure that out.ezra kleinThe not entirely new part feels important to me. The degree to which this is all a continuum feels often underplayed in conversations about A.I., about the future of work, about humans and machines. But there’s also a way in which you see the A.I. companies using this argument to say that they should be given much more free rein and much more full profits over the products of these models, because they say, look. We’re not doing anything different than any other artist or anyone ever has.Scientists today work off of the collective body of knowledge of science before them. You know, Holly Herndon is influenced by folk music and choral music and German techno, and everybody is always absorbing what has come before them and mixing it into something new. That’s all we’re doing. We’re not doing something new. We’re not making a copyright infringement.So how do you understand the effort to use the collectivity, right? The fact that human beings have always been in collective projects, but we do give people a lot of individual ownership and authorship over their works from what might be different here in the scale and the nature of what these models are doing.holly herndonSo, OK, I think that there’s a middle ground that can work for everyone, that can allow people to experiment and have fun with this technology while also compensating people. So spawning is a neologism that I like to use to kind of describe what’s happening here. And it’s a 21st century corollary to sampling, but it’s really distinctly different. And that difference, I think, is really important. It’s different in what it can do and also how it came about.So what it can do, we’ve kind of gone into that already. You know, you train a model, the kind of logic of one thing to be able to perform new things through that logic. So it’s distinctly different from sampling, which is really like a one-to-one reproduction of a sound created by someone else that can then be processed and treated to make something new. But with spawning, you can actually perform as someone else based on information trained about them. So that’s distinctly different.But also the way that it comes about, with sampling, it’s this one-to-one reproduction. With spawning, it’s a little bit more of a gray area in terms of intellectual property because you’re not actually making a copy. The machine is ingesting that media, if you want to call it looking at, reading, listening to, learning from. So I kind of land in that — I like to call it the “sexy middle ground” between people who are all for open use for everything and people who want to have really strict I.P. lockdown.And so that’s one of the reasons why spawning, then, kind of mutated even further into an organization, which is something that I co-founded with three other people, Mat Dryhurst, Patrick Hoepner and Jordan Meyer, to try to figure out this messy question of essentially data manners. How do we handle data manners around A.I. training? Because what’s happening right now isn’t working for everyone.ezra kleinAre there experiments that you find exciting or that you’ve conducted that you found the results of them promising?holly herndonYeah. I mean, I think Holly+ was a really fun experiment because people then actually used my voice and we were able to, you know, sell some works through that and generate a small profit, but enough to be able to continue to build the tools for the community. So that was a fun experiment that I think really worked. And there’s one experiment that I’m running right now that I’m really excited about. My partner, Mat Dryhurst and I had an exhibition at the Serpentine London in October, and as part of that, we are recording choirs across the U.K. I think there’s 16 in total, and they’re joining a data trust. And we’ve hired a data trustee to pilot this idea of governance where we’re trying to work out some of the messy issues around how a data trust might work. And then we’ll negotiate with that data trust directly as to how we can use their data in the exhibition and moving forward.I think it’s a really fun experiment, and it’s also because it’s singing and it’s choral music, it’s not really sensitive health data. We can really experiment and try out different ways to make this work in a way that’s not dealing with such sensitive information. So I’m really excited to see how people engage with that and how much do people really want to deal with the kind of day-to-day governance of their data. That’s also a big question.ezra kleinSo you were saying earlier that often the models are the art, but in this case, the governance is the art.holly herndonYou know, in this case, I think the model and the governance and the protocol around it are all the art.ezra kleinThis idea of control is interesting, though. I mean, so it came out a while ago that Facebook and Meta had been training its A.I. on a huge cache of pirated books. And I think my book was in there. My wife’s book was in there. Like, the books of virtually everybody I know were in there. And so, a bunch of authors sued. And I also felt some part of me, like, I wanted to be paid for my inclusion. But I didn’t want to not be included in all of these. And it reminds me a bit of social media where at a certain point, whether or not you wanted to be on social media or not, it was sort of important that you had something representing you there, right?It could be not your real photo, right? You could have some control over it, but if you didn’t do it, then you had absolutely no control over what you appeared as online. And it probably wasn’t plausible. You could appear as nothing online. So maybe something you didn’t want would be your top Google search result.And here it’s going to get even weirder because there isn’t really — you can’t have your home page in the artificial intelligence model. All you are is training data. And so there’s something very strange about this. You know, if before all you were was kind of a profile, which was a very flattened version of you, now your training data — which is a very warped version of you. And this question of how do you have any control over that data, like if you want to participate but you want some definition over how you participate, there’s no real obvious avenue towards that.holly herndonThere’s none at the moment, but I think that that’s coming. I think people will opt in under terms that they feel comfortable with to be able to shape the way that they appear in this new space. I don’t think it’s tenable that people have no agency over how they appear in the future of the internet.ezra kleinThat feels idealistic to me. I mean, I feel like we’ve been we’ve been going through an internet for a long time where I would have said this level of data theft or use is not tenable. This level of surveillance is untenable. This level of flattening, the way we get each other to treat each other in social media, it doesn’t feel like this is going to hold.Like, I am amazed that people are still on X. As hostile as that platform has become to many of them, it’s just so impossible to imagine leaving something happening that they will accept something they really feel angry about. They really feel like the way it is run is hostile to them, that it is degraded. But, you know, what are you going to do? I’m amazed at how powerful the “what are you going to do” impulse is in life.holly herndonWell, I mean, I totally get that. But what we decided to do was to try to build a universal opt out standard. And it’s actually gaining traction. And there’s precedent in the E.U. A.I. Act. Ideally, it would be something that would be from the beginning, all training data would have been at. You know, people would have been asked permission from the offset, but that’s not how things played out. So now we’re in a position where we’re building tools where people can really easily opt out the data that they don’t want to have included in these models.We have an A.P.I. where you can install that on your website and easily have everything on your website not be included in crawling. So I do think that there are things that we can do. It requires a little bit of legislation. It requires a little bit of diplomacy. But I don’t think that we should just throw up our hands and say, OK, it’s over. They should just have everything.You know, if we do have a situation where we’re able to get the opt out as a kind of standard, then I think you can start to build an economy around an opt in. Something that I’m really proud of, we just announced Source.Plus. So I’m not trying to shill here, but I think this is a really important part of this conversation where we put together a data set of all public domain data, and it’s huge. And people should be training their base models there. And then you can allow people to opt in to fine tune their models and create an economy around that.If you have a public domain base layer model, then you can actually create an economy around that. But I don’t think we should give up.ezra kleinI definitely agree. I don’t think we should give up. For a lot of people, they need to make a living out of the work they’re doing.holly herndonYes.ezra kleinOne thing that I find inspiring about the idea of thinking of it as a collective intelligence is it maybe points the way towards the idea that there’s modes of collective ownership, or modes of collective compensation. And at least in the space of art, when you’re thinking about this idea that you might have your voice out there for anybody to use, I think for a lot of people, that’s scary, right?I mean, we’re very used to business models that are about nobody can use this thing of mine unless they pay me, right? We have patents, we have copyrights. What does that spark for you? What if we — what are the ways to do this in a more collective open source way that you think might work to make it possible for people to live, but also to create? Well,holly herndonI think first and foremost, it should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I mean, you know, we’re talking about art. And that encompasses so many different practices that function economically in so many different ways. That’s something that was really devastating, I think, when it came to streaming. Streaming was really revolutionary and wonderful for a lot of people, but it was really devastating for a lot of other people because everything had to have the same economic logic as pop music.And a lot of experimental music doesn’t follow that per play valuation logic. A lot of experimental music is about the idea, and you just need access to that idea once. You don’t need to listen to it on repeat. And so if the access to that idea costs a fraction of a cent, that’s going to be really difficult to pay for. It’s almost more you almost need more like a movie model where you pay a little bit more to gain access to that idea.I think what’s really needed is that people have the ability to create whatever subcultures and whatever kind of economic models work for their subcultures and aren’t squeezed into a kind of sausage factory where everything has to follow the same logic.ezra kleinSo I know you and your partner are working on this book for this forthcoming exhibition that has, I think, the most triggering possible title to two people in my industry, “All Media is Training Data.” What’s the argument there?holly herndonYeah, so this is a book that’s a series of commissioned essays and interviews between me and Mat about our approach to A.I. and data over the past 10 years. I do realize that this is kind of triggering for a lot of people, but I think it’s something that’s worth kind of recognizing. You know, as soon as something becomes captured in media, as soon as something becomes machine legible, it has the potential to be part of a training canon.And I think that we need to think about what we’re creating moving forward with that new reality. You know, a lot of the work that we’re doing around the exhibition is we’re creating training data deliberately. So we’re treating training data as artworks themselves. I’m writing a song book that a collective of choirs across the UK will all be singing from, and those songs were written specifically to train an A.I. So all of the songs cover all of the phonemes of the English language so you can really — the A.I. can get the full scope of the sound, of each vocalist.So we’re kind of playing with this idea of making deliberate training data, kind of — we like to call them mind children that we’re sending to the future.ezra kleinI want to talk about what’s triggering in it for a minute. Because I think when people hear that, they might think media in the sense of the news. And I’m actually least worried about the news, because the news is where we’re covering new things that happened that are not in the training data.But media, if you think about it broadly, right, visual media and music and all the other things human beings create, I think when people hear all media’s training data, what they hear is — everything we do will be replaceable, right? That the A.I. is going to learn how to do it and it’s going to be able to spit it back at us and then it doesn’t need us anymore.When we become the training data, we’re sort of training our replacement, right? Like, the sort of very grim stories that will come out of factories before they outsource somewhere, where people are training. You know, the people are going to replace them at a lower cost. Is that how you see it? If you’re training data, does that mean you’re replaceable?holly herndonArt is a very complex cultural web. It’s a conversation. It’s something that’s performed. It’s a dialogue. It’s situated in time and place. We wouldn’t confuse a poster of the Mona Lisa for the Mona Lisa. Those are two different things. So I’m not worried about artists being replaced or about, you know, infinite media, meaning that artists have no role in meaning-making anymore. I think that the meaning-making becomes all the more important.I do think we have to contend with a future where we do have infinite media, where the single image is perhaps no longer carrying the same weight as it did before. So yeah, there are some things to contend with, but I think that we won’t be replaced and I think it’ll be weird and wonderful.[MUSIC PLAYING]ezra kleinThere are a bunch of programs that are coming out now that use A.I. to generate this sort of endless amount of pretty banal music for a purpose. So I have this one I downloaded called “Endel,” and it’s like, do you want music for focus? Do you want it to sleep? Do you want it to — And it’s fine. If I heard it on one of those playlists on Spotify, I wouldn’t think much of it.[endel, ""wind downEVENING ENERGY RISE”]And I think it points towards this world where I think the view is, we’re going to know what we want. And what we’re going to want is a generic version of it. And we’re going to be able to get it in kind of vast quantities forever. But you’re an artist and you said something in an interview I saw you give about how reality always ends up weirder. It always mutates against what people are expecting of it.And so I wonder how much you suspect or see the possibility of the sameness that A.I. makes possible, the kind of endless amount of generic content, leading to some kind of backlash where people actually get weirder in response, both weirder with these projects, but also more interested in things created by humans in the same way that a lot of artisanal food movements got launched by the rise of fast food.I mean, how much do you think about backlash and the desire for differentiation as something that will shape cultures and software here?holly herndonWell, there’s a lot in there. I mean, the backlash has been huge. I think that A.I. has certainly joined the ranks of culture wars and especially on Twitter. So I think the backlash is already there. But I think we’re also in really early days. So some of the examples that you gave, I feel like they’re kind of trying to please everyone. And as we move into a situation where your specific taste profile is being catered to more, I think it will feel less mid and feel more bespoke.One direction where some of this can go, I think a lot of people are really focused on prompting at the moment because that’s how we’re interfacing with a lot of models. But in the future, it might look more like, you know, maybe you have a kind of taste profile where the model understands your tastes and your preferences and the things that you are drawn to and just kind of automatically generates whatever media that would kind of like please you.So the kind of production to consumption pipeline is kind of collapsed in that moment. One of the things that I always appreciated as a young person growing up was hearing things that I didn’t like and didn’t understand, and that was something I always found really difficult with algorithmic recommendation systems, is I just kept getting fed what it already knew that I liked.But, you know, when I was just being exposed to new music as a young person, I really needed to hear things that I didn’t like to expand my palate and understanding of what’s possible in music. And so that’s one thing that I think you could just kind of have a stagnation of taste if people are constantly being catered to. So I think people will crave something different or will crave to be challenged. Some people won’t, but some people will.ezra kleinOne of the things that occurred to me while I was looking through a lot of your work was that what I enjoyed about it was that you were using the relationship with the generative system to make yourself and make the work stranger. And that felt refreshing to me because my experience using ChatGPT or Claude or anything, really, so often is that it makes me more generic.And that there’s this way in which A.I. feels like it is this great flattening. It’ll give you a kind of lowest common denominator of almost anything that human beings have done before, and that the danger of that feels to me like it’s a push toward sameness whereas a lot of your art feels to me like a push towards weirdness and a kind of sense that you can interact with different versions of these systems in a less sanded-down way and find something that neither a human or a machine could create alone. Is that a reasonable read of what you’re doing? Is there something there?holly herndonYeah, I think that’s largely because I use my own training data. I create training data specifically for this purpose of training models rather than using something that’s just laid out for me. I think you get a lot of mid or averaging from these really large public models, because that’s basically the purpose.You know, it’s supposed to kind be a catchall, but I’m not interested in the catchall. I’m interested in, you know, this weird kind of vocal expression or I’m interested in this other weird thing. And so that’s what I really want to create training data around and really focus on for whatever my model is. So I think people should just get into training their own models.ezra kleinI want to end by going back to a song from “PROTO.” And it’s one of the stranger songs on the album. And I thought maybe we could just talk about what it’s doing and people could hear it. So why we play a clip of “Godmother“?[RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING]What’s happening there?holly herndonOK, so, yeah, when I delivered that single to 480, I was like, here’s a single for the next album. They were like, um, OK, what do we do with this? So this is, I guess, a really early voice model trained on my voice. So if you compare that to the Jolene song, that’s basically how far we’ve come in the last five years, which I think is just remarkable. It’s — the speed is incredible.So I trained Spawn on my voice, my singing voice, and then I fed Spawn stems from a collaborator of mine named Jlin. And so Spawn is attempting to sing Jlin’s stems through my voice. And Jlin’s music is very percussive. It’s mostly percussion sounds, so it ends up being this kind of almost like a weird beatboxing kind of thing because it’s trying to make sense of these sounds through my voice.ezra kleinWell, here, why don’t we play a clip of the Jlin? This is one of my favorite songs from her. It’s called “The Precision of Infinity.”[JLIN & PHILIP GLASS, “THE PRECISION OF INFINITY”] And so, yeah, it’s not that it’s a machine, it’s just something that a human being cannot do quite on their own. I mean, there’s like a Philip Glass sample in there. It’s beautiful. But I don’t know. It’s funny when you say that that Spawn feels so old because something I like about it is it feels very — compared to a lot of what’s coming out now, its strangeness feels much more modern. It feels truer to how A.I. feels to me than the much more polished things we’re currently hearing or seeing, which it’s like this thing has exploded in all of its weirdness. And all this effort is being made to make it seem normal.And I think the reason “PROTO” sounded very current to me when I heard it for the first time this year is it in sounding abnormal, it feels more actually of this moment, which feels very strange even as everybody keeps trying to make it seem not that strange.holly herndonWell, thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like at the time I was — this A.I. conversation has been going for so long. The hype was kind of already started back then. And I feel like so many things that were being marketed as A.I., it was kind of misleading what the A.I. was doing or how sophisticated things were. So at the time, a lot of people were creating A.I. scores and then having either humans perform them or having really slick digital instruments perform them.And so it was giving this impression that everything was really slick and polished and finished, and that’s why we decided to focus on audio as a material, specifically because you could hear how kind of scratchy and weird and unpolished things were at that time. And that’s — I wanted to meet the technology where it was, and that required a whole mixing process with Marta Salogni, who’s an amazing mixing engineer in London, to try to get the human bodies and the slick studio to occupy the same space as the kind of crunchy lo-fi Spawn sounds.But it was really important to me that I wasn’t trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors of like, this is some glossy future thing that it that it wasn’t, because I actually found the weirdness in there so much more beautiful.ezra kleinAs somebody who has now been for years playing around with models and working in these more sort of decentralized possibilities, I think it’s easy if you’re outside this and don’t have any particular A.I. software engineering expertise, as I don’t — as I think most of my listeners don’t — and you see, well, there’s models by OpenA.I., by Google, by Facebook — it feels like that no human being can do this, right? Companies getting billions of dollars.How are you able to participate in this world of models? How much expertise do you need? How do you figure out what are the interesting projects, right? If somebody wants to understand this kind of world of homebrew A.I., so to speak, how did you start, and where do they start?holly herndonThat’s a really good question. I mean, I think the landscape has changed so much since I started. I would say, you know, first thing, you can interact with publicly available models. And once you kind understand how those are working, then I would just do the really boring work of reading the academic research papers that are tedious. Take your time, drink a coffee, watch the YouTube video where they presented at a conference and maybe some people asked questions and that that helps to flesh it out.This was our process. It’s been really, really kind of messy. And yeah, we didn’t have a lot of hand-holding, but I think if you’re really interested in learning more, the information is out there. You just kind of have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think that’s a nice place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience? OK, so Reza Negarestani wrote a book called “Intelligence and Spirit.” It’s a pretty dense philosophical book about intelligence and spirituality that I think is really great. On a lighter side, “Children of Time” by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a really enjoyable A.I. science fiction about intelligent, genetically-modified spiders.ezra kleinOne of my favorite books.holly herndonYeah, it’s so good. So you kind see the kind of society and technology that a super intelligent spider society would build, which I love. And then there’s a book called “Plurality” that was led by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang and a wide community of contributors. I also contributed a small part to this book. It’s about the future of collaborative technology and democracy, and it was actually written in an open, collaborative, Democratic way, which I think is really interesting. So check it out.ezra kleinHolly Herndon, thank you very much.holly herndonThanks so much.

But what could it look like for artists to collaborate with A.I. systems in making art that is actually generative, challenging, transcendent?Holly Herndon offered one answer with her 2019 album “PROTO.” Along with Mathew Dryhurst and the programmer Jules LaPlace, she built an A.I. called “Spawn” trained on human voices that adds an uncanny yet oddly personal layer to the music. Beyond her music and visual art, Herndon is trying to solve a problem that many creative people are encountering as A.I. becomes more prominent: How do you encourage experimentation without stealing others’ work to train A.I. models? Along with Dryhurst, Jordan Meyer and Patrick Hoepner, she co-founded Spawning, a company figuring out how to allow artists — and all of us creating content on the internet — to “consent” to our work being used as training data.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Read 8 CommentsShare full article8Read in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTComments 8‘Artificial Intelligence’?

[MUSIC PLAYING] We are already awash in crappy A.I. content. Some of it is crappy commercial A.I. content that wants to sell you things. Some of it is crappy A.I. art. And it got me interested amidst all this complaining. What does it mean right now to be making good A.I. art? And so I read this profile of the A.I. artist and musician Holly Herndon in ""The New Yorker,"" and then separately, this DJ I met mentioned her work to me. So I should check this out. And so I went and listened to her 2019 album, ""PROTO,"" which was done alongside an A.I. voice trained on her voice and others. And I was walking to work when the song ""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"" came on. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT""] And I just stopped walking. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT""] What makes so much A.I. art so bad, in my opinion, is that it's so generic. These are generative systems. We keep calling them generative. But generative is so -- when we use that term, it usually means it helped you get somewhere new. But these systems are mimics. They help you go somewhere old. They can help us write or draw or compose like anyone else. But I find it much harder when using them to become more like yourself. And most of what I see coming out of people using them, it's all riffing on others in this very obvious way. What I like about Herndon's art is she uses A.I. to become weirder, stranger, more uncanny, more personal. It's going in the exact opposite direction. And some of her art questions the entire way these systems work. She and her partner, Mat Dryhurst, did this project at the Whitney Biennial this year, where they created an image generator based on images of Herndon, or at least what the A.I. system seemed to think she looked like, which is she's got this very striking copper hair. And so the way it understood her was really around this striking copper hair. She is, as she put it, a haircut. And so they manipulated these images and they made this A.I. system where anybody can generate any image in the style of what A.I. systems think Holly Herndon is. So you can generate an image of a house, and it'll have this long flowing copper hair. And it'll tag itself as an image of Holly Herndon. And because it's on the Whitney Biennial, these images have a certain authority in the way these A.I. scrapers work. And so as they are scraping the internet for images in the future, she is potentially poisoning their idea of what she is. She is taking control over the A.I.'s idea of Holly Herndon. I find that fascinating, A.I. art that is acting as a kind of sabotage of A.I. systems and the lack of voice we have in how we appear in them. Along with a bunch of collaborators, Herndon has a lot of projects trying to blaze a trail and do not just good A.I. art, but fair economics and ethics. And so I wanted to have her on the show to talk about it. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Holly Herndon, welcome to the show. Thanks. It's great to be here. So something I find fascinating about you is that you grew up singing in church choirs. Then you moved to Berlin after college and got deep into Berlin techno. And I think those are respectively the most human and the most inhuman forms of music that human beings make. So how did they shape you? Yeah, that's a really good question. I mean, I feel like I'm such a product of the environments that I've spent a lot of time in, so I'm really interested in folk singing traditions coming from East Tennessee. Of course, growing up in a town next to where Dolly Parton is from, she always loomed large. Then I spent a lot of time in Berlin. And so of course, electronic music and techno has played a really big part of my story. And then also moving to the Bay Area, where I got really deeply interested in technology. I feel like even though techno might sound and does kind of have a synthetic palette and does sound maybe inhuman, I feel like the rituals that happen around the music are very human and very sweaty and very embodied. So I think if you experience that culture in person, it feels less inhuman. But why does that magic happen? So I was in Berlin, and I was down in the sort of big room in the bunker, I would call it, as sort of the way it felt to me. And I would say the music felt like being inside of a machine gun but in a good way. And meanwhile, as you say, what's happening around it -- I mean, it was actually the most inhuman music I've ever heard. And I like electronic music. But what's happening around it is so human. I mean, all these people engaged in this most physical, sweaty, smelly ritual of dancing together. How do you understand both the meaning and the function of it? Why does music like that create that kind of transcendence? I mean, this might sound strange, but music is a kind of coordination technology. So 4/4 techno beat is maybe the most clear communication of that. It's so easy to participate in. It's fairly easy to make. It's also fairly easy to dance to and understand. So I feel like as a kind of -- if I want to call it a kind of protocol, it's an easy way to communicate what to do in that scenario. So I think that that's why people have organized around it so much. When I go out and listen to the further reaches of techno, in Berlin, in New York, where I live, I'll often find myself at some point in the night thinking every piece of sound in this music is a choice. And when that choice sounds very artificial, right, when it sounds like something so removed from somebody playing strings or somebody singing, I think this person wanted to communicate in this extraordinarily machine-like way. And this has been happening for a long time, I mean, talk boxes and synthesizers and all of these technologies. And I'm curious, as somebody who's made some of that music or is deeply, at least within the culture that has made it, what is appealing about that? I mean, you said it creates this very sweaty human ritual. But first, there is this transition of the person into something that does not sound like people. It sounds like music that robots might make. It sounds like music from a faraway culture. Maybe there's something about living in in such a technologically mediated world that makes us want to find how we fit into that as humans. And music is such a kind of innate part of being a human. I mean, as a performer of the laptop, I was always trying to find a way to make the laptop feel really embodied, because at the time, when I started performing a lot, there was this criticism that, oh, you could be checking your email, or this doesn't really feel like a lively performance. So I started using my voice as a kind of input stream. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""FADE""] And the thing that I found really liberating about using my voice in that way is that I could kind do anything to digitally manipulate my voice to make it be so much more than it is physically. But what I really enjoyed was using my voice as a kind of controller or data stream, and then it could do things that I couldn't imagine once I put it in the laptop and was able to process it in specific ways. So there's something about trying to come to terms with the systems around us by working through them and working with them. Collaborating maybe helps us kind understand where we sit in that feedback loop. So in a minute, I want to play a clip of a piece of music you made. But first, I want to talk about how you made it. So tell me about Spawn. Spawn, who was our A.I. baby experiment. ""PROTO"" was released in 2019, and Spawn came about two years before that. So at the time, it was a very different time, especially for audio. A lot of the visual models were developed earlier. But eventually, things got better. We started playing with a project called SampleRNN and some other software. And you'll hear still from the from the stems that we might play later the vocal quality, the sound quality from 2017, 2018. To me, it sounded like the really early recordings that you can find on YouTube. I think it's like the earliest audio recording. It sounds really scratchy and super low fidelity. That's what the audio sounded like back in the day. And so it was this real issue of trying to get the high fidelity recordings that I was doing with my ensemble in the studio to live in the same universe as this really scratchy, low-fi audio that I was generating through Spawn. Well, why don't we play a bit of that? Because you kindly shared the stems for the song ""Swim."" And maybe we should start here by playing the ensemble, the sort of chorus you brought together to sing for the album. [VOCALIZATION] So that's really beautiful and really human. And now on the other side, I want to play the Spawn track on its own. [MUSIC PLAYING] What am I hearing when I hear that somewhat nightmarish Spawn there? So Spawn was trained on the voices of the ensemble. And so back then, we couldn't deal with polyphony, which means one -- more than one note at a time. So what we had to do was break each line into an individual line, and then we would feed that line to Spawn, who would then sing it back through the voice of our ensemble. And I think we were feeding it through with a either a voice synthesizer or a piano. I can't remember. It's been so long. But so we basically use this idea, which is called timbre transfer. So that's where the computer learns the logic of one sound and kind of superimposes that onto the performance of another. So that's what we did. We had the ensemble sing a variety of phrases. We trained Spawn on their voices. And then we did a timbre transfer. We fed her the line that we wanted her to sing. And then she sang it back to us. And I think hearing that, one question you could have is, well, what do you need Spawn for? Why not just have a human being sing into a talk box or use a synthesizer or ableton? We can make people's voices sound strange already, auto-tune. What is the value of Spawn here? I think overall spawn has a unique timbral quality that I actually really love because it really is a snapshot in time. It doesn't sound like that anymore. It sounds really clean and, yeah, really high fidelity. But at that period of time, it's I almost have this like romanticism around that, almost like a vinyl hiss or a pop for that very particular period of time in machine learning research. But also, I felt like I really needed to be making my own models and dealing with the subject directly in order to have a really informed opinion about it. And I'm really glad that I made that decision, because it's informed so much of the work that I do today. Just even the very basic understanding that that a model's output is so tied to the training data, the input, I don't know that I would have come to the profundity of that had I not been training my own models. And that's really informed all of the work that I've done since then. So I think sometimes you just have to deal with the technology in order to make informed work around that technology. We're going to come back to the profundity of that, because I actually think it's really important. But I wanted to do two things before we do. One is to play a bit of the full song, ""Swim,"" so people can hear where this ended up. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""SWIM""] And so then I want to play something you just released more recently using -- I don't know if you'd call this an updated Spawn, but we're calling Holly+, which is this much more modern voice model trained on your voice that you had covered Dolly Parton's Jolene. [HOLLY HERNDON, ""JOLENE""] So obviously the unearthly quality is gone. What am I hearing? Who -- what is singing? So that is a voice model trained on my voice. I worked with some researchers in Barcelona in a studio called Voctro Labs at the time. And Holly Plus was born. And as you can hear, it's leaps and bounds better, more high -- higher fidelity than little Spawn. So basically, that version of Holly+, there are multiple versions. There's a version that can be performed in real time, but this particular version is a score-reading piece of software. So I basically just write out a score with the text written out in phonemes. And then the software spits out basically pitch-perfect performance of that song. And of course, it helps to have Ryan Norris playing a beautiful human guitar accompaniment. That's a use case that I'm fascinated by, that I imagine will become more and more common in the future, which is a model trained on a person that one can sort of almost autonomously create as if it were that person. You can imagine somebody training a model on all of my podcasts. And then the model generates questions they could ask somebody, or a model generated all of my columns and you can spit out a an Op-Ed. What is your relationship with that? And do you see it as an extension of what you can do? Or do you see it as a kind of partner you can collaborate with? Or do you see it as just some version of you that makes you scale because you can't take commissions to sing from everybody out in the public, but they can all go to Holly Plus and get it to sing on their behalf? Like, what is your relationship with this nascent other you, or at least other voice of you, that now exists in the world? I think I'm probably an outlier in my relationship here because my practice involved so much vocal processing. So if you listen to movement -- [HOLLY HERNDON, ""MOVEMENT""] -- or a platform -- [HOLLY HERNDON, ""CHORUS""] The albums before ""PROTO"" before I started working with machine learning, I was already taking my voice and kind of mangling it beyond recognition, turning it into a machine itself. So for me to make a model of my voice that felt like the natural next step in an already very kind of highly-mediated process with my voice, I don't expect everyone to have that relationship. I don't really see the Holly+ voice as something that replaces me in any way. It's something that I have fun playing with. I can attempt to perform things that I wouldn't normally be able to. You know, I did a performance with Maria Arnal in Barcelona, and, I mean, that music is so difficult to perform. I could never sing that. She can do all of these amazing melismatic diva runs that I could never dream of, but my voice model could do it. And that was really fun. And it didn't confuse me to think, OK, I can do that now. It was more just fun to hear myself do something that I know that I couldn't do alone acoustically. So I guess for me, it's maybe like an extension or an augmentation of my own self. So what did Holly+ add to that cover of Jolene? I mean, you could have just sung a few tracks of harmony and added them above the melody. So what does A.I. mean to you in it specifically? Well, I think that one is perhaps a little personal because growing up in east Tennessee, Dolly Parton was kind of the patron saint of that region. And the kind of music that I usually perform has very heavily processed vocals and is usually, it's a bit more abstract than a Dolly Parton song. So it was almost like I wouldn't afford myself that or allow myself that, but I would allow Holly+ to do it, because there was this kind of level of removal. It's almost like Holly+ can perform things that I would be too bashful to perform myself. Oh, that's really interesting, the idea that having another version of yourself out there could give you license to try things you wouldn't otherwise try. Yeah, like Jolene. I mean, I love Jolene as a project, but it doesn't have the same ghostliness and quality as the music on ""PROTO,"" which is why I didn't release it as an album, you know. It's just not as interesting, somehow. I guess the other thing, there's a question of meaning here that I've been circling in my own time playing around with A.I. I spent a bunch of time recently creating sort of A.I. friends and therapists. And, you're trying to understand, like, the relational A.I.s that you can build now. And on the one hand, I was amazed at technically how good a lot of them were. At the same time, I find I never end up coming back. I find it very hard to make the habit sticky or the relationship sticky. When I sit with my friend or my partner, the fact that they are choosing to be there with me is separate from the things that they are saying. And an experience I'm having with a lot of A.I. projects is that the output is pretty good, right? Holly+ sings really well. Or the therapist friend I made on Kindroid texts in a way that if you had just shown me the text, I would not know it's not a human being. But the absence of there being the meaning of it that another person brings, the fact that I know it's Holly+, like, it's a cool project, but I'm not going to keep listening to it. The fact that I know the Kindroid can't not show up to talk to me, that that's a relationship I control totally. It robs the interaction of meaning in a way that makes it hard for me to keep coming back to it. And so somebody who works a lot with the question of meaning and sees a lot of these A.I. efforts happening, how do you think about what imbues them with meaning, and in what cases they end up feeling hollow? It's really funny. We did a live performance from ""PROTO,"" I guess in 2019, in New York. And we had the ensemble on the stage. And afterwards someone came up to me and they said, ""I really enjoyed the show, but I don't understand what it has to do with A.I."" And actually that was the biggest compliment that I could receive, because I wasn't trying to project this kind of super future, you know, A.I., high-tech story. I was trying to show all of the kind of human relationships and the human singing that goes into training these models. That's something I was really trying to get to with that album is, you know, allowing the some of the things that the computer can do, you know, some of the coordination that it can do is remarkable. But it can also free us up to just be more human together, to really just focus on the parts that we really want to focus on, which is just enjoying that moment of singing on stage together. I'm also not so interested in necessarily having an A.I. therapist. That's not what I find interesting or compelling about the space. I'm interested in exploring some of the weirdnesses in how we as a society define different things. That's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in, not having a kind of like A.I. chat pet. [MUSIC PLAYING] I've heard you say that with A.I., it's the model that's the art, not necessarily the output of the model. Yeah, that's one thing that we're exploring quite a bit. So one of the potentials around machine learning is that you're not limited to just a single output. You can create a model of whether that's my own singing voice or whether that's my own image or likeness, and you can allow other people to explore the logic of that model and to prompt through your world. So it's almost kind of like inviting people into your subjectivity, or inviting someone into your video, the video game of your art. So I think it has a lot of potential to be interesting in a kind of collaborative way with your audience. One term that we're often using is ""protocol art,"" basically understanding that any work that's made is a kind of seed for infinite generations. So we're trying to lean into that. So, for example, if we make a sculpture, which we did a project called ""Ready Weight,"" we also make it available as a package with an embedding and a Lora and all the kind of tools that anyone would need to be able to explore that sculpture in latent space. Or, you know, when we made the model of my voice with Holly+, we made that publicly available so anyone could make work for that. So that's the example of protocol art, where really, it becomes a collaborative experience between myself and the people who are engaging with my work. And in a way, art's kind of always a little bit like that. It's a conversation between the work that you're making and the viewer or the recipient, but that becomes a little bit more complicated and fun, I think, in an A.I. world. You wrote something in 2018 that I think is worth exploring where you said that A.I. is a deceptive, over-abused term. ""Collective intelligence"" is more useful. Why? Because I really do see it as a kind of aggregate human intelligence. It's trained on all of us. Specifically, when you look at music, it's trained on human bodies performing very special tasks. And I think it does humans a great disservice to try to remove that from the equation. I think that's why I like to draw a parallel, also, to choral music, because I see it as a kind of coordination technology in the same kind of lineage as group singing. I think it's a part of our evolutionary story and I think it's a great human accomplishment that should be celebrated as such. I want to explore what changes when you emphasize the collectivity of these models, the fact that they are in some ways an aggregate of all of us versus the artificiality of them, right? Artificial intelligence, which really emphasizes no, there's something that somebody has written into software over here. They're unearthly. They're a new kind of thing. And one thing is actually, I think, economic, that there's this whole question about who gets compensated and who's going to make the money off of this and what all this training data is going to end up doing economically. And it does seem very different to me if you understand these as on some level, a societal output, something that's built on a kind of commons as opposed to a tremendous leap and feat of technology that is the sort of individual result of software geniuses working in garages and office parks somewhere. Yeah, I mean, that basically summarizes the work that I've been doing for the last several years. It's kind of like shouting that from the rooftops. Because I think if you see it through that lens, then it becomes something really beautiful and something to be celebrated and also something that's not entirely new. You know, we've been embarking on collective projects, the entirety of our humanity to make things that are bigger than ourselves. And so if we can find a way to make that work in the real world with the kind of future of the economy, then yeah, I think it behooves us to figure that out. The not entirely new part feels important to me. The degree to which this is all a continuum feels often underplayed in conversations about A.I., about the future of work, about humans and machines. But there's also a way in which you see the A.I. companies using this argument to say that they should be given much more free rein and much more full profits over the products of these models, because they say, look. We're not doing anything different than any other artist or anyone ever has. Scientists today work off of the collective body of knowledge of science before them. You know, Holly Herndon is influenced by folk music and choral music and German techno, and everybody is always absorbing what has come before them and mixing it into something new. That's all we're doing. We're not doing something new. We're not making a copyright infringement. So how do you understand the effort to use the collectivity, right? The fact that human beings have always been in collective projects, but we do give people a lot of individual ownership and authorship over their works from what might be different here in the scale and the nature of what these models are doing. So, OK, I think that there's a middle ground that can work for everyone, that can allow people to experiment and have fun with this technology while also compensating people. So spawning is a neologism that I like to use to kind of describe what's happening here. And it's a 21st century corollary to sampling, but it's really distinctly different. And that difference, I think, is really important. It's different in what it can do and also how it came about. So what it can do, we've kind of gone into that already. You know, you train a model, the kind of logic of one thing to be able to perform new things through that logic. So it's distinctly different from sampling, which is really like a one-to-one reproduction of a sound created by someone else that can then be processed and treated to make something new. But with spawning, you can actually perform as someone else based on information trained about them. So that's distinctly different. But also the way that it comes about, with sampling, it's this one-to-one reproduction. With spawning, it's a little bit more of a gray area in terms of intellectual property because you're not actually making a copy. The machine is ingesting that media, if you want to call it looking at, reading, listening to, learning from. So I kind of land in that -- I like to call it the ""sexy middle ground"" between people who are all for open use for everything and people who want to have really strict I.P. lockdown. And so that's one of the reasons why spawning, then, kind of mutated even further into an organization, which is something that I co-founded with three other people, Mat Dryhurst, Patrick Hoepner and Jordan Meyer, to try to figure out this messy question of essentially data manners. How do we handle data manners around A.I. training? Because what's happening right now isn't working for everyone. Are there experiments that you find exciting or that you've conducted that you found the results of them promising? Yeah. I mean, I think Holly+ was a really fun experiment because people then actually used my voice and we were able to, you know, sell some works through that and generate a small profit, but enough to be able to continue to build the tools for the community. So that was a fun experiment that I think really worked. And there's one experiment that I'm running right now that I'm really excited about. My partner, Mat Dryhurst and I had an exhibition at the Serpentine London in October, and as part of that, we are recording choirs across the U.K. I think there's 16 in total, and they're joining a data trust. And we've hired a data trustee to pilot this idea of governance where we're trying to work out some of the messy issues around how a data trust might work. And then we'll negotiate with that data trust directly as to how we can use their data in the exhibition and moving forward. I think it's a really fun experiment, and it's also because it's singing and it's choral music, it's not really sensitive health data. We can really experiment and try out different ways to make this work in a way that's not dealing with such sensitive information. So I'm really excited to see how people engage with that and how much do people really want to deal with the kind of day-to-day governance of their data. That's also a big question. So you were saying earlier that often the models are the art, but in this case, the governance is the art. You know, in this case, I think the model and the governance and the protocol around it are all the art. This idea of control is interesting, though. I mean, so it came out a while ago that Facebook and Meta had been training its A.I. on a huge cache of pirated books. And I think my book was in there. My wife's book was in there. Like, the books of virtually everybody I know were in there. And so, a bunch of authors sued. And I also felt some part of me, like, I wanted to be paid for my inclusion. But I didn't want to not be included in all of these. And it reminds me a bit of social media where at a certain point, whether or not you wanted to be on social media or not, it was sort of important that you had something representing you there, right? It could be not your real photo, right? You could have some control over it, but if you didn't do it, then you had absolutely no control over what you appeared as online. And it probably wasn't plausible. You could appear as nothing online. So maybe something you didn't want would be your top Google search result. And here it's going to get even weirder because there isn't really -- you can't have your home page in the artificial intelligence model. All you are is training data. And so there's something very strange about this. You know, if before all you were was kind of a profile, which was a very flattened version of you, now your training data -- which is a very warped version of you. And this question of how do you have any control over that data, like if you want to participate but you want some definition over how you participate, there's no real obvious avenue towards that. There's none at the moment, but I think that that's coming. I think people will opt in under terms that they feel comfortable with to be able to shape the way that they appear in this new space. I don't think it's tenable that people have no agency over how they appear in the future of the internet. That feels idealistic to me. I mean, I feel like we've been we've been going through an internet for a long time where I would have said this level of data theft or use is not tenable. This level of surveillance is untenable. This level of flattening, the way we get each other to treat each other in social media, it doesn't feel like this is going to hold. Like, I am amazed that people are still on X. As hostile as that platform has become to many of them, it's just so impossible to imagine leaving something happening that they will accept something they really feel angry about. They really feel like the way it is run is hostile to them, that it is degraded. But, you know, what are you going to do? I'm amazed at how powerful the ""what are you going to do"" impulse is in life. Well, I mean, I totally get that. But what we decided to do was to try to build a universal opt out standard. And it's actually gaining traction. And there's precedent in the E.U. A.I. Act. Ideally, it would be something that would be from the beginning, all training data would have been at. You know, people would have been asked permission from the offset, but that's not how things played out. So now we're in a position where we're building tools where people can really easily opt out the data that they don't want to have included in these models. We have an A.P.I. where you can install that on your website and easily have everything on your website not be included in crawling. So I do think that there are things that we can do. It requires a little bit of legislation. It requires a little bit of diplomacy. But I don't think that we should just throw up our hands and say, OK, it's over. They should just have everything. You know, if we do have a situation where we're able to get the opt out as a kind of standard, then I think you can start to build an economy around an opt in. Something that I'm really proud of, we just announced Source.Plus. So I'm not trying to shill here, but I think this is a really important part of this conversation where we put together a data set of all public domain data, and it's huge. And people should be training their base models there. And then you can allow people to opt in to fine tune their models and create an economy around that. If you have a public domain base layer model, then you can actually create an economy around that. But I don't think we should give up. I definitely agree. I don't think we should give up. For a lot of people, they need to make a living out of the work they're doing. Yes. One thing that I find inspiring about the idea of thinking of it as a collective intelligence is it maybe points the way towards the idea that there's modes of collective ownership, or modes of collective compensation. And at least in the space of art, when you're thinking about this idea that you might have your voice out there for anybody to use, I think for a lot of people, that's scary, right? I mean, we're very used to business models that are about nobody can use this thing of mine unless they pay me, right? We have patents, we have copyrights. What does that spark for you? What if we -- what are the ways to do this in a more collective open source way that you think might work to make it possible for people to live, but also to create? Well, I think first and foremost, it should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I mean, you know, we're talking about art. And that encompasses so many different practices that function economically in so many different ways. That's something that was really devastating, I think, when it came to streaming. Streaming was really revolutionary and wonderful for a lot of people, but it was really devastating for a lot of other people because everything had to have the same economic logic as pop music. And a lot of experimental music doesn't follow that per play valuation logic. A lot of experimental music is about the idea, and you just need access to that idea once. You don't need to listen to it on repeat. And so if the access to that idea costs a fraction of a cent, that's going to be really difficult to pay for. It's almost more you almost need more like a movie model where you pay a little bit more to gain access to that idea. I think what's really needed is that people have the ability to create whatever subcultures and whatever kind of economic models work for their subcultures and aren't squeezed into a kind of sausage factory where everything has to follow the same logic. So I know you and your partner are working on this book for this forthcoming exhibition that has, I think, the most triggering possible title to two people in my industry, ""All Media is Training Data."" What's the argument there? Yeah, so this is a book that's a series of commissioned essays and interviews between me and Mat about our approach to A.I. and data over the past 10 years. I do realize that this is kind of triggering for a lot of people, but I think it's something that's worth kind of recognizing. You know, as soon as something becomes captured in media, as soon as something becomes machine legible, it has the potential to be part of a training canon. And I think that we need to think about what we're creating moving forward with that new reality. You know, a lot of the work that we're doing around the exhibition is we're creating training data deliberately. So we're treating training data as artworks themselves. I'm writing a song book that a collective of choirs across the UK will all be singing from, and those songs were written specifically to train an A.I. So all of the songs cover all of the phonemes of the English language so you can really -- the A.I. can get the full scope of the sound, of each vocalist. So we're kind of playing with this idea of making deliberate training data, kind of -- we like to call them mind children that we're sending to the future. I want to talk about what's triggering in it for a minute. Because I think when people hear that, they might think media in the sense of the news. And I'm actually least worried about the news, because the news is where we're covering new things that happened that are not in the training data. But media, if you think about it broadly, right, visual media and music and all the other things human beings create, I think when people hear all media's training data, what they hear is -- everything we do will be replaceable, right? That the A.I. is going to learn how to do it and it's going to be able to spit it back at us and then it doesn't need us anymore. When we become the training data, we're sort of training our replacement, right? Like, the sort of very grim stories that will come out of factories before they outsource somewhere, where people are training. You know, the people are going to replace them at a lower cost. Is that how you see it? If you're training data, does that mean you're replaceable? Art is a very complex cultural web. It's a conversation. It's something that's performed. It's a dialogue. It's situated in time and place. We wouldn't confuse a poster of the Mona Lisa for the Mona Lisa. Those are two different things. So I'm not worried about artists being replaced or about, you know, infinite media, meaning that artists have no role in meaning-making anymore. I think that the meaning-making becomes all the more important. I do think we have to contend with a future where we do have infinite media, where the single image is perhaps no longer carrying the same weight as it did before. So yeah, there are some things to contend with, but I think that we won't be replaced and I think it'll be weird and wonderful. [MUSIC PLAYING] There are a bunch of programs that are coming out now that use A.I. to generate this sort of endless amount of pretty banal music for a purpose. So I have this one I downloaded called ""Endel,"" and it's like, do you want music for focus? Do you want it to sleep? Do you want it to -- And it's fine. If I heard it on one of those playlists on Spotify, I wouldn't think much of it. EVENING ENERGY RISE""] And I think it points towards this world where I think the view is, we're going to know what we want. And what we're going to want is a generic version of it. And we're going to be able to get it in kind of vast quantities forever. But you're an artist and you said something in an interview I saw you give about how reality always ends up weirder. It always mutates against what people are expecting of it. And so I wonder how much you suspect or see the possibility of the sameness that A.I. makes possible, the kind of endless amount of generic content, leading to some kind of backlash where people actually get weirder in response, both weirder with these projects, but also more interested in things created by humans in the same way that a lot of artisanal food movements got launched by the rise of fast food. I mean, how much do you think about backlash and the desire for differentiation as something that will shape cultures and software here? Well, there's a lot in there. I mean, the backlash has been huge. I think that A.I. has certainly joined the ranks of culture wars and especially on Twitter. So I think the backlash is already there. But I think we're also in really early days. So some of the examples that you gave, I feel like they're kind of trying to please everyone. And as we move into a situation where your specific taste profile is being catered to more, I think it will feel less mid and feel more bespoke. One direction where some of this can go, I think a lot of people are really focused on prompting at the moment because that's how we're interfacing with a lot of models. But in the future, it might look more like, you know, maybe you have a kind of taste profile where the model understands your tastes and your preferences and the things that you are drawn to and just kind of automatically generates whatever media that would kind of like please you. So the kind of production to consumption pipeline is kind of collapsed in that moment. One of the things that I always appreciated as a young person growing up was hearing things that I didn't like and didn't understand, and that was something I always found really difficult with algorithmic recommendation systems, is I just kept getting fed what it already knew that I liked. But, you know, when I was just being exposed to new music as a young person, I really needed to hear things that I didn't like to expand my palate and understanding of what's possible in music. And so that's one thing that I think you could just kind of have a stagnation of taste if people are constantly being catered to. So I think people will crave something different or will crave to be challenged. Some people won't, but some people will. One of the things that occurred to me while I was looking through a lot of your work was that what I enjoyed about it was that you were using the relationship with the generative system to make yourself and make the work stranger. And that felt refreshing to me because my experience using ChatGPT or Claude or anything, really, so often is that it makes me more generic. And that there's this way in which A.I. feels like it is this great flattening. It'll give you a kind of lowest common denominator of almost anything that human beings have done before, and that the danger of that feels to me like it's a push toward sameness whereas a lot of your art feels to me like a push towards weirdness and a kind of sense that you can interact with different versions of these systems in a less sanded-down way and find something that neither a human or a machine could create alone. Is that a reasonable read of what you're doing? Is there something there? Yeah, I think that's largely because I use my own training data. I create training data specifically for this purpose of training models rather than using something that's just laid out for me. I think you get a lot of mid or averaging from these really large public models, because that's basically the purpose. You know, it's supposed to kind be a catchall, but I'm not interested in the catchall. I'm interested in, you know, this weird kind of vocal expression or I'm interested in this other weird thing. And so that's what I really want to create training data around and really focus on for whatever my model is. So I think people should just get into training their own models. I want to end by going back to a song from ""PROTO."" And it's one of the stranger songs on the album. And I thought maybe we could just talk about what it's doing and people could hear it. So why we play a clip of ""Godmother""? [RHYTHMIC SQUEAKING] What's happening there? OK, so, yeah, when I delivered that single to 480, I was like, here's a single for the next album. They were like, um, OK, what do we do with this? So this is, I guess, a really early voice model trained on my voice. So if you compare that to the Jolene song, that's basically how far we've come in the last five years, which I think is just remarkable. It's -- the speed is incredible. So I trained Spawn on my voice, my singing voice, and then I fed Spawn stems from a collaborator of mine named Jlin. And so Spawn is attempting to sing Jlin's stems through my voice. And Jlin's music is very percussive. It's mostly percussion sounds, so it ends up being this kind of almost like a weird beatboxing kind of thing because it's trying to make sense of these sounds through my voice. Well, here, why don't we play a clip of the Jlin? This is one of my favorite songs from her. It's called ""The Precision of Infinity."" [JLIN & PHILIP GLASS, ""THE PRECISION OF INFINITY""] And so, yeah, it's not that it's a machine, it's just something that a human being cannot do quite on their own. I mean, there's like a Philip Glass sample in there. It's beautiful. But I don't know. It's funny when you say that that Spawn feels so old because something I like about it is it feels very -- compared to a lot of what's coming out now, its strangeness feels much more modern. It feels truer to how A.I. feels to me than the much more polished things we're currently hearing or seeing, which it's like this thing has exploded in all of its weirdness. And all this effort is being made to make it seem normal. And I think the reason ""PROTO"" sounded very current to me when I heard it for the first time this year is it in sounding abnormal, it feels more actually of this moment, which feels very strange even as everybody keeps trying to make it seem not that strange. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like at the time I was -- this A.I. conversation has been going for so long. The hype was kind of already started back then. And I feel like so many things that were being marketed as A.I., it was kind of misleading what the A.I. was doing or how sophisticated things were. So at the time, a lot of people were creating A.I. scores and then having either humans perform them or having really slick digital instruments perform them. And so it was giving this impression that everything was really slick and polished and finished, and that's why we decided to focus on audio as a material, specifically because you could hear how kind of scratchy and weird and unpolished things were at that time. And that's -- I wanted to meet the technology where it was, and that required a whole mixing process with Marta Salogni, who's an amazing mixing engineer in London, to try to get the human bodies and the slick studio to occupy the same space as the kind of crunchy lo-fi Spawn sounds. But it was really important to me that I wasn't trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors of like, this is some glossy future thing that it that it wasn't, because I actually found the weirdness in there so much more beautiful. As somebody who has now been for years playing around with models and working in these more sort of decentralized possibilities, I think it's easy if you're outside this and don't have any particular A.I. software engineering expertise, as I don't -- as I think most of my listeners don't -- and you see, well, there's models by OpenA.I., by Google, by Facebook -- it feels like that no human being can do this, right? Companies getting billions of dollars. How are you able to participate in this world of models? How much expertise do you need? How do you figure out what are the interesting projects, right? If somebody wants to understand this kind of world of homebrew A.I., so to speak, how did you start, and where do they start? That's a really good question. I mean, I think the landscape has changed so much since I started. I would say, you know, first thing, you can interact with publicly available models. And once you kind understand how those are working, then I would just do the really boring work of reading the academic research papers that are tedious. Take your time, drink a coffee, watch the YouTube video where they presented at a conference and maybe some people asked questions and that that helps to flesh it out. This was our process. It's been really, really kind of messy. And yeah, we didn't have a lot of hand-holding, but I think if you're really interested in learning more, the information is out there. You just kind of have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think that's a nice place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience? OK, so Reza Negarestani wrote a book called ""Intelligence and Spirit."" It's a pretty dense philosophical book about intelligence and spirituality that I think is really great. On a lighter side, ""Children of Time"" by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a really enjoyable A.I. science fiction about intelligent, genetically-modified spiders. One of my favorite books. Yeah, it's so good. So you kind see the kind of society and technology that a super intelligent spider society would build, which I love. And then there's a book called ""Plurality"" that was led by Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang and a wide community of contributors. I also contributed a small part to this book. It's about the future of collaborative technology and democracy, and it was actually written in an open, collaborative, Democratic way, which I think is really interesting. So check it out.

LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New research from 

The latest instalment of Pearson’s Skills Outlook series, ‘Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work’ – looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).






Pearson’s workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.

The ten work tasks with most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in the UK are:


Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (679,000 hours)

Develop educational programs, plans, or procedures (665,000 hours)

Create visual designs or displays (525,000 hours)

Maintain operational records (512,000 hours)

Prepare legal or regulatory documents (490,000 hours)

Maintain health or medical records (406,000 hours)

Prepare reports of operational or procedural activities (401,000 hours)

Advise others on products or services (387,000 hours)

Explain regulations, policies, or procedures (386,000 hours)

Monitor individual behaviour or performance (383,000 hours)


By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision making, innovation, problem solving, empathy, leadership.

At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with Generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work life balance.
- A message from our partner -

Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said:

“In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that needs a more human touch and mean more to their customers. Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams, and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks. They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.”






Methodology

At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson’s proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.

Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in the UK on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years’ time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace. We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is here, and it's already changing our lives in a wide variety of ways. From chatbots to sat-nav, AI has revolutionized the technological space — but in doing so, it may be set to take over a wide variety of jobs, particularly those involving labor-intensive manual tasks. But it's not all bad news: as with most new technologies, the hypothetical advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) — where machines are smarter than humans and can apply what they learn across multiple disciplines — could also lead to new roles. So what might the job market of the near future look like, and could your job be at risk?Jobs AI could replaceData entry(Image credit: Shutterstock)One of the most mind-numbing and tedious jobs around today, data entry will surely be one of the first roles supplanted by AI. Instead of a human laboring over endless data sets and fiddly forms for hours on end, AI systems will be able to input and manage large amounts of data quickly and seamlessly, hopefully freeing up human workers for much more productive tasks. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksBlinkist MagazineApple Recommends Blinkist, The Best App For Intellectuals Around The WorldBlinkist MagazineUndoTelemarketing(Image credit: Shutterstock)You might already have endured robotic calls asking if you have been the victim of an accident that wasn’t your fault, or whether you’re keen to upgrade your long-distance calling plan — but this could be just a taste of things to come. AI services could easily take the work of a whole call center, automatically dialling hundreds, if not thousands of unsuspecting victims to spread the word, whether you like it or not. LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceCustomer service representative(Image credit: Shutterstock)On the friendlier side, AI customer service agents are already a common sight on the websites of many major companies. Often in the form of chatbots, these agents offer a first line of support, before deferring to a human where needed. In the not too distant future, though, expect the AI to take over completely, walking customers through their complaints or queries from start to finish.Front of house(Image credit: Shutterstock)Restaurant bookings can be a hassle, as overworked staff or maitre d’s try to juggle existing reservations with no-shows and chancers who try their arm at getting a last-minute slot. Booking a table will soon be a whole lot easier, however, with an entirely computerized system able to allocate slots and spaces with ease, and even juggle late cancellations or alterations without the need for anyone to lose their spot. Voiceover artist(Image credit: Shutterstock)Although image generation has grabbed much of the headlines, AI voice creation has become a growing presence in the entertainment and creative world. Offering potentially unlimited customization options, directors and producers can now create a voice whatever tone, style or accent they require — which is then able to say whatever they desire, without the need for costly retakes or ever getting tired.  Copywriter(Image credit: Shutterstock)Text generation has quickly become one of the most-used aspects of AI technology, with copilots and other tools able to quickly generate large amounts of texts based on a simple prompt. Whether you’re looking to fill your new website with business-focused copy, or offering more detail on your latest product launch — AI text generation provides a quick and easy way to do whatever you need to do. Website builder(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein, many of the leading website builder services today offer a fully AI-powered service, allowing you to create the page of your dreams simply by entering a few prompts. From start-ups to sole traders and all the way to big business, there’s no need to fiddle around with templates — simply tell the platform what you’re after, and a personalized website will be yours to customize or publish in moments. Driver(Image credit: Shutterstock)This one may still sound a bit more like the realm of science fiction, but with cars getting smarter by the year, fully AI-powered driving is not too much of a pipe dream any more. Far from the basic autopilot tools on offer today, the cars of the future may well be able to not just operate independently, but provide their passengers with a fully-curated experience, from air conditioning at just the right level, to your favorite radio station. Accountant(Image credit: Shutterstock)Another position that is based around humans taking in huge amounts of data and creating reports, accounting is set for an AI revolution that could see many roles replaced. No need to spend hours collating receipts and entering numbers into a spreadsheet when AI can quickly scan, identify and upload all the information needed, taking the stress out of tax season and answering any queries or questions with ease. Paralegal/legal assistant(Image credit: Shutterstock)The legal industry is another one that is dominated by large amounts of data and paperwork, and also one that is dominated by role-specific processes and even language. This makes it another prime candidate for AI, which will be able to automate the lengthy data analysis and entry actions undertaken by paralegals and legal assistants today — although given the scale or importance of the case involved, it may still be wise to have some kind of human element Receptionist(Image credit: Shutterstock)Signing in for an appointment or a meeting is another job that many believe can easily be done by AI platforms. Rather than needing to bother or distract a human from their job, simply check in on a display screen, with your visitor’s badge or meeting confirmation registered in seconds — allowing you (and everyone else) to get on with your day. Courier/delivery driver(Image credit: Shutterstock)Similar to AI drivers, autonomous vehicles and robots powered by AI systems could soon be taking the role of delivery people. After scanning the list of destinations for any given day, the vehicle or platform would be able to quickly calculate the most efficient route, ensuring no waiting around all day for your package, as well as being able to instantly flag any issues or missed deliveries. Proofreader/editor(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a boost to current spell checking tools, it may be that AI systems eventually graduate from suggesting or writing content to helping check it for mistakes. Once trained on a style guide or content guidelines, an AI editor could quickly scan through articles, documents and filings to spot any issues — a particularly handy speed boost in highly regulated industries such as banking, insurance or healthcare — before flagging possible problems to a human supervisor. Musician(Image credit: Shutterstock)Away from the written word, AI-powered platforms could soon be helping compose the next great pieces of music. Taking inspiration from vast libraries of existing pieces, these futuristic musicians could quickly dream up everything from film soundtracks to radio jingles, once again meaning companies or organizations would no longer need to pay human performers for day-long sessions consisting of multiple takes. Statistician(Image credit: Shutterstock)Another area which relies on quickly spotting trends and patterns among huge tranches of data, the statistics field could be quickly swamped by AI platforms. Whether it is at a business level, where companies could look to spot potential growth opportunities or risky situations, all the way down to the sports stats used by commentators and fans alike, AI can quickly come up with the figures needed. Project manager(Image credit: Shutterstock)A job that has already declined in importance over the past few years thanks to the emergence and widespread adoption of centralized collaboration tools, the role of project manager is another sure-fire target for AI. Rather than having a designated manager trying to keep tabs on the work being done by a number of disparate teams, an AI-powered central solution could collate all the progress in a single location, allowing everyone to view the latest updates and stay on top of their work. Animator(Image credit: Shutterstock)We’re already seeing the beginning of AI taking over the image design and generation space, with animation set to be one of the first fields to feel the effect. As more and more advanced AI programs emerge, creating any kind of customized animation will soon be easier than ever, with production studios able to easily create the movies, TV shows and other media they require. Graphic designer(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein to the entertainment industry, creating designs for new products, advertising campaigns and more will doubtless soon be another field dominated by AI. With a simple prompt, companies will be able to create the graphics they need, with potentially endless customization options that can be carried out instantly, with no need for back-and-forth with human designers. Cybersecurity analyst(Image credit: Shutterstock)Keeping track of potential security risks is another task that could be easily handled by AI, which will be able to continuously monitor multiple data fields and sensors to spot issues or threats before they take hold. Once detected, the systems would hopefully be able to take proactive action to lock down valuable data or company platforms, while alerting human agents and managers to ensure everything remains protected. Travel agent(Image credit: Shutterstock)Many of us are perfectly comfortable booking and scheduling our vacations independently, but sometimes you want all of the stress of planning taken off your hands. Rather than leaving it to a human agent, AI travel service platforms could gather all of your requirements and come up with a tailored solution or itinerary exactly sculpted to your needs, without endless back and forth, taking all of the hassle out of your vacation planning. Insurance underwriter(Image credit: Shutterstock)Making assessments on the viability of insurance applications can be a lengthy process, with agents needing to take into consideration a huge number of potential risks and other criteria, often via specific formulae or structures. Rather than a human needing to spend all this time, AI agents could quickly scan through all the information provided, coming up with a decision much faster and more effectively.Stockbroker/trader(Image credit: Shutterstock)One final field that is again dominated by analyzing huge amounts of data, past knowledge, and spotting upcoming trends and actions before they happen, stock trading could also quickly become dominated by AI. AI systems will be able to speedily act to make the best deals for financial firms in the blink of an eye, outpacing and outperforming human traders with ease, and possibly leading to even bigger profits. Jobs AI could createAI expert/consultant(Image credit: Shutterstock)First, and perhaps most obviously, will be an increase in roles for people looking to advise businesses exactly what kind of AI they should be utilizing. Simply grabbing as many AI tools and services as possible may have a tremendously destabilizing effect on a business, so having an expert who is able to outline the exact benefits and risks of specific technologies will become increasingly important for companies of all sizes.AI trainer(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein, getting the most out of your company’s new AI tools will be vital, so having trainers skilled in the right services will be absolutely critical. The ability to suggest to workers at all levels what they can utilize AI for will be incredibly useful for businesses everywhere, walking employees through the various platforms and educating them about any possible ill effects. Prompt engineer(Image credit: Shutterstock)With chatbots and virtual agents becoming the main “entry point” for people encountering AI, knowing just how to communicate with such systems is going to be vital to making the relationship productive. Having experts who know the best way to “talk” to models such as ChatGPT, especially when it comes to phrasing specific questions or prompts, will be increasingly important as our dependence on AI models increases. AI psychologist(Image credit: Shutterstock)Once we’re happy with how we communicate with AI models, the next big obstacle might be understanding what keeps it “happy” — or at least, productive. We may soon see experts who, much like human therapists, are engaged with AI models to try and understand what makes them tick — including why they might show bias or toxicity — in order to make our relationships with them more effective overall. AI crisis manager(Image credit: Shutterstock)On the occasion that something does go wrong — whether that’s a poorly worded corporate email, or an advertising campaign that features an embarrassing slip-up — there will be a need for crisis managers who can step in and look to quickly defuse the situation. This may become increasingly important in situations where AI may put sensitive data or even lives at risk, although hopefully such incidents will be rare. AI lawyer(Image credit: Shutterstock)The next step along from a crisis involving AI agents or systems may be lawyers or legal experts who specialize in dealing with non-human creators. The ability to represent a defendant who isn’t physically present in a courtroom may become increasingly valuable as the role of AI in everyday life, and the risks it poses, becomes more prevalent — especially as business data or personal information gets involved. AI stress tester(Image credit: Shutterstock)With AI set to push the limits of what can be done with analysis and data processing, it may be that some companies looking to adopt new tools are simply not equipped to handle the new technology. Stress testers will be able to evaluate the status of your tech stack and network to make sure that any AI tools your business is set to use don’t have the opposite effect and push everything to breaking point. Image/video auditor(Image credit: Shutterstock)With content creation becoming an increasingly important role for AI, we’re likely to see such images, audio and video appearing more frequently in everyday life. But we’re already seeing backlash against obviously AI-generated content littered with errors, like extra fingers on humans, or nonsense alphabets in advertising. Having a human editor that is able to audit this content and ensure it is accurate, and fit for human consumption, could be a vital new role. AI proofreader(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a similar vein, AI-generated content may also need a human sense-checking it before it hits the public domain. Similar to the work currently being done by proofreaders and editors on human-produced content around the world, making sure that AI documents flow properly and sound legitimate will be another crucial consideration, and should lead to a growth in these sorts of roles. ""Non-AI"" content creator(Image credit: Shutterstock)Finally, despite the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-generated content, there will still always be room for the human touch. Much like we already have “authentic” artists, or artisans who specialize in handmade goods, it may soon be that we have creators and painters who strive for their work to be “authentically human”, setting them apart from the AI hordes.

TL:DR
 Peter Cappelli argues AI complexity often makes it more work than manual tasks. He notes AI can become costly due to rising computer space and electricity demands. Human validation of AI is necessary and costly; AI is best for sorting data, not revolutionary tasks. 



A common argument in favor of AI is that it helps people save time at work.
But what if using generative AI is actually more trouble than it is worth? That’s the question posited by Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School.
Do we really need AI at work?
During a speech at MIT (via ZDNET), Cappelli explained that cumulatively, given the inherent complexity of AI, the work that goes into automating some tasks is more work than if you just did the task yourself in the first place.
He also adds that “it turns out there are many things generative AI could do that we don’t really need doing.”
He then went on to explain how replacing rote automation with AI is going to end up increasingly expensive. “It’s not so clear that large language models are going to be as cheap as they are now,” Cappelli said. “As more people use them, computer space has to go up, electricity demands alone are big. Somebody’s got to pay for it.”
Another concern raised by Cappelli is the fact that people are still needed either way in order to validate AI’s output.
“If you’re going to use it for something important, you better be sure that it’s right,” he explained. “And how are you going to know if it’s right? Well, it helps to have an expert; somebody who can independently validate and knows something about the topic.
“To look for hallucinations or quirky outcomes, and that it is up to date..We have to check it somehow, and this is not necessarily easy or cheap to do.”
So, what is AI actually good for? According to Cappelli, AI is best served sorting through data. “Somebody’s got to worry about guardrails and data pollution issues,” he said. Which is a lot more boring than revolutionizing the games industry.

In the ever-evolving landscape of work, the emergence of generative AI has sparked both curiosity and concern among professionals. Yet, for independent knowledge workers who navigate the complexities of high-end tasks daily, this technological advancement offers a unique set of opportunities and challenges. My conversation with Miles Everson, CEO of MBO Partners, sheds light on the nuanced impact of generative AI on this distinct segment of the workforce.
The Surprising Optimism Among Independent Workers 
Everson’s insights begin with an optimistic note: a significant majority of independent workers do not see their jobs being replaced by generative AI in the near future. In fact, only 8% of independent workers surveyed by MBO Partners anticipate their roles might be at risk within the next five years—a stark contrast to the 13% in the broader full-time workforce.
This optimism, as Everson explains, stems from the specific nature of tasks performed by high-end independent workers—tasks that often involve complex decision-making with unstructured data, areas where AI has yet to fully excel. These workers are involved in dynamic environments where judgment and adaptability play critical roles—qualities that AI, for all its advances, cannot completely replicate. The nuanced understanding of their professional landscape helps these workers view AI not as a threat, but as a potential tool to enhance their own capabilities.
The Strategic Use of Generative AI 
Beyond the fear of obsolescence, there is a proactive engagement with AI among independent workers. According to Everson, 37% of independent professionals are already integrating generative AI into their daily tasks. This is not about replacing human intellect but augmenting it to handle more routine aspects of their roles, thereby elevating their strategic value to clients.
This trend reflects a broader historical pattern: technological innovation, while disruptive, often creates more opportunities than it extinguishes. Everson points out that by automating the more mundane tasks, independent workers can focus on higher-value, more complex activities that require a human touch. This strategic incorporation of AI allows them to provide more sophisticated, tailored services that better meet the needs of their clients, ultimately making their offerings more competitive and indispensable in a market that increasingly values personalized and agile solutions.
Rethinking Job Structures with AI 
Everson’s strategic framework for understanding AI’s impact across different job structures is insightful. He categorizes tasks based on salary ranges and complexity: structured tasks earning less than $50,000 annually, semi-structured tasks in the $50,000 to $150,000 range, and complex, high-stakes decision-making tasks at salaries over $150,000. This salary-based stratification provides a clear perspective on how AI might be applied differently depending on the complexity and value of the tasks involved.
For lower salary ranges, where tasks are more structured and repetitive, AI integration can be swift and impactful, significantly improving efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention. However, as the complexity of tasks and the salary increase, the integration of AI becomes more challenging. At the highest salary levels, where strategic and unstructured decision-making prevails, AI has yet to develop the capability to fully replicate human judgment. Here, AI is used more as a support tool, enhancing human decision-making rather than replacing it. This nuanced understanding is critical for businesses planning their long-term strategy around AI integration, ensuring that they align AI’s capabilities with the right job roles to maximize effectiveness and efficiency.
Embracing AI to Remain Competitive 
Everson compellingly argues that the true challenge in the era of generative AI is not the technology itself, but the ability of companies and professionals to adapt and harness its potential. The narrative that AI will lead to widespread job elimination oversimplifies the multifaceted impact of AI in the workplace. Instead, Everson highlights the enhancement of job functions as a critical benefit of AI adoption. By integrating AI into their workflows, businesses can not only improve their operational efficiencies but also enhance their strategic capabilities, making them more competitive in a rapidly evolving market.
This approach helps secure a company’s position in the future job market, where being technologically adept and adaptable will be key determinants of success. For professionals, keeping pace with AI developments and proactively incorporating these technologies into their skill sets can turn potential threats into significant career opportunities, emphasizing the importance of a mindset geared towards continuous learning and innovation.
Generative AI as a Catalyst for Job Creation 
Everson illuminates the role of generative AI in fostering job creation, grounding his argument in historical precedents that demonstrate how technological innovation often leads to expanded markets and increased demand for labor. He references the transformative impact of platforms like Uber, which not only revolutionized the transportation industry but also significantly expanded the market size from a hundred million to three hundred million dollars in just five years in San Francisco alone.
This expansion was not merely a shift but an enhancement that created more opportunities and jobs than previously existed. Everson posits that generative AI is poised to have a similar effect, particularly as it enhances customer experiences and streamlines internal processes. As businesses adopt AI to improve efficiencies, they are likely to discover new service offerings and market opportunities, which in turn could lead to the creation of new job categories. This suggests that AI, far from being a mere tool for automating existing tasks, can act as a springboard for innovation and market growth, paving the way for new kinds of employment that are today, perhaps, unimaginable.
Practical Advice for Independent Workers 
In light of these evolving dynamics, Everson offers practical guidance for independent workers to adapt and thrive in an AI-enhanced market. His dual strategy emphasizes the importance of cultivating a mindset of curiosity and an active engagement with AI technologies. By directly interacting with AI tools, experimenting, and exploring their functionalities, independent workers can gain a practical understanding of how these technologies can enhance their work, streamline operations, and open up new avenues for business. This hands-on experience is invaluable, as it allows professionals to discover and innovate in ways that formal education alone cannot provide.
However, Everson also stresses the importance of complementing this experiential learning with formal training and certifications in AI applications. This more structured approach to understanding AI ensures that independent workers not only keep pace with technological advancements but also enhance their professional credentials, making them more attractive to clients and collaborators who are increasingly prioritizing technological proficiency. Together, these strategies equip independent workers with the tools necessary to navigate and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the ongoing integration of AI into the workforce.
Concluding Thoughts: A Call for Openness and Adaptability 
As we concluded our interview, Everson emphasized the importance of adopting a mindset open to innovation. Viewing generative AI as an opportunity rather than a threat allows professionals to explore new possibilities and secure a competitive edge. His parting advice is clear: Embrace change, engage with new technologies, and be prepared to adapt, for this is the path to not just surviving but thriving in the evolving landscape of work. As I help companies I work with adapt to the future of work and integrate Generative AI into their activities, I will recommend they listen to this interview.

Hype of generative AI exploded in 2023, as did share prices of big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Concurrent with this hype, AI investment moved from healthcare and AVs to generative AI in 2023, and this has continued in 2024. In fact, total private investment fell to $96 billion in 2023, down from $103.4 billion in 2022 and $130 billion in 2021 even as investment in generative AI surged eightfold from 2022 to $25.2 billion in 2023.
On the surface, generative AI looks incredible. Writing emails, marketing reports, and even academic papers is alluring for many, particularly for those people who are frequently stopped by writer’s block. Generative AI’s ability to create pictures and videos is even more attractive. Suddenly, advertising videos, education videos, and even entire movies seems possible.
All we have to do is make some improvements, the proponents claim, and we will be there. Reduce the frequency of hallucinations, racial slurs, and misplaced arms, and a productivity revolution will be unleashed.
Not So Fast
Unfortunately, we didn’t see that emphasis in the recent products that were announced by Google and OpenAI in Mid-May, however. OpenAI introduced a voice assistant, and a new model, GPT-4o that can respond to audio prompts, works across text, vision, and voice, and can read facial expressions.
Google also emphasized new features rather than greater accuracy, even showing hallucinations in its demo. Gemini Live enables video that is captured with a phone along with voice recognition to deliver contextual responses to your questions. Gemini was also integrated with Gmail so that long email chains can be summarized.
Some noticed the problem with emphasizing new features, “raising “concerns about the speed at which untested new services are coming to market, and academics and ethicists are distressed about the technology’s tendency to propagate bias,” a problem related to hallucinations.
One reason there wasn’t an emphasis on reducing hallucinations is because the problem is hard. Some argue that hallucinations area “baked into AI chatbots:” Large language models (LLMs) are

doing exactly what they were developed and trained to do: respond, however they can, to user prompts. The real problem, according to some AI researchers, lies in our collective ideas about what these models are and how we’ve decided to use them.

Others argue that the big tech firms have basically given up. For instance, in Google’s IO keynote, it placed disclaimers such as “check responses for accuracy” in every new AI tool it showed off. ChatGPT operates similarly. In tiny font just below the prompt window, it says, “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.” “That’s not a disclaimer you want to see from tools that are supposed to change our whole lives in the very near future!”
Comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are also illustrative:

Anyone who had an issue with AI’s accuracy was naive. If you just do the naive thing and say, never say anything that you’re not 100 percent sure about,’ you can get them all to do that. But it won’t have the magic that people like so much.

As many have argued, it’s all about wooing investors with magic.
Shiny Objects Over Safety
A CNBC article also argues that companies are more concerned with investors than users, and less concerned with reducing hallucinations. “Artificial intelligence engineers at top tech companies” said, 

The pressure to roll out AI tools at breakneck speed has come to define their jobs. They say that much of their work is assigned to appease investors rather than to solve problems for end users, and that they are often chasing OpenAI.” “Some said they were switched over to AI teams to help support fast-paced rollouts without having adequate time to train or learn about AI, even if they are new to the technology.

A Microsoft engineer says that when it comes to ethics and safeguards, it “has cut corners in favor of speed, leading to rushed rollouts without sufficient concerns about what could follow. The engineer said there’s a recognition that because all of the large tech companies have access to most of the same data, there’s no real moat in AI,” comments consistent with what executive Jan Leike said when he departed OpenAI: OpenAI put “shiny products over safety.”
An “Amazon engineer, who lost his weekend to a project that was ultimately scuttled, said higher-ups seemed to be doing things just to ‘tick a checkbox,’ and that speed, rather than quality, was the priority while trying to recreate products coming out of Microsoft or OpenAI.”
Another Microsoft AI engineer “recalled instances when a software engineer on his team would come up with an #algorithm to solve a particular problem that didn’t involve generative AI. That solution would be pushed aside in favor of one that used a large language model, even if it were less efficient, more expensive and slower.”
An independent engineer “described much of the work in generative AI today as an ‘extreme amount of vaporware and #hype.’ Every two weeks, the engineer said, there’s some sort of big pivot, but ultimately there’s the sense that everyone is building the same thing.” He said he often has to put together demos of AI products for the company’s board of directors on three-week timelines, even though the products are “a big pile of nonsense.” There’s a constant effort to appease investors and fight for money, he said. He gave one example of building a web app to show investors even though it wasn’t related to the team’s actual work. After the presentation, “We never touched it again.”
What do these comments tell us about generative AI? That perhaps it isn’t as good as proponents have been claiming. If it was so great, companies would be lapping up these products and using them to increase their productivity, but they aren’t, according to the Wall Street Journal. Suppliers of AI software wouldn’t be so concerned about what the investors thought because the success of their customers would speak to investors.
Who Will Solve the Real Problem?
One big problem is that if suppliers of AI are spending more time on demos for investors, then who will solve real problems, such as the hallucination problem? The simple answer is that not enough engineers are trying to solve the problem and thus the solution will take much longer than the tech sector is claiming. The longer and more cynical answer is that they don’t have a solution and know they don’t have one, so they are trying to distract everyone. And so far, they are succeeding.
This story also tells us about investors, and how superficial they are, which is something that we kind of already knew. Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller described these investors in his 2000 book Irrational Exuberance. During a boom, price increases lead to more price increases as each increase seems to provide more evidence that the market will continue to rise. The media, with help from the financial sector, offers seemingly logical reasons for the price increases, thus creating a narrative that encourages still more increases.
The narrative that Robert Shiller is referring to is the one companies are trying to massage with their demos, many of which may be faked. We already knew that some were faked, but the quotes from engineers in the CNBC article suggests that many may be faked.
A new narrative will likely soon emerge, and that narrative will likely be exaggerated in the opposite direction. This is way that bubbles work. Investors love you on the way up and hate you on the way down.

            Elon Musk says artificial intelligence will take all our jobs and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
    

            “Probably none of us will have a job,” Musk said about AI at a tech conference on Thursday.
    

            While speaking remotely via webcam at VivaTech 2024 in Paris, Musk described a future where jobs would be “optional.”

            “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job,” Musk said. “But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.”
    

            For this scenario to work, he said, there would need to be “universal high income” – not to be confused with universal basic income, although he did not share what that could look like. (UBI refers to the government giving a certain amount of money to everyone regardless of how much they earn.)
    

            “There would be no shortage of goods or services,” he said.
    

AI capabilities have surged over the past few years, fast enough that regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Concerns also continue to mount over how various industries and jobs will change as AI proliferates in the market.
    

            In January, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found workplaces are adopting AI much more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also said the majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time.
    

            Experts also largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not need replacing, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers.

            Musk has been outspoken about his concerns around AI. During the keynote on Thursday, he called the technology his biggest fear. He cited the “Culture Book Series” by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and “the best envisioning of a future AI.”
    

            In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled.
    

            “The question will really be one of meaning  – if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?” he said.  “I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this – in that we may give AI meaning.”
    

            He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because “they’re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.”

He cited the “Culture Book Series” by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and “the best envisioning of a future AI.” In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled. “The question will really be one of meaning  – if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?” he said.  “I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this – in that we may give AI meaning.” He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because “they’re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.”",,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.article__content'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P0Y0M0DT0H1M50S,416.0,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://clips-media-aka.warnermediacdn.com/cnn/clips/2023-05/1160341-974afebcba15452bae20b011a3fc1d83/mp4/cms3-CNN-the-lead-geoffrey-hinton-primary-268139-1160341-1920x1080_8000k.mp4', 'dateModified': '2023-05-02T23:00:50Z', 'uploadDate': '2023-05-02T23:00:50Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=tv/2023/05/02/the-lead-geoffrey-hinton.cnn&stellarUri=cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_6e3a104631d6d40f85581703743b2a51@published&stellarUdk=rn0723c0&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H04M27S', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': 'The so-called ""Godfather of the A.I."" joins The Lead to offer a dire warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence', 'headline': 'The so-called ""Godfather of the A.I."" joins The Lead to offer a dire warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence', 'description': 'Geoffrey Hinton joins The Lead.', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/geoffrey-hinton.jpeg?c=original', 'width': '1920', 'height': '1080', 'dateCreated': '2023-05-02T22:52:14Z', 'dateModified': '2023-05-02T22:52:15Z'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/geoffrey-hinton.jpeg?c=original', 'mainEntityOfPage': 'https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2023/05/02/the-lead-geoffrey-hinton.cnn'}]",,,

Since joining Vox in 2018, her work has explored the rise of TikTok, internet aesthetics, and the pursuit of money and fame online. You can sign up for her biweekly Vox Culture newsletter here.FacebookLinkArtificial intelligence has long been hailed as a great “equalizer” of creativity, finally putting the ability to create art in all of its myriad forms into the hands of the tech-savvy. Not a creative person? Not an issue.“The reason we built this tool is to really democratize image generation for a bunch of people who wouldn’t necessarily classify themselves as artists,” said the lead researcher for DALL-E, which turns text prompts into images. Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI, wrote in his book that generative AI will one day account for 95 percent of the work that companies hire creative professionals to do: “All free, instant, and nearly perfect. Images, videos, campaign ideas? No problem.” Or, as another AI startup founder put it: “So much of the world is creatively constipated, and we’re going to make it so that they can poop rainbows.” But it is a problem for actual artists, and for anybody who cares and thinks deeply about the words, images, and sounds we consume every day. With any promise of disruption comes the reasonable fear that its replacement will be worse, both for the creative professionals who rely on artmaking for their livelihoods and for people who enjoy reading well-written works, who take pleasure in thoughtful visual art, who watch movies not solely to be entertained but because of the surprising, life-affirming, or otherwise meaningful directions a good film might go. Should we take seriously the artistic vision of someone who considers “pooping rainbows” the pinnacle of creativity?The wrinkle in AI executives’ plot to supplant human creativity is that so far, consumer AI tools are not very good at making art. Generative AI creates content based on recognizing patterns within the data it was trained on, using statistics to determine what the prompter is hoping to get out of it. But if art is more meaningful beyond the images or words that comprise it or the money that it makes, what good is an amalgam of its metadata, divorced from the original context?A DALL-E image generated by the prompt “Show me what art is, in one image.” DALL-EText generators like ChatGPT, image creators like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Lensa, and DALL-E, the song-making tool Suno, and text-to-video generators like Runway and Sora, can produce content that looks like human-made writing, music, or visuals by virtue of having been trained on a great many human-made works. Yet any further examination reveals them to be mostly hollow, boring, and disposable. As one former journalist who now works at Meta remarked, “There hasn’t been a single AI-generated creative work that has really stuck with me … it all just glides right past and disappears.” What happens when and if the AI tools of the future can someday produce novels that people actually want to read, songs that listeners can’t stop blasting, or films that audiences will pay movie theater prices to see? Or, perhaps the better question is: Is that even possible if the owners of these technologies fundamentally misunderstand why people make and enjoy art?Why AI art looks cheapVisual artists have used machine learning for decades, but they’ve often done so in ways that reflect the artist’s process and ideas rather than the machine’s. Anna Ridler is a conceptual artist who uses a type of machine learning called a generative adversarial network, or GAN, that can be trained solely on the images she feeds it. That isn’t what the current generation of simple text-to-image generators — which are trained on hundreds of millions of images scraped from all over the internet — like Midjourney and DALL-E do. “Conceptually, it’s hard to do interesting things with [them], because [they’re] hidden behind APIs. It’s a black box,” she says of the proprietary (as opposed to open-source) software these companies use that discourages true experimentation. Instead, the work these generators churn out look uncanny, smooth, and generally off in ways that are both obvious and not: Generative AI’s reliance on data make it famously unable to accurately depict human hands, and as psychologist and AI commentator Gary Marcus noted, it also struggles with statistically improbable prompts like “a horse riding an astronaut,” which still seem exclusively the province of human imagination (even the latest AI models will invariably give you a picture of an astronaut riding a horse). “There’s this weird slickness to the images that will become a temporal marker that ‘this was a mid-2020s image,’” Ridler says. “The more you play with these things, the more you realize how hard it is to actually get something interesting and original out of them.”What AI is good at doing, however, is flooding the internet with mediocre, instantaneous art. “You know what I realized about AI images in your marketing? It sends out the message that you’ve got no budget. It’s the digital equivalent of wearing an obviously fake Chanel bag. Your whole brand immediately appears feeble and impoverished,” wrote artist Del Walker on X.It’s the same story with text generators. Last year Neil Clarke, the founder of the sci-fi and fantasy literary magazine Clarkesworld, shut down submissions after ChatGPT-generated works accounted for nearly half of what was submitted. “When this hit us last year, I told people they’re worse than any human author we’ve ever seen. And after one update, they’re equal to the worst authors we’ve seen,” he says. “Being a statistical model, it’s predicting the next most likely word, so it doesn’t really understand what it’s writing. And understanding is somewhat essential to telling a good story.” Great works of storytelling tend to work not just on one level but on multiple — they contain subtext and meaning that a statistical model likely couldn’t grasp with data alone. Instead, Clarke says, the AI-generated stories were flat and unsophisticated, even if they were grammatically perfect.“Right now, you could have GPT-4 generate something that looks like a full screenplay: It’d be 120 pages, it would have characters, they would have consistent names throughout and the dialogue would resemble things you might find in a movie,” says John August, a screenwriter on the WGA bargaining committee, which gained huge protections against AI last September. “Would it really make sense? I don’t know. It might be better than the worst screenplay you’ve ever read, but that’s a very low bar to cross. I think we’re quite a ways away from being a thing you’re going to want to read or watch.”AI is already being used in film in a few ways, sometimes to make it appear as though actors’ mouths match up with dubbed foreign languages, for example, or in creating backdrops and background characters. More controversially, AI has also been used in documentary projects: 2021’s Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain used AI to make a fake Bourdain speak three lines, a similar tactic was used in 2022’s The Andy Warhol Diaries. In April, the leaders of the Archival Producers Alliance drafted a proposed list of best practices for AI in journalistic film, including allowing for the use of AI to touch up or restore images, but warning that using generative AI to create new material should be done with careful consideration. This future is far — although nobody can agree on how long — from the one that AI boosters have preached is just around the corner, one of endless hyper-personalized entertainment with the click of a button. “Imagine being able to request an AI to generate a movie with specific actors, plot, and location, all customized to your personal preferences. Such a scenario would allow individuals to create their own movies from scratch for personal viewing, completely eliminating the need for actors and the entire industry around filming,” teased one AI industry group. Marvel filmmaker Joe Russo echoed this vision in an interview, positing, “You could walk into your house and save the AI on your streaming platform. ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe’s photoreal avatar. I want it to be a romcom because I’ve had a rough day,’ and it renders a very competent story with dialogue that mimics your voice, and suddenly now you have a romcom starring you that’s 90 minutes long.” It’s certainly possible that the next generation of AI tools makes such a leap that this fantasy could conceivably become a reality. Still, it inevitably begs the question of whether a “very competent” hyper-personalized romcom is what most people want, or will ever want, from the art they consume. That doesn’t mean AI won’t transform the creative industriesHowever dystopian this might sound (not least because, as any woman on the internet is well aware, this technology is being used to make nonconsensual sexual images and videos), we actually already have a decent corollary for it. Just as AI is meant to “democratize” artmaking, the creator industry, which was built on the back of social media, was designed to do the same thing: circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of media by “empowering” individuals to produce their own content and in return, offering them a place where their work might actually get seen. There are clear pros and cons here. While AI is useful in giving emerging creators new tools to make, say, visual and sound effects they might not otherwise have the money or skill to produce, it is equally or perhaps more useful for fraud, in the form of unthinkably enormous amounts of phone scams, deepfakes, and phishing attacks. Ryan Broderick, who often discusses the cultural impact of AI on his newsletter Garbage Day, points out another comparison between social media and generative AI. “My fear is that we’re hurtling really quickly towards a world where rich people can read the words written by humans and people who can’t afford it read words written by machines,” he tells me. Broderick likens it to what’s already happening on the internet in many parts of the world, where the wealthy can afford subscriptions to newspapers and magazines written by professionals while the working classes consume news on social media, where lowest-common-denominator content is often what gets the most attention. Crucially, social media may have disrupted media gatekeepers and given more people to platforms to showcase their art, but it didn’t expand the number of creatives able to make a living doing those things — in many ways it did the opposite. The real winners were and continue to be the owners of these platforms, just as the real winners of AI will be the founders who pitch their products to C-suite executives as replacements for human workers. Anna Ridler’s “Myriad (Tulips),” an installation of thousands of photographs of tulips, which Ridler used as the dataset for later projects. “By choosing to make the dataset an artwork it draws attention to the skill, labour and time that goes into constructing it, whilst also helping to expose the human element in machine learning, usually hidden by algorithmic processes,” she writes. Anna RidlerBecause even if AI can’t create good art without a talented human being telling it what to do, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t pose an existential threat to the people working in creative industries. For the last few years, artists have watched in horror as their work has been stolen and used to train AI models, feeling as though they’re being replaced in real time. “It starts to make you wonder, do I even have any talent if a computer can just mimic me?” said a fiction writer who used the writing AI tool Sudowrite. Young people are reconsidering whether or not to enter artistic fields at all. In an FTC roundtable on generative AI’s impact on creative industries last October, illustrator Steven Zapata said, “The negative market implications of a potential client encountering a freely downloadable AI copycat of us when searching our names online could be devastating to individual careers and our industry as a whole.”Cory Doctorow, known for both his science fiction and tech criticism, argues that, in any discussion of AI art, the crucial question should be: “How do we minimize the likelihood that an artist somewhere gets $1 less because some tech bro somewhere gets $1 more?” How to think about the artistic “threat” of AIEven as we should take seriously the labor implications of AI — not to mention the considerable ethical and environmental effects — Doctorow argues that it’s essential to stop overhyping its capabilities. “In the same way that pretending ‘Facebook advertising is so good that it can brainwash you into QAnon’ is a good way to help Facebook sell ads, the same thing happens when AI salespeople say, ‘I don’t know if you’ve heard my critics, but it turns out I have the most powerful tool ever made, and it’s going to end the planet. Wouldn’t you like me to sell you some of it?’”This is how AI salespeople view art: as commodities to be bought and sold, not as something to do or enjoy. In a 2010 essay on The Social Network, Zadie Smith made the case that the experience of using Facebook was in fact the experience of existing inside Mark Zuckerberg’s mind. Everything was made just so because it suited him: “Blue, because it turns out Zuckerberg is red-green color-blind … Poking, because that’s what shy boys do to girls they are scared to talk to. Preoccupied with personal trivia, because Mark Zuckerberg thinks the exchange of personal trivia is what ‘friendship’ is,” she writes. A DALL-E image generated by the prompt “a portrait of an artist using AI to make beautiful art.” DALL-EWhy should millions (now billions) of people choose to live their lives in this format over any others? Just as we should ask whether using a tool created by a college sophomore preoccupied with control and stoicism is perhaps the best way to connect with our friends, we should also be asking why we should trust AI executives and their supporters to decide anything related to creativity. One of the more asinine things published last year was Marc Andreesen’s “Techno-Optimist Manifesto,” in which the billionaire venture capitalist whined about the supposed lack of cultural power he and people exactly like him wield in comparison to “ivory tower, know-it-all credentialed expert[s].” These ideological enemies, it is relatively safe to infer, are the sorts of people — ethicists, academics, union leaders — who might concern themselves with the well-being of normal people under his particular view of “progress”: free markets, zero regulation, unlimited investment in technological advancement regardless of what these technologies are actually being used to do. A slightly funny element of the “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” is how clearly its author’s interest in art fails to extend beyond an average ninth-grader’s familiarity with literature (references include the “hero’s journey,” Orwell, and Harry Potter); in a list of “patron saints of techno-optimism,” Andreesen names a few dozen people, mostly free-market economists, and a single visual artist: Warhol. On X, a platform run by a different out-of-touch tech billionaire, AI boosters cheer on a world finally rid of human creators, even human beings at all. “This is it. The days of OnlyFans is over,” posted one tech commentator over a video of AI-animated people dancing. “Seems sorta obvious AI will replace the online simp/thot model,” said another. “Cash in on OnlyFans while you can I guess.”In the same way that people who believe human influencers will be replaced by AI simulacra fail to understand what is compelling about influencers, those who believe AI will somehow “replace Hollywood” or the music and publishing industries betray a lack of curiosity about why we consume art in the first place. Try asking Google’s new AI Overview feature why people love art, for instance, and it will tell you that “watching art can release dopamine.” People love great art not for the chemicals it releases but because it challenges us, comforts us, confuses us, probes us, attacks us, excites us, inspires us. Because great art is a miracle, because to witness it is to feel the presence of something like God and the human condition, and to remind us that they are perhaps the same thing. It’s no coincidence that AI has widely been compared to a cult; there is almost a religious zeal to its adherents’ beliefs that one day AI will become omnipotent. But if you look at art and all you see is content, or if you look at a picture of a hot girl and all you see are JPGs in the shape of a sexual object, that’s all you’ll get out of it. People love great art not for the chemicals it releases but because it challenges us, comforts us, confuses us, probes us, attacks us, excites us, inspires us.Doctorow is willing to stipulate that works created by AI generators might one day be considered an art form, in the same way that sampling went from being looked down upon but is now a common and celebrated practice in music. Media theorist Ignas Kalpokas has written that AI art “has a revelatory quality, making visible the layers of the collective unconscious of today’s societies — that is, data patterns — in a way that is in line with the psychoanalytic capacities that [Walter] Benjamin saw in photography and film.” But the more content AI creates, he argues, the more likely that audiences will experience it “in a state of distraction.”The future of art and entertainment could very well be individuals asking their personal AIs to feed them music, movies, or books created with a single prompt and the press of a button, although the point at which this sort of entertainment will be good enough to hold our attention feels much farther out of reach. If there is a day where this becomes the norm, the creative industries would, as they have for more than a century, adapt. “The history of the professional creative industry is competition — TV competing with film competing with radio,” explains Lev Manovich, an AI artist and digital culture theorist. “Maybe [the industry] becomes more about live events, maybe human performance will become even more valuable. If machines can create Hollywood-level media, the industry will have to offer something else. Maybe some people will lose jobs, but then new jobs will be created.”I wondered what, if anything, could entice someone like Clarke, the editor of the science fiction literary magazine, to actually publish AI-generated fiction right now, with the technology as it exists. His answer articulated every qualm that I and many in the creative industries take with the notion that AI can do the same work as an artist. “I am willing to accept an AI story when an AI decides to write a story of its own free will and picks me as the place that it wants to send it to. It’d be no different if an alien showed up on the planet: I wouldn’t say no. At that point, it’s a new life,” he said. “But that’s a science fiction scenario. It’d be kind of neat if I get to see it during my lifetime, but I’m not gonna hold my breath.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Lightroom has always been a powerful tool, but it’s had its limitations. One major challenge has been removing distractions from photos without switching to Photoshop. Adobe's recent update introduces a game-changing feature: the generative AI erase tool. This tool simplifies the process, allowing you to handle more within Lightroom itself.




Coming to you from Matt Kloskowski, this insightful video explains the new generative AI erase tool in Lightroom. This feature is available in Lightroom Classic, Lightroom, and Adobe Camera Raw. It addresses the need for better distraction removal, a task that previously required Photoshop. The update, found in Lightroom Classic version 13.3 and Lightroom version 7.3, leverages AI to remove unwanted elements from your photos efficiently.
Kloskowski shows how the tool works within the familiar healing and clone stamp interface. The AI-based eraser detects objects and offers multiple variations for you to choose from. This flexibility allows for better results, reducing the need to jump between Lightroom and Photoshop. The process is straightforward: paint over the unwanted object, let the AI do its work, and cycle through the generated variations until you find the best fit. If the results aren't perfect, you can refresh and get new options.
One of the key benefits of this tool is its ability to handle larger objects and complex backgrounds. Kloskowski demonstrates its effectiveness with several examples, including removing bright spots and distracting elements that previously required Photoshop. Although the tool isn't flawless and might need some tweaking with cloning or healing tools afterward, it significantly improves the workflow.
Kloskowski also mentions a related feature in Photoshop that allows you to type in prompts for generative AI. This capability, though not yet available in Lightroom, hints at future developments that could further integrate AI into photo editing. For now, the new tool in Lightroom is a significant step forward, making distraction removal faster and more intuitive. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Kloskowski.

","Elon Musk says artificial intelligence will be able to ""do everything better"" than humans by 2025. ",N/A,N/A," Tristan Greene  May 24, 2024  Elon says AI will ‘do everything better than you,’ make employment obsolete  Despite having fathered at least 10 children, Musk also seems to think humans will struggle to find meaning in their lives without employment.  4099  Total views  10  Total shares  Listen to article  2:14  News  Own this piece of crypto history  Collect this article as NFT  Join us on social networks Elon Musk recently doubled down on his predictions that humans would need a “universal high income” in the wake of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven job displacement. — this time claiming that without our jobs, our purpose in life may eventually be to “give AI meaning.”The bleak prognostication from the world’s richest person came during the VivaTech 2024 event in Paris as part of a winding speech wherein Musk made fervent claims that AI would provide all of our goods and services in the future. “My biggest fear is AI,” the mogul said. He also claimed that AI will be better than humans at everything, thus relegating our species to doing our best to support the machines:“The question will really be one of meaning — if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning? I do think there’s perhaps still a role for humans in this, in that we may give AI meaning.”Musk, the father of at least 10 children, said humans might be able to work “as a hobby,” if they chose, but ultimately painted a bleak picture of the future where, according to his previous predictions, AI will supplant us in all endeavors.In related news, Musk’s AI company, dubbed simply xAI, has reportedly secured $6 billion in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tribe Capital at a total valuation of $18 billion. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Musk says that xAI lags behind industry leaders OpenAI and DeepMind but could catch up by the end of 2024:“xAI is a new company so it still has a lot of catching up to do before it has an AI that is competitive with Google Deepmind and OpenAI. Maybe towards the end of the year, we will have that.”This sentiment, combined with his prediction that AI will surpass humans by 2025, indicates that he believes his company will be among those that could potentially create AI capable of human-level cognition.It bears mentioning that Musk’s AI-related predictions haven’t always fared so well. In 2019, he famously promised that Tesla would field 1 million fully autonomous robotaxis on the road by 2020. More recently, he claimed that Tesla would unveil its first robotaxi in August 2024.

Wall Street is investing big in artificial intelligence — and that's good news for machine-learning engineers and other tech talent.Consider JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank by assets. In a recent letter to investors, CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon compared the potential disruption of generative AI to that of electricity, the printing press, the steam engine, the computer, and the internet.

Dimon said the firm is getting ready for the AI revolution with its more than 2,000 machine-learning experts. These workers are tackling a range of AI use cases, such as marketing, fraud, and risk — and looking into how the technology can be used for customer service, operations, and software engineering, he said.""In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows,"" Dimon said, adding that it could potentially reduce some jobs in the company while also creating new ones. Dimon said he expects the technology to eventually ""augment virtually every job"" at the financial powerhouse.

JPMorgan is far from the only bank investing heavily in this technological future by hiring reams of artificial-intelligence experts, including machine-learning engineers and data scientists.Citi's top tech exec recently outlined, in an interview with BI, how the bank's AI roadmap will impact everyone from engineering to operations and wealth. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, has been on an AI hiring tear as the German bank looks to grow its AI employee base to at least 600, Gil Perez, Deutsche's chief innovation officer, previously told BI. AI is also widely expected to eventually take over many of the tedious tasks now ascribed to junior investment bankers, like editing pitch decks and putting logos on PowerPoints, which stands to make the notoriously competitive field even harder to break into.The race to harness AI across corporate America has put a premium on talent with relevant AI skills, which means banks will have to shell out more money to compete for the best talent. Some PE firms are offering pay packages up to $2 million for AI execs to implement the tech at portfolio companies, as Business Insider has previously reported. Top AI product managers, for instance, can snag about $100,000 more than standard engineering managers, recruiters told BI.""We're talking about cream-of-the-crop talent that is seeing a bit of upside to the AI boom,"" said Giancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at recruitment firm Glocomms, referring to the ""inflated range"" for compensation. Hirsch said that investment banks are hiring AI engineers to build in-house tools that they can use ""across their trading, research, and risk-management functions.""

To put Wall Street pay for AI talent in perspective, BI pulled data from the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2023 disclosure data for H1-B and similar visa holders for large investment banks, some of which also have consumer banking divisions, commercial lending divisions, and asset management divisions. The 8 banks reviewed are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, UBS, Citibank, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.We pulled data for roles containing keywords like ""AI,"" ""data science,"" ""machine learning,"" and ""prompt."" We also included any roles tagged with the Department of Labor classification (known as a SOC code) for data scientists. While not every data scientist works directly on artificial intelligence, their work of ensuring integrity across the vast amounts of data these firms collect is an integral part of rolling out advanced machine-learning applications.This data shows the salaries that Wall Street banks expected to pay foreign data scientists and AI workers in 2023, and its disclosure is part of their visa terms. This data does not include signing or performance bonuses or stock-based compensation, but it is the best publicly available data on base pay at these firms, which are known for doling out big bonuses.All of the banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.

Bank of America has been building AI-powered virtual assistants for years, both its Erica assistant for retail banking customers and its back-end product known as Banker Assist. Banker Assist connects disparate sources of data into one centralized location, cutting out hours of research work.The bank is also a leader in AI patents, with Bank of America and Capital One responsible for 2/3rds of all AI patents filed between June 2021 and 2022, according to Evident AI.It sought to fill 11 data-science roles through the visa programs in 2023, with vice president/data scientist I making up five of the roles or nearly half. BI was unable to find open job postings that match the roles below.Assistant Vice President, Data Scientist I: $118,473- $139,464Officer, Data Scientist I: $120,000Senior Vice President, Senior Data Scientist: $194,000Vice President; Data Scientist I: $134,914-$165,000Vice President; Data Scientist II: $155,000

At the start of this year, Barclays and IBM released a report finding that AI will quickly impact worker productivity worldwide compared with technologies like the steam engine, electrification, and personal computers, which took decades to ramp up fully.Barclays Chief Information Officer, Craig Bright, noted that generative AI will increase the firm's fraud-detection capabilities and act as a personal assistant to customer service workers with difficult or specific questions.The company sought to hire 28 data-science and AI workers via the visa program in 2023. The highest-paid worker is a New York-based vice president of data science who was offered $198,000. BI was unable to find comparable salaries for open roles online.Associate Vice President, Systems Analyst, Data Science Projects: $139,000Associate, Data Science Research: $156,500AVP Data Analyst: $140,000AVP Data Product Owner: $140,000AVP Internal Audit Data Management: $150,000AVP US Risk: $140,000Data Analyst: $155,000Data Engineer: $110,000-$120,000Data Metrics Analyst Lead: $125,000Data Scientist: $145,000Enterprise Data Platform Engineer: $120,000IAM DataServices Lead: $155,000Internal Audit Data Analytics AVP: $110,000SAS Senior Analyst: $125,000Securitized Products Modeling Analyst, AVP: $150,000Senior Data Analyst and Programmer: $148,000Senior SAS Analyst: $115,232-$130,000Vice President, Data Science: $170,000-$198,000Vice President, Managing Data Scientist: $109,762-$185,000

Citi's co-chief information officer, Shadman Zafar recently told BI that small and ""boring"" changes brought by AI will create the biggest change. Instead of focusing on one massive project, the firm will use AI in small ways that add up. The firm already has 30,000 software engineers using AI to become more efficient by creating new code and more thoroughly documenting existing code.It also plans to use AI extensively in operational roles, decreasing the rote tasks that these workers need to do. On the customer-facing side, AI will help bankers and advisors complete mechanical tasks and create reports, giving them more time with clients. Eventually, Zafar said the bank will want to use AI to create financial products more quickly when customers want them.Citi had the second-largest request for AI visas, with 52 data science and AI engineers. The company sought 11 data-science lead analysts via visas, the most in the database. The most highly paid role was for a business analytics principal at $200,600. A review of current job postings shows the firm offering similar salaries for similar roles, including an open data science lead analyst role for $163,238.Check out what the bank is paying for different AI roles below.Data Science Group Manager: $175,000Data Science Lead Analyst: $116,000-$167,814Data Science Senior Analyst: $108,645-$141,800Data Science Senior Manager: $142,000-$154,000Business Analytics Group Manager: $192,400-$195,244Business Analytics Principal: $200,600Business Analytics Senior Analyst: $115,000-$120,000Business Risk Officer: $140,000Data Analytics Lead Analyst: $155,000Data Analytics Senior Analyst: $139,000Data Governance Senior Lead Analyst: $178,000Data/Information Management Analyst: $140,000Digital PM Lead Analyst: $175,000Legal Support Senior Group Manager: $155,000Model/Analysis/Validation Officer: $145,000Model/Analysis/Validation Senior Analyst: $98,000-$132,925Operational Risk Officer: $120,175Operational Risk Senior Analyst: $110,000Risk Policy Officer: $163,238Specialized Analytics Lead Analyst: $162,000Specialized Analytics Senior Analyst: $153,525-$163,238

Deutsche Bank has spent the past 18 months aggressively experimenting with AI, the bank's chief innovation officer told BI in September. At the time, the bank had about 300 technologists working on AI projects, a number that Deutsche's chief innovation officer, Gil Perez, predicts will double or triple by the end of this year.Much of Deutsche Bank's early AI work was aimed at automating manual processes in the corporate bank, which serves its institutional clients, financial services firms, and investors. One example was an AI tool that generated client briefings for bankers ahead of client meetings. What used to take a team of junior bankers a day or two to produce can now be created with the touch of a few keystrokes.BI only found three roles with generic investment-banking titles, though they were tagged as data scientists. The firm sought to hire two of each of the roles below for a total of 6 AI hires. It's worth noting that the pay for two vice presidents is higher than the salaries listed on the firm's website for similar roles, which list a pay range of $125,000 to $203,000.Analyst: $95,000-$100,000Associate: $105,000-$120,000Vice President: $250,000

Goldman Sachs' tech chief previously told BI he believes we're at an inflection point with AI, and that the technology's impact is already rippling through the bank. Some of the bank's early use cases include getting non-tech workers to do more with code and automating the annoying task of documenting what code does for engineers.AI is not just changing how Goldman tech employees work, it's also redefining what it takes to be a software engineer. Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer, said it's more important than ever to understand the problem that needs solving and why before coding begins. Taking courses in philosophy and English will help future generations of engineers stand out in the age of AI.Goldman sought to hire 19 data-science workers through the visa program in 2023. The highest paid offer was for a New York-based vice president with a $220,000 salary, while the lowest was for a Utah-based analyst at $57,700. The firm is currently hiring for a New York-based internal audit-embedded data analytics associate-level data role with a salary range of $85,000 to $140,000, roughly comparable to the salary ranges offered for associate-level roles last year.Check out salaries for different roles below. While they carry investment-banking titles like analyst and vice president, their visa paperwork comes with data-science codes.Analyst: $57,700-$100,000Associate: $88,000-$126,000Vice President: $156,000-$220,000

JPMorgan Chase











                                                  Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress/Corbis via Getty Images
                                                


JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the country, is making a play to be the industry's AI leader. The bank had, by far, the most visa worker hires in our study, 237, with Citibank at a distant second with 52 hires. A report by Evident AI ranked the bank at the top of its AI Innovation list for banks, noting that it produced 45% of all AI research produced by banks in 2023. AI research at JPMorgan is led by Manuela Veloso, who leads a team of academics who look at the potential of AI across seven main areas, from data management to employee empowerment.The practical application of AI at JPM is spearheaded by the bank's recently formed Data and Analytics organization. JPMorgan's firmwide chief data and analytics officer, Teresa Heitsenrether, leads that team, which consists of AI, machine learning, and data executives from across the bank. The firm's prodigious hiring of data science and AI roles last year included applications of 37 data science associates and 37 applied AI & machine learning associates. In total, the firm sought to hire 95 employees on a visa with AI in their title with a top salary of $275,000 for a data scientist/executive director position. The lowest salary was $90,000, which is more than $30,000 above the average US salary.Recent job listings show the firm is currently hiring for similar roles at similar salaries. An applied AI/ML lead position comes with a salary range of $147,250 to $260,000, compared to the $163,800 to $235,000 offered to the sixteen vice presidents of applied AI ML leads they sought in 2023.Check out what the bank is paying for different roles below.Associate, AI & Data Science: $125,000-$150,000Associate, AI Research: $140,000-$215,000Associate, Analytics Solutions: $115,000-$150,000Associate, Applied AI & Machine Learning: $124,000-$215,000Associate, Asset Associate II: $109,250Associate, Business Analyst: $90,000-$98,500Associate, CCB Risk Program AI/ML: $140,000Associate, Channel Marketing: $115,000Associate, Data Analyst: $130,000Associate, Data Analytics Analyst: $100,000Associate, Data Domain Architect: $117,500-$120,000Associate, Data Management: $102,000Associate, Data Scientist: $100,000-$180,000Associate, Data Visualization: $125,000Associate, Model Program Risk: $150,000Associate, Modeling Analytics: $120,000Associate, Quant Analytics: $100,000-$135,000Associate, Quant Modeling: $120,000Associate, Quantitative Research: $125,000-$131,000Associate, Software Engineer: $127,700-$145,000Associate, Strategic Analytics: $90,900-$120,000Business Analysis Associate II: $110,000Data Analytics Analyst: $100,000Data Scientist Analyst: $90,000-$102,274Data Scientist: $100,000Executive Director, Applied AI ML Director: $260,000Executive Director, Data Scientist: $260,000-$275,000Executive Director, Product Director: $260,000Executive Director, Quant Analytics: $235,000Quant Analytics Associate: $90,000Senior Associate, AI Research: $175,000-$185,000Senior Associate, Applied AI & Machine Learning: $134,000-$173,720Senior Associate, Data Owner Associate: $145,000Senior Associate, Data Scientist: $110,000-$160,000Senior Data Scientist: $166,000Senior Engineer, Applied AI ML: $170,100Senior Quant Analytics Associate: $107,000Vice President, AI Research Lead: $177,000-$193,800Vice President, Analytics Solutions and Delivery: $142,623Vice President, Applied AI ML Lead Predictive Science: $203,500Vice President, Applied AI ML Lead: $163,800-$235,000Vice President, Applied AI ML: $175,000-$260,000Vice President, Capital Risk Lead: $175,000Vice President, Data Domain Architect: $170,000Vice President, Data Domain Architect: $170,000-$190,000Vice President, Data Management Lead: $175,000Vice President, Data Scientist Lead: $120,000-$190,000Vice President, Data Scientist: $146,000-$190,000Vice President, Database Management Lead: $135,000Vice President, Fraud Risk: $145,000Vice President, Lead Software Engineer: $170,000Vice President, Modeling Analytics: $139,000Vice President, Predictive Science: $137,600Vice President, Product Development (AI/ML): $118,400Vice President, Product Specialist: $135,000Vice President, Project Execution: $155,000Vice President, Quant Analytics Manager: $116,000Vice President, Software Engineer: $214,000Vice President, Strategic Analytics: $135,000

At Morgan Stanley, Jeff McMillan is infusing AI into the daily routine of its 16,000 financial advisors. McMillan is Morgan Stanley's AI leader who assumed the helm in April— a promotion from his post as head of wealth-management tech.Advisors at Morgan Stanley now have access to ""AI@MS Assistant,"" a generative AI chatbot that knows the bank inside and out and can answer questions related to wealth management. The firm is also piloting another generative AI tool, AI@MS Debrief, which can summarize Zoom conversations with clients, generate emails with next steps for clients, and help advisors create newsletters. Looking ahead, McMillan said he plans to build similar AI tools for other bank divisions using the same underlying technology behind AI@MS Assistant.The company sought to hire 15 data science workers through the visa program in 2023, with the highest-paid role for a New York-based vice president at $210,000. BI was unable to find any directly comparable roles on Morgan Stanley's job boards.Check out the salaries below, which carry investment-banking titles but have been tagged as data science jobs.Assistant Vice President: $130,000-$150,000Associate: $112,000-$162,000Manager: $160,000Vice President: $164,000-$210,000

According to a note written by the bank earlier this year, UBS believes that the AI boom is just getting started and will buoy technology stocks for the rest of the decade.""AI could arguably be the tech theme of the decade, as we don't see similar growth profiles elsewhere,"" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in the note.Less has been reported on the bank's internal AI operations. During the company's annual general meeting in April, the first since UBS closed on its deal to acquire Credit Suisse, the only mention of AI came from the chairman of the Credit Suisse Staff Association, who noted that AI could be a challenge to creating sustainable jobs, and urged caution with current restructuring plans.UBS sought to hire 11 data-science workers via the visa program in 2023. The highest-paid role was for a data-science director at $190,000, though another request was issued for the same role at $170,000. BI was unable to find open job listings matching the titles below.Associate Director, Engineer, STAAT Data Science: $170,000Associate Director, Engineer, STAAT Insights: $150,000Associate Director, Senior Data Scientist: $145,000Director, Data Scientist: $142,500-$190,000Employee, Investment Data Scientist: $110,000Executive Director, Fixed Income Algorithmic Trading-Credit: $275,000GWM Quantitative Analytics & Data Science Specialist: $132,000Quantitative Analytics and Data Science Specialist: $105,000

In a recent letter to investors, CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon compared the potential disruption of generative AI to that of electricity, the printing press, the steam engine, the computer, and the internet.Dimon said the firm is getting ready for the AI revolution with its more than 2,000 machine-learning experts. These workers are tackling a range of AI use cases, such as marketing, fraud, and risk — and looking into how the technology can be used for customer service, operations, and software engineering, he said.""In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows,"" Dimon said, adding that it could potentially reduce some jobs in the company while also creating new ones. Dimon said he expects the technology to eventually ""augment virtually every job"" at the financial powerhouse.JPMorgan is far from the only bank investing heavily in this technological future by hiring reams of artificial-intelligence experts, including machine-learning engineers and data scientists.Citi's top tech exec recently outlined, in an interview with BI, how the bank's AI roadmap will impact everyone from engineering to operations and wealth. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, has been on an AI hiring tear as the German bank looks to grow its AI employee base to at least 600, Gil Perez, Deutsche's chief innovation officer, previously told BI. AI is also widely expected to eventually take over many of the tedious tasks now ascribed to junior investment bankers, like editing pitch decks and putting logos on PowerPoints, which stands to make the notoriously competitive field even harder to break into.The race to harness AI across corporate America has put a premium on talent with relevant AI skills, which means banks will have to shell out more money to compete for the best talent. Some PE firms are offering pay packages up to $2 million for AI execs to implement the tech at portfolio companies, as Business Insider has previously reported. Top AI product managers, for instance, can snag about $100,000 more than standard engineering managers, recruiters told BI.""We're talking about cream-of-the-crop talent that is seeing a bit of upside to the AI boom,"" said Giancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at recruitment firm Glocomms, referring to the ""inflated range"" for compensation. Hirsch said that investment banks are hiring AI engineers to build in-house tools that they can use ""across their trading, research, and risk-management functions.""To put Wall Street pay for AI talent in perspective, BI pulled data from the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2023 disclosure data for H1-B and similar visa holders for large investment banks, some of which also have consumer banking divisions, commercial lending divisions, and asset management divisions. The 8 banks reviewed are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, UBS, Citibank, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.We pulled data for roles containing keywords like ""AI,"" ""data science,"" ""machine learning,"" and ""prompt."" We also included any roles tagged with the Department of Labor classification (known as a SOC code) for data scientists. While not every data scientist works directly on artificial intelligence, their work of ensuring integrity across the vast amounts of data these firms collect is an integral part of rolling out advanced machine-learning applications.This data shows the salaries that Wall Street banks expected to pay foreign data scientists and AI workers in 2023, and its disclosure is part of their visa terms. This data does not include signing or performance bonuses or stock-based compensation, but it is the best publicly available data on base pay at these firms, which are known for doling out big bonuses.All of the banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.Check out data-science and AI salaries for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Bank of America, and other investment banks:",,,,,"What Wall Street banks pay tech talent, from the data scientist earning $275,000 to the $120,000 quant-mode...",,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kaja Whitehouse'}"

AI pioneer Yann LeCun kicked off an animated discussion today after telling the next generation of developers not to work on large language models (LLMs). 
“This is in the hands of large companies, there’s nothing you can bring to the table,” Lecun said at VivaTech today in Paris. “You should work on next-gen AI systems that lift the limitations of LLMs.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise






The comments from Meta’s chief AI scientist and NYU professor quickly kicked off a flurry of questions and sparked a conversation on the limitations of today’s LLMs. 
When met with question marks and head-scratching, LeCun (sort of) elaborated on X (formerly Twitter): “I’m working on the next generation AI systems myself, not on LLMs. So technically, I’m telling you ‘compete with me,’ or rather, ‘work on the same thing as me, because that’s the way to go, and the [m]ore the merrier!’”

With no more specific examples offered, many X users questioned what “next-gen AI” means and what might be an alternative to LLMs. 

Developers, data scientists and AI experts offered up a multitude of options on X threads and sub-threads: boundary-driven or discriminative AI, multi-tasking and multi-modality, categorical deep learning, energy-based models, more purposive small language models, niche use cases, custom fine-tuning and training, state-space models and hardware for embodied AI. Some also suggested exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a new breakthrough in neural networking. 

One user bullet-pointed five next-gen AI systems:

Multimodal AI.
Reasoning and general intelligence.
Embodied AI and robotics.
Unsupervised and self-supervised learning.
Artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Another said that “any student should start with the basics,” including: 

Statistics and probability.
Data wrangling, cleaning and transformation.
Classical pattern recognition such as naive Bayes, decision trees, random forest and bagging.
Artificial neural networks. 
Convolutional neural networks.
Recurrent neural networks.
Generative AI.
advertisement

Dissenters, on the other hand, pointed out that now is a perfect time for students and others to work on LLMs because the applications are still “barely tapped.” For instance, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to prompting, jailbreaking and accessibility. 

Others, naturally, pointed to Meta’s own prolific LLM building and suggested that LeCun was subversively trying to stifle competition. 
“When the head of AI at a big company says ‘don’t try and compete, there’s nothing you can bring to the table,’ it makes me want to compete,’” another user drolly commented. 

LLMs will never reach human-level intelligence
A champion of objective-driven AI and open-source systems, Lecun also told the Financial Times this week that LLMs have a limited grasp on logic and will not reach human-level intelligence. 
They “do not understand the physical world, do not have persistent memory, cannot reason in any reasonable definition of the term and cannot plan . . . hierarchically,” he said. 
Meta recently unveiled its Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), which can detect and understand highly detailed object interactions. The architecture is what the company calls the “next step toward Yann LeCun’s vision of advanced machine intelligence (AMI).” 
Many share LeCun’s feelings about LLMs’ setbacks. The X account for AI chat app Faune called LeCun’s comments today an “awesome take,” as closed-loop systems have “massive limitations” when it comes to flexibility. “Whoever creates an AI with a prefrontal cortex and an ability to create information absorption through open-ended self-training will probably win a Nobel prize,” they asserted. 

Others described the industry’s “overt fixation” on LMMs and called them “a dead end in achieving true progress.” Still more noted that LLMs are nothing more than a “connective tissue that groups systems together” quickly and efficiently like telephone switch operators, before passing off to the right AI.


Calling out old rivalries
LeCun has never been one to shrink away from debate, of course. Many may remember the extensive, heated back and forths between him and fellow AI godfathers Geoffrey Hinton, Andrew Ng and Yoshia Bengio over AI’s existential risks (LeCun is in the “it’s overblown” camp). 
At least one industry watcher called back to this drastic clash of opinions, pointing to a recent Geoffrey Hinton interview in which the British computer scientist advised going all-in on LLMs. Hinton has also argued that the AI brain is very close to the human brain. 
“It’s interesting to see the fundamental disagreement here,” the user commented. 
One that’s not likely to reconcile anytime soon.
