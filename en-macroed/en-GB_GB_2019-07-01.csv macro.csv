Nobody waits for the government to do something. It happens automatically,” Ben-Israel told Science|Business. In the country of eight million often referred to as “start-up nation”, reality has kept pace with rhetoric. AI-related investments in Israel are surging: 37 per cent of the total capital raised last year was for AI companies, according to a report from Start-Up Nation Central, which tracks and supports investment deals. Ben-Israel, a long-time figure in Israeli research, is leading the multi-committee work on the government’s AI vision along with another big name, Eviatar Matania, founder and former head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau. Both were chosen for their past roles in making cybersecurity products and services one of Israel’s biggest exports. Ben-Israel was chief cybernetics adviser to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu from 2010-2012, when he launched the national cyber initiative, propelling the country into the top five leaders of the global cyber industry. Today, according to estimates, some 20 per cent of the total global investment in cybersecurity pours into Israeli companies and start-ups.   “We took cybersecurity out into the real world and made it a legitimate pursuit for the economy,” Ben-Israel said. “I started the cyber revolution here, and now with some of my help we are looking to repeat the trick with AI.” Israel’s strength in applying AI to computer vision, which benefits greatly from the country’s huge investment in military equipment, is beginning to extend into a range of different industries. One of the biggest successes is Mobileye Vision Technology, which provides technology for autonomous vehicles. Founded in Jerusalem in 1999, the company develops image processing algorithms to interpret images from conventional cameras, to see traffic. The money raised in its initial public offering in the US in 2014 was the largest ever by an Israeli firm. Three years later, Intel, the world's largest chipmaker and one of Israel’s largest private employers, purchased the company for $15.3 billion. Now, Mobileye aims to start trials of self-driving cars in Israel next year, with hopes of commercialising a robo-taxi service. At the same time, Israel aims to become a world leader in medical applications of AI, with companies developing algorithms that use patient data and lifestyle information to speed up and inform diagnoses. Hospitals are amassing a huge and valuable collection of data. “Everyone has their records registered with four big insurance groups, so it’s quite a centralised system here, unlike in the US,” said Shai Bagon, an AI researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “Everyone is aware of the potential of this data and there is an initiative to try and open it securely.” Growing demand There are some constraints on the growth of AI, however. “We would like to triple the number of AI graduates but many of our professors are going to work in the private sector. So here’s a problem that can’t be solved by the market – it has to be the government,” Ben-Israel said. The answer, he suggests, is to grant researchers more flexibility to work between university and the private sector. “The rule could be that a researcher has to spend 20 per cent of their time at university. It’s not a lot, but if you make them choose between university or industry, they’re going to choose industry.” It is already the case that some researchers share their time between universities and tech companies, like Google and Facebook, which have research hubs in the country. “They are here for the talent, and they bring money,” Ben-Israel says. Israel’s strict immigration laws create additional competition for AI recruits. Opening more positions in computer science departments around the country would help “bring excellent researchers back to Israel”, argues Jonathan Berant, senior lecturer at the Blavatnik School of Computer Science in Tel-Aviv University. “[Our] university would like to hire more faculty but it is hard to fill the positions at this point where demand is very high.” Academics are drawn to the private sector by far higher salaries, but also the opportunity to work with more processing power. “There are types of research that require large amounts of computational resources that are only available in industry,” Berant says. He proposes that universities work out a way to share servers. “[We] can substantially improve the quality of research by distributing resources better and having better IT services,” he said. AI in defence There is no doubt that Israel’s defence establishment helps drive the country’s tech success. However, Ben-Israel prefers not to discuss whether investments by the armed forces and intelligence services in high tech surveillance tools could give Israel an edge in AI. Much of the work undertaken by Israeli defence agencies inevitably remains in the shadows. “This kind of research is not open to the wider AI community,” said Bagon. “They understandably keep their cards close to their chest.” Israeli men and women are required to perform military service after secondary school. Many gain experience in a variety of high technology systems and that leads directly to careers. Tech companies make no secret of their military backgrounds; start-ups’ websites regularly highlight the units in which the founders served. There is some public information on new AI defence systems under development in the country. The Times of Israel has reported that an Israeli armed robotic vehicle called the Guardium has been used on the Gaza border. Another Israeli company, Rafael Advanced Defense System, says on its website that it has developed a bomb that can use autonomous capabilities to navigate and correct its location in environments where the global positioning system has been inactivated. Chinese competition China and the US are seen as head-to-head in competing for AI leadership, but Ben-Israel suggests that Chinese strengths in the field have been over-promoted. “There’s no difference between brains, it’s the conditions of the ecosystem and culture,” he said. “You have Chinese Nobel Laureates, for instance, but more often than not they did not win for research carried out in China.” “Harmony is one of the main values in China, so people don’t try and differentiate themselves from others. You don’t go into the streets with pink hair. Obedience to certain rules in society is too important,” Ben-Israel said. “As long as they have these values, it’s very difficult to see how they will grow to become a large innovative country. The same [deference] to authority didn’t work out in the Soviet Union,” he says. Israel doesn’t have it all figured out either. Start-ups there, like in Europe, face challenges in scaling up to become bigger, sustainable businesses; many promising companies leave to find bigger markets in the US. Thousands of start-ups are being developed in incubators, but the country has only a handful of so-called unicorns, or start-ups valued at over $1 billion. The success rate for new businesses in Israel is low at 5 per cent. It’s not hurting motivation, though. “In Israel, we have five new start-ups per day; or 1,500 a year with maybe 200 surviving,” said Ben-Israel. “What makes us good in science and business is that we’re not ashamed to fail, or too timid to tell people how to do things differently and better.”",N/A,N/A,"

Tel Aviv, Israel - The Israeli government is developing a national strategy to make the country a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), and according to one researcher involved in drawing up the plan, the starting point could hardly be better. 
“There’s not much that needs to be done, in fact; the government has to send a signal, that’s all,” said Isaac Ben-Israel, a former Israeli defence force major general who, among many other titles, is head of the Security Studies programme in Tel Aviv University.

The 2ACI function has been assessed in combat-like conditions, associated to the turret sights of a French Army AMX10RCR tank.
MBDA, along with its industry and French Government partners, have been awarded the prestigious Ingénieur général Chanson prize for their work combining artificial intelligence (AI) and massively parallel processing to develop new real-time target Detection, Recognition and Identification (DRI) technology.
 
The Association de l’Armement Terrestre (AAT) has presented this year’s award (the 46th) to the 2ACI (Acquisition Automatique de Cibles par Imagerie – automatic target recognition by imaging) programme team, which was made up of employees of MBDA and Kalray and staff from the French defence procurement agency (Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA)) and the French Army’s technical section (Section Technique de l’Armée de Terre). The award was presented by Stéphane Mayer, president of the Groupement des industries françaises de défense et de sécurité terrestres et aéroterrestres (GICAT).
The 2ACI programme has produced technology based on Artificial Intelligence (algorithms and image data bases for deep learning) that enables automatic target recognition by imaging. The 2ACI function thereby allows the detection, recognition and identification of fixed and moving targets through real-time processing of the video stream output from weapon systems imaging sensors. The technology therefore meets a common functional need across the different services of the French armed forces both for active surveillance and for early warning and engagement of threats. It provides a substantial aid to the human operators, giving them more time to confirm a target identification while reducing the overall reaction time of the system.
The work of this programme has resulted in the production of two demonstrators. The first was installed on a heavy armoured vehicle and was evaluated in operational conditions on a DGA-Techniques Terrestres (DGA land techniques) test site. The second was delivered to DGA-Maîtrise de l’Information (DGA information management) for a laboratory evaluation.
Those demonstrators have proved the operational efficiency of the 2ACI function and that it could be integrated in due course to the French Army combat system Scorpion, as well as to the MMP firing unit.
This technology programme has been conducted by MBDA together with the French start-up Kalray – a pioneer of processors for new intelligent systems. It also illustrates the sovereignty strategy established by MBDA within its Open Innovation framework, which aims to reinforce its links with French and European partners.
The DGA has contributed its technical expertise and the Section Technique de l’Armée de Terre its experience operational needs
 
 


Le démonstrateur 2ACI a été intégré à la tourelle d’un char AMX10RCR, pour vérifier l’aide qu’il apporte à un opérateur humain placé en conditions proches du combat.
L’Association de l’Armement Terrestre récompense l’équipe ayant mis au point une fonction temps réel de Détection, Reconnaissance et Identification de cibles, faisant appel à l’intelligence artificielle et au traitement de données massivement parallèle.
 
Ce 3 Juillet, le 46ème prix Ingénieur Général Chanson a été décerné par l’Association de l’Armement Terrestre (AAT) à l’équipe du projet « Acquisition Automatique de Cible par Imagerie » (2ACI), composée des industriels MBDA et Kalray, ainsi que de la Direction générale de l’armement (DGA) et la Section Technique de l’Armée de Terre (STAT). Il a été remis par Stéphane Mayer, président du Groupement des industries françaises de défense et de sécurité terrestres et aéroterrestres (GICAT).
Dans le cadre de ce projet de S&T (Sciences et Technologie) piloté par la DGA, MBDA a développé des outils et capacités d’acquisition automatique de cible par imagerie, faisant appel à l’intelligence artificielle (chaînes algorithmiques et base de données d’apprentissage). La fonction 2ACI permet ainsi de détecter, reconnaitre et identifier en temps réel des cibles terrestres, fixes ou mobiles, via un traitement d’images en temps réel réalisé sur les flux vidéo issus des viseurs de systèmes d’armes. Le projet 2ACI répond ainsi à un besoin fonctionnel commun aux différentes armées françaises, tant au niveau de la veille active à distance de sécurité que de l’anticipation et de l’engagement des menaces. Il apporte une aide significative à l’opérateur en lui ménageant du temps pour confirmer l’identification de la cible, tout en réduisant le temps global de réaction.
Les travaux 2ACI ont conduit à la réalisation de deux démonstrateurs. Le premier a été intégré sur blindé lourd et a été évalué en conditions opérationnelles sur un site du centre d’expertise et d’essais de DGA Techniques Terrestres (DGA TT). Le second a été livré au centre de DGA Maîtrise de l’Information (DGA MI) pour une évaluation en laboratoire.  Ces travaux ont démontré l’efficacité opérationnelle de la fonction 2ACI, qui pourrait à terme être intégrée au système SCORPION ou au poste de tir MMP
MBDA a réalisé ce projet d’innovation planifiée en collaboration avec la PME française Kalray, pionnier des processeurs pour les nouveaux systèmes intelligents qui a bénéficié par ailleurs du fonds d’investissement en capital dans les PME de défense Def’invest, mis en œuvre conjointement avec Bpifrance. Ce programme s’inscrit également dans la stratégie de souveraineté mise en place par MBDA dans le cadre de l’Open Innovation, en renforçant ses liens avec des partenaires français et européens.
La DGA a apporté son expertise technique et la STAT son expertise des besoins opérationnels.

Roberts’ new book Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media.Below is a lightly edited excerpt of Roberts and Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel’s discussion about why artificial intelligence is not the solution to the content moderation problem. You can hear this and more in the latest episode of The Vergecast. My colleague and Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton says to me, “If you live in a world where your dream is to replace human beings with math, then of course you’re going to treat the human beings poorly.” AI is designed to take the place of people. That’s why these content moderators are contractors. Have you encountered this sort of AI vision of content moderation? Have you seen attempts to build it? Do you think it works? First off, it’s a fundamental cultural and political orientation to work. There is an inherent belief that those systems are somehow less biased, that they can scale better, and they’re just somehow preferable. I would argue that there’s a lot that goes unsaid in such an attitude. Here are some things that algorithms don’t do: they don’t form a union, they don’t agitate for better working conditions, they don’t leak stories to journalists and academics. So we have to be very critical about that notion. But yes, since 2010, as I looked at the work life and the behavior of moderators on the job and what they were being asked to do, it was very clear to me that the processes they undertook were binary decision trees. If then, if this is present, then do this. If this is not present in an adequate amount, then leave and go to line 20. And that’s an algorithm kind of thinking that not only is endemic to the culture but also would go very easily toward building a computational system tool that could replicate. So one of the things that I’ve been seeing as a trend more recently is the fact that there are entirely new pockets of what I consider to be commercial content moderation work that have opened up that may go by another name. And now what we see is a bunch of humans whose full-time job is, rather than to deal with live content on a system, is to train datasets for machine learning tools so that their decisions on a particular piece of content or a set of prescreened images are then captured and put back into a computational system with the hope of using that to replicate. And then, ultimately, replace the humans. That said, if you talk to actual industry insiders who will speak candidly and who are actually working directly in this area, they will tell you that there is no time that they can envision taking humans entirely out of this loop. And I believe that to be true. If for no other reason than what I just described, we need human intelligence to train the machines right. And people are always going to try to defeat the algorithm. They’re going to try to defeat it. They’re going to try to game it. We can’t possibly imagine all the scenarios that will come online. And of course, those decisions need to be vetted at various points along the decision-making chain. At best, what we’ll have and what we’ll continue to have is a hybrid. But over the past few years, all I’ve seen is an increase in hiring not a decrease.

Because innovation never ends and you can only be successful if you make the organization itself more innovative instead of hiring people to “do” innovation for you. If you’d like to know about this mindset, check out my last article.
In a recent interview, our CFO Lutz Meschke pointed out one of Porsche’s big challenges when it comes to being more innovative: “Our corporate culture has been shaped by the field of engineering, and we are very good at continually optimizing things further. But that can only continue for a few more years.”
Assessing our skills: Next Level Engineer Thinking
I absolutely agree with this and I want to put those words in perspective, using the Innovation Ambition Matrix, a simple modification of a strategy framework called Ansoff-Matrix. Internally, we use this instrument quite a lot to explain the different challenges of innovation and it really helps to structure this broad topic.
Basically, the Innovation Ambition Matrix looks at markets and products. The core innovations mentioned in the matrix as horizon 1 are the incremental changes made to existing products for our existing clients. Whereas the transformational innovations in horizon 3 mean “new to the world” products we present to different markets and target groups. In-between are the adjacent innovations in horizon 2 that include products and services that are new to business for the company but have been seen before in the market.











The challenge is, though, that the ways to approach those horizons differ fundamentally:
Horizon 1: Know your products and your clients
In core innovation projects, Porsche is very successful due to operational efficiency and incremental improvements. We know our products, our clients and we know how to assess if a project is worth being followed — probably using simple Return on Investment (ROI) metrics. However, since products and services developed here are deeply connected with our core business, their complexity is higher than in other horizons.
Horizon 2: Old shoes in new markets
Broaching the adjacent innovations, we take something we are already good at and use this to target something new. In this case, we can keep uncertainty low and predict ROI. The Taycan is a good example for that approach — we developed it following our long experience in sports car manufacturing, but it will be the first fully electric Porsche coming to market this fall. Therefore, it might sell to an entirely new customer group we currently do not serve with our established product portfolio.
Horizon 3: Transformational innovation
Transformational innovation initiatives are the king of business development. They include developing a product for a market that does not yet exist — no certainty or prediction possible. Transformational innovations probably take capabilities we haven’t even developed yet. The only way to get these capabilities: test and experiment fast and often, understand the relevant questions you need to answer for the product to excel. Only by gaining feedback directly from our customers we can understand and continuously improve our work, products, and services. The good thing within this horizon is that it does not interfere with the running business, thus — despite the uncertainty — the complexity is not that high.
How to balance total innovation
Porsche, like other corporates, has to be able to pursue different tracks of innovation — all at the same time. Rather than bringing forward stand-alone innovation initiatives which compete for funds, time, and attention with one another, Porsche has to implement a holistic innovation approach to be successful in the future. For Porsche, that means establishing a balance between our core, adjacent, and transformational innovation initiatives.
Now, this is the tricky part. To produce cars quickly, in high quality and with a high margin, Porsche has to work like clockwork. What does that mean? Not only a rather linear mindset, but also little time to educate ourselves in new work methods and to take part in innovative projects — apart from the daily business.
So, how can we buy us more time in order to meet the requirements of the different horizons?
AI: Transforming Finance & IT
That’s where AI comes into play. When most people think about Artificial Intelligence (AI), they probably think about self-driving cars, robots from Boston Dynamics or similar things. When we at the Porsche Finance & IT department think about AI, we fiddle about how to improve standard processes in order to preserve our precious human resources.
Wouldn’t it be nice if a machine could take over those repetitive tasks? If we could win time to work on the exciting stuff? Intelligent technology will give us the so badly needed free time. Time that we can invest in the preparation for the future, interesting experiments, and great new products — reaching out from horizon 1 to 3.
As a McKinsey study about the effects of AI in Finance states, the technology can fully automate 42 percent of finance activities and mostly automate a further 19 percent — this includes robotic process automation (RPA), even though that is not a very intelligent technology. If we could really enhance our processes to such an extent, we would free up our most valuable resources — our employees — in order to teach and train them to tackle the challenges to come.
Learning what AI can and cannot do
Interestingly, Artificial Intelligence is not only a tool to support Porsche’s employees, but it is also a great example of how the company itself is already learning and transforming. In 2017 and 2018, our innovation department tested AI in various pilot projects, experimenting with all three innovation horizons to understand what the technology can and cannot do. In those two years, we learned valuable lessons, especially which questions to ask in order to make AI scalable and to understand which capabilities are needed.
Not very surprisingly, it became quite obvious: Artificial Intelligence can do a lot. So, it is not without reason that our CIO Matthias Ulbrich made AI one of the main pillars of Porsche’s IT strategy. As one key technology, it can e.g. help us to balance our different tracks of innovation at Porsche. With the help of intelligent technology, we can enhance our core initiatives, empower operations in the adjacent horizon and create the right conditions for transformational innovations. Besides that, AI also poses its own challenges — not only on the technological side but especially in terms of organization and culture. At Porsche, our AI@Porsche initiative gathers all the activities around AI at Porsche as part of our digitization strategy — such as the AI Monday that we now brought to Stuttgart. We need to address all those different levels to fully leverage the potential of AI. I am looking forward to contributing to this process with my work in the Finance and IT department!

Now, the firm prepares to launch it officially for consumers across the world to purchase from this month, if they have a spare 400 bucks (£340) that is.
So, is this pricey toothbrush really as smart as they say it is? Well, Oral-B claims what makes this AI-powered oral scrubber so advanced is that it's been trained via thousands of volunteers to assess different brushing styles and detect how it's used in the mouth to give pointers on improving how your brush your teeth.









Oral-B's Genius X AI toothbrush launches on 18 July
Oral-B





The firm says this is important because 80% of people miss areas of their mouth when brushing their teeth, which if not improved, could lead to serious future dental issues. When it was unveiled, Oral-B said its AI toothbrush would be smart enough to track where you are actually brushing (or not brushing enough) in your mouth and generate personalized feedback via a connected app to show you how to achieve better results.
PROMOTED
But does your toothbrush really need to be loaded with AI, and does it even work? I have been trying the device ahead of its launch to find out.
Hands-on review: Setup









Choosing the color of your LED-lit handle
Lee Bell





Upon first unwrapping the Genius X, you'll want to download the Oral-B app, which syncs with the toothbrush and gives you all the feedback when it comes to improving your, erm, stroke.
Once the app is downloaded and it finds the Genius X via Bluetooth (and chosen your preferred LED-lit handle color), simply brush as you usually would, twice a day, and all your data will be synced on your connected device.
Hands-on review: Daily use








Applying too much pressure
Lee Bell





You can choose to have the app open while brushing, or simply sync all the data every couple of days or so and look at your feedback retrospectively. The former is recommended as real-time training is better for understanding where you are going wrong when brushing. Here you can also choose from your six brushing modes to find one that best suits your oral care needs. These range from whitening to sensitivity preferences.
While brushing, you can use the in-built two-minute timer to ensure you brush for the length your dentist recommends. What I found to be super clever was a red pressure sensor will light up within the app on the area of your teeth you're brushing to tell you when you’re brushing too hard. The LED in the handle will do the same in case you're not using the app.








Obviously, I didn't brush my teeth all so well, according to the app
Lee Bell





It's this feature that makes use of the Artificial Intelligence to track where you are brushing in your mouth, and any spots you’ve missed too, and afterward, view your personalized feedback and ""brushing score.""
Hands-on review: post-brushing
Once brushing is done, it's time to check your score. The app will score you out of 100% taking account of how long you brush for, whether you press too hard and how effective your overall brushing coverage is. It can tell you exactly how long you were applying too much pressure for and where, as well as the repercussions of this. It will also ask you if your gum bled during brushing, and give appropriate feedback to tackle that in the future, if so.








The app will ask if your gums bled during brushing
Lee Bell





Over time, you can work to improve your score so you can achieve your best oral care results on a daily basis, which is very useful.
Hands-on review: Verdict
Okay, so it doesn't come cheap. But like they say: you can't put a price on health, and in this case, that's oral health. I was quite taken aback at how accurately the Oral-B app knew where exactly the Genius X toothbrush was in my mouth at any given moment while brushing, and how it was quickly able to tell me that I was pressing too hard in certain areas. The use of AI here, I think, is pretty unique and does seem to work really well. It's also all very intuitive and easy to use.
So to answer my own question, I think AI can be needed in a toothbrush, especially if it improves the way you brush your teeth as well as your oral health in general.








My brushing score - not so great
Lee Bell





Check back in a couple of weeks to see how the Genius X fares longer term and if I've managed to improve my brushing score thanks to the built-in AI.
In terms of availability, the Genius X can be bought now on Amazon with an eye-watering RRP of £340 ($430). It's available in two colors; a smart black (as pictured above) or metallic rose gold design. The new smart brush also features a travel case that charges both the brush and a USB device, such as a smartphone, to make traveling a little less stressful.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Lee BellMy journalism career kick-started in the technology industry at The INQUIRER in 2012, where I soon found my voice in the innovations space, focusing... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Comments Off on Artificial Intelligence: Working Hand in Hand with Hotel Staff




 


New technologies often turn out to be complements, not substitutes, to the old technologies (and even manual processes) they are envisaged to replace. A new technology may simply be better suited to serving a different user need and in a different situation.By Jeff Zabin, Managing Editor - 7.1.2019



















Artificial intelligence has been disrupting and transforming various industry sectors for years. While the hospitality industry as a whole may not have been at the forefront of AI-enabled technology adoption, hotel operators are now paying close attention to the potential benefits as well as the potential threats that AI may present to them.
In many cases, as discussed, they are investing significant resources in AI-related technologies, particularly ones that allow them to take advantage of the evolution in guest experience management. At the same time, they are seeking to understand the potential impact of artificial intelligence on front desk personnel, customer service reps, concierge and other guest-facing hotel staff positions and support resources.
For most hoteliers, regardless of the size or type of property they operate, it seems clear that, sooner or later, they will need to embrace the fusion of AI-enabled speaker systems and personal assistants, IoT advanced in-room controls, consolidated service devices and even robots that might appear to be straight out of Star Wars to transform their properties and redefine their guest service standards.
The financial benefits are obvious. In fact, according to research conducted by Starfleet Research in partnership with Oracle Hospitality, 89 percentage of hoteliers agree that AI significantly reduces operating costs in the customer support function. By integrating artificial intelligence to redefine the meaning of an exceptional customer experience, hotels also have the opportunity to increase positive brand awareness and increase customer loyalty, which should translate into tangible revenue gains.

An important question for hoteliers to ask as they embark on this journey is: To what extent will the migration from humans to machines redefine, or even possibly eliminate, existing jobs? Can humans and machines work together in a way that is complementary and benefits both hotel staff and hotel guests?
The answer, in most cases, would appear to be a resounding “yes.” In fact, according to the research, 86% of hoteliers agree that AI actually improves employee satisfaction. It does this, in part, by handling mundane tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, freeing employees to focus on higher-value, high-touch tasks and by enhancing their knowledge and performance.
To that point, one should keep in mind that new technologies often turn out to be complements, not substitutes, to the old technologies (and even manual processes) it is envisaged to replace. A new technology may simply be better suited to serving a different user need and in a different situation.
Guests who prefer to interact with real humans in some situations may be perfectly content to interact with AI-enabled technologies in other situations. With artificial intelligence, hotels are better able to handle guest inquiries and provide support in a far more efficient and effective manner, reducing strain on employees while improving guest satisfaction in the process, and in a way that complements and enhances existing processes.
At a growing number major hotel groups, artificial intelligence is already reducing the workload of human customer support reps by orders of magnitude. Until recently, the team at one major hotel group was struggling to keep up with the tens of thousands of support tickets it received each year. Its multiple support systems were running at full capacity. Responses to guest inquiries were often delayed or incomplete, putting the company’s reputation at risk. To meet its capacity demands, the company implemented AI-enabled virtual assistants with natural language integration and self-learning capabilities that could provide guests with a conversational support experience.
Integrated with the hotel’s case management tools, the technology has the ability to adapt over time. It can get up to speed on the customer support processes quickly while feeding back information that continues to help improve the guest experience with each interaction and support engagement.
To date, the technology has accelerated call resolution times in a large number of tasks, reportedly reducing contact time by more than four minutes per interaction and with upwards of 85 percent accuracy on received queries for many tasks. This has gone a long way toward taking the pressure off of the human support personnel, who are now free to focus on higher-value tasks, while improving the guest experience on a mass scale.

The complementary nature of AI is such that it can also enhance the knowledge, performance and speed of human customer service reps. Some hotel groups are experimenting with an AI-enabled voice-controlled speaker to listen in on sales reps conversations with prospective guests. If the rep fumbles on a response, the technology comes to the rescue.
Some companies are using AI bots to suggest responses to guest queries which a human agent can then approve or adapt before sending. In some cases, this approach has doubled the number of text-based inquiries a hotel can handle without increasing the number of reps on its payroll.
At one hotel group, the bots are now able to handle upwards of 2 million queries a day, a workload equivalent to around 7,000 human staff. By offering a virtual concierge that automatically answers guests’ queries by text, it has reduced calls to the human concierge desk by 30 percent.
Technology adoption requires an internal culture change. Employees need to understand the benefits of artificial intelligence and how it can enhance not only the guest experience but also improve their own employee experience. They need to overcome any fears, particularly as they relate to job security, and see how AI allows their jobs to fit into higher-level roles.
AI-enabled technology needs to be made a part of the overall business strategy. Employees need to be included in the strategy and understand how they can work together with the technology to their own advantage as well as to the advantage of the organization as a whole.

This is based on research conducted for UNDP Innovation Unit Africa.For the purpose of this article, the Global South refers to countries in Africa, Latin America, and developing Asia including the Middle East.1 Current LandscapeTo date almost all of research work has been focused on the implications of frontier technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, automation and Internet of Things (IoT) for people living in higher income countries such as the EU, UK and US. The focus of this article is to identify key examples on the impact of artificial intelligence as a frontier technology on citizen engagement in low and middle-income countries for whom many of the same opportunities and risks apply as in the higher-income courtiers (often to a greater extent), along with additional opportunities and risks unique to these countries.Fig.1 shows a map of Global South (red) and highlights the current AI uptake situation. The mapping exercise for the region identified over 50 artificial intelligence applications for citizen engagement across the three continents. These applications ranged from traditional chatbots to advanced robotics and machine learning processes.According to PWC (2017), China stands to see the biggest economic gains with AI enhancing GDP by 14.5% in the coming years but it notes that most of the other developing countries will experience more modest increases due to the much lower rates of adoption of AI technologies expected. China’s State Council has recently issued guidelines on AI development wherein it is aiming to become a global innovation centre in the field by 2030, with an estimated total output value of the AI industry projected at $147 billion. China Artificial Intelligence Industry Innovation Alliance (CAIIIA) was set up in 2017. The newly formed alliance set a target to incubate 50 AI-enabled products and 40 firms, launch 20 pilot projects, and set up a technology platform in the next three years. Singapore recently announced plans to invest over $100 million in AI over the next five years. Measured by patents filed, from 2010–14, China was second submitting 8,410 AI applications. During this period, Japan and Republic of Korea submitted 2,071 and 1,533 respectively. India was also among the top 10 countries globally in terms of numbers of patents submitted. In addition, China and India are among the top 10 countries in terms of the number of AI companies (ESCAP, 2017).There are plenty of instances where AI is being used to improve delivery of public services and public goods in low and middle-income countries, ranging from pilot projects to larger scale roll out. AI seems particularly fit for simplifying transactions on government websites. AI has also been deployed as a response to public health concerns, such as to anticipate outbreaks of diseases such as Zika and dengue fever. For example, the Brazilian NGO Viva Rio partnered with start-up AIME (Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology) which analyses existing local government datasets in combination with satellite image recognition systems to deploy low cost predictions of where we should expect greater incidence of disease in an upcoming three-month period. Notably, the technology was designed to work in Malaysia, but it had success rates of 84% diagnosis in Brazilian trials. Following its low-cost success in Brazil, AIME has been deployed in Dominican Republic.In other cases, AI has been used to improve police coverage, such as in dealing with transit issues. In Uganda, AI is used to advise individuals or emergency vehicles on optimal routes, dynamically redeploying a limited number of traffic police officials, and analysing possible reconfigurations of the road network to remove bottlenecks. In other cases, it has been used for environmental ends. In Kenya, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) supports the use of an AI device with drones. After nine months, over a dozen hunters had been apprehended in the Maasai Mara. WWF has received a $5 million grant from Google.org to employ this AI-powered device to protect wildlife. AI has also been used for agricultural matters, including identifying crop disease with a smartphone. Mcrops, developed in Uganda, is a diagnostic tool for diagnosing viral crop diseases in cassava plants. Sick plants are flagged in real time, which allows farmers to take action and stop the spread of the disease. In Nigeria, AI is being employed to help farmers sell their produce and buy services via a bot platform that relies on SMS and other channels such as USSD, Slack, etc.AI has also been used to prevent and predict natural disasters. The Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre has an on-going project with Togo’s Nangbéto Dam, which frequently overspills, causing great disruption to the livelihoods of people living downstream. In the past models were poor at predicting the likelihood of overspill but using a combination of crowdsourced information (including by mobile phone) and AI techniques, an improved model of overspill prediction was developed. Also, the Netherlands Red Cross’ data initiative has developed models using data from previous natural catastrophes to allow better resource management and prioritization of aid. It was employed after Typhoon Haima in the Philippines in 2016 and proven to be accurate after a comparison with data on damaged property.AI-based automated translation and voice recognition systems are also emerging which can have significant impact in countries with multiple languages. This is the case for numerous low and middle-income countries, including India, Indonesia and Nigeria. These systems could also have an impact in places with high levels of illiteracy, allowing people to engage with the government or public service provision interfaces by spoken rather than by written means. This would particularly benefit marginalised groups who experience disproportionate rates of illiteracy. Some of the examples of automated translation and voice recognition systems include ‘Translator Gator’ developed by Pulse Lab Jakarta (Indonesia) to invites people to create taxonomies, or collections of keywords, in lesser-known languages and dialects, and ‘Conversations as a Platform’ developed by Microsoft and Government of Singapore to represent a fundamental shift where the power of human language will be used to make chatbots more anticipatory, accessible, engaging and inclusive for citizens and constituents.Some case studies are discussed in detail in the next section. For each case study, information about geographical coverage and scale of operation is provided.1.1 Case Studies1.1.1 AsiaAI for Parliament in Japan (Japan, Asia; Scale: Pilot)The Japanese Government is trialing artificial intelligence to help officials draft responses submitted to the parliament. The tech would help officials draft responses used in policy-making, by mining past opinions on policy issues and alternative suggestions voiced out by officials during parliament. The government will first feed five years’ worth of parliament agenda summaries to the system before it churns out responses.Based on trial results, Tokyo will then expand the use of AI in other branches of government. The government has launched a broad plan to use AI and robotics across public services. Called “Society 5.0”, the government envisions using science and technology [to] play even more key roles in tackling challenges like ageing, sluggish productivity growth and enhancing [the] wellbeing of humans.Singapore’s Dengue Risk Map (Singapore, Asia; Scale: Operational)As a tropical country, Singapore faces seasonal bouts of dengue cases, peaking in the warmer months of June to October. The country’s main strategy is to carry out preventive surveillance of dengue hotspots. However, this is labour-intensive, and drains an already limited pool of skilled vector control officers. So, the Government decided to use data to identify the areas most at risk of dengue — and help the agency deploy officers more effectively.The team used a machine-learning model to create a colour-coded risk map. The model analyses data from various agencies to rank the overall risk of dengue across the entire country. These data include past dengue cases from the Ministry of Health; population estimates from Singstat; vegetation indices from the Centre for Remote Imaging Sensing & Processing at the National University of Singapore; public transport information from Future City Lab ETH-NUS; and mosquito population data from NEA’s surveillance programme.The risk map also enables targeted publicity campaigns — for example, placing advertisements about dengue prevention at bus stops in high-risk towns. The project won Best Use of Data at the GovInsider Innovation Awards, held at Innovation Labs World in 2017.mAadhaar app (India, Asia; Scale: Operational)The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has launched the mAadhaar app, which allows users to carry digital versions of their identification profiles on their phones. Users of the app may download their Aadhaar number profiles on their smartphones and will therefore not need to carry the physical cards with them, The Economic Times reported. The Aadhaar number is a 12-digit random identification number issued by the UIDAI to Indian citizens, which is linked to basic demographic information such as name and date of birth, and biometric information such as fingerprints and iris scans. These data are stored in a centralised biometric ID database. The Aadhaar system has over 1.1 billion citizens enrolled, and is saving current administration about US$2 billion a year.In November 2017, The Ministry of Commerce and Industry in India has set up a Task force on Artificial Intelligence to kick-start the use of AI for India’s economic transformation.SAAD (Dubai) (United Arab Emirates, Asia; Scale: Operational)The city’s first government service utilising artificial intelligence, powered by IBM Watson. It was aimed at allowing entrepreneurs and investors to ask questions related to setting up a business in Dubai, and to get real-time responses on various topics, including business licensing requirements and registration processes. “Saad” is designed to understand natural language and ingest and comprehend massive amounts of data, learn and reason from its interactions, and provide responses that will aid users in deciding on correct courses of action.VAMPIRE tool (Indonesia, Asia; Scale: Operational)Indonesia is under threat of food insecurity and undernutrition, and faces “alarmingly high” stunting levels. Pulse Lab Jakarta joined forces with the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation to develop a platform that identifies affected communities in need of help. The VAMPIRE visualisation tool combines data in several layers: users can view where food-insecure and agriculture-dependant communities live; data on rainfall anomalies and vegetation health; and crowdsourced prices of staple foods in these areas. VAMPIRE, which is installed in the President’s situation room, is “an early warning system” for authorities to manage food security and better allocate resources. Following VAMPIRE’s success in Indonesia, WFP is now in discussions with the Sri Lankan government to have it installed there too.Bindez (Myanmar, Asia; Scale: Operational)Bindez emerged out of a challenge that has faced many countries coming online in the last few decades: how to make their countries languages talk with computers. Bindez is an acronym for Burmese Index, a project that started as a local language search engine by 2 Burmese techies Yewint Ko and Htet Will in mid-2013, shortly after the country had opened up to new technology, and content consumption needs became evident. It now uses natural language processing and text analysis to track online hate speech.1.1.2 AfricaSustainability and Artificial Intelligence Lab (Africa; Scale: Operational)The Lab is combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty. Using the final model that has been trained on survey data, it can estimate per capita consumption expenditure for any location where we have daytime satellite imagery. The Lab is commissioned by Stanford’s Global Development and Poverty Initiative and partially supported by the National Science Foundation.Robotic Pharmacists for HIV Patients (South Africa, Africa; Scale: Pilot)Robotic pharmacists are dispensing drugs to people with HIV on the streets of South Africa. The country has the highest number of people living with HIV — 7 million. However, 3.3 million people are not on drugs they should be, according to South Africa’s Department of Health. In the past, the antiretroviral drugs have been available only via expensive and private care.The robots will not reveal patient identity helping to remove any social stigma associated with the disease. It will also dispense medicines also for other patients with chronic diseases like TB. With the robot dispenser, patients may no longer need to wait for hours at hospitals or clinics to get their monthly dose. The pilot is run by the Right to Care project in Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg funded by the Department of Health and non-profit The Global Fund.Similar Initiative: Nigerian startup Aajoh uses artificial intelligence to help individuals that send a list of their symptoms via text, audio and photographs, to diagnose their medical condition.1.1.3 Central and South AmericaRosie (Brazil, S. America; Scale: Operational)In Brazil, a group of data-analysis experts has used artificial intelligence techniques to monitor public officials. They focused on limiting fraud among members of congress seeking reimbursements for their travel and food expenses; after getting crowdfunding for the startup costs, they created Rosie, an Artificial Intelligence robot that analyzes the reimbursement requests of lawmakers and calculates the probability that they are justified. To no one’s surprise, Rosie found that the deputies often cheated.Similar Initiative: The Serious Fraud Office in the UK developed a robot with help of AI startup RAVN which then helped the government’s law enforcement arm sift, index and summarise 30 million documents relating to fraud investigations.CitymisVis (Argentina, S. America; Scale: Operational)An interactive tool developed by Government of Argentina in collaboration with Microsoft Latin America that allows citizens to report and track problems from poor street infrastructure to deficient urban sanitation. Through this tool, municipalities listen and respond to requests and complaints from the citizens. As a result of the successful adoption of Citymis Community in several municipalities, large amounts of data are daily generated, which require analysis by the corresponding service departments. The intelligent analysis of citizen requests and complaints can lead to improved levels of service coordination and can help in the decision-making process by relevant authorities.Minecraft (Mexico, C. America; Scale: Operational)A United Nations initiative is using the computer game Minecraft to help citizens design public spaces in more than 25 developing countries including Mexico. Called Block by Block, the UN project turned the game into a ‘community participation tool’ in urban design, with a focus on poor communities. Minecraft is the world’s second best-selling videogame of all time. In the game, players use textured cubes to build a virtual world. According to Microsoft Research’s Cambridge lab, people build amazing structures that do amazing things in Minecraft, and this allows experimenters to put in tasks that will stretch AI technology beyond its current capacity.Elefantes Blancos App (Columbia, C. America; Scale: Operational$163 million in public works corruption and inefficiencies has been identified citizens using the smartphone app, Elefantes Blancos (White Elephants). The smartphone app was introduced in 2013 by Colombia’s Transparency Secretariat and since that time 54 “white elephant” projects — those projects perceived by citizens as public works that were languishing, unfinished or abandoned — have been identified. 15 of the projects worth more than $400,000 were completed with pressure from the Transparency Secretariat, 27 are under prosecution and 12 projects are currently being investigated (Guay, 2017).Citizens can download the app to their smartphone and then upload photos of the unfinished public projects. Users can vote on the most problematic projects, and the app determines location and frequency of reporting for each project. The Transparency Secretariat then begins the process of assessing the projects for corruption. While the Transparency Secretariat cannot prosecute cases, the Elefantes Blancos app has proven its value, and control of the app will be transferred to the local comptroller — the comptroller has the legal authority to prosecute corruption.1.1.4 ChallengesIt is important to note that countries in this geographical region are diverse politically, economically and socially. Hence, AI technologies pose several challenges at national and regional levels. Some of the key impediments identified include:A possible frontier technology divide emerging with advanced economies like Singapore and Indonesia investing in technological leapfrogging at astonishing rates, leaving others in the region at a risk of being left behindImbued trust deficit amongst countries, private and development sectors exists regarding use and abuse of such technologies and associated dataLimited technical capacity of governments and policymakers in developing technologically advanced governance solutions is leading to overdependence on donor agencies and other developed countriesLimited research and baseline data are available to prioritise infrastructural elements of national and regional decision support systemsA potential concern about technological unemployment persists due to surge in technological adaptation.The article acknowledges that some countries in the Global South are leading from the front and are forecast to be the major market of the future.

The rapid advance of technology has resulted in CPA firms hiring more nonaccounting graduates in order to integrate new tools into their practice. For example, one national firm leader reported that more than 25% of its new entry-level hires are science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors (Allan Koltin, opening remarks at Advisory Board’s Winning is Everything Conference, Dec. 13, 2017, http://bit.ly/2wrh091). Specifically for the accounting profession, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with robotic process automation (RPA) can create intelligent virtual workers to improve productivity. On facing the challenge of AI, Barry Melancon, AICPA CEO and president, has said, “With AI the whole ramification of jobs in society is a huge issue, and those that embrace it will be the most successful” (Michelle Perry, “AICPAs Barry Melancon on the Challenge of Change in Accountancy,” ICAS website, Oct. 6, 2017, http://bit.ly/2Wajgkm).
While AI is still an evolving technology, many applications have recently made impressive leaps. For example, computers can defeat chess champions, help drive cars, instruct drones to return automatically, provide medical diagnoses, perform as virtual assistants, and navigate vacuum cleaners through a furnished house. The AI applications for business involve training computers to do tasks employees can perform, learning from experiences and adjusting to new data, if needed. Currently, CPA firms can use intelligent robots to count inventories, inspect fixed assets, handle bank audit confirmations, and read contracts or other documents to generate meaningful insights.
Some CPAs may assume that, like big data or blockchain, AI is a relatively recent development. To the contrary, AI research started even before the creation of the Accounting Principles Board, FASB’s predecessor, in 1959. Subsequently, several subfields of AI have emerged, including robotics, perception (vision and speech), machine learning (ML), and expert systems (ES). This article will help CPAs understand AI and the current AI-enabled tools in accounting. In addition, it offers suggestions on how to embrace this powerful technology to benefit CPAs and CPA firms.

Development of the AI Field
Alan Turing, who played a pivotal role in breaking Germany’s Enigma code during World War II, is considered by many as the father of AI. In his milestone paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing raised the question, “Can machines think?” and discussed how to build intelligent machines (Mind, October 1950, http://bit.ly/2MgwNCq). The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by John McCarthy, who defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” In 1955, McCarthy coauthored a research proposal to study AI with Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon (A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, https://stanford.io/2KdBeeK), which launched it as a research field. Unfortunately, contemporary computers could not store enough data or process it fast enough to exhibit intelligence. As research interest subsided, so did funding (Rockwell Anyoha, “The History of Artificial Intelligence,” Harvard University blog, Aug. 28, 2017, http://bit.ly/2VZgQzU).






In the 1980s, AI research was reignited thanks to refined development tools (e.g., Lisp, Prolog, EMYCIN, VP-Expert) and increased funding. Consequently, there was a proliferation of business-related AI projects using ML and ES. ML studies the algorithms and statistical models that computers use to effectively perform a specific task (e.g., predicting corporate financial stress or bankruptcy). ML algorithms can generate a model from the available data—known as the “training sample”—that can then be used to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed by humans. One of the models for ML is the artificial neural network (ANN), a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons that emulates a human’s biological neural network and develops algorithms from a set of given samples. Specifically, an artificial neuron can process the data it receives and then pass them on to connected artificial neurons. Initially, artificial neurons were subclassified into three layers—input, hidden, and output. Later on, ANN evolved into deep learning, in which there are multiple layers between the input and output layers.

CPA firms can use intelligent robots to count inventories, inspect fixed assets, handle bank audit confirmations, and read contracts or other documents to generate meaningful insights.

An ES is a computer program that emulates the decision-making process of human experts. It is designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through a collection of existing experiences and knowledge, generally represented as “if-then” rules. An ES is divided into two subsystems: the knowledge base and the inference engine. The knowledge base represents facts and rules, while the inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities. David Yang and Miklos Vasarhelyi reported that there were 167 accounting-related ES studies in the ’80s and ’90s covering five areas: auditing, taxation, financial accounting, personal financial planning, and management accounting (“The Application of Expert Systems in Accounting,” Artificial Intelligence in Accounting and Auditing, vol. 4, Markus Wiener Publishers, 1995, http://bit.ly/2KaW3Y1).
In the 21st century, the applications of AI have become increasingly widespread; Exhibit 1 presents several popular applications. There may, however, be some drawbacks for users, depending to a great extent upon individual experiences, expectations, and preferences.

AI Projects by CPA Firms
CPA firms often develop and use cutting-edge tools to stay competitive, and adopting AI is no exception. By integrating AI with RPA, CPA firms can increase productivity and improve job performance. AI is, however, an evolving technology, and not every firm is willing to commit the required resources to adopt AI into its practice. Nonetheless, the Big Four have already invested in AI, as illustrated by the sample projects in Exhibit 2. While the Big Four are at the forefront in developing AI-enabled tools, smaller firms should not preclude themselves from reaping the benefits. For example, Gursey Schneider LLP used AI-enabled audit tools to process a massive amount of client data and compile enough evidence to move forward with a $2.8 million criminal fraud case (Solon Angel, “How AI Could Protect Your Business from Financial Fraud,” Forbes.com, Feb. 14, 2019, http://bit.ly/2KaYolS). According to the Accounting Today 2019 Regional Leaders Report, Gursey Schneider is a “small” firm in California with 16 partners and 192 total employees (http://bit.ly/2HL6iAR).

Examples of AI Applications in Accounting



To help CPAs learn more about developing AI-enabled tools, the authors present the following excerpt from a post on the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) website written by Gary Krausz of Gursey Schneider and John Colthart of MindBridge Ai, explaining how and why they used AI to enhance the fraud audit (http://bit.ly/2HN45F7):

The client had $120 million in annual sales. … They had suspected fraud to have occurred across three years and requested an examination of their general ledger for the period between 2014 and Q2 2018, to the tune of 6.2 million transactions. … AI gave us the ability to take very big data sets and make them manageable, as it took all the data and knew how to put different thoughts together and infer relationships between items. Unlike the traditional methods in our industry of relying on hunches and instinct to pick an account and start digging, AI offered up its own “intuition” based on the current data set and the learnings from prior analysis. In this case, without any tuning by us, the AI analyzed the entire data set from the client’s general ledger and flagged the fraudulent transactions in a very short amount of time, including identifying items of large amounts posted into unusual accounts and items posted by the same person multiple times. …
AI offers the opportunity to ingest and inspect 100% of a client’s accounting transactions and go beyond simple rules reporting (sorting and filtering). It allows examiners to dig deeper into insights based on the behavior of the data and to augment professional judgment with insights that replicate what an army of the world’s best experts can do.

This case illustrates how an AI-enabled tool can significantly improve audit efficiency with effective analytics and auditing of the entire transaction dataset. In the end, Krausz and Colthart concluded that firms are advised to start planning their AI adoption strategies now.


How to Embrace AI
In its 2018 report on the annual Rosenberg Survey, the CPA Journal noted that “the CPA profession is on the cusp of arguably its greatest transformation” due to technological innovations such as blockchain and AI. The survey also concluded that this change “will dramatically transform how a CPA firm is managed and staffed, and what it will mean to be a CPA” (CPA Journal, December 2018, http://bit.ly/2MiAyHz). Thus, the authors would like to offer some suggestions on how to embrace AI in the accounting profession.

For accountants.
The modern technology-driven business approach drives accountants to evolve from information providers to business enhancers. AI opens the door for business enhancement, and CPAs can contribute to AI projects with their extensive knowledge in business operations and data. Accountants who are willing to embrace AI-enabled tools can develop advanced skills for career development. For example, to prepare the training samples for AI projects, CPAs need to have data management skills in order to collate the data and prepare it in a format that can be used for ML. The authors suggest accountants learn and use a database management system (e.g., MS Access) or generalized audit software (e.g., ACL, IDEA) to slice, join, and merge the data coming from various platforms.
To start learning AI, accountants and accounting students are encouraged to take advantage of free online courses available at edX, MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, Udacity, Codecademy, Youtube, or numerous universities; these courses often offer self-paced lessons directed at varying levels of personal experience, existing knowledge, and needs.


For accounting professors.
To help accounting students adapt to new technology, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business adopted Accounting Standard A7 in 2013 and called for adding “the development of skills and knowledge related to data creation, data sharing, data analytics, data mining, data reporting, and storage within and across organizations” to the curriculum. Although the AACSB aims to ensure that students are well prepared for career development, the applications of AI and RPA, not yet included in A7, have become increasingly important for businesses. Critics still claim that “our education system is doing a dismal job of preparing accountants to work deeply with technology” (Daniel Hood, “The Profession’s Biggest Challenges,” Accounting Today, Oct. 1, 2018, http://bit.ly/2KkANzl).

CPA firms that embrace AI will likely continue to prosper, but those who do not may end up being left behind.

Having dealt with financial data, accountants can play an important role in transforming unique insights into competitive advantages. In addition to structured transaction data, big data projects often include unstructured and external data to generate analytical insights. Consequently, the authors suggest integrating data management, AI, and RPA within accounting curricula to prepare the next generation of accountants. Furthermore, accountants need to know computer programming because coding requires performing tasks in proper sequence and creating a clear roadmap for problem solving (”Should Accounting Students Learn to Code,” AICPA website, Jul. 14, 2015, http://bit.ly/2RyYVyi). Taking even one semester of computer programming would allow accounting students to evolve from knowing how to use computers to understanding how to make computers solve problems. Knowledge of coding would also help accountants collaborate with IT professionals to develop AI-enabled tools.


For accounting firms.
Scott Showalter, chair of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, has stated that the impact of new technology is the greatest change to the profession since the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and that “no matter the discipline, whether audit, accounting, tax or advisory, all will be affected by these innovations” (Hood 2018). Thus, after assessing the impact of AI on their practice and identifying the potential niche of new technology, CPA firm leaders should keep staff informed regarding their vision and implementation plans; firms can then acquire or develop the new skills to use intelligent tools.
Many CPA firms’ entry into the AI field may be accelerated by focusing their hiring to include recent college graduates who have been exposed to some level of AI knowledge through coursework or internship. It generally takes longer for existing staff to develop and learn new skills, and they require adequate support to complete the transformation to an AI-enabled workplace. Furthermore, in addition to online courses, CPA firms can take advantage of seminars, workshops, and CPE training—already required as part of annual CPE requirements—to facilitate additional knowledge-based training in AI.
Generally, large firms tend to discern the economic benefits of utilizing new technologies first, and smaller firms follow suit. This wait-and-see approach, however, is no longer an option due to AI’s disruptive potential. CPA firms that embrace AI will likely continue to prosper, but those who do not may end up being left behind. Consequently, a firm’s management teams—including IT, audit, tax, advisory, and HR—need to work together to identify where AI can be best utilized to build on their existing strengths, create new ones, and develop strategies for deploying AI-enabled tools in the workplace.

                    Wondering how the advances of artificial intelligence might impact your future career? Murdoch alumnus Dr Jeremy Nunn, Founder and Director of Workmetrics shares his views and predictions about the impact of AI on future graduate roles in the workplace.
                
The promise of AI in the workplace is an intimidating one. Slowly, a new workforce that doesn’t rest or demand a raise is being eased into the work environment, begging the fierce debate if this technology is an advantage or a threat. What we know for certain is the transformative impact it will have on how the role of humans in the workplace could change.
The impact of AI on workplaces
Right now, there is an increasing amount of jobs the current crop of graduates are doing that didn’t exist a decade ago, not to mention the more traditional graduate roles of their parents. I think we can all agree artificial intelligence will change the workplace forever; the question is how.
There is plenty of pessimistic outlook on AI in the workplace. Kai-Fu Lee, former President of Google China, says up to half of our jobs will be “technically and economically doable by AI and automation over the next 15 years”. Regarding graduate jobs specifically, a third of jobs across the globe will be eventually replaced by machines and/or software, according to a report by the International Bar Association (IBA).
How industries could be affected
The legal profession is a glaring example of AI’s impact on the work environment. Its ability to innovatively produce more work with fewer production costs means law graduates and paralegals – as the brunt of the legal processing – will be replaced by technology that can perform repetitive and mundane tasks vastly quicker.
Areas like investing and brokering are witnessing an influx of sophisticated and low-cost AI-powered advisers. Due to their superior skills of selecting investments and stocks and lessening their risk, they are slowly replacing human brokers. Basically, any graduate role that includes a certain degree of routine and monotony (skills like information retrieval, planning, pattern recognition) is at the highest risk of being automated through AI.
The good news is this doesn’t mean those jobs are lost forever for the people holding them, but rather there’s a significant change in their day-to-day tasks.
Legal professionals will be liberated to do other things. There will still be demand for lawyers and advisers to handle complex litigation and legal requirements, and there’ll still be a need for doctors and medical professionals to discuss various treatment options even if AI will be quicker and more accurate in diagnosing a disease.
Preparing for the careers of the future
Instead of worrying about job cuts, graduates should focus on ensuring they have an attractive skillset which complements the abilities of AI. The ability to learn, adjust, and evolve a specific competence will increasingly be in demand as AI advances and becomes more integrated in the workplace. This means soft skills like leadership, creative thinking and problem-solving, as well as non-technical skills like communication and project management will still be necessary skills to have.
There will also be jobs created in the AI landscape which relate directly to the technology, some which will be fairly unique. As machines cannot learn anything human by themselves, AI trainers will have to make sure their performance is as close as possible to human-like. Various machine learning researchers and developers will be at the forefront of efforts in adding a touch of human reasoning and intuition to machines.
Then, AI support analysts will act as AI-focused advisors to organisations looking to harness the power of this technology. These people will be in charge of explaining how AI contributes to the workplace and making sure it is placed in the right role. As technology continues to push forward at a breathtaking pace, there will be a whole new host of careers and branches that haven’t been invented yet.
A permanent change to the way we work
It’s business’ need to process an exponentially growing quantity of data which ensures AI an enduring presence in workplaces. This increase in volume and number of ways we use data is unlikely to ever slow or phase out, so the sooner graduates begin to adapt, the greater the advantage they will have when this technology inevitably becomes mainstream.  Perhaps that is the greatest effect AI is having on graduate roles – instilling a broader perspective for a more valuable and meaningful workplace.

The universe is filled with beautiful objects, like this bubble nebula, located more than 8,000 light-years from Earth. Researchers recently used artificial intelligence to simulate the universe. Though the simulation did surprisingly well, no one fully understands how it works.

The first-ever artificial intelligence simulation of the universe seems to work like the real thing — and is almost as mysterious.Researchers reported the new simulation June 24 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The goal was to create a virtual version of the cosmos in order to simulate different conditions for the universe's beginning, but the scientists also hope to study their own simulation to understand why it works so well.""It's like teaching image-recognition software with lots of pictures of cats and dogs, but then it's able to recognize elephants,"" study co-author Shirley Ho, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City, said in a statement. ""Nobody knows how it does this, and it's a great mystery to be solved."" [Far-Out Discoveries About the Universe's Beginnings] Simulating the universeGiven the enormous age and scale of the universe, understanding its formation is a daunting challenge. One tool in the astrophysicist toolbox is computer modeling. Traditional models require a lot of computing power and time, though, because astrophysicists might need to run thousands of simulations, tweaking different parameters, to determine which is the most likely real-world scenario.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceHo and her colleagues created a deep neural network to speed up the process. Dubbed the Deep Density Displacement Model, or D^3M, this neural network is designed to recognize common features in data and ""learn"" over time how to manipulate that data. In the case of D^3M, the researchers inputted 8,000 simulations from a high-accuracy traditional computer model of the universe. After D^3M had learned how those simulations worked, the researchers put in a brand-new, never-before-seen simulation of a virtual, cube-shaped universe 600 million light-years across. (The real observable universe is about 93 billion light-years across.)The neural network was able to run simulations in this new universe just as it had in the 8,000-simulation dataset it had used for training. The simulations focused on the role of gravity in the universe's formation. What was surprising, Ho said, was that when the researchers varied brand-new parameters, like the amount of dark matter in the virtual universe, D^3M was still able to handle the simulations — despite never being trained on how to handle dark matter variations. Computers and cosmologyThis feature of D^3M is a mystery, Ho said, and makes the simulation intriguing for computational science as well as cosmology.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""We can be an interesting playground for a machine learner to use to see why this model extrapolates so well, why it extrapolates to elephants instead of just recognizing cats and dogs,"" she said. ""It's a two-way street between science and deep learning.""The model might also be a time-saver for researchers interested in universal origins. The new neural network could complete simulations in 30 milliseconds, compared to several minutes for the fastest non-artificial intelligence simulation method. The network also had an error rate of 2.8%, compared with 9.3% for the existing fastest model. (These error rates are compared to a gold standard of accuracy, a model that takes hundreds of hours for each simulation.)The researchers now plan to vary other parameters in the new neural network, examining how factors like hydrodynamics, or the movement of fluids and gases, may have shaped the universe's formation.From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through TimeThe 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark MatterThe 12 Strangest Objects in the UniverseOriginally published on Live Science.

IIT Hyderabad has been the first institute in the country to introduce B.Tech in AI technology, enrolling 20 students this year.India is expected to create 39,000 new analytics jobs by 2020. The advent of automation and the demand for changing job skills has attracted a large chunk of Indian students enrolling in India premier institution — Indian Institute of Technology(IITs) — for advanced engineering courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning. As industries face talent shortage in the sector, IITs recently rolled out degree programmes and certifications including a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Artificial Intelligence — providing diverse options in technology courses. IIT Hyderabad has been the first institute in the country to introduce B.Tech in AI technology. The institute started its first batch this year, enrolling 20 students to the course.“What surprised us was that many students this year chose BTech course in AI as against regular CSE (computer sciences) despite having a better score. It’s a sign that students have realised the potential of AI as a career prospect considering the scope of research and jobs in the industry,” Vineeth N Balasubramanian, associate professor at IIT Hyderabad told the Times of India.This year, the JEE advanced rank for opting AI stood at 478 and closed at 657. Overall, IIT Bangalore and IIT Delhi continue to remain top choices for engineering aspirants.The industry estimates that India has less than 10% of data scientists available globally. According to a survey by Analytics Vidhya and ed-tech platform Great Learnings, India has 50,000 vacancies in data and analytics sector. In fact, the country is expected to create 39,000 new analytics jobs by 2020. Coping with the growing demandIndian IT majors including GE Research, Ericsson and Bosch, for their part, have also been funding various research programs at IITs.Microsoft too recently announced that it will establish AI digital labs in India, jointly with 10 colleges and universities including Indian School of Business (ISB).In its most recent budget, Indian government announced a key national programme focussed on AI under its ‘Digital India’ initiative. This will include the setting up of AI centers across the country to help AI-based startups in India.See also:Accenture comes in ahead of Deloitte, Wipro and TCS in IDC’s AI rankingsIITs to offer programs in artificial intelligence as India faces talent shortage",,IIT students are choosing AI over computer science as job prospects change,,,,,,https://www.businessinsider.in/iit-students-choose-ai-over-computer-science/articleshow/70024844.cms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.bg-white']}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '600', 'height': '60', 'url': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-60085318,width-1000,height-750/default-thumb.jpg'}","['https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderIndia', 'https://twitter.com/BiIndia']"
