A recent article and analysis by Nick Reed at Brink News suggests the driverless car revolution isn’t gaining as much traction as originally predicted. “Five years ago, there was a lot of hype, a sense that this was something that was coming very soon and would be a part of the lives of many people,” he says. “But people underestimated the scale of the challenge of operating a fully automated, safety-critical system in an unpredictable and infinitely variable environment.”


The slow uptake of driverless cars may be an allegory for what may be a slower-than-expected uptake of artificial intelligence in general. After all, businesses surely operate in “unpredictable and infinitely variable environments” — and the past year has certainly put an exclamation point on this observation.

Success with AI is going to be a bumpy and uneven road, and is going to need more human knowledge and input than we can ever imagine. At its core, artificial intelligence isn’t really a job-killer — it’s more of a taskmaster. The challenge for people and organizations, then, is to provide the knowledge and training to prepare for this new age. No one is more critical to AI success than the people who will be working with it on the front lines.

PROMOTED
Who really understands the business from the ground up? Who faces customers every day — and are likely the only faces (or voices) customers see or hear? The frontline and service workers make the business happen, and will make AI happen.

That’s the word coming out of a recent panel discussion, hosted by Stanford University’s center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). More needs to be done to engage the workforce to help steer the changes AI is bringing about in a positive direction. Business leaders and policymakers need to be more proactive in this process.

While jobs will be lost, many more will be enhanced, elevated, and created, says James Manyika, chairman of the McKinsey Global Institute. “There will be jobs that'll be lost, partly because technology will be able to do the various activities involved in that job. There will be jobs that will be changed. The jobs change is part of the fact that while the job is still there, technology will complement some of those activities.”

The share of jobs and occupations “that can be fully automated in terms of all their constituent activities is actually relatively small, at least for the next several decades,” Manyika adds.
How should we prepare the workforce for the changes ahead — to encourage their involvement in the AI revolution, as well as deliver the skills needed to make it happen? Many jobs, for example, are frontline workers who don’t have access to many technology tools. This is a crucial question, says Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). “Seventy percent of the U.S. workforce is in the service sector, and one in four jobs are care jobs. Those jobs are poverty jobs that, in most cases, there's two million black, brown, and immigrant women doing home care work in this nation. It's the fastest growing job [category]. I think those workers would love to understand how technology and artificial intelligence could actually elevate the work they do caring for the nation's elderly and people with disabilities.”
There are structural barriers to this kind of work that do not lend it too well to AI and automation retraining, Henry points out. “There's a lack of regular schedule. They have to hustle for hours every week, and one week to the next, they don't know really what their schedule is, which makes it impossible for them to engage in any kind of ongoing education. That also keeps them from being able to have a dialogue with their employers about how artificial intelligence in technology gets introduced into their work.”
Empowering the jobs of frontline workers is “where technology that complements what workers do, what people do, becomes critically important,” Manyika responds, advocating that workers be fully involved in the technology adoption process. “What I always tell people when we have this conversation is don't worry about a jobless future. It is not for many, many decades. What we should think about is how we manage the transitions and adaptations as we help workers cope with this.”
For starters, he continues, “we do have to solve the skills question because as jobs change, we're going to need to make sure that workers can actually adapt, learn skills, be able to work alongside machines, or move into occupations that are actually growing. The second question is how do we help workers transition either form declining occupations to the occupations that are growing? This is where policy and other mechanisms are really, really important to make sure we support the workers, we have the safety nets and the benefit models, and transition supports to actually help workers transition.”
This is critical, as a large segment of the workforce now, and going forward, are occupations such as care workers and teachers, who need to be compensated more fairly. Finally, Manyika says, “we need to solve for is how do we actually redesign work, because what happens is, the workplace actually changes as we bring in technology to the workforce. How do we think about data in the workplace? How do we think about redesigning the work itself? By the way, if we didn't think these questions about redesigning work were urgent, we only have to pay attention to what's happened with Covid.”
There is growing recognition that AI and robotics will only succeed when there is a human component to processes, he adds. “There are certain aspects of training where it actually is very helpful to actually do that with workers alongside the machines. How do you think about robotic manipulation, for example? Some of that training can actually be done by the machines. One of the things that's interesting in this Covid moment is robotic mechanisms have actually been quite important in actually doing things like improving testing. Quite often, when machines are trying to learn how to place and locate things in a space and in an environment, it's often very helpful to learn that from real human beings, so work alongside human beings... There's a co-learning aspect to this. I think that's another way in which workers can be part of the process.”
Healthcare provides an exemplary proving ground for the ways people can work to design AI-driven workplaces and processes that deliver the benefits intended. “In healthcare, we recognize that looping in these workers, from clinicians to caretakers, we start to understand deeply the privacy concerns and ethical concerns,” says Fei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford HAI. “When we started working with the nurses in Stanford Hospital about hand-hygiene practice, the initial reaction was ‘You'll never be allowed to do this because there is a privacy infringement, or actually concern for the nurses.’ But as we loop in the nurses and understand the concerns, we share the technology that does not infringe on privacy, you realize these people are so incredible. They are creative, they're supportive, they want what's best for the patients, they become our biggest allies and partners in this. There is a lack of culture in tech right now to involve more of our workers, especially service workers, in the early stage of the tech design, all the way to the application stage.”

Hearing aids with artificial intelligence


Contributed by Madeleine BurryJanuary 25, 20212021-01-25T00:00:00-06:00


Fantastical notions of all-powerful robots, straight out of Hollywood, may come to mind when you think about artificial intelligence (AI). But set aside thoughts of the machines taking over: When it comes to your hearing aids, AI helps the devices function better. 
For instance, AI can help wrangle one of the most challenging situations if you struggle to hear: Engaging in a conversation when you’re in a crowded, loud space (think: a restaurant or cafe). Because as you know if you wear a hearing aid, louder isn’t the solution. 
From month to month, year to year, researchers are finding more ways to harness this technology and use it to improve hearing aids. Here’s what you need to know about how hearing aids use AI—and if a hearing aid with this functionality is right for you or a loved one. 

Key terms: AI, machine learning, deep neural network 
Put simply, artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a machine to simulate human intelligence, performing a set of tasks that require “intelligent” decisions by following predetermined rules. 
“Artificial intelligence is a very broad definition. Machine learning, neural network, deep learning, and all of those, fall under the AI umbrella,” says Issa M.S. Panahi, PhD, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
Through machine learning, a subset of AI, machines use algorithms (aka, a set of rules) to sort through giant amounts of data and make decisions or predictions. 
Go one level deeper, and we get to the deep neural network (DNN): This form of AI is set up to mimic the neural habits of the brain, and aims to respond the same way your brain would, without being explicitly programmed how to react in a given situation. 
You’re familiar with this technology if your inbox sorts emails into categories (important, promotional, etc.), if you take advantage of recommendations of ""what to watch next"" on streaming networks, or if you’ve marveled over self-parking cars. Some more mundane but important examples of deep learning include weather forecasting and credit card fraud protection. These tools have gotten much better in recent years due to deep learning. 
How hearing aids use AI 

Audiologist Scott Young

“The AI that occurs in hearing aids has actually been going on for years, but it’s a slow burn to think about how that’s actually happened,” says Scott Young, Aud, CCC-A, owner of Hearing Solution Centers, Inc. in Tulsa, Okla. 
Hearing aids used to be relatively simple, he notes, but when hearing aids introduced a technology known as wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) the devices actually began to make a few decisions based on what it heard, he says. 
“Over the last several years, AI has come even further—it actually listens to what the environment does,” Scott says. And, it responds accordingly. Essentially, a DNN allows hearing aids to begin to mimic how your brain would hear sound if your hearing wasn’t impaired.  
For hearing aids to work effectively, they need to adapt to a person’s individual hearing needs as well as all sorts of background noise environments, Panahi says. “AI, machine learning, and neural networks, are very good techniques to deal with such a complicated, nonlinear, multi-variable type of problem,” he says. 
What the research shows
Researchers have been able to accomplish a lot with AI to date, when it comes to improving hearing. 
For instance, researchers at the Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL) at the Ohio State University trained a DNN to distinguish speech (what people want to hear) from other noise (such as humming and other background conversations), writes DeLiang Wang, professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University, in IEEE Spectrum. “People with hearing impairment could decipher only 29 percent of words muddled by babble without the program, but they understood 84 percent after the processing,” Wang writes.

Dr. Issa Panahi is working on smartphone
-based AI apps to help people with hearing
loss. 

And at University of Texas at Dallas, Panahi, along with co-principal investigator Dr. Linda Thibodeau, used AI to create a smartphone app that can tell the direction where speech is coming from. This app calls on models built using a massive library of sounds to identify and diminish background noise, so people hear better. Place a smartphone with the app on a table, or rest it in the GPS stand in your car, and “clean speech is transmitted to the hearing aid devices or earbuds,” Panahi says. 
“The importance of AI is it overcom[es] a lot of issues that cannot be easily solved by a traditional mathematical approach for signal processing,” Panahi says. 
The app is not yet available to the public, Dr. Thibodeau says (code, demos, and more information are available on the website). 
Neural-network powered hearing aids
In recent years, major hearing aid manufacturers have been adding AI technology to their premium hearing aid models. For example Widex's Moment hearing aid utilizes AI and machine learning to create hearing programs based on a wearer's typical environments.
And this January, Oticon introduced its newest hearing aid device, Oticon More™, the first hearing aid with an on-board deep neural network. Oticon More was trained—using 12 million-plus real-life sounds—so that people wearing it can better understand speech and the sounds around them.

Oticon More hearing aids, which are
rechargeable.

In a complicated ""sound scene""—picture a bustling airport or hospital emergency room—the Oticon More's neural net receives a complicated layer of sounds, known as input. The DNN gets to work, first scanning and extracting simple sound elements and patterns from the input. It builds these elements together to recognize and make sense of what's happening. Lastly, the hearing aids then make a decision on how to balance the sound scene, making sure the output is clean and ideally balanced to the person's unique type of hearing loss. 

""We wanted our system to be able to find speech even when it's embedded in background noise. And that's happening in real-time and in an ongoing basis.""

This improvement is especially key for speech in noise, explained Donald J. Schum, PhD, Vice President of Audiology at Oticon, during the product launch event.
""Speech and other sounds in the environment are complicated acoustic wave forms, but with unique patterns and structures that are exactly the sort of data deep learning is designed to analyze,"" he said. ""We wanted our system to be able to find speech even when it's embedded in background noise. And that's happening in real-time and in an ongoing basis.""
Do I need a hearing aid with AI? 
Think of hearing aids as existing on a spectrum, says Young—hearing aids range widely in price, and some at the lower end have fewer AI-driven bells and whistles, he says. 
He points out that some patients may not need all the features—people who live alone or rarely leave the house, and don’t find themselves in crowded scenarios often, for instance, might not benefit from the functionality found in higher-end models. 
But for anyone who is out and about a lot, especially in situations where there are big soundscapes, AI-powered features allow for an improved hearing experience.
Listening effort is reduced
What ""improvement"" looks like can be measured in a lot of ways, but one key indicator is memory recall, Schum explained. It's not that the hearing aids like Oticon More literally improve a person's memory, he explained, it's that artificial intelligence helps people spend less time trying to make sense of the noise around them, a process known as ""listening effort.""
When the listening effort is more natural, a person can focus more on the conversation and all the nuances conveyed within.
""It's allowing the brain to work in the most natural way possible,"" he said.

The AI and Law webinars, co-organised by the Council of Europe and the University of Strasbourg (UMR DRES), are regular meetings open to a wide public, public decision-makers, officials from international organisations and national administrations and academics, whose aim is to measure the stakes of subjects at the frontiers of digital techniques and the practice of law.
This webinar focusses on the role artificial intelligence techniques such as facial recognition play in the criminal justice system. Deep learning techniques of this type promise to make it considerably easier to identify people from pictures and can be a real boon to police departments, provided the identification is technically reliable and fair – and the person in question was already a suspect before they were identified.
Currently a hot topic, video surveillance coupled with a facial recognition system is gaining traction in Europe while several North American cities have not only stopped using facial recognition, some have prohibited it. Does video surveillance create suspects? Is the fact that someone is present in a specific place – predetermined by the police – constitute reasonable grounds on which to launch a criminal investigation? Is using such combined surveillance and recognition systems a fair and effective way to fight crime?
Clear regulations have been adopted in recent decades to govern the use of investigative measures based on specific techniques such as telecommunications interception, using GPS to track vehicles, and installing surveillance cameras in homes. In Europe, the use of such techniques is reviewed by the European Court of Human Rights. Should similar rules apply when facial recognition is used to identify people?
Turning the mere identification of someone into grounds to investigate or proof of a crime is a legally delicate endeavor. Identification by a witness is governed by rules of criminal procedure. Witnesses must testify and be questioned by defense counsel before a judge, and in some cases their testimony cannot be admitted as evidence. Does AI testify? Does it provide an expert opinion? Can defense counsel question it, or impugn its reliability? Do otherwise benign observations produced by AI, such as that a driverless car was on the road, play a role in criminal proceedings?

AAAS is launching a project to support the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare contexts, and specifically in public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Today the project released a landscape assessment of existing public opinion work in this area compiled by a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.[1] This report summarizes what we know about public views of the use of AI in healthcare and in areas affecting the pandemic response, with an emphasis on understanding the concerns of populations most vulnerable to the negative impacts of AI technology. 
“By understanding the views of people who might use or be affected by new technologies, and seeking out diverse voices that include marginalized communities, we aim to deepen conversations about the implications of these technologies for civic society,” said Emily Therese Cloyd, director of the AAAS Center for Public Engagement with Science & Technology. “Such conversations can reveal questions and concerns about the ways technologies are designed and applied before they become problems -- or light the way to new approaches that hadn't been considered previously.”
From containment of the virus to drug development, AI-driven healthcare applications have played an important role in the COVID-19 response. AAAS identified three areas where these applications could have an outsize impact on privacy and human rights, or pose a greater risk of potential abuses: surveillance (e.g., contact tracing), medical triage, and allocation of resources. The landscape assessment released today reviews public opinion on the AI landscape more broadly while also seeking to understand the concerns of vulnerable communities in particular, including in the context of the three areas identified.  
The landscape assessment, intended as a baseline to show where additional research may be useful, found very little existing survey work on public opinions of AI in the United States. Surveys that do exist do not provide breakdowns by demographic, although the researchers did some of this analysis as part of their work. The landscape assessment recommends that future work “pay special attention to minority groups and groups that are traditionally digitally marginalized, as these groups are more susceptible to negative outcomes of AI usage and applications (for example, racial bias embodied in AI systems).”
Findings from the assessment also flagged as a gap that polls “tend to focus on specific, sometimes very hypothetical or obscure-seeming potential applications of AI, making it difficult to piece together an overall picture of public opinion regarding AI in general and in healthcare contexts in particular.”
AAAS intends to incorporate the results from this landscape assessment into a responsibility framework for creating and using AI in ways that alleviate, rather than exacerbate, any negative impacts of the technology among vulnerable and marginalized populations. AAAS will develop and disseminate this framework in collaboration with representatives of these groups as well as with AI experts and developers, social scientists, and policymakers.   
To follow up on the landscape assessment, AAAS is working with researchers from Marquette University and the Medical College of Wisconsin[2] to convene focus groups and gather more qualitative information from specific populations. The focus groups will be held with Black, Latino, Southeast Asian, and First Nations communities in the Milwaukee area. 
“Our aim is to engage with these communities to gain a clearer picture of their general understandings of AI and its range of uses within the healthcare context, their reactions to the potential uses of AI technology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes about the use of personal health data in the development of AI, and views about whether they feel AI might help (or, perhaps perpetuate) health disparities in their respective communities,” says Michael Zimmer, lead investigator.
In the coming weeks, the project will also release a report summarizing the uses of AI in the COVID response, and focused on the three applications identified (surveillance, triage, and resource allocation.) In later stages, AAAS intends to work with community leaders, AI experts and developers, social scientists, and policymakers to develop and deliver written and digital materials and direct engagement activities to promote conversations between scientific experts and diverse publics. Engagement activities may include online discussion forums, virtual workshops, town halls, webinars, and other appropriate convenings.
The Artificial Intelligence (AI2): Application/Implications Initiative was launched with support from Microsoft. The project is guided by an advisory group of multidisciplinary experts. Those interested in contributing to this work may do so at: https://www.aaas.org/ai2/donate.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is now on the job to combat the spread of misinformation on the internet and social platforms thanks to the efforts of start-ups such as Logically. While AI is able to analyze the enormous amounts of info generated daily on a scale that's impossible for humans, ultimately, humans need to be part of the process of fact-checking to ensure credibility. As Lyric Jain, founder and CEO of Logically, said, toxic news travels faster than the truth. Our world desperately needs a way to discern truth from fiction in our news and public, political and economic discussions, and artificial intelligence will help us do that.
Fake News Is Rampant, Here Is How Artificial Intelligence Can Help Adobe Stock

The Fake News “Infodemic”

People are inundated with info every single day. Each minute, there are 98,000 tweets, 160 million emails sent, and 600 videos uploaded to YouTube. Politicians. Marketers. News outlets. Plus, there are countless individuals spewing their opinions since self-publishing is so easy. People crave a way to sort through all the information to find valuable nuggets they can use in their own life. They want facts, and companies are starting to respond often by using machine learning and AI tools. 

Logically Verifies Fact from Fiction

To make critical decisions in life, we require facts. However, since anyone has the ability to publish information on the internet, false news travels fast and can have dire consequences. UK start-up Logically was founded in 2017 by Lyric Jain, an alum of MIT and Cambridge. He set out to develop a solution that combined artificial and human intelligence to verify the veracity of news, social discussion, and images.
PROMOTED
Through a free app that can be downloaded from the Apple Store or Google Play, readers can verify content by sharing an article with Logically. The company also has a Chrome browser extension that works on more than 160,000 social platforms and news sites to fact-check news stories. The company deployed first in the UK and India and then spread to the United States ahead of the 2020 election cycle to fact-check for consumers as well as government agencies.
How Does Logically Work? 
Logically’s AI algorithms use natural language processing to understand and analyze text. The AI models label the credibility of the source of the content with a rating of low, medium, high, and an article as reliable or unreliable based on comparisons of similar content from more than 100,000 sources. The algorithms are checking not only content, but metadata and images too.

During India’s last election campaign, Logically analyzed more than 1 million articles. They found 50,000 to be fake. The algorithms also check the toxicity of content and can block out profane and obscene content. This is an area where the algorithms are a bit less proficient as they are with fact verification, where they might mistakenly flag tongue-in-cheek communication as toxic.

When there is a need as great as we have with fighting fake news to safeguard our communities and commerce from the damage lies can inflict, it’s not hard to imagine that several innovators have stepped up to help develop solutions.
Another organization that is working to rid the world of misinformation is Full Fact, a team of independent fact-checkers that is also building automated fact-checking tools. Since 2015, they have been developing tech to increase their fact-checking impact. Full Fact collects and monitors data, identifies and labels claims, and often takes the fact-checking process offline with humans.
AdVerif.ai is an AI company that aims to keep users safe from inappropriate and deceiving content, spam, and fake news. The company's FakeRank algorithms help advertisers, publishers, and ad networks to moderate content and ensure compliance with company policies to ultimately protect users and keep the reputations of brands safe.
As the world’s largest social media networks have come under fire for the part they play in spreading fake news, companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and others will rely on technology and AI tools to help them address the public's demands. Facebook worked with independent fact-checking organizations Snopes, Politifact, ABC News, and FactCheck.org to verify viral stories. They also announced initiatives such as applying machine learning and building new products to identify and limit the spread of false news.
As the pursuit of fighting fake news becomes more sophisticated, technology leaders will continue to work to find even better ways to sort out fact from fiction also well as refine the AI tools that can help fight disinformation. Deep learning can help automate some of the steps in fake news detection, according to a team of researchers at DarwinAI and Canada's University of Waterloo. They are segmenting fact-checking into various sub-tasks, including stance detection where the system is given a claim on a news story plus other stories on the same subject to determine if those other stories support or refute the claim in the original piece.

Artificial intelligence has been making waves in recent years, enabling us to solve problems faster than traditional computing could ever allow. Recently, for example, Google's artificial intelligence subsidiary DeepMind developed AlphaFold2, a program which solved the protein-folding problem. This is a problem which has had baffled scientists for 50 years.





Advances in AI have allowed us to make progress in all kinds of disciplines—and these are not limited to applications on this planet. From designing missions to clearing Earth's orbit of junk, here are a few ways artificial intelligence can help us venture further in space.
Astronaut assistants
Do you remember Tars and Case, the assistant robots from the film Interstellar? While these robots don't exist yet for real space missions, researchers are working towards something similar, creating intelligent assistants to help astronauts. These AI-based assistants, even though they may not look as fancy as those in the movies, could be incredibly useful to space exploration.
A recently developed virtual assistant can potentially detect any dangers in lengthy space missions such as changes in the spacecraft atmosphere—for example increased carbon dioxide—or a sensor malfunction that could be potentially harmful. It would then alert the crew with suggestions for inspection.
An AI assistant called Cimon was flown to the international space station (ISS) in December 2019, where it is being tested for three years. Eventually, Cimon will be used to reduce astronauts' stress by performing tasks they ask it to do. NASA is also developing a companion for astronauts aboard the ISS, called Robonaut, which will work alongside the astronauts or take on tasks that are too risky for them.

Mission design and planning
Planning a mission to Mars is not an easy task, but artificial intelligence can make it easier. New space missions traditionally rely on knowledge gathered by previous studies. However, this information can often be limited or not fully accessible.






This means the technical information flow is constrained by who can access and share it among other mission design engineers. But what if all the information from practically all previous space missions were available to anyone with authority in just a few clicks. One day there may be a smarter system—similar to Wikipedia, but with artificial intelligence that can answer complex queries with reliable and relevant information—to help with early design and planning of new space missions.
Researchers are working on the idea of a design engineering assistant to reduce the time required for initial mission design which otherwise takes many human work hours. ""Daphne"" is another example of an intelligent assistant for designing Earth observation satellite systems. Daphne is used by systems engineers in satellite design teams. It makes their job easier by providing access to relevant information including feedback as well as answers to specific queries.
Satellite data processing
Earth observation satellites generate tremendous amounts of data. This is received by ground stations in chunks over a large period of time, and has to be pieced together before it can be analyzed. While there have been some crowdsourcing projects to do basic satellite imagery analysis on a very small scale, artificial intelligence can come to our rescue for detailed satellite data analysis.
For the sheer volume of data received, AI has been very effective in processing it smartly. It's been used to estimate heat storage in urban areas and to combine meteorological data with satellite imagery for wind speed estimation. AI has also helped with solar radiation estimation using geostationary satellite data, among many other applications.
AI for data processing can also be used for the satellites themselves. In recent research, scientists tested various AI techniques for a remote satellite health monitoring system. This is capable of analyzing data received from satellites to detect any problems, predict satellite health performance and present a visualization for informed decision making.

Space debris
One of the biggest space challenges of the 21st century is how to tackle space debris. According to ESA, there are nearly 34,000 objects bigger than 10cm which pose serious threats to existing space infrastructure. There are some innovative approaches to deal with the menace, such as designing satellites to re-enter Earth's atmosphere if they are deployed within the low Earth orbit region making them disintegrate completely in a controlled way.
Another approach is to avoid any possible collisions in space, preventing the creation of any debris. In a recent study, researchers developed a method to design collision avoidance maneuvers using machine-learning (ML) techniques.
Another novel approach is to use the enormous computing power available on Earth to train ML models, transmit those models to the spacecraft already in orbit or on their way, and use them on board for various decisions. One way to ensure safety of space flights has recently been proposed using already trained networks on board the spacecraft. This allows more flexibility in satellite design while keeping the danger of in orbit collision at a minimum.






Navigation systems
On Earth, we are used to tools such as Google Maps which use GPS or other navigation systems. But there is no such a system for other extraterrestrial bodies, for now.
We do not have any navigation satellites around the Moon or Mars but we could use the millions of images we have from observation satellites such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). In 2018, a team of researchers from NASA in collaboration with Intel developed an intelligent navigation system using AI to explore the planets. They trained the model on the millions of photographs available from various missions and created a virtual Moon map.
As we carry on to explore the universe, we will continue to plan ambitious missions to satisfy our inherent curiosity as well as to improve the human lives on Earth. In our endeavors, artificial intelligence will help us both on Earth and in space make this exploration possible.

Meeting the Future Head-onHow the Hawaii State Library System is introducing artificial intelligence

If you’re not ready for them, the changes brought on by new technology might “punch you in the mouth,” said Ian Kitajima, director of corporate development at Oceanit Research Foundation.
It’s a timely, if violent, image: The pandemic has accelerated numerous technological changes, including digitization, automation, and remote work. In the midst of this upheaval, the Hawaii State Library system has partnered with Oceanit to help dodge any metaphorical punches by bringing artificial intelligence (AI) technology, along with job training and mentorship for students, to the library.
With Stacey Aldrich, state librarian of Hawaii, Kitajima shared details about their partnership and the future of AI technology in the session “Artificial Intelligence: The Future is Already Here” on Sunday, January 24 as part of the 2021 ALA Midwinter Meeting & Exhibits’ LibLearnX Preview and the Symposium on the Future of Libraries.
Aldrich approached Oceanit because she was looking for a more effective way of tracking library occupancy. At the time, the Hawaii library system—the only statewide public library system in the US—relied on manual people-counting to assess usage and occupancy. Aldrich sought instead a way to use Oceanit technology to implement people-counting while using the data in a way that protects people’s privacy.
The partnership would not only bring AI into the libraries, but also leverage Oceanit’s Aloha AI Student Trailblazers program to offer opportunities for students across the islands to learn about AI and work with the data to help the library envision new ideas for managing resources. “We want to make sure we’re looking at how we use it, what we can do with it, and how we can help educate folks,” Aldrich said.
The partnership centers on the Aloha AI System and Occupancy Sensors. While most people-counters use a motion detector to count entries and exits, these sensors use AI technology that has been trained on massive datasets to identify human beings. However, the system helps maintain library visitors’ privacy by analyzing camera input on the sensors themselves instead of transmitting them to a central database, which means that the only data stored in the cloud is that a person entered the library at a specific time. Advances in AI technology have lowered the cost of these more powerful sensors. “If we were trying to do this three years ago, I would have told Stacey it’s just not feasible,” Kitajima said.
Testing began in October 2020 at the Kaimuki Public Library in Honolulu. An online dashboard provides a real-time occupancy count; soon it will include an audio component to notify library staff when occupancy is too high. Students from Hawaii high schools will begin training in March to use the data and present further questions to the library for analysis under mentorship from Oceanit.
Kitajima identifies AI as one of several “mega-trends” in technology that will affect life and work in the years to come. He predicts that it will be just as influential as the internet when it comes to creating new businesses, and believes that focusing on students now will help develop and diversify the technology in the future. “We have to have a balance within, especially in artificial intelligence,” he says, adding that AI should respect privacy and culture. “Technology sometimes tends to be so efficient that we lose our cultural practices.”
Student participation also helps provide training for careers in AI and other data-related fields. The Oceanit program exposes students to innovation mindsets and design thinking instead of a particular technological device or format, since, Kitajima noted, technology changes while the approaches needed to evolve it stay the same.
By engaging students in a community problem, “we have a unique opportunity to have multiple benefits for everyone,” Kitajima said.

After a pandemic-stricken year that catapulted some of the most aggressive retail traders to millionaire status, the idea of turning to computer-driven quantitative hedge funds for outsized returns can seem unnecessary. Renee Yao, the founder and portfolio manager of quant hedge fund Neo Ivy Capital, begs to disagree. ""For the past six months, there's been a lot of retail flows into the market and the retail flows love those high-volatility, high-returns penny stocks,"" said Yao, noting that meanwhile, blue-chip stocks attracted little inflows. That discrepancy breeds the danger for a correction — something that Yao's fund is always monitoring so that it can act fast in a chaotic market environment. An example of such drama was the Dow's 13.7% decline in March followed by its 11% gain in April. ""If you use the traditional quant investing methodology, which you basically train your models with historical data, your model is going to get lost, because those are very rare events,"" Yao said.That's why so many traditional big-name quant hedge funds were hit with poor performance in 2020. For example, Jim Simons' Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha fund was down 32% while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Pure Alpha II fund declined 12.57% last year. How does an artificial intelligence strategy work?Yao's fund, which manages about $200 million in client assets, has generated a consistent 10% in annualized return since its inception in June 2016 thanks to its artificial intelligence-driven model.

""The whole purpose of AI is to train the computer to think and analyze like a human being; it's not entirely reliant on historic data,"" she said. ""So our model was able to quickly pick up the change in market regime and deliver positive returns for both March and April last year.""Instead of training the computers with historical data and hoping history repeats itself, Yao and her researchers write their own artificial intelligence algorithm that automatically generates trading ideas for the fund 24/7, non-stop.It does so by collecting the relevant data, cleaning the data, processing the data-generated forecasts, and then translating the forecasts into tradable targets, according to Yao. ""For example, the AI might say that today Elon Musk sent a tweet about Tesla, it's a good tweet, it's a piece of good news so we think the Tesla stock will go up,"" she said. ""So it's going to give a positive conviction to the Tesla stock.""She continued: ""Then the algo will go ahead and incorporate that conviction into the risk constraint we have, and then translate that conviction into how many shares of Tesla we want to buy, and then sent the order to the market.""With no human discretion in the stock selection process, the fund holds a diversified pool of about 1,000 stocks.  A new generation of quants Yao represents a new generation of quant hedge fund managers who are embracing artificial intelligence to harness the infinite possibilities in financial markets. But she technically grew up in the world of traditional quantitative investing.After finishing her master's in statistics at Columbia University, Yao started her career as a quant researcher at hedge fund giant Citadel before joining Millennium Partners and WorldQuant as a portfolio manager. ""As I continued to work in traditional quantitative investing, I started to observe that the space has become very crowded, and more and more people are trading similar ideas,"" she recalled. ""So we were trying very hard to find a new angle, a new source of alpha that is uncorrelated to the traditional way.""Yao found this new angle while conducting joint research with Google's DeepMind lab, which was also working on its Alpha Go paper that introduced modern AI theory to the public for the first time.""Once you build this AI system, the system will automatically find new ideas for you, which completely frees up the human resources,"" she said. ""We don't need to hire hundreds of thousands of Ph.D.s like some of the second generation traditional quant funds do. Instead, we just build this system that will automatically do all the jobs of the Ph.D.s.""She added: ""In terms of business model, this is a good business model. In terms of the results, obviously, the results are quite good compared to traditional quantitative investing.""As the quant investing landscape evolves, Yao continues to upgrade the system and technology that support her hedge fund. Aside from work, she is also trying to support the industry by helping to groom the next generation of quants. ""Whenever I have time, I would actually go back to Columbia and attend some of the seminars they hold at the business school and statistics department,"" she said. ""Whenever I have the opportunity, I will go there and try to encourage more women to focus on science and mathematics.""
