3 Daunting Ways AI Will Transform The World Of Work Adobe Stock

But this fourth industrial revolution – what I call the “intelligence revolution,” because it is being driven by AI and data – feels unprecedented in terms of the sheer pace of change. The crucial difference between this and the previous industrial revolutions is we’re no longer talking about generational change; we’re talking about enormous transformations that are going to take place within the next five, 10 or 20 years.

Here are the three biggest ways I see AI fundamentally changing the work that humans do, within a very short space of time.



PROMOTED
1. More tasks and roles will become automated
Increasing automation is an obvious place to start since a common narrative surrounding AI is “robots are going to take all our jobs.” In many ways, this narrative is completely understandable – in a lot of industries and jobs, the impact of automation will be keenly felt.
To understand the impact of automation, PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzed more than 200,000 jobs in 29 countries and found:

·        By the early 2020s, 3 percent of jobs will be at risk of automation.
·        That rises to almost 20 percent by the late 2020s.

·        By the mid-2030s, 30 percent of jobs will be at the potential risk of automation. For workers with low education, this rises to 44 percent.
These are stark figures. But there is a positive side to increasing automation. The same study found that, while automation will no doubt displace many existing jobs, it will also generate demand for new jobs. In fact, AI, robotics, and automation could provide a potential $15 trillion boost to global GDP by 2030.

This is borne out by previous industrial revolutions, which ultimately created more jobs than they displaced. Consider the rise of the internet as an example. Sure, the internet had a negative impact on some jobs (I don’t know about you but I now routinely book flights and hotels online, instead of popping to my local travel agent), but just look at how many jobs the internet has created and how it’s enabled businesses to branch into new markets and reach new customers.
Automation will also lead to better jobs for humans. If we’re honest with ourselves, the tasks that are most likely to be automated by AI are not the tasks best suited to humans – or the tasks that humans should even want to do. Machines are great at automating the boring, mundane, and repetitive stuff, leaving humans to focus on more creative, empathetic, and interpersonal work. Which brings me to…

2. Human jobs will change
When parts of jobs are automated by machines, that frees up humans for work that is generally more creative and people-oriented, requiring skills such as problem-solving, empathy, listening, communication, interpretation, and collaboration – all skills that humans are generally better at than machines. In other words, the jobs of the future will focus more and more on the human element and soft skills.
According to Deloitte, this will lead to new categories of work:
·        Standard jobs: Generally focusing on repeatable tasks and standardized processes, standard jobs use a specified and narrow skill set.
·        Hybrid jobs: These roles require a combination of technical and soft skills – which traditionally haven’t been combined in the same job.
·        Superjobs: These are roles that combine work and responsibilities from multiple traditional jobs, where technology is used to both augment and widen the scope of the work, involving a more complex combination of technical and human skills.
For me, this emphasizes how employees and organizations will need to develop both the technical and softer human skills to succeed in the age of AI.

3. The employee experience will change, too
Even in seemingly non-tech companies (if there is such a thing in the future), the employee experience will change dramatically. For one thing, robots and cobots will have an increasing presence in many workplaces, particularly in manufacturing and warehousing environments.
But even in office environments, workers will have to get used to AI tools as “co-workers.” From how people are recruited, to how they learn and develop in the job, to their everyday working activities, AI technology and smart machines will play an increasingly prominent role in the average person's working life. Just as we've all got used to tools like email, we'll also get used to routinely using tools that monitor workflows and processes and make intelligent suggestions about how things could be done more efficiently. Tools will emerge to carry out more and more repetitive admin tasks, such as arranging meetings and managing a diary. And, very likely, new tools will monitor how employees are working and flag up when someone is having trouble with a task or not following procedures correctly.
On top of this, workforces will become decentralized (a trend likely to be accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic) – which means the workers of the future can choose to live anywhere, rather than going where the work is.

Preparing for the AI revolution
AI, and particularly automation, is going to transform the way we work. But rather than fear this development, we should embrace this new way of working. We should embrace the opportunities AI provides to make work better.

No doubt, this will require something of a cultural shift for organizations – just one of the many ways in which organizations will have to adapt for the intelligence revolution. Discover how to prepare your organization for an AI-driven world in my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

Millions of Americans are unemployed and looking for work. Hiring continues, but there’s far more demand for jobs than supply. 
As scholars of human resources and management, we believe artificial intelligence could be a boon for job seekers who need an edge in a tight labor market like today’s. 
What’s more, our research suggests it can make the whole process of finding and changing jobs much less painful, more effective and potentially more lucrative.
Make me a match
Over the last three years, we’ve intensely studied the role of AI in recruiting. This research shows that job candidates are positively inclined to use AI in the recruiting process and find it more convenient than traditional analog approaches. 
Although companies have been using AI in hiring for a few years, job applicants have only recently begun to discover the power of artificial intelligence to help them in their search. 
In the old days, if you wanted to see what jobs were out there, you had to go on a job board like Monster.com, type in some keywords, and then get back hundreds or even thousands of open positions, depending on the keywords you used. Sorting through them all was a pain. 
Today, with AI and companies like Eightfold, Skillroads and Fortay, it is less about job search and more about matchmaking. You answer a few questions about your capabilities and preferences and provide a link to your LinkedIn or other profiles. AI systems that have already logged not just open jobs but also analyzed the companies behind the openings – based on things like reputation, culture and performance – then produce match reports showing the best fits for you in terms of job and company.  
Typically, there is an overall match score expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100% for each job. In many cases the report will even tell you which skills or capabilities you lack – or have not included – and how much their inclusion would increase your match score. The intent is to help you spend your time on opportunities that are more likely to result in your getting hired and being happy with the job and company after the hire. 
Crafting a winning CV
Usually, when you look for a job, you apply to lots of openings and companies at the same time. That means two choices: save time by sending each one a mostly generic resume, with minor tweaks for each, or take the time and effort to adjust and tailor your resume to better fit specific jobs. 
Today, AI tools can help customize your resume and cover letter for you. They can tell you what capabilities you might want to add to your resume, show how such additions would influence your chances of being hired and even rewrite your resume to better fit a specific job or company. They can also analyze you, the job and the company and craft a customized cover letter. 
While researchers have not yet systemically examined the quality of human- versus AI-crafted cover letters, the AI-generated samples we’ve reviewed are difficult to distinguish from the ones we’ve seen MBA graduates write for themselves over the last 30 years as professors. Try it for yourself. 
Granted, for lots of lower-level jobs, cover letters are relics of the past. But for higher-level jobs, they are still used as an important screening mechanism.



One of these cover letters was written by an MBA student. The other was generated by artificial intelligence. Can you tell which one is which?

Show me the money
Negotiations over compensation are another thorny issue in the job search. 
Traditionally, applicants have been at a distinct informational disadvantage, making it harder to negotiate for the salary they may deserve based on what others earn for similar work. Now AI-enabled reports from PayScale.com, Salary.com, LinkedIn Salary and others provide salary and total compensation reports tailored to job title, education, experience, location and other factors. The data comes from company reported numbers, government statistics and self-reported compensation. 
For self-reported data, the best sites conduct statistical tests to ensure the validity and accuracy of the data. This is only possible with large databases and serious number crunching abilities. PayScale.com, for example, has over 54 million respondents in its database and surveys more than 150,000 people per month to keep its reports up-to-date and its database growing.
Although no academics have yet tested if these reports result in better compensation packages than in the old days, research has long established that negotiating in general gets candidates better compensation offers, and that more information in that process is better than less.

Growing use of AI in hiring
Use of these tools is growing, especially among young people.
A survey we conducted in 2018 found that half of employed workers aged 18 to 36 said that they were likely or highly likely to use AI tools in the job search and application process. And 64% of these respondents felt that AI-enabled tools were more convenient. 
Most of the research on the use of AI in the hiring process – including our own – has focused on recruitment, however, and the use of the technology is expected to double over the next two years. We’ve found it to be effective for companies, so it seems logical that it can be very useful for job candidates as well. In fact, at least US$2 billion in investments are fueling human resources startups aimed at using AI to help job candidates, according to our analysis of Crunchbase business data. 
While more research is needed to determine exactly how effective these AI-enabled tools actually are, Americans who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus could use all the help they can get.

Now, we’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution, one driven by artificial intelligence and big data.

I like to refer to this as the “Intelligence Revolution."" But whatever we call it – the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 or the Intelligence Revolution – one thing is clear: this latest revolution is going to transform our world, just as the three previous industrial revolutions did.

What makes AI so impactful, and why now?

AI gives intelligent machines (be they computers, robots, drones, or whatever) the ability to “think” and act in a way that previously only humans could. This means they can interpret the world around them, digest and learn from information, make decisions based on what they’ve learned, and then take appropriate action – often without human intervention. It’s this ability to learn from and act upon data that is so critical to the Intelligence Revolution, especially when you consider the sheer volume of data that surrounds us today. AI needs data, and lots of it, in order to learn and make smart decisions. This gives us a clue as to why the Intelligence Revolution is happening now.

PROMOTED
After all, AI isn’t a new concept. The idea of creating intelligent machines has been around for decades. So why is AI suddenly so transformative? The answer to that question is two-fold:
·        We have more data than ever before. Almost everything we do (both in the online world and the offline world) creates data. Thanks to the increasing digitization of our world, we now have access to more data than ever before, which means AI has been able to grow much smarter, faster, and more accurate in a very short space of time. In other words, the more data intelligent machines have access to, the faster they can learn, and the more accurate they become at interpreting the information. As a very simple example, think of Spotify recommendations. The more music (or podcasts) you listen to via Spotify, the better able Spotify is to recommend other content that you might enjoy. Netflix and Amazon recommendations work on the same principle, of course.
·        Impressive leaps in computing power make it possible to process and make sense of all that data. Thanks to advances like cloud computing and distributed computing, we now have the ability to store, process, and analyze data on an unprecedented scale. Without this, data would be worthless.

I guarantee your business is going to have to get smarter. In fact, every business is going to have to get smarter – from small startups to global corporations, from digital-native companies to more traditional businesses. Organizations of all shapes and sizes will be impacted by the Intelligence Revolution.

Take a seemingly traditional sector like farming. Agriculture is undergoing huge changes, in which technology is being used to intelligently plan what crops to plant, where and when, in order to maximize harvests and run more efficient farms. Data and AI can help farmers monitor soil and weather conditions, and the health of crops. Data is even being gathered from farming equipment, in order to improve the efficiency of machine maintenance. Intelligent machines are being developed that can identify and delicately pick soft ripe fruits, sort cucumbers, and pinpoint pests and diseases. The image of a bucolic, traditional farm is almost a thing of the past. Farms that refuse to evolve risk being left behind.
This is the impact of the Intelligence Revolution. All industries are evolving rapidly. Innovation and change is the new norm. Those who can’t harness AI and data to improve their business – whatever the business – will struggle to compete.
Just as in each of the previous industrial revolutions, the Intelligence Revolution will utterly transform the way we do business. For your company, this may mean you have to rethink the way you create products and bring them to market, rethink your service offering, rethink your everyday business processes, or perhaps even rethink your entire business model.

Forget the good vs bad AI debate
In my experience, people fall into one of two camps when it comes to AI. They’re either excited at the prospect of a better society, in which intelligent machines help to solve humanity’s biggest challenges, make the world a better place, and generally make our everyday lives easier. Then there are those who think AI heralds the beginning of the end, the dawning of a new era in which intelligent machines supersede humans as the dominant lifeform on Earth. 
Personally, I sit somewhere in the middle. I’m certainly fascinated and amazed by the incredible things that technology can achieve. But I’m also nervous about the implications, particularly the potential for AI to be used in unethical, nefarious ways.
But in a way, the debate is pointless. Whether you’re a fan of AI or not, the Intelligence Revolution is coming your way. Technology is only going in one direction – forwards, into an ever-more intelligent future. There’s no going back.
That’s not to say we shouldn’t consider the implications of AI or work hard to ensure AI is used in an ethical, fair way – one that benefits society as well as the bottom line. Of course, we should do that. But it's important to understand that; however, you feel about it, AI cannot be ignored. Every business leader needs to come to terms with this fact and take action to prepare their company accordingly. This means working out how and where AI will make the biggest difference to your business, and developing a robust AI strategy that ensures AI delivers maximum value.

AI is going to impact businesses of all shapes and sizes, across all industries. Discover how to prepare your organization for an AI-driven world in my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Starting a new life is difficult for criminals transitioning from prison back to regular society. To help those individuals, Purdue University Polytechnic Institute researchers are using artificial intelligence to uncover risky behaviors which could then help identify when early intervention opportunities could be beneficial.
Results of a U.S. Department of Justice study indicated more than 80 percent of people in state prisons were arrested at least once in the nine years following their release. Almost half of those arrests came in the first year following release.
Marcus Rogers and Umit Karabiyik of Purdue Polytechnic’s Department of Computer and Information Technology, are leading an ongoing project focused on using AI-enabled tools and technology to reduce the recidivism rates for convicted criminals who have been released.
Both are examining the forensic psychology aspect, by identifying risky behaviors, stressful situations and other behavioral and physiological factors connected to a risk of individuals returning to criminal behavior. Rogers is a professor and Karabiyik is an assistant professor in the fields of digital and cyber forensics.

“The major reason recidivism is so high is the parolees don’t feel like they belong in the community,” Karabiyik said. “They have a hard time, and they immediately go back to their old criminal habits. Their old criminal communities are very welcoming.”
Artificial intelligence will give researchers a window into the parolee’s daily life through bracelets that collect health information, including stress and heart rate.
Smart phones carried by each person also will collect information, ranging from where they are at any given time to the photos they may take. The artificial intelligence will be run in intervals with the data examined rather than real time.
Rogers said the information will be used to identify risky behaviors, stressful situations and other behavioral and physiological factors correlated with those individuals at risk of returning to their criminal behavior.
“The goal of the study is to identify opportunities for early intervention to better assist those individuals to integrate back into general society successfully,” he said.

The monitoring systems currently are being developed, with the parolees expected to use the system during the third year of the research.
The project will work with 250 parolees as they are released. Of that total, 125 people will be in a treatment group that will have the devices and use the system. The other 125 people will be a control group observed to compare the differences. All are volunteers who consent to participate in the research, and their family members are notified of the project.
The four-year project is being done with Tippecanoe County Community Corrections, the Tippecanoe County/Purdue High Tech Crime Unit and the Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s Department.
In addition to determining the factors that draw parolees back, the research also will study the effect of offering assistance to the individuals as they integrate back into society.
For example, Karabiyik said the AI tools could recommend communities or jobs that would work well for the parolees, helping them feel comfortable and eliminating their high-risk status.
Rogers said the research will look at how technology can be used to teach better coping and life skills to those individuals and to allow overburdened caseworkers to more easily work with them.
“In the end, we want to develop a system that will allow the caseworkers to more quickly identify those individuals that seem to be on a path that would lead to recidivism,” Rogers said.
Rogers and Karabiyik are partnering with faculty from Florida State University and the University of Alabama-Huntsville and have received multimillion-dollar grant funding from the U.S. Department of Justice.

Canberra electronica duo B(if)tek — Kate Crawford and Nicole Skeltys — with twin Korg keyboards.(Supplied: Nicole Skeltys)The opening track on B(if)tek's 2020 album, Machines Work, was inspired by an advertisement made by The Muppets creator Jim Henson, featuring the sounds of electronic instruments inventor Raymond Scott.In 1967, multinational technology company IBM asked Henson to make an ad about their new word processor and how its technology could help people control paperwork in the office.The resulting ad, with its montage of images and words to an electronic soundtrack by Scott, provided the sample for Machines Work.""Machines can do the work so that people have time to think,"" the sample intoned, but ended with a warning that, actually, ""people can do the work so that machines have time to think"".""It's a fantastic little film, made to promote the idea that humans and machines would cooperate and deal with all the messy paperwork of the office,"" Crawford said.""It's funny to see that those sorts of claims are still being made today. But, if anything, that work has filled more and more of our space, time and thoughts.""Assuming that machines can do the work and artificial intelligence will save the day is, in some ways, quite a trap."" Skeltys said this 1960s view that robots would ""always be our friend"" had since blurred into a more dystopian outlook, and the fear that robots were ""coming to invade our space"" was present with each new innovation.She said a lot of the artificial intelligence robotic revolution had been outsourced to ""very cheap female labour"" who made its essential electronic components.""This is the result of capital, and decisions that have been made about where it's invested, and what kind of technology is made,"" Skeltys said.""It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, something out of human control. It just depends on who's got their hands on the levers of power and influence.""YouTube Paperwork ExplosionLife after B(if)tek posed 'enormous sociological and political questions'After eight busy years, touring with US hip hop group the Beastie Boys, selling out the Sydney Opera House, and being shortlisted for an ARIA award, B(if)tek disbanded.Crawford went on to help set up New York University's AI Now Institute, which considers the social and political implications of artificial intelligence, and joined another duo, Metric Systems. She has never lost her love of analogue synthesisers in the 25 years she has been composing with them.""So many of the machines that Nicole and I used in B(if)tek were 20 to 30 years old,"" Crawford said.""They would function differently on a hot day versus a cool day. They're organic. You get to collaborate with them.""So they have personalities, which is something I find endlessly fascinating and a source of great curiosity when writing music.""YouTube B(if)tek - Machines WorkCrawford's work through the AI Now Institute ""is focused on how these tools that are part of everyday life are starting to produce, in some cases, serious forms of inequity, of bias and discrimination, in the systems we rely on"".From health care to education to criminal justice, artificial intelligence was ""a profoundly concentrated industry [with] social, economic and political power,"" she said.""We have to look behind the machines to see the broader economy of who is running these [systems]; who profits, who benefits, and who might be bearing the greatest risk.""Crawford said there were ""enormous sociological and political questions"" that needed to be asked about using AI in our everyday life.""It gets much more concerning when we look to the way in which artificial intelligence is used to decide who might get a job, or be seen as a more dangerous defendant in the criminal justice system; or what student is seen to have the greatest potential in how they are responding in a classroom,"" she said.""All of these systems I am describing already exist and we have an entire industry set up to try to extract data and to apply meanings to that data.""The more I work in the field and really study those systems, a lot of those meanings are very suspect, and I think we have to be much more critical in the way we might expect artificial intelligence systems to interpret the world."" Kate Crawford is now a leading researcher and professor of the social implications of data systems and machine learning.(Supplied: Kate Crawford)From electronic music to folk rockUnlike Crawford, Skeltys moved ""180 degrees away from electronic music"" towards folk rock, as a touring artist.""People still crave the live performance experience, that intimacy and joy of being with other people,"" she said.""We long to be together and have that sense of community in the real world.""She said much of her music was peppered with political and social commentary.""There's always people who say 'nothing to worry about', and philosophers and analysts who say we need to be worried because there's going to be surplus populations and so many of us are not going to be needed,"" Skeltys said.""That's another reason why I gravitated to [folk]. Some of the themes I've been writing and singing about … have unfortunately become more acute, rather than less so."" Nicole Skeltys is an Australian composer, writer and presenter, and former member of Canberra electronica duo B(if)tek.(Supplied: Nicole Skeltys)It was after B(if)tek's third album that Skeltys decided she ""wanted to work less with machines and more with people"".She lent her vintage collection of synthesisers to the Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio, ""an artist-run, living museum where anyone who's curious and interested in this technology and aesthetic can go in, touch them, and learn how to use them"".""One of the great inventors and pioneers of synthesisers, Bob Moog, called the experience [of using them] 'a feeling you're channelling some kind of spiritual, transcendental, universal energy' — the opposite of artificial intelligence,"" she said.""I thought and felt that as well.""Skeltys said the themes dealt with in her latest album, Deal With Your Disenchantment, had become ""more and more real for people as we all deal with our disenchantment of being in lockdown"".But Crawford thinks the disenchantment goes deeper.""We're coming to an inflection point where people are saying, 'We need to have more control over our data, over our digital lives,' just at the moment where the power of [AI] companies has become, in many ways, stronger than it has ever been.""Posted 11 Aug 202011 Aug 2020Tue 11 Aug 2020 at 8:45pm, updated 12 Aug 202012 Aug 2020Wed 12 Aug 2020 at 4:35pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesDocuments reveal AFP's use of controversial facial recognition technologyIndustry ripe for innovation turns to AI and robots to pollinate cropsIt's not just you — songs really can take you back to specific times in your lifeDid you know a Eurovision-inspired AI Song Contest was being held this year?

The ScienceDigital cancer registries collect, manage, and store data on cancer patients. They help scientists identify trends in cancer diagnoses and treatment responses. This information can in turn help guide research funds and other resources. However, cancer pathology reports are complex. Human cancer researchers must analyze these reports to interpret variations in how they record information. To better leverage cancer data for research, scientists developed an artificial intelligence-based natural language processing tool. The tool will help researchers extract information from textual pathology reports.The ImpactResearchers have developed a multitasking convolutional neural network (CNN) for cancer research. The CNN is the first of its kind for working with cancer pathology reports. The CNN is a deep learning model that learns to perform tasks, such as identifying key words in a body of text. It works by processing language as a two-dimensional numerical dataset. Researchers have previously used single-task CNN models to comb through pathology reports. However, each single-task model can extract only one characteristic from the range of information in the reports. Compared with the single-task CNN and conventional AI models, the new multitask CNN is much faster. It processed text reports in a fraction of the time as the single-task models. In addition, it more accurately classified each of the five cancer characteristics.SummaryPopulation-level cancer surveillance is critical for monitoring the effectiveness of public health initiatives aimed at preventing, detecting, and treating cancer. To train and test the multitask CNNs with real health data, researchers used a secure data environment, more than 95,000 pathology reports from the Louisiana Tumor Registry, and the capabilities of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, a Department of Energy Office of Science user facility. The researchers compared their multitask CNNs to three established AI models, including a single-task CNN. The researchers concluded that the multitask CNN offers superior classification accuracy for automated coding of cancer pathology documents. This finding was true across a wide range of cancers and across multiple information extraction tasks. The multitask CNN achieved this performance while needing training and inference time similar to that needed for a single task–specific model.ContactGina TourassiDirector, National Center for Computational Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratorytourassig@ornl.govFundingThis work was supported in part by the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program established by the Department of Energy and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health.

Touted as nation's largest AI research program.


The University of Technology Sydney launched a new research institute to develop the nation’s use of artificial intelligence for economic and social advancement.







The Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) will oversee what the university is calling the country’s largest AI research program, with both applied and fundamental research using AI and associated technologies such as the internet of things (IoT).
Researchers at the institute are set to work across a number of sectors including healthcare, financial services, transport, education, and defence.
The facility will be led by Distinguished Professor Jie Lu, an expert in “fuzzy” machine learning - where algorithms are intended to function more like humans with an ability to evaluate more nuanced possibilities - and its impact on data-driven decision making.
Eight separate labs exist within the institute, with focus areas covering computational intelligence and deep learning, blockchain, bioinformatics, software and security.
Lu was awarded $3.3 million by the Australian Research Council to lead one of the major projects at the AAII concerning autonomous learning capabilities for decision-making in complex situations, and to improve the scale and focus of machine learning-based research into decision-making and its applications.
“We aim to create a novel research direction – autonomous machine learning for data-driven decision-making from big data that supports decision-making in complex situations,” Lu said in a statement.
“This project will give a new set of theories, methodologies and algorithms to learn autonomously from data, and assist machine-learning to effectively handle tremendous uncertainties in data.”
Together with industry partners from across the healthcare, transportation, agriculture and logistics transportation sectors, the project will look at intelligent learning systems using large data domains, data streams and agent environments.
“This dedicated Institute will further enhance UTS' - and Australia’s - reputation in AI, particularly machine learning, which is having such a transformational impact on many areas of science, the economy and society,” Lu added.
“AAII will build world-class AI research capacity in Australia and globally through links with national and international researchers, research communities and industries in machine learning and decision support systems.”

The pandemic and business continuity planning
The pandemic is a severe stress test for the business continuity plans of global corporations. The operators of call centres are playing an important role in meeting that challenge, and it has not been easy. In normal times, if an earthquake hits Bangalore, you can switch capacity to your call centre in Manila. But what do you do when all the call centres around the world that serve your customers are hit – all at the same time?


The big outsourcing call centre companies which serve corporate giants have hundreds of thousands of employees, and many of these people are working from home now. Their employers can make sure they have adequate computer equipment, but staff in developing countries are often handicapped by lack of good internet access, and the lack of a calm environment without interruptions.

The pandemic will prompt another round of discussions about re-shoring call centre jobs to places which are less vulnerable in that way, but cost will remain a huge barrier. The salary of one person in a corporation’s home country will often pay for three people in an offshore location. Or you could employ a graduate in India, China, or the Philippines for the cost of a school leaver in the US or the UK, and keep some change.

PROMOTED
Accelerating automation
The pandemic is also reviving talk of automation slashing the number of humans working in call centres. In 2014, the CEO of Telstra, Australia’s largest mobile phone company, made headlines with a forecast that within five years there would be no people in its call centres. It didn’t happen, of course. Peter Monk, GM for Australia of Concentrix, one of the two big global customer engagement companies offering contact centre services, says that employment in call centres has grown modestly in recent years, but that the really significant change has been the shift from voice to digital.

When customer interactions are simple, they can often be automated. A chatbot is perfectly adequate to handle a password change, or the provision of some basic information. And the digitally native younger generations prefer to interact digitally, ideally with short videos. But when there is significant value to be generated and exchanged, a call will often still be better.

Concentrix’ rival for the top spot in contact centre management is the French multinational Teleperformance, whose CEO said in a recent interview, “When chatbots started to arrive about five years ago, I was depressed. But since then our company has never grown so fast. The chatbot does the rational part of the job and the customer expert manages the emotional part.”

Natural language processing (NLP)
Peter Monk is sceptical about vendors’ claims to offer services with artificial intelligence. “Most vendors offer clever natural language processing technology, but it is not yet real AI. Some exceptions are coming through, but the software is still mostly pre-programmed, using lookup tables and knowledge banks.”

One of the more interesting early applications of NLP is systems which can detect the emotional state of a customer on the other end of a phone line, or tapping away on their keyboard. These systems are deployed alongside call centre staff, alerting them if a customer seems to be running out of patience, and suggesting variations on the script. The more sophisticated ones can discern the context of a word or sentence, referring to words and phrases from earlier in an exchange, or even from a previous conversation.
Josh Feast is co-founder and CEO of Cogito, whose “AI coach” helps customer service representatives be more emotionally intelligent on the phone. He thinks that most of us under-estimate “the challenging job of handling numerous calls each day, working with customers’ varied circumstances and communication styles, and dealing with countless policies and procedures. This can cause cognitive overload. AI can help them recognize behavioural signals by providing contextual guidance. The focus has been on automation, so we have yet to realize AI’s power to coach people, helping them reach their full potential.”
IVR, and analytics
Thanks to the increasing sophistication of NLP systems, IVR, or Interactive Voice Response, is making a comeback. When these systems were first introduced a few years ago, they were clunky and awkward, and the voice recognition software was not quite good enough, so they were quickly abandoned.
As with most industry sectors, the other big application of early AI systems is analytics. Phone conversations can be converted to text and analysed, so that companies can track how often each customer has been interacting with them, and what they are saying, with greater and greater richness and depth of understanding. This is a big area of investment for the large call centre operators.
A big industry
The call centre industry is a big one, and what happens to jobs in it will be important. It employs many millions of people around the world, in countries both rich and poor. It began in the West when large telephone systems were developed, and gradually became a major global employer. In the UK, the Birmingham Press and Mail claims to have opened the first centre, but the call centre boom really got going in 1985, when Direct Line became the first company to sell insurance entirely by phone. Today the industry employs around 1.3 million people in the UK, and more than 6 million in the USA.
Entrepreneurs in the developing world soon realised that they could bring a massive cost advantage to the industry. India was the biggest player in this market for many years, but in 2011 the Philippines stole the crown. With no connection to the south-east Asian mainland, the Philippines had failed to attract the foreign investment in manufacturing that was improving living standards in Thailand and Vietnam, but its people speak excellent English, and 1.2 million of them now work in call centres.
Translation and gigs
Artificial intelligence and related technologies are driving two other significant trends within the call centre industry. One is real-time translation, which should accelerate global trade – so long as it isn’t derailed by the pandemic, and populist nationalism. Google’s focus on B2C (business-to-consumer) applications leaves some space for other companies to play in the B2B space, and one of the leaders here is Unbabel, a Portuguese company.
The other is the application of gig economy business models to the call centre industry. Companies like Concentrix, through their ‘Solv’ solution, enable individuals anywhere in the world to get themselves accredited to work on particular types of business, and then log on and log off to work whenever they like. As the support tools improve, there is less and less need for contact centre workers to know much about the products and services of the companies they are representing. This information can be accessed instantaneously from databases in the cloud. They are evaluated more on their client handling skills, their empathy, and their ability to work with continuously evolving technologies.
Designing out the human
More fundamentally, younger companies are designing their business processes so that customers never – or almost never – need to contact a human to obtain their goods and services. The websites and logistics operations of digital disruptors aim to be so intuitive and user-friendly that customers never need to search for the “Contact” link. When this works it generates a tremendous cost advantage. When it fails, it generates huge frustration. The worst problem is when legacy companies, which lack the slick ergonomics of the disruptors’ websites, try to pull off the same trick, and hide their contact links. We consumers are not so easily fooled, and this behaviour will be the downfall of many once-great companies.
The long and the short of it
The Telstra CEO’s remark about call centres going dark within five years was a classic case of Amara’s Law, which observes that we over-estimate the impact of any given technology in the short term, and under-estimate it in the long term. Pre-virus, employment in call centres was growing in single-digit percentages a year. Post-pandemic, assuming the economy recovers, call volumes will probably remain stable, but their share of customer contacts will decline, and the call centre will become more and more a contact centre, handling many more exchanges digitally than by voice.
In the long run, it is a fairly good bet that humans will become as scarce in contact centres as they are becoming in warehouses. The question is, how long will this take. As Peter Monk, the GM of Concentrix Australia says, “Of course, the endgame - in the not too distant future - is that many aspects of even my job can be done pretty much by a machine.”

It's not shiny, it's not driven by technology, it's driven by a fight for survival,"" Dr Stanford told 7.30 as part of a new series on the education and jobs of Australians in 2025.""The reality is though, economically speaking, the advent of new technology in Australia is going surprisingly slowly in the real world."" Jim Stanford says the future of work will be driven by a ""fight for survival"" rather than technology.(Supplied: Australia Institute)The Centre for Future Work report, entitled The Robots are NOT Coming for Your Job … (And Why that's a Bad Thing), cited low business investment in technology, low use of industrial robots and lagging research and development as ""the most tangible manifestation of new technology"" which had ""plunged dramatically, with painful consequences for Australian economic growth, productivity, and innovation"".The report says that since 2017, business investment in machinery and equipment has averaged just 3.75 per cent of GDP. ""That's the weakest pace of investment during the entire post-war era, and just half the pace recorded for several decades after the Second World War,"" the report says.""We're going to see more and more of those very low-wage, low-grade, low-tech jobs,"" Dr Stanford said.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic'What really had to change was our human to human practices' Dom Price says software ""often gets less bugs now than humans"".(Supplied: Atlassian)However, Atlassian work futurist Dom Price told 7.30 the COVID-19 crisis has ""poured accelerant"" on the pace of technological change.""I think the investment in automation, robotics, machine learning will increase because it, in some regards, is seen as less risky than humans, right?"" Mr Price said.""Bizarrely, I think software often gets less bugs now than humans can get. ""Software can work 24/7, [it] doesn't need an enterprise bargaining agreement, doesn't take holidays, doesn't have sick leave. ""And so I think there is a view in some parts of society, in some parts of the economy, that technology's great.""Atlassian, a company with an already decentralised workforce which makes collaboration software, was ideally suited to pandemic-era work.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicBut Mr Price said even their workforce learnt important lessons about human-technology interface.""Our people were ready for it, the technology was ready for it,"" he said.""What really had to change was our human to human practices: how we engage, how we collaborate, what are those moments that we're used to having at a water cooler, or in a meeting room, that now were at the end of a call.""We realised, and I think a lot of organisations are realising now, if you copy and paste an in-person work week to a remote situation, it doesn't work. You do longer hours and it's more frustrating. So you have to change your habits and rituals,"" he said.He said the Australian firm, which reported revenue of $2.2 billion last financial year partly due to COVID-19, placed more emphasis on core human qualities than technical skills.""The hiring used to be a one-way process,"" he said.""I think in today's market it's about a match, a balance, and saying, 'What are the social causes that you care about?

It's what makes you you; your strengths, your behavioural styles, your motivators, your value sets, your interests,"" Mr Jacobs said.""And so our matching science looks at those traits of a human, of a young person, and matches them to work that would be a great fit for them.""Chloe Sheridan, Monica Li and Ace Nguyen are all concluding study, working for WooliesX part time and seeking further full-time work when unemployment has never been as high in their lifetimes.Adding to their worry is the fact that even though their skills are new, they will likely need to reskill before 2025.""It definitely makes me feel insecure, especially as graduates are probably the most dispensable employees,"" Ms Li said.""In 2025 I will hopefully be in some sort of permanent work, using the skills that I'm developing now — digital skills, communication skills, design skills — in a position that I don't necessarily know what it will look like.""Dr Stanford said the labour market in Australia was in an ""absolutely brutal downturn"".""It's something we've never seen before,"" he said.""After all, we deliberately shut down several important sectors of the economy in order to preserve public health.

According to research from IDC, the global spending on AI (Artificial Intelligence) is expected to hit $97.9 billion by 2023, up from $37.5 billion in 2019. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 28.4%.


No doubt, this is an enormous opportunity for startups. “These days, almost every company needs to leverage AI in order to thrive and build a meaningful future,” said Saar Yoskovitz, who is the CEO of Augury. “This is true for younger startups, and it is true for the largest companies, even in the most traditional and nascent industries like manufacturing and insurance. In a sense, AI has become another layer in the tech stack, like databases, and not a business model.”

All this is true. But then again, finding the right product-market fit is extremely challenging. Consider that AI models generally require a lot of customization. In fact, there is often much variation even for companies in the same industry. 

PROMOTED
And yes, there must be a high-quality dataset. But of course, this is far from easy for a startup to develop.

“Data creates an interesting chicken-and-egg problem,” said Yoskovitz. “Without a customer, you don't have data, which means you cannot train your algorithms. Without algorithms, you are not able to provide value to your customers and compete in the market. Therefore you will not have customers to provide data.”
What to do? You can look at forming partnerships, such as with companies that may not have strong AI capabilities. Or another approach is to create a free app that collects data.
“What we have found is that to build a successful AI startup, the key is sourcing and building proprietary data,” said Saniya, who is the CEO and co-founder of Pilota. “This is what makes your business defensible and attractive to investors. Almost every investor has asked us where our data comes from and what would stop others who can access this data from replicating what we do. So when creating a business centered around AI, it is extremely important to make sure that your data is proprietary and you are not just building a business on analyzing public datasets.”

But even with a good dataset, this is still not enough. For example, does the AI model make a real difference? Or are the results mostly minor improvements?
“Investors are interested in startups that are building tailored AI solutions for previously unsolvable problems,” said Jay Srinivasan, who is the CEO and co-founder of atSpoke. “So focus on areas where there are many inefficiencies and repetitive human processes, such as call centers and back-office paperwork processing. Investors want successful AI solutions that address specific workflows and problems, such as a legal document review.”

Then there is the issue of adoption.  Let’s face it, customers are still leery of the powers of AI. It does not help that the models are often complex and opaque. There are also the nagging problems with bias.

“Know your customer,” said Vasiliy Buharin, who is the Associate Director of Product Innovation at Activ Surgical. “You may have the algorithm to solve the worst LA traffic or shorten airplane boarding time 10-fold. But if the solution requires people to behave like preprogrammed automatons, it will never be adopted, and your company will fail. Your customer has a certain way of doing things. Your product must fit this workflow.”
Given all the challenges, a startup will likely undergo multiple pivots.  This is why you need a top-notch team that works well together. 
“If you start with a problem and leave yourself open to many different solutions, you will learn from the market and find the best solution to build your business around,” said Sean Byrnes, who is the CEO of Outlier. “Spending six months exploring and selecting the right problem can save you six years of wasted effort trying to build a business around a flawed idea.”
