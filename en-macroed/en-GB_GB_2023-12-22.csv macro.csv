AI-powered image generators are transforming the way we create images, and there are endless applications for the technology both in and out of business.From generating realistic images of non-existent objects to enhancing existing images, AI image generators are changing the world of art, design, and entertainment. With that said, understanding the technology behind AI image generators and how to use it can prove challenging for beginners.In this piece, we’ll provide a comprehensive guide to AI image generators, including what they are, how they work, and the different types of tools available to you. Whether you’re an artist looking to enhance the creative process or a business owner wanting to streamline your marketing efforts, this guile will provide a starting point for AI image generators.What is an AI Image Generator?An AI image generator, also known as a generative model, is an artificial intelligence system designed to create new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions. These systems use machine learning (ML) algorithms that can learn from large datasets of images, allowing them to generate new images that are similar in style and content to the original dataset.The main advantage of AI image generators is that they can create images without human intervention, which can save time and resources in many industries. For example, in the fashion industry, AI image generators can be used to create clothing designs or style outfits without the need for human designers. In the gaming industry, AI image generators can create realistic characters, backgrounds, and environments that would have taken months to create manually.There are different types of AI image generators, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular types of AI image generators include style transfer, which allows users to transfer the style of one image onto another, and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), which use two neural networks to generate realistic images that resemble the original dataset. Regardless of the type, AI image generators have immense potential to revolutionize how we create and consume visual content.What are the Benefits of an AI Image Generator?There are many benefits of AI image generators, such as:Time-saving: One of the most significant benefits of AI image generators is their ability to save time. Instead of spending hours or even days creating an image from scratch, AI image generators can generate high-quality images within minutes.Cost-effective: AI image generators save money by reducing the need for human designers or artists. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses or startups with limited resources.Creativity boost: AI image generators can inspire creativity by generating unique and unexpected images that human designers may not have thought of. This can lead to new and innovative design ideas that can set a brand or product apart from the competition.Customization: AI image generators can be customized to generate images that meet specific requirements or preferences. This can be particularly useful for businesses that require images with specific branding or design elements.Scalability: AI image generators can generate a large number of images quickly and efficiently, making them ideal for creating large volumes of visual content for marketing, advertising, or other purposes.Consistency: AI image generators can create images that are consistent in style and quality, which can help establish a brand's visual identity and improve overall brand recognition.Accessibility: AI image generators can make visual content creation more accessible to people who may not have design or artistic skills. This can democratize the creative process and give more people the opportunity to create high-quality images.Versatility: AI image generators can be used across a wide range of industries and applications, from fashion and gaming to healthcare and education. This versatility makes them a valuable tool for businesses and individuals alike.How Do AI Image Generators Work?AI image generators work by using machine learning algorithms to generate new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions.In order to train the AI image generator, a large dataset of images must be used, which can include anything from paintings and photographs to 3D models and game assets. Ideally, the dataset should be diverse and representative of the images that the AI image generator will generate.The AI image generator is then trained using ML algorithms that can learn from the patterns and features present in the dataset. In training, neural networks identify and extract specific features from images, such as shapes, textures, and colors.Once the AI image generator has been trained, it can generate new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions. These parameters can include things like style, color, texture, and shape. The input parameters can be set by a user or determined by the AI image generator itself.The model uses the input parameters to generate a new image. The process involves using the ML algorithms to combine and manipulate the features learned during training to create a new image that meets the input parameters. This process of generating a new image can be repeated multiple times in an iterative process to create variations or refine the image until it meets the desired specifications.Finally, the AI image generator outputs the generated image, which can be saved, edited, or used in any way the user sees fit.To summarize, AI image generators work by using ML algorithms to learn from large datasets of images and generate new images based on input parameters. The technology behind these models is constantly evolving, and it has the potential to transform how we create and consume visual content.*When providing the input to generate new images with the model, you want to use AI prompt engineering. You can find our guide on the topic here.Limitations of AI Image GeneratorsIt’s important to note that AI image generators also have various limitations when it comes to generating images with precise details. While these tools are a powerful way to create visual content, they are not always perfect in their current form. The quality of the generated image can be heavily reliant on the pre-trained images that the model uses, meaning that if the data used to train the AI is not representative of the desired output, the generated image may not be accurate.Another one of the main challenges of AI image generators is generating realistic human faces. Creating these accurate faces is not an easy task, and image generators can often produce artificial-looking images. All of this is the result of the complex nature of human faces. To capture the various nuances, the model requires a large dataset of human faces that can prove challenging to both acquire and train on.Impacting Artists and DesignersAI image generators are having a big impact on designers and artists, and they are going to change the way these individuals operate. AI can speed up and supplement the creative process by quickly generating work, saving time, money, and resources. Artists and designers can begin with a strong idea rather than a completely blank canvas. For example, if you want to create new icons for an interface, you can input text and generate numerous ideas.With that said, many artists and designers may need to change the way they work as AI models begin to take over some of the responsibilities. Instead of spending hours on designing, they may need to work with the machine and it’s generated art. This shift will likely require a different way of thinking throughout the entire process, which is also true for various other industries impacted by AI.*To begin trying out AI image generators, check out own Best AI Art Generators page.

However, alongside the ample benefits come complications, such as disrupting existing roles, shifting skill requirements, and affecting workforce composition, according to the latest research from McLean &amp; Company, a global HR research and advisory firm. The newly published industry resource, Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI, provides insights that will help HR leaders understand the workforce planning implications of generative AI and adjust initiatives to fill the talent gap.""Generative AI has the potential to disrupt organisations by automating tasks, reshaping roles, and shifting talent requirements,"" says Lisa Highfield, principal director of Human Resources Technology &amp; Artificial Intelligence at McLean &amp; Company. ""The success of organisations in leveraging generative AI to drive organisational objectives hinges on HR to address the underlying impacts on talent.""Organisations that adopt generative AI are more likely to gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and performance, the firm's resource explains. To successfully leverage new technologies, McLean &amp; Company highlights in the blueprint that organisations must first determine how generative AI use supports the organisation's strategic objectives to discover its impact on the workforce, and in turn, the talent demand, supply, and gap.""HR can address the talent gap driven by generative AI by adjusting and developing strategic HR initiatives to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent,"" explains Highfield.To support HR leaders in the future of work, which continues to be heavily impacted by generative AI developments, McLean &amp; Company offers research insights on how to navigate the impact of AI on talent, split into two key sections in the blueprint. An overview of the research is outlined below:Section One: Understand workforce planning implicationsThe first section discusses the anticipated influence of generative AI on roles, tasks, skills, and workforce demographics. For example, roles requiring a higher degree of decision-making and problem-solving, organisational knowledge, creativity and innovation, and social and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated.The guidance and insights in section one can also help HR leaders understand the impact of generative AI on roles, how it will change the demand for technical and non-technical skills, and how generative AI may contribute to the digital divide and disproportionately affect certain populations. Section Two: Address talent gapsThe second section identifies actions HR can take to reduce talent gaps driven by generative AI and ensure the organisation has the right talent in place to meet objectives. Examples of these actions include understanding when to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent to respond to organisational needs appropriately, and determining the next steps needed to address talent gaps.Additionally, section two will support HR leaders in planning to address generative AI's impact on workforce planning initiatives and adjusting HR initiatives to plan for the talent gap driven by the new technologies.McLean &amp; Company suggests that while workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption even without a formal workforce planning process.",HRTech,https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Online Bureau', 'url': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/author/479261596/online-bureau'}, {'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'ETHRWorldSEA', 'url': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com'}]","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Agencies', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-106277811,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4/.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}]","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",ETHRWorldSEA,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",contactus@ethrworld.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read part one here, part two here and part three here. Across industries, there is rampant concern that generative artificial intelligence — the kind that powers OpenAI's ChatGPT — is powerful enough to take jobs from human workers. But to some degree, that trend was already underway before the popularization of gen AI.  ""A lot of financial services companies are IT shops,"" said Luke Penca, head of emerging technologies at the consultancy Capco. Goldman Sachs, for example, employed 10,000 engineers, representing 25% of its total workforce, as of 2020. ""They're always hunting for an information advantage,"" Penca said. ""They're going to process ever larger volumes of data, be more and more real-time and things like that. These are use cases that are perfect for the deployment and application of AI.""What gen AI adds to this process is its ease of working at scale. It's best at handling quantities of data that are so massive that simply throwing more people at the task won't be enough to dent it, Penca said.The technology can also be trained to handle single tasks well enough that, if a person's job is focused on that task, that job can be handled by AI. There are still caveats; customer-facing interactions may seem like low-hanging fruit, but large language models like ChatGPT can be easily manipulated (intentionally or otherwise) into giving false information, creating more customer service issues than they resolve. Nevertheless, some companies have already taken the plunge and committed to shifting certain tasks from humans to gen AI.

In what seems like the blink of an eye, mentions of artificial intelligence (AI) have become ubiquitous in the healthcare industry. 
From deep learning algorithms that can read computed tomography (CT) scans faster than humans to natural language processing (NLP) that can comb through unstructured data in electronic health records (EHRs), the applications for AI in healthcare seem endless.







But like any technology at the peak of its hype curve, artificial intelligence faces criticism from its skeptics alongside enthusiasm from die-hard evangelists.
Despite its potential to unlock new insights and streamline the way providers and patients interact with healthcare data, AI may bring considerable threats of privacy problems, ethical concerns, and medical errors.
Balancing the risks and rewards of AI in healthcare will require a collaborative effort from technology developers, regulators, end-users, and consumers.
The first step will be addressing the highly divisive discussion points commonly raised when considering the adoption of some of the most complex technologies the healthcare world has to offer.

AI WILL CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO IN HEALTHCARE
AI in healthcare will challenge the status quo as the industry adapts to new technologies. As a result, patient-provider relationships will be forever changed, and the idea that AI will change the role of human workers to some extent is worth considering.
Seventy-one percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup in 2018 believed that AI will eliminate more healthcare jobs than it creates, with just under a quarter indicating that they believe the healthcare industry will be among the first to see widespread handouts of pink slips due to the rise of machine learning tools.
However, more recent data around occupational shifts and projected job growth don’t necessarily bear this out.
A report published earlier this year by McKinsey & Co. indicates that AI could automate up to 30 percent of the hours worked by US employees by 2030, but healthcare jobs are projected to remain relatively stable, if not grow.
The report notes that health aides and wellness workers will have anywhere from 4 to 20 percent more of their work automated, and health professionals overall can expect up to 18 percent of their work to be automated by 2030.
But healthcare employment demand is expected to grow 30 percent by then, negating the potential harmful impacts of AI on the healthcare workforce.
Despite these promising projections, fears around AI and the workforce may not be entirely unfounded.
AI tools that consistently exceed human performance thresholds are constantly in the headlines, and the pace of innovation is only accelerating.
Radiologists and pathologists may be especially vulnerable, as many of the most impressive breakthroughs are happening around imaging analytics and diagnostics. 
In a 2021 report, Stanford University researchers assessed advancements in AI over the last five years to see how perceptions and technologies have changed. Researchers found evidence of growing AI use in robotics, gaming, and finance.
The technologies supporting these breakthrough capabilities are also finding a home in healthcare, and physicians are starting to be concerned that AI is about to evict them from their offices and clinics. However, providers’ perceptions of AI vary, with some cautiously optimistic about its potential.
“Recent years have seen AI-based imaging technologies move from an academic pursuit to commercial projects. Tools now exist for identifying a variety of eye and skin disorders, detecting cancers, and supporting measurements needed for clinical diagnosis,” the report stated.
“Some of these systems rival the diagnostic abilities of expert pathologists and radiologists, and can help alleviate tedious tasks (for example, counting the number of cells dividing in cancer tissue). In other domains, however, the use of automated systems raises significant ethical concerns.”
At the same time, however, one could argue that there simply aren’t enough radiologists and pathologists — or surgeons, or primary care providers, or intensivists — to begin with. The US is facing a dangerous physician shortage, especially in rural regions, and the drought is even worse in developing countries around the world.
AI may also help alleviate the stresses of burnout that drive healthcare workers to resign. The epidemic affects the majority of physicians, not to mention nurses and other care providers, who are likely to cut their hours or take early retirements rather than continue powering through paperwork that leaves them unfulfilled.
Automating some of the routine tasks that take up a physician’s time, such as EHR documentation, administrative reporting, or even triaging CT scans, can free up humans to focus on the complicated challenges of patients with rare or serious conditions.
Most AI experts believe that this blend of human experience and digital augmentation will be the natural settling point for AI in healthcare. Each type of intelligence will bring something to the table, and both will work together to improve the delivery of care.
Some have raised concerns that clinicians may become over-reliant on these technologies as they become more common in healthcare settings, but experts emphasize that this is unlikely to occur, as automation bias isn’t a new topic in healthcare, and there are existing strategies to prevent it.
Patients also appear to believe that AI will improve healthcare in the long run, despite some concerns about the technology’s use.
A research letter published in JAMA Network Open last year that surveyed just under 1,000 respondents found that over half believed that AI would make healthcare either somewhat or much better. However, two-thirds of respondents indicated that being informed if AI played a big role in their diagnosis or treatment was very important to them.
Concerns about the use of AI in healthcare appear to vary somewhat by age, but research conducted by SurveyMonkey and Outbreaks Near Me — a collaboration between epidemiologists from Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School — shows that generally, patients prefer that important healthcare tasks, such as prescribing pain medication or diagnosing a rash, be led by a medical professional rather than an AI tool.
But whether patients and providers are comfortable with the technology or not, AI is advancing in healthcare. Many health systems are already deploying the tools across a plethora of use cases.
Michigan Medicine leveraged ambient computing – a type of AI designed to create an environment that is responsive to human behaviors – to further its clinical documentation improvement efforts in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Researchers from Mayo Clinic are taking a different AI approach: they aim to use the tech to improve organ transplant outcomes. Currently, these efforts are focused on developing AI tools that can prevent the need for a transplant, improve donor matching, increase the number of usable organs, prevent organ rejection, and bolster post-transplant care.
AI and other data analytics tools can also play a key role in population health management. A comprehensive strategy to manage population health requires that health systems utilize a combination of data integration, risk stratification, and predictive analytics tools. Care teams at Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation (PCCI) and Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas are leveraging some of these tools as part of their program to address preterm birth disparities.
Despite the potential for AI in healthcare, though, implementing the technology while protecting privacy and security is not easy.  


AI PRIVACY AND SECURITY CHALLENGES
AI in healthcare presents a whole new set of challenges around data privacy and security – challenges that are compounded by the fact that most algorithms need access to massive datasets for training and validation.
Shuffling gigabytes of data between disparate systems is uncharted territory for most healthcare organizations, and stakeholders are no longer underestimating the financial and reputational perils of a high-profile data breach.
Most organizations are advised to keep their data assets closely guarded in highly secure, HIPAA-compliant systems. In light of an epidemic of ransomware and knock-out punches from cyberattacks of all kinds, chief information security officers have every right to be reluctant to lower their drawbridges and allow data to move freely into and out of their organizations.
Storing large datasets in a single location makes that repository a very attractive target for hackers. In addition to AI’s position as an enticing target to threat actors, there is a severe need for regulations surrounding AI and how to protect patient data using these technologies.
Experts caution that ensuring healthcare data privacy will require that existing data privacy laws and regulations be updated to include information used in AI and ML systems, as these technologies can re-identify patients if data is not properly de-identified.
However, AI falls into a regulatory gray area, making it difficult to ensure that every user is bound to protect patient privacy and will face consequences for not doing so.
In addition to more traditional cyberattacks and patient privacy concerns, a 2021 study by University of Pittsburgh researchers found that cyberattacks using falsified medical images could fool AI models.
The study shed light on the concept of “adversarial attacks,” in which bad actors aim to alter images or other data points to make AI models draw incorrect conclusions. The researchers began by training a deep learning algorithm to identify cancerous and benign cases with more than 80 percent accuracy.
Then, the researchers developed a “generative adversarial network” (GAN), a computer program that generates false images by misplacing cancerous regions from negative or positive images to confuse the model.
The AI model was fooled by 69.1 percent of the falsified images. Of the 44 positive images made to look negative, the model identified 42 as negative. Of the 319 negative images doctored to look positive, the AI model classified 209 as positive.
These findings show not only how these types of adversarial attacks are possible, but also how they can cause AI models to make a wrong diagnosis, opening up the potential for major patient safety issues.
The researchers emphasized that by understanding how healthcare AI behaves under an adversarial attack, health systems can better understand how to make models safer and more robust.
Patient privacy can also be at risk in health systems that engage in electronic phenotyping via algorithms integrated into EHRs. The process is designed to flag patients with certain clinical characteristics to gain better insights into their health and provide clinical decision support. However, electronic phenotyping can lead to a series of ethical pitfalls around patient privacy, including unintentionally revealing non-disclosed information about a patient.
However, there are ways to protect patient privacy and provide an additional layer of protection to clinical data, like privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Algorithmic, architectural, and augmentation PETs can all be leveraged to secure healthcare data.
Security and privacy will always be paramount, but this ongoing shift in perspective as stakeholders get more familiar with the challenges and opportunities of data sharing is vital for allowing AI to flourish in a health IT ecosystem where data is siloed and access to quality information is one of the industry’s biggest obstacles.


ETHICS, RESPONSIBILITY, AND OVERSIGHT
The thorniest issues in the debate about AI are the philosophical ones. In addition to the theoretical quandaries about who gets the ultimate blame for a life-threatening mistake, there are tangible legal and financial consequences when the word “malpractice” enters the equation.
Artificial intelligence algorithms are complex by their very nature. The more advanced the technology gets, the harder it will be for the average human to dissect the decision-making processes of these tools.
Organizations are already struggling with the issue of trust when it comes to heeding recommendations flashing on a computer screen, and providers are caught in the difficult situation of having access to large volumes of data but not feeling confident in the tools that are available to help them parse through it.
While some may assume that AI is completely free of human biases, these algorithms will learn patterns and generate outputs based on the data they were trained on. If these data are biased, then the model will be, too.
There are currently few reliable mechanisms to flag such biases. “Black box” artificial intelligence tools that give little rationale for their decisions only complicate the problem – and make it more difficult to assign responsibility to an individual when something goes awry.
When providers are legally responsible for any negative consequences that could have been identified from data they have in their possession, they need to be certain that the algorithms they use are presenting all of the relevant information in a way that enables optimal decision-making.
However, stakeholders are working to establish guidelines to address algorithmic bias.
In a 2021 report, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) suggested that the rule of thumb should be to assume that AI algorithms contain bias and work to identify and mitigate those biases.
“The proliferation of modeling and predictive approaches based on data-driven…techniques has helped to expose various social biases baked into real-world systems, and there is increasing evidence that the general public has concerns about the societal risks of AI,” the report stated.
“Identifying and addressing biases early in the problem formulation process is an important step to improving the process.”
The White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)’s ‘Blueprint for Trustworthy AI Implementation Guidance and Assurance for Healthcare’ have also recently provided some guidance for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI, but these can only go so far.
Developers may unknowingly introduce biases to AI algorithms or train the algorithms using incomplete datasets. Regardless of how it happens, users must be aware of the potential biases and work to manage them.
In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the first global report on the ethics and governance of AI in healthcare. WHO emphasized the potential health disparities that could emerge as a result of AI, particularly because many AI systems are trained on data collected from patients in high-income care settings.
WHO suggested that ethical considerations should be taken into account during the design, development, and deployment of AI technology.
Specifically, WHO recommended that individuals working with AI operate under the following ethical principles:


Protecting human autonomy
Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest
Ensuring transparency, explainability, and intelligibility
Fostering responsibility and accountability
Ensuring inclusiveness and equity
Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable


Bias in AI is a significant negative, but one that developers, clinicians, and regulators are actively trying to change.
Ensuring that AI develops ethically, safely, and meaningfully in healthcare will be the responsibility of all stakeholders: providers, patients, payers, developers, and everyone in between.
There are more questions to answer than anyone can even fathom. But unanswered questions are the reason to keep exploring — not to hang back. 
The healthcare ecosystem has to start somewhere, and “from scratch” is as good a place as any. 
Defining the industry’s approaches to AI is a significant responsibility and a golden opportunity to avoid some of the past mistakes and chart a better path for the future.
It’s an exciting, confusing, frustrating, optimistic time to be in healthcare, and the continuing maturity of artificial intelligence will only add to the mixed emotions of these ongoing debates. There may not be any clear answers to these fundamental challenges at the moment, but humans still have the opportunity to take the reins, make the hard choices, and shape the future of patient care.

Put You out of WorkTOPICS:Artificial Intelligence By Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences December 25, 2023A new study reveals that work experience significantly affects how employees interact with AI. Employees with greater task-specific experience benefit more from AI, whereas senior workers are less likely to trust AI due to concerns over its imperfections. The findings emphasize the need for tailored strategies when integrating AI in the workplace to enhance human-AI teamwork.





New research reveals intricate aspects of human-AI interactions, highlighting a surprising trend: artificial intelligence systems tend to benefit junior employees, but not for the reasons you’d expect.New research published in the INFORMS journal Management Science offers valuable insights for business leaders regarding the impact of work experience on employee interactions with artificial intelligence.The study explores the effects of two primary forms of human work experience—narrow experience, which is defined by the volume of specific tasks, and broad experience, characterized by overall seniority—on the dynamics within human-AI teams.  Surprising Findings from a Medical Chart Coding Study“We developed an AI solution for medical chart coding in a publicly traded company and conducted a field study among the knowledge workers,” says Weiguang Wang of the University of Rochester and leading author of the study. “We were surprised by what we found in the study. The different dimensions of work experience have distinct interactions with AI and play unique roles in human-AI teaming.”“While one might think that less experienced workers should benefit more from the help of AI, we find the opposite – AI benefits workers with greater task-based experience. At the same time, senior workers, despite their greater experience, gain less from AI than their junior colleagues,” says Guodong (Gordon) Gao of Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, and study co-author.The Dilemma of Seniority and AI TrustFurther investigation reveals that the relatively lower productivity lift from AI is not a result of seniority per se but rather their higher sensitivity to the imperfection of AI, which lowers their trust in AI.“This finding presents a dilemma: Employees with greater experience are in a better position to leverage AI for productivity, but the senior employees who assume greater responsibilities and care about the organization tend to shy away from AI because they see the risks of relying on AI’s assistance. As a result, they are not effectively leveraging AI,” says Ritu Agarwal of Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, a co-author of the study.The researchers urge employers to carefully consider different worker experience types and levels when introducing AI into the work. New workers with less task experience are disadvantaged in leveraging AI. Meanwhile, senior workers with more organizational experience may be concerned about the potential risks imposed by AI. Addressing these unique challenges are key to productive human-AI teaming.

AI developers, engineers, and consultants are seeing a lot of new job opportunities — even at companies outside the traditional tech world. And the pay is good, with many AI-related job postings listing salaries of well over $100,000.Companies are on the hunt for job candidates whose knowledge of AI can help them use their in-house data more extensively — for instance, to make better predictions and decisions, said Aaron Sines, a director at the Austin-based tech-recruiting company Razoroo. One agriculture client was looking to potentially use AI to help estimate crop yields, he said earlier this year.""The demand for professionals with knowledge in AI research, machine learning, deep learning — it truly outpaces the available supply of candidates,"" Sines said.That means companies are offering salaries above six figures to attract experienced candidates: The base salary for AI researcher roles, even at non-tech companies, could range from $150,000 to $250,000, Sines said.

""There's certainly a scarcity, I think, and our clients are acutely aware of that, which inherently is driving upward pressure on compensation,"" he said. JPMorgan Chase is hiring for a software engineer who can develop generative AI models with a base pay of $194,750 to $285,000. Experience working with machine learning algorithms and knowledge of the latest generative AI research are listed as preferred qualifications for the job, which was posted in mid-December.Meanwhile, Disney is looking to hire a senior machine-learning engineer with expertise in machine learning, algorithms, and statistical methods; the entertainment giant is offering an annual salary of $145,400 to $199,870, its listing says for the job that was posted in early December.A few months prior, the insurance company Travelers listed a data-engineer role that sought AI expertise, with a base pay of $113,900 to $188,000.

Before she graduated high school, Michele Rosenthal knew that she wanted to dedicate her life to art. close dialogclose dialogShe had always wanted to be a professional illustrator. When it came time to apply to colleges, she decided to attend art school, where she majored in illustration before becoming a professional freelance artist.""What I really love is art,"" she said in an interview with TheStreet.  But over the last year — in the wake of the launch of ChatGPT, Stability AI and the like — the business of art has become more difficult. AI trends: What experts, execs think artificial intelligence will look like in 2024Read MoreAI trends: What experts, execs think artificial intelligence will look like in 2024Read MoreIndustries that before paid illustrators for their work have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence image generators. The jobs, Rosenthal said, have begun to dry up.Rosenthal's initial response to AI image generation was that there is no real comparison between an artist and an algorithm. A professional artist, she said, brings far more to a job than an output. What she didn't expect was how quickly so many people — with such haste — would choose to adopt AI tools as a means of replacing flesh-and-blood humans. ""The shockwaves are real,"" she said. ""Artists are definitely feeling the results of everyone adopting this technology so quickly."" Still, Rosenthal doesn't think the current bump in the road of the professional artist will be a permanent reality. If people want something new, she said, they still have to turn to a human artist; AI models produce a mere amalgamation of their training data, they don't seem truly creative. The ethics of AIArtificial intelligence is not a new technology. But with the launch of ChatGPT last year, it became consumer-facing in a whole new way, touching off an AI arms race as startups and tech giants alike raced to be the first to ship products. That race has been mirrored in courtrooms and government buildings as regulators have struggled to understand the technology so that they can figure out how best to regulate it. And a debate, meanwhile, has been ongoing within the field about the harms, risks and benefits of AI. A piece titled 'Triple Self Portrait' by Michele Rosenthal. Courtsey of Michele RosenthalAmong these ethical concerns — which include algorithmic discrimination, misinformation, political instability, data privacy and more — are questions of copyright infringement and fears of job loss. Over the past few months, several lawsuits have been filed by groups of authors and artists against the companies behind these models. A class action lawsuit, filed in September by the Authors Guild, alleges that Microsoft  (MSFT)  and OpenAI, without providing notice, credit or compensation, use copywritten work as the underpinning of their models. ""These algorithms are at the heart of Defendants' massive commercial enterprise,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""And at the heart of these algorithms is systematic theft on a mass scale.""OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on this piece. Another case, brought by a group of visual artists against Stability AI, Midjourney and other companies, argues a similar premise: ""AI image products are primarily valued as copyright-laundering devices, promising customers the benefits of art without the costs of artists.""The companies involved have argued that the content they train their models on is ""fair use,"" a claim that could, if true, supersede copyright violations. The U.S. Copyright Office said in August that it had undertaken a study of copyright law as it relates to generative AI to determine how best to treat the sector.  ""Training generative AI models in this way is, to me, wrong,"" Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and technologist, wrote in a Nov. 15 op-ed. ""Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works.""Newton-Rex in November resigned from his position leading Stability AI's Audio team, based, he said, on a disagreement over the company's impression that copyrighted work is fair use. Saying that the act of training on copyrighted work amounts to the exploitation of creators, Newton-Rex questioned the model as an unjust disruptor of existing copyright practices in the arts. He has instead supported generative models that are trained only on licensed content and are further transparent about the content in their training sets. As the legality of the issue is battled out in court, with the potential result of further enforcing existing laws against copyright infringement in the U.S., there has been a growing point of contention between creatives and those who have embraced AI content and image generators over the myriad nuances of creativity, and the differences between human and algorithmic creation. TheStreet spoke with a series of experts, including AI researchers, psychologists who specialize in the study of human creativity and the artists themselves about the differences between algorithmic output and human creation, the importance of the creative process, the impact of human creativity and the important differences between art as a hobby and art as a profession, and the ways in which AI can impact both. The ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreThe ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreHow LLMs 'create'Large Language Models (LLMs) — like ChatGPT — are, at their core, predictive models. Trained on an enormous quantity of data (the first ""L"" in ""LLM"") that includes books, newspaper articles, social media content, photos and videos, the output of any generative AI model is tied directly to its input, something that cannot quite be said for humans.  The Atlantic reported in September that a dataset called ""Books3"" was used to train models by Meta, Bloomberg and others. The dataset included more than 191,000 books, the basis of a July lawsuit filed against Meta by writers Sarah Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden.Generative text models, according to AI researcher Dr. John Licato, essentially output a ""probability distribution that's defined over a set of possible tokens."" ""There's a very specific mathematical function that it's trying to optimize when it's doing that training process,"" he told TheStreet. ""It's trying to make it so that the probability distribution best reflects the training data.""Though Licato noted some similarities between the creative processes of humans and AI models, he said that there is an ""inherent limit"" to what LLMs can actually output. Stability diffusion and high-quality datasetsWhen it comes to diffusion image generation — a method employed by Stability AI — models learn the base construction of an image by removing the noise from images in a given dataset so they can produce variations of each image. The artist lawsuit against Stability and its peers notes that ""the primary objective of a diffusion model is to reconstruct copies of its training images with maximum accuracy and fidelity.”The complaint goes on to cite a research scientist at Google DeepMind, Nicholas Carlini, who in a 2023 research paper stated that ""diffusion models are explicitly trained to reconstruct the training set."" DeepFloyd IF, an image generator launched in April by Stability AI, was trained on a high-quality dataset that contained one billion image and text pairs. Stability AI did not respond to TheStreet's request for comment on this piece. A low-quality dataset will produce low-quality output. A piece titled 'Autumn' by Michele Rosenthal.Courtesy of Michele RosenthalLikewise, a biased dataset will produce a biased output. And without datasets at all, such models would be unable to produce anything. AI expert and Ivanti CPO Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala told TheStreet that LLMs cannot generalize any more than they can feel. Such models can only 'create' based exclusively on the information in their training set. ""It doesn't have senses. It doesn't have human empathy behind it,"" Mukkamala said, noting that humans, on the other hand, can both feel and express. ""As a technologist, LLMs are very limited, from the dataset they've been fed with, to the human that's behind it and what you're asking it to answer."" Artificial Intelligence is a sustainability nightmare — but it doesn't have to beRead MoreArtificial Intelligence is a sustainability nightmare — but it doesn't have to beRead MoreHow humans createHumans, on the other hand, are, as Rosenthal said, much more than a mere algorithm. The technical process of human creativity, according to artist and Duke assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience Dr. Paul Seli, is one of generation and evaluation. The working hypothesis, he told TheStreet, is that the brain's default mode network — which is active during passive rest — is at work during the generation of creative ideas. The brain's prefrontal regions are then associated with the process of determining whether those ideas are any good.A recent study conducted by Dr. Ariana Anderson, assistant professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA, found highly creative people had more randomness in their brain activity than simply intelligent people. AI, she told TheStreet in an interview, might be considered ""smart"" due to the size of the datasets the models are trained on. But AI can't ""extrapolate beyond what it's been trained, whereas human brains can."" The random turnings inherent to highly creative brains allow such people, humans, to find and explore new creative areas they ""wouldn't have found if they were pre-programmed."" Dr. Roger Beaty, creativity expert and assistant professor of psychology at PennState, told TheStreet that, while AI output might sometimes seem novel or creative, it's ""not really a fair comparison because of the vastness of knowledge that the AI has access to.""Indeed, current LLMs, according to Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, are trained on text data that he said would take a human ""20,000 years to read."" 'Gaussian Noise, Human Hands,' by Eryk Salvaggio, was a series of art created using an exploit in Stable Diffusion that resulted in the model creating an abstract image. The result is a piece of art that ""barely"" touches the training data, instead producing ""strange forms."" Courtesy of Eryk SalvaggioRegardless, Beaty said that AI models ""don't have experiential episodic memory, which is also kind of relevant to creativity when you think about drawing on personal experiences for inspiration.""The source of that personal inspiration, according to Seli, more than just being fueled by personal experiences and emotions, comes from a deeply human attempt to ""take our subjective experience and share it with other people."" Human inspiration, Seli said, goes far beyond a 'training set' of previously consumed art, literature or music. ""One of the primary purposes of art is to serve as a communicative element of our inner experience,"" Seli said. ""We can share emotions in ways that words can't capture."" Why humans createHow humans get inspired and create represents an important distinction between the strictly mathematical process that AI algorithms utilize. But the answer to the question of why humans create is perhaps more important. Seli conducted a study in July where participants were asked to grade how creative they found a given set of artworks. The entire set of artwork featured exclusively AI-generated art, though the labels each participant saw — which categorized a work as either human or machine-made — were randomized. The study concluded that people found allegedly human-produced art to be more creative than AI art. ""If we think that a human did it, then we assume that the art is communicating some experience, and then we like it because we can relate to it or we can gain some sort of empathic insight into what it's like to be that person,"" Seli said. ""But with AI, we don't have the same empathic experience.""Seli noted an inherent emptiness to the communicative abilities of AI art, a sentiment that was echoed by new media artist Eryk Salvaggio. A viewer can look at an AI-generated image and be moved by it, but regardless of the viewer's impression, ""there's nothing on the other side of that communication. There's no intention in that communication. There's no meaning in that communication.""And it is that need to communicate that, according to Seli, remains at the very core of what art is and why humans are so drawn to it. It all comes down to a powerful human urge to take isolated experiences and establish a wider level of connection. ""The more welcome we feel in this existence, the more understood. And I think that's the point,"" Salvaggio said. A piece titled 'Tea Break' by Michele Rosenthal. Courtesy of Michele RosenthalThe creation of art, even on the professional level, holds true to that base value of a need for raw, human expression. The dataset that artists work with, Rosenthal said, goes far beyond reference shots, encompassing instead ""everything we've ever experienced and every emotion that we've ever had."" Rosenthal said that at the core of all human art is a powerful urge to symbolically express some element of the artist's human experience. A certain brushstroke, or a particular passage from a poem, or, Seli said, a musical melody, can elicit a strong emotional response from a varied audience. That response is the result of intimate human connection. The act of creating art, for David Depasquale, a professional artist who has worked as an art director and character designer in television, has been an avenue for personal expression and escapism throughout his life. Pursuing it professionally was a ""need.""""It was the only place that I found where my mind just was quiet for a little while,"" he told TheStreet. The importance of that process and that personal expression is on display in his professional work as much as it is in his personal work. None of Depasquale's work comes from a cold place of pure output, a common misconception about an artist's approach when working professionally. ""I get hired as an artist personally for my sensibilities, for my ideas, for my experiences in life and where I've come from,"" Depasquale said. ""Every single character I've designed is from a very personal place.""Good artists, he said, are not just hired for their output, they are hired for the unique humanity, process and soul that they bring to the job of creation, which is why he's not concerned about AI taking his job. ""You have to draw from something personally to be able to communicate something that someone else is going to recognize and translate,"" Rosenthal said, noting that the process of exploring artistic inspiration revolves around answering certain questions of ""what is the image in my mind that I want to make?"" and ""what is the feeling that I want it to evoke?"" This need for symbolic emotional expression — a passion that drove both Rosenthal and Depasquale to pursue art professionally — points to the more philosophical nature of art itself: the vibrant soul ensconced within a piece of art, and the vitality of an often laborious artistic process. The Cloud is vulnerable. Is Chain Reaction the solution?Read MoreThe Cloud is vulnerable. Is Chain Reaction the solution?Read MoreThe soul of artArt, according to Depasquale, is far more than just the final product. And artists are far more than their output. ""You don't play the piece of music you're playing just to get to the end. You play it for the joy of playing the whole thing,"" Depasquale told TheStreet. ""The reality is that the whole process is the art and that's what AI removes."" A growing obsession with ""efficiency and instant gratification"" has, according to Depasquale, fueled the recent proliferation of artificially generated art, something that is merely the latest evolution in the ongoing and damaging commoditization of art itself. ""You hear a piece of AI-generated music and it might sound nice on the surface, but there's nothing behind it,"" he said. ""It's empty. It's an empty door; you can't go through it.""Public conversation that focuses on the economics of art, rather than its inherent emotionality, has further enhanced this perspective. Still, Depasquale does not hate AI, nor does he think AI will take away his livelihood. AI, he said, is a machine and a tool. It ""has no emotions."" The real issue Depasquale has with AI is the ""humans behind it, and how they've chosen to wield this tool."" ""I'm more afraid of the devaluation of art than I am of a machine taking my job,"" he said. The value of human creativity A world without art and creativity, Seli said, ""would be a hell of a lonely place for us."" Rosenthal said that this point represents the ""secret weapon"" of art itself, something that ""AI will never be able to produce."" ""Art making is about human connection and really good art can create more empathy,"" she said. ""The experience of connecting with someone else's experience; that's really powerful. That's what makes art so valuable.""""I hope that doesn't get lost.""But in a more macro sense, human creativity — stretching beyond the arts — improves human society, according to Dr. Anderson. Every technological revolution human society has experienced, Anderson said, was incited by highly creative people. ""Technology can be very beneficial when it is developed by creative people because it can really alleviate human suffering around the world,"" she said. ""But we should always remember that the creative people are the ones who should be guiding it.""And if human society begins to over-rely on AI as a means of replacing artists and art with algorithmically derived, mathematical amalgamations of the art it was trained on, the result, according to Depasquale, could be the downfall of civilization. ""It sounds hyperbolic. And I kind of mean it to be, but I think that is what destroys human civilization,"" he said. ""The arts and creativity is what kept humans going since the dawn of time. Creative people are the people who are the keepers of culture and the keepers of human civilization.""When there is nothing else left, Depasquale said, there is still art, which can be made with a stick in the mud as much as it can be made on a computer or with a pen and paper. The history of humanity can be traced through art and the stories that art has told. This transcends language and modernity, stretching back to the time of the Neanderthal and their cave paintings that today inform historians how they lived.""People always have this instinct to create. And I think removing that or trying to remove that from humanity will destroy humanity,"" he said. ""Human culture is exhibited through art; you can't remove that from humanity. That's like taking out somebody's heart. They can't survive without that.""Art represents the essence and importance of boundless human communication, communication not fettered by the constructs of language or time. And the essence, or soul, of that, Depasquale said, cannot be artificially produced. ""No matter how minutely detailed AI can get, you can never manufacture that, you can't manufacture vision through an artist's eyes or hands or whatever they're using to create,"" he said. ""That's the end of civilization.""Think tank director warns of the danger around 'non-democratic tech leaders deciding the future'Read MoreThink tank director warns of the danger around 'non-democratic tech leaders deciding the future'Read MoreIntentionality in co-creativityDespite its already-established ability and ongoing potential to wreak havoc and harm across the professional art industry, some are looking at AI as a tool that, with the right intentions, can be used to help enhance human creativity, rather than limit it. Seli noted preliminary findings in which the artists themselves seem to be better at using AI image generators than non-artists. ""It's a tool. It doesn't level the playing field in some equality of outcome way with art,"" he said. ""It's just new tools, and you can use them or not, but if you're better at painting a piece you seem to be better at using DALL-E.""Another entry in Eryk Salvaggio's 'Gaussian Noise, Human Hands"" series. Courtesy of Eryk SalvaggioThough he is sure that people will take advantage of these models, Seli found that it can be useful on occasion as a sounding board, an initial step in his own process of artistic inspiration and creation. For Salvaggio, who recently taught a course on AI art at Bradley University, generative AI represents an enormous tool with countless creative possibilities. Art, he told TheStreet, is not the commercial pursuit of image creation. There is much more nuance to the field, and to the kinds of creativity AI can enable and enhance, and the ways in which AI can limit creativity. In his artistic work with AI, Salvaggio is always attempting to figure out ways in which he can essentially trick an AI model into making something new.Much of the work he's done with AI has been through a lens of ""creative misuse."" The reason for this approach is that Salvaggio doesn't trust the datasets that power these models, and so doesn't want to rely on them when using them to create a piece of art that is unique to him. ""Most artists don't want to create something that is so literally in dialogue with things that they don't know,"" he said. ""If I want to make work that is in dialogue with other artists, I want to choose how that is represented and I want to choose what that conversation is.""In the act of prompting an AI model, Salvaggio doesn't have much say in what image the model spits out. There is no dialogue with other artists, there is no credit to other artists and there is no ability to extend a story begun by other artists. There is only the generation of an abstraction of other work. Such models also pose an additional challenge to creatives who are attempting to break new ground; no artist, Salvaggio said, wants to put something out there that ""runs the risk of being something that someone else has done."" Prompting alone is not enough. And relying on prompting is creatively limiting — a user might get outputs that are almost exactly what they asked for, something that jeopardizes the relationship between artist and art through something Salvaggio called ""curational creativity."" A still from 'Sarah Palin Forever,' which uses AI images and deepfake voice technology to tell the story of a 17-year-old girl who has spent her entire life inside a looping Sarah Palin rally in Bangor, Maine. The film was a way for Salvaggio to explore the unsavory side of AI and political manipulation, while telling a clearly fictional science-fiction story. Courtesy of Eryk SalvaggioThe central component of his creative process is ""screwing up, making the thing you didn't want to make and the learning that comes from that."" ""There's a constant flow between myself and the work that I'm making where I am putting something in to the best of my capacities, seeing the limits of those capacities, and then calibrating to what's on the page,"" he said. ""There's almost a dialogue with the ideas that are in my head and the ideas that are being expressed.""The challenges, posed by AI, that exist within Salvaggio's new media space are the same faced by many traditional artists. The limits of a person's artistic capabilities, Salvaggio said, are usually defined in terms of commercial viability, which is a violation of the artistic process. The artistic process is about ""our relationship to making"" and ""finding a way to express ourselves within our own minds,"" he said. The idea that AI image generators democratize art suggests that art isn't inherently democratic; it ""isn't a problem with art. It's a problem with the market.""As such, Salvaggio's biggest concern is not about AI, something he engages with as a tool, but with the profession of art itself. Creativity, he said, will always exist, a sentiment that was echoed almost verbatim by everyone TheStreet spoke with for this piece: AI will not and cannot stop human artistic creation. The real question at hand is the industry of professional art, from illustrators to writers and actors, and issues of exploitation and job loss. ""Humans are naturally creative. We've been making art since the beginnings of human history and we're not going to stop anytime soon,"" Rosenthal said. ""I think it's a shame that the people who are hiring artists seem to have lost respect for artists, seem to think that artists could be replaced by something that is just an algorithm.""Contact Ian with AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.By Ian KrietzbergIan Krietzberg is a tech reporter for The Street.

Authors, worried that large language models had been trained using their books, filed a handful of lawsuits against OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and others. So did visual artists, against Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DeviantArt, and more. None of those suits has reached any kind of conclusion, and some argue copyright claims aren’t the way to stop the bots from absorbing creative work, but the suits did turn the courts into yet another battlefield, in addition to picket lines, on which humans pushed back against AI incursion.By the end of 2023, governments entered the fray. In early November, US president Joe Biden signed an executive order attempting, among other things, to curtail AI’s impact on human work and provide “federal support for workers facing labor disruptions, including from AI.” Unions, including SAG, praised the move, which came as world leaders were heading to the UK for the AI Safety Summit, where, as my colleague Will Knight wrote, they sought to contain the threats of machine learning while also harnessing its power.That has always been the tricky part.

AI in India: India's job landscape is experiencing a seismic shift driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). While routine tasks in sectors like data entry and call centres face automation, a surge of opportunities is blossoming in data science, engineering, and machine learning.





    Premium AI Wave Washes Over India: From Routine to Robotics, Transforming Jobs Across Industries

OpenAI’s entrance marked a turning point, automating routine tasks and disrupting employment sectors like data entry and call centres. However, the AI wave also brought a surge of opportunities in data science, engineering, and machine learning, creating a new landscape of high-skilled jobs. Mint speaks with hiring experts to probe into AI’s impact on Indian jobs after its emergence.Experts told Mint that AI has caused both disruption and adaptation, with challenges like the digital divide coupled with social unrest balanced by the potential of AI to revolutionize traditional sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and education.World Economic Forum (WEF) anticipates that AI will generate 12 million more jobs than it displaces by 2025. India houses a talent base of 416K AI professionals as of August 2023 as opposed to the current demand of approximately 629K, a figure expected to surge to 1 million by 2026, according to a report by Wheebox National Employability Test (WNET).Young employability surges to 51.25 per cent, with Haryana, Maharashtra, and UP leading in talent concentration, the report added.Over 85 per cent of employers foresee AI generating new job opportunities within the next 1-5 years. This optimism is shared by around 63 per cent of job seekers, with 53 per cent believing that AI will create more jobs. Sectors like Education, Healthcare, Media, Finance, and Technology witness significant enthusiasm from 50-65 per cent of job seekers toward AI adoption. However, industries such as Construction, Logistics, Government, and Transportation display a more reserved response, an Indeed India survey revealed.What is the overall impact of AI?AI is already changing how we work, and its influence is only going to grow. Instead of replacing people, AI is designed to boost human abilities and help us, said Ruchee Anand, Senior Director of Talent and Learning Solutions at LinkedIn India.AI is still in its nascent stages; there have been very minimal negative effects, said Sumit Sabharwal, Head of HRSS, Fujitsu International Regions.AI has significantly impacted the employment sector in India by automating several tasks, leading to job displacement in some industries but also creating new opportunities in AI-related fields, according to Jaideep Kewalramani, COO &amp; Head of Employability, TeamLease, Edtech.However, Indian job seekers have concerns, including the necessity for reskilling or upskilling, fears of potential job displacement, and ethical considerations, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, observed.AI also provided a promising solution to address recruitment bias by relying on objective criteria like qualifications and skills, minimizing the influence of unconscious biases in hiring decisions. “AI tools promise up to 40 per cent bias reduction, helping increase gender, race and background diversity within teams, Vikram Ahuja, Co-Founder of ANSR and CEO of Talent500, observed.Which sectors have AI boosted employment?Job roles such as data scientist, data analyst, machine learning, Cloud Engineer, and stack developers will be in high demand for both Tech and Non-Tech sectors that aim to employ 11.15 lac tech Talent by FY 2027 from the current 7.65 lac employed, Munira Loliwala, AVP- Strategy and Growth of TeamLease Digital opined.“While some job categories shrink, new ones bloom. AI development, data science, cybersecurity, and robotics engineering are witnessing robust growth, creating exciting opportunities for tech-savvy individuals,” said, Balasubramanian A Vice President &amp; Business Head, TeamLease Services.AI has opened gates for new industries, skills and opportunities, claimed Karthik Sridharan, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Flexiple. AI has unlocked opportunities in fields like consumer apps, CRM applications, learning products, and financial apps.&nbsp;LinkedIn data showed that AI-powered shifts will cause a 65 per cent change in skills that are in demand by 2030. Gen Z was seen as more eager to learn new skills. “We’ve seen a 1.1x increase in LinkedIn learners who are spending 1.8x more time learning since September 2021,” Anand of LinkedIn India noted. Some of the top skills, according to LinkedIn findings, are investing in programming languages, data science, cloud computing, data analysis, and project management skills.Speaking on AI’s impact on a number of opportunities, Felix Kim, co-founder and CEO of Redrob, said, “AI is a force multiplier. AI will increase the disparage between the skilled and unskilled workers.”Which sectors have witnessed decline in opportunities?According to a Gartner survey, 69 per cent of managerial tasks are automatable, emphasizing the necessity for a strategic fusion of AI and human capabilities.Automated systems and AI algorithms can handle data entry and processing tasks more efficiently than manual efforts, impacting jobs in this sector. Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI have streamlined customer service, revealed Devashish Sharma, founding member and CEO at Taggd.Additionally, legal, accounting, and finance sectors have been negatively impacted by AI. Salaries, especially in developed countries like the U.S., have seen a 30 per cent decline over the past 10 years after you factor in inflation, Kim opined.AI hasn’t necessarily resulted in a net negative impact on sectors; instead, it has transformed job landscapes, demanding new skill sets and creating opportunities in emerging fields, opined Sekhar Garisa, CEO of foundit.Administrative roles, manual labour in manufacturing, some transportation jobs, telemarketers, basic accounting and bookkeeping are some of the mundane tasks that AI may have put at risk, noted Sarbojit Mallick, Co-founder of Instahyre.Skill up to prepare for the AI ageCandidates need to update their skill sets to leverage AI tools to supercharge their work. Further, aligning their skills with what is in demand will also improve their opportunities to land roles and also the ability to gain better salaries, Sridharan opined.

Americans are flocking to the gig economy for extra income and job flexibility, but the AI boom could make independent jobs a necessity — rather than a choice.That's because three of AI's potential impacts — making jobs easier, more competitive, and in some cases, obsolete — could each make gig work more prevalent.A record 63 million Americans, 38% of the workforce, performed freelance — or gig work — in 2023, according to an Upwork survey of 3,000 US adults conducted in the fall. The most popular gig jobs weren't what you might imagine, like ride-hailing or delivery drivers, but workers who provided knowledge services such as computer programming, marketing, or IT — this group accounted for 47% of all independent workers.

Bosses could opt for fewer full-time workers in the age of AIAI tools like ChatGPT are expected to boost some workers' productivity, in part by automating a portion of their work tasks. A McKinsey study found that up to 30% of hours worked in the US could be automated by 2030.

When a worker's job tasks require fewer hours than they used to, their boss might simply give them additional work or responsibilities. But there's a more negative possibility, Alexandrea Ravenelle, assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, who specializes in the gig economy, told Business Insider. Their boss could decide they're no longer providing enough value to warrant a full-time salary and benefits.""If a worker has realized that they can replace some of their efforts with AI, there's a good chance that their boss has already picked up on that too,"" she said. ""And if part of a worker's job can be filled by AI, why would an employer pay someone for a full day?""

There are plenty of work tasks AI can't do. But if it can do enough, Ravenelle said, more companies might decide to use gig workers —who are oftentimes less expensive — to fill in the gaps.""AI can diagnose a patient, but we still need an actual human to do the exam and enter the data,"" she said as one example. ""Or AI can drive a truck, but we still need humans — for now — to load the truck.""

Ravenelle said this dynamic could play out in many professions, including lawyers, writers, public relations, and marketing.The adoption of AI tools could make it easier for companies to find gig workersIf more companies look for gig workers to replace some of their full-time employees, there could be plenty to choose from. That's because AI tools are helping people become proficient at a variety of work tasks — potentially boosting the labor supply for many professions.If companies can trust AI-assisted independent workers to get the job done, they might turn to them more, Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist who studies AI, told Business Insider.""More complex tasks, like market research, are now much easier to do with the help of generative AI,"" he said. ""And so there is a lot of cheap labor around the world that companies might tap into rather than hiring people in-house.""

AI job replacement could push more Americans into the gig economyIn addition to making jobs easier and more competitive, AI could eliminate some jobs.When full-time jobs are eliminated, some impacted workers might seek employment in the gig economy to make ends meet — boosting the number of total gig workers. A 2018 study found that for every 1% uptick in unemployment in a given US county, there was an average increase of 22% in the number of residents actively working on gig platforms.But AI could eliminate some gig jobs as well, Frey said, citing copywriting and translation work as two possibilities. He said this is among the reasons it remains an open question whether AI will exacerbate or reverse gig work's recent growth.If certain gig workers are forced to find other work, some might pursue traditional employment. But others might just look for new jobs in the gig economy.

""I don't see gig work disappearing,"" Ravanelle said. ""I see it continuing to grow, and I think that we are going to need to really rethink our strategy as a society in terms of ensuring that workers have economic stability and then have access to benefits if their only income is coming from 1099 work.""If a world with more gig jobs means workers receive lower pay and fewer benefits, many workers could be worse off. But if gig work's positive attributes — like flexibility — provide opportunities for workers of all ages to boost their incomes, then it's not all bad news, Kweilin Ellingrud, a senior partner at McKinsey who has researched generative AI and the future of work, told Business Insider.""Figuring out how to create more flexible work for a broader set of people, including an aging workforce, could be a real boon to our productivity, to our economy, to businesses,"" she said. ""It doesn't only have to be a negative.""Are you a worker whose job has been impacted by AI, for better or for worse? If so, reach out to this reporter at jzinkula@businessinsider.com.

It's
happening,
the
worst
nightmare
for
anyone
working
in
the
corporate
world
is
becoming
true.
Artificial
Intelligence
is
slowly
taking
away
jobs.
From
the
clattering
looms
of
the
18th
century
to
the
power
looms,
to
robots
in
factories
to
artificial
intelligence,
each
wave
of
technological
advancement
has
gnawed
away
human
jobs.
But
AI
is
different.     
PAYTM
&
GOOGLE
TO
FIRE
1000s
OF
EMPLOYEES            
India's
Paytm
is
axing
jobs
to
cut
costs,
highlighting
a
broader
trend
in
the
tech
industry,
and
emphasising
the
growing
impacts
of
AI
in
workforce
dynamics.
One
97
Communications,
parent
of
fintech
firm
Paytm
confirmed
the
lay-offs.
""We
will
be
able
to
save
10-15%
in
employee
costs
as
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI)
has
delivered
more
than
we
expected
it
to,""
the
spokesperson
told
Reuters.
On
Friday
Google
parent
Alphabet
Inc
announced
12,000
job
cuts.
That's
6%
of
its
global
workforce.
Google
is
the
latest
tech
giant
to
retrench
after
years
of
abundant
growth
and
hiring.         Did
Delhi's
Overnight
Rain
Come
From
Artificial
Cloud
Seeding?   
MACHINES
ON
THE
MARCH:
CAN
WE
ADAPT? 
Each
leap
in
technology,
from
the
telegraph
to
the
smartphone,
has
chipped
away
at
human
labour,
making
once-vital
jobs
obsolete.
Today,
computers
are
getting
smarter
at
every
click
of
the
mouse,
and
with
every
web
search,
it
is
learning
and
evolving.
Machines
are
becoming
efficient
in
using
algorithms
to
crunch
numbers
and
solve
problems.
Self-driving
cars
are
navigating
the
streets,
so
drivers
won't
be
in
much
demand
soon.
Chatbots
are
getting
smarter
and
may
soon
replace
tele-callers
and
answer
questions,
pushing
the
boundaries
of
automation
further.   
THE
IMPACT
OF
ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE
-
WIDESPREAD
JOB
LOSSES 
In
the
1950s,
the
automation
of
switchboard
operations
in
the
US
alone
displaced
400,000
telephone
operators.
In
1900,
41
percent
of
Americans
worked
in
agriculture;
by
2000,
it
dwindled
to
only
2
percent.
Again,
in
the
post-World
War
II
years
30
percent
of
Americans
were
employed
in
the
manufacturing
sector,
today
it
has
dropped
to
around
10
percent.
According
to
a
survey
done
by
Oxford
Economics,
a
UK-based
research
firm,
lower-skilled
regions,
which
tend
to
have
weaker
economies
and
already
high
unemployment
rates,
are
much
more
vulnerable
to
job
losses.
Again
a
recent
study
by
the
Bank
of
Korea
said
some
3.9
million
jobs
in
South
Korea
were
at
risk
as
AI
adoption
grows.   
WHAT
JOBS
WILL
AI
REPLACE? 
AI
is
replacing
and
will
continue
to
replace
some
jobs.
Workers
in
industries
ranging
from
healthcare
to
agriculture
and
industrial
sectors
can
all
expect
to
see
disruptions
in
hiring
due
to
AI.
There
are
some
professions
which
are
especially
vulnerable.
According
to
experts,
jobs
like
Telemarketing,
Accountants,
Receptionists,
Proofreaders,
Doctors,
Chemists
&
Computer
Support
Specialists.     For
the
first
time
Supreme
Court
uses
Artificial
Intelligence
for
live
transcription
of
hearings       
HOW
CAN
WE
OVERCOME
THE
AI
WAVE? 
While
new
opportunities
arise,
not
everyone
can
surf
the
wave
of
automation.
The
skills
gap
between
those
displaced
and
the
jobs
of
the
future
widens
with
each
passing
year.
But
amidst
the
gloom,
flickers
of
hope
remain.
While
AI
undeniably
automates
some
tasks,
it
also
creates
new
ones.
Adaptability
and
reskilling
will
be
key
for
individuals
to
navigate
this
shifting
technological
landscape.
Machines
will
continue
to
evolve,
there
is
no
stopping
them.
But
we
humans
need
to
rise
to
the
challenge
and
ride
the
AI
wave. Its game time -  play now!
