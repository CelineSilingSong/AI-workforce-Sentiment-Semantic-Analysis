Artificial intelligence will drastically transform the economy and the workplace. Which skills will be required and is training the all-encompassing solution?

In the automation and digitalisation we experienced hitherto, people were given a machine—such as a laptop with the usual office software, a 3D printer or a computer-numeric-controlled milling machine—which they could use to perform their job. Knowledge and communication became more mobile. At the same time, the new machines made possible customised production.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems enable machines to work with people. As they are being introduced into the workplace, new kinds of co-operation are already being defined. And there is little doubt AI systems will play a far greater role in people’s lives. In the future, machines could predict errors or disruptions in work processes (for example, in the context of predictive maintenance) or conduct the beginning of a phone call with a customer.

These changes require adaptations. But who will have to adapt? Who will determine which adaptions are made and what form should they take?
Expectations placed on workers
We often hear that workers should receive continued training, to remain ‘employable’. And who has anything against training? Yet the debate isn’t progressing beyond general demands. How individual professions and sectors are affected, as well as the corresponding satisfaction of the demand for training, have not been adequately addressed or implemented. Instead, expectations are placed on workers to behave in an economically rational way—and to kindly get some training.
Participation in continued professional training programmes has in fact risen since 2010 and while now stagnating is at around 50 per cent. On-the-job training enjoys particularly high acceptance. But it is also clear that not all workers are being reached. Individuals with less formal education, those in smaller firms, those who are older or who work part-time participate less in continued training.

One study actually showed that those workers who can be easily replaced are the least likely to participate in training. In a way, we are perpetuating the inequalities of our school system. We are in danger of of ending up with an even more divided labour market, with well-paid specialists on the one side and a new precariat which performs ancillary tasks—before and after the algorithm—on the other.
Contextual conditions
To ensure that current changes lead to more rather than less social cohesion, we have to create contextual conditions that make workers feel protected from unfulfillable demands. After a 40-hour working week, most of us do not have the time alongside family and care work to take part in a training programme.
This will become even less likely if labour gives into demands from the employer lobby for more flexible working times and a softening of free time. We must create more time and space to empower and protect workers who—for whatever reason—don’t want this. Here legislation, such as in Germany the Qualification Opportunity Act and the Work-for-Tomorrow Act, as well as in-company guidance on continued training, should play an important role.
With these legislative initiatives, Germany’s labour minister, Hubertus Heil, has already proposed or begun to enact improvements. Under discussion are the many aspects of how to finance continued training programmes. In the Work-for-Tomorrow Act, continued training is made extremely attractive for companies affected by structural change.
Workers don’t just need subsidies—they need time and guidance. And the Federal Labour Office has been offering continued training advice since the beginning of 2019. A right to continued training should guarantee that employers provide enough time for it. Under such conditions, programmes can be created that empower workers. 
Works councils
Works councils are key actors making sure that such opportunities are actually used. They are not ‘inhibitors’, trying to prevent the introduction of AI systems. Rather, they ensure that processes are implemented well and that tasks are redistributed. They do the preliminary work that will lead to greater acceptance of AI systems within companies, while at the same time providing better working conditions for the workforce.
For this to happen, we need works councils that are knowledgeable about the material. At the same time, works-council members, especially those who are not exempted from their regular tasks to take care of their works-council duties, have enough on their plate. We cannot simply unload additional tasks on to them. So they must be able to bring external expertise, on AI, data privacy and additional aspects of digitalisation, into the workplace.
Some employers are already engaged in active union-busting. In future, it will be even easier to hinder the activities of works councils if workers see and talk to each other less and less, because they will ever more frequently be working at different times and in different locations. A sense of belonging and exchange with works councils can be weakened this way.
As a reaction, work councils must also become more digital. As companies are redefined, we also need new forms of organising works councils—for example, by organising the next election via a Messenger group. We want to address such issues and others in an amendment to the Works Council Constitution Act.
Shaping the transformation
But which abilities and skills, which kinds of knowledge will broad segments of the population—such as, for example, a 56-year-old steel worker, a 32-year-old father working part-time or a 61-year-old tax adviser on a temporary contract—need in the future, to help shape the transformation and get closer to the goal of good work?
Already today, human-machine co-operation places new demands on workers. How will we deal with our algorithmic or robotic colleagues?
Complete trust in an AI system or dealing blindly with decision processes—similar to the annoying clicking away of cookie settings on websites and the acceptance of unread terms and conditions—should not be what we see in workplaces. For this reason, the ability to think critically and to question results is all the more important.
Such ability must be founded on basic knowledge of how AI systems work. This does not mean everyone needs to be able to write code. But we should learn that AI systems and their decision-making processes have strengths and weaknesses. A successful instance of the imparting of knowledge is the ‘Elements of AI’ online course, now available in a number of EU languages, including German.
Technical knowledge also remains relevant because it empowers workers to provide critical feedback on the implementation and continued development of AI systems—because not each and every technical possibility can be practically and reliably implemented. Technical knowledge keeps workers on an equal footing with the algorithms.
Besides good formal training, tomorrow’s workplace will require from workers more communication and teamwork, because the tasks under discussion will only be able to be mastered by a group. Here, workers’ ability to give and receive constructive criticism will be key to maintaining their ability to keep learning.
What are called ‘soft skills’ today could soon prove to be ‘hard skills’, essential for companies’ success. Such skills are formed and fine-tuned through their daily application. Both employers and employees face the challenge of organising work in the future in a way that will foster these indispensable skills. 
Good work
Through works councils and staff committees, workers must be integrated into the planning of continued training. This includes the development of training programmes and the form they will take, and the preparation of plans for a qualified workforce.
It is the duty of social democracy to make sure that human beings don’t get the short end of the stick in the human-machine partnership. At the end of the day, machines should enable more autonomy and bring us closer to the goal of good work. We do not need another relationship of dependency in which the machine is constantly telling us where to go and which movements we should make.
We’ll do that ourselves. To be able to codetermine the shape of the workplace of tomorrow, we need new contextual conditions, of which education and continued training are part—but only part.

In fact, our entire ecosystem, including the food we eat and the air we breathe, counts on pollinators. But the pollinator population is declining according to Sabiha Rumani Malik, the founder and executive president of The World Bee Project. But, in an intriguing collaboration with Oracle and by putting artificial intelligence, internet of things and big data to work on the problem, they hope to reverse the trend.
How Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Big Data Can Save The BeesAdobe Stock

Why is the global bee population in decline?

According to an Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report, pollinators are in danger. There are many reasons pollinators are being driven to extinction, including habitat destruction, urbanization, use of pesticides, pollution, fragmentation of natural flowering habitats, predators and parasites, and changing climate. However, until recently, with The World Bee Project's work, there hasn't been a global initiative to study bee populations or to research and attack the issue from a global perspective.

Why is it important to save the bees?

Did you know that bees, along with other pollinators, such as butterflies, are the reason plants can produce seeds and reproduce? According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 35 percent of food crops and three-quarters of the world’s flowering plants depend on bees and pollinators. In fact, in order to ensure the almond crop gets pollinated in California each year, most of the beehives in the United States are shipped to California to ensure it. In fact, bees help to pollinate 90% of the leading global crop types, including fruit trees, coffee, vanilla, and cotton plants. And, of course, healthy plants are critical in replenishing our oxygen supply thanks to photosynthesis.  
PROMOTED
If the pollinators aren't alive or healthy enough to do their job, our global crop production, food security, biodiversity, and clean air is in peril. Honeybees are the world's most important pollinators. As much as 40 percent of the global nutrient supply for humans depends on pollinators. Presently there are approximately 2 billion people who suffer deficiencies of micronutrients.
“Our lives are intrinsically connected to the bees,” Malik said.

Partnership to monitor global honeybee population
The World Bee Project is the first private globally coordinated organization to launch and be devoted to monitoring the global honey bee population. Since 2014, the organization has brought together scientists to study the global problem of bee decline to provide insight about the issue to farmers, governments, beekeepers, and other vested organizations.

How technology can save the bees
How could technology be used to save the bees? Technology can be leveraged to help save the bees in a similar way that it is applied to other innovative projects. First, by using internet-of-things sensors, including microphones and cameras that can see invasive predators and collect data from the bees and hives. Human ingenuity and innovations such as wireless technologies, robotics, and computer vision help deliver new insights and solutions to the issue. One of the key metrics of a hive's health is the sounds it produces. Critical to the data-gathering efforts is to ""listen"" to the hives to determine colony health, strength, and behavior as well as collect temperature, humidity, apiary weather conditions, and hive weight.
The sound and vision sensors can also detect hornets, which can be a threat to bee populations.
The data is then fed to the Oracle Cloud, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms get to work to analyze the data. The algorithms will look for patterns and try to predict behaviors of the hive, such as if it's preparing to swarm. The insights are then shared with beekeepers and conservationists so they can step in to try to protect the hives. Since it's a globally connected network, the algorithms can also learn more about differences in bee colonies in different areas of the world. Students, researchers, and even interested citizens can also interact with the data, work with it through the hive network's open API, and discuss it via chatbot.
For example, the sound and vision sensors can detect hornets, which can be a threat to bee populations. The sound from the wing flab or a hornet is different from those of bees, and the AI can pick this up automatically and alert beekeepers to the hornet threat.
Technology is making it easier for The World Bee Project to share real-time information and gather resources to help save the world's bee population. In fact, Malik shared, ""Our partnership with Oracle Cloud is an extraordinary marriage between nature and technology."" Technology is helping to multiply the impact of The World Bee Project Hive Network across the world and makes action to save the bees quicker and more effective.

A multitude of factors, including technological advancements like big data, artificial intelligence, mobile, cloud-based HR and labor technology, are contributing to rapid change. Artificial intelligence, specifically, is predicted to drive the future of work, yet multiple reports indicate that human resources professionals are ill-equipped to make this happen successfully.Believe it or not, the HR function is no stranger to artificial intelligence and many HR functions already utilize the unsupervised learning and predictive modeling benefits that come along with AI, especially in tasks such as recruiting and training. AI for recruiting, for example, is an existing category of HR technology designed to reduce — or even remove — time-consuming activities like manually screening resumes.   New generations entering the workforce, and older generations delaying retirement, are contributing to larger applicant pools, so HR professionals are already experiencing the lift of having an AI-backed system to identify qualified candidates. Employing AI technology for the repetitive parts of standard HR tasks like sourcing, screening and nurturing candidates will increase and grow into more sophisticated tasks, like scheduling interviews and even engaging with and interviewing candidates. Although there are existing areas within the HR function that already leverage the power of AI, the rapid pace of digitization and technology disruption will enhance the need for further expansions. IBM predicts that 120 million workers in the world’s ten largest economies will need to be reskilled in the next few years to adapt to an AI-driven marketplace. Additionally, Deloitte’s 2018 Global Human Capital Trends report reveals a similar sentiment, stating that while 72% of respondents think adopting AI is vital for their business, only 31% feel ready to address this transformation.   But failure to implement wholesale changes backed by digitization and insight-driven learnings will result in the loss of an organization’s competitive edge, and HR departments will have to account for the ensuing adverse effects on long-term growth. So this brings the question, will HR be replaced by AI? The short answer is no. Instead, HR will be enhanced by the insights and capabilities that will inherently come with AI’s unsupervised learning and predictive modeling.

   Most organizations that have invested and integrated AI into their HR functions have a new perspective that’s worth noting. Think of HR jobs now as a hybrid model with people and technology co-existing. Best practices in this hybrid model focus on carefully designed work and processes with specific delineations on who or what is doing the activity — additionally, monitoring and measuring how you utilize AI with human oversight is imperative. Continual learning needs to be reviewed by an HR leader to avoid biases and other unintended consequences of automating tasks and processes.The future workforce will see a hybrid of both humans and technology working together seamlessly. AI will not replace work that requires empathy, problem-solving, social skills, or emotional intelligence. It’s not about technology replacing the personal touch; it’s about technology enabling the personal touch and raising the bar. While efficiencies may reduce the number of HR roles in the future overall, the type of work performed by HR professionals will be higher paying, and more strategic, high-value based responsibilities.In addition to the artificial intelligence benefits that are currently leveraged by many HR professionals, future examples of AI-based HR capabilities include:Productivity: This will develop through email and time management insights, workplace redesign and internal talent mobility.Management: HR professionals leveraging AI to analyze engagement feedback and assess managerial readiness and team health.Compensation: AI can identify gender and age inequality, matching pay to demand and optimizing reimbursement to market figures.Artificial intelligence is positioned to plan a role in nearly every HR domain, changing and enhancing every process. The way organizations source, assess, hire, train, develop, pay, and move people will all be informed by AI.Companies can reframe the integration of AI as a complement to human expertise rather than a zero-sum game in which humans fill in for what machines cannot accomplish yet. With the increase of automated software and chatbots, AI has the power to become a secret workhorse for HR departments delivering exponential growth in the next three to five years. The responsibility of leveraging systems of intelligence to better inform decisions on recruitment, assessments, learning, management, career advancement, compensation, wellbeing, compliance and productivity, among others, will fall squarely on the shoulders of HR departments. Utilizing machine learning to assist the human touch will soon become the price of entry, versus the exception to the rule.

 Artificial intelligence (AI)is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.    Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.    Rail engine has given an unforeseen speed to the world. And penicillin has changed the dynamics of the field of medicine drastically. Then, the advent of computer has made a telling impact, on mankind altogether. Now, another revolutionary game changer of even bigger magnitude is making its way into the human life in a never-seen-before kind of fanatic pace;that is Artificial intelligence (AI).With a brain that thinks, learns, logics just as a human being does, the AI is giving a new momentum to machinery and institutions alike. Now experts say most of the new career opportunities are going to be for those who take get mastery over this AI. In this context, let us take a good look at what this AI is about, the kind of impact it is going to make on job opportunities and so on…   The world is changing with a rapid pace, thanks to the ever new innovative technological changes and advancements, which in effect is throwing a great challenge to the mankind. Sensing the abundant opportunities, this phenomena is throwing open, most of the students are falling in line and trying to catch up with the new AI technologies for a better and brighter future. In this context, it can undoubtedly be said that the most impactful technological invention of this century is definitely going to be the AI. Many surveys say the number of inventions in India is going to increase by two times by 2021. India has already been taking firm steps in terms of strategies and plans that would help in the manifold growth of the AI.   What is AI?   Computer needs a language for it to work. It doesn’t work unless programmes are executed. It is a machine that does not do anything by thinking on its own and only executes the pre-directed work. But the Artificial Intelligence (AI) is totally different. Machines can take their own decisions according to the situation with the help of the AI. The humanoid robot- Sofia, designed by Hong Kong’s Hanson Robotic Company in 2016, is an example of this. This robot is a computer algorithm that learns by observing the environment around, just as a human being does. When a particular task is performed repeatedly with the computer that has an AI fitted, it thinks over on its own as to how that task can be bettered, and even corrects if there be any mistakes in the course of performing the said task. The mobiles that we use now already have a bit of the AI fitted into them. It suggests possible words when something is even being typed in. Likewise, it separates spam and promotional mails as well. In a sense, the computer thinks the way we would want it to, and makes the task easier for us.   These are all AI  Alexa voice speaker is a well-known tool which answers the queries of the users. The technology used in it is none other than the AI. Likewise, the AI software ‘AlfaGo’ developed by Google’s DeepMind is considered the toughest game in the world. And China’s ‘Go’ has defeated even the Grandmasters. It could do so by understanding the whole old data of the game that was installed into it, playing the game over and over again, and correcting improving itself. IBM has also designed an AI called Watson. Facebook also designed computers named Bob and Elice, which work based on the AI, but later on done away with them as they started conversing in a language that is understood only between the two of them.   The way forward  There is a little doubt the world will revolve around the AI in the near future. The doctors have already used the AI to diagnose melanoma. Many recruiters also have been of the late depending on it to zero in on their human resources. Australia’s biggest energy firm Woodside has also used IBM’s ‘Watson’. It claimed this move enabled results in their research in less than one fourth of the time compared with that done by its employees. Many firms around the world have improved their efficiency by using IBM’s AI technology. This technology enables improved marketing efficiency and better results. It even tracks the moods and purchasing patterns of the customers beforehand for the firms. Thus, they stand a good chance of improved performance.   Caution needed  It seems the AI will be put into use in many fields in a massive scale. It re-emphasizes the need of continuous improvisation of AI skills the experts in the said fields possess. Especially those who want to be or to come into corporate companies, they should upgrade their AI knowledge to get through the interviews and get recruited.   Types  AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields:   Machine learning, A neural network, Deep learning, Cognitive computing, Computer vision, Natural language processing.   Opportunities  Artificial intelligence is not here to replace us. It augments our abilities and makes us better at what we do. Because AI algorithms learn differently than humans, they look at things differently. They can see relationships and patterns that escape us. This human, AI partnership offers many opportunities. It can:      Bring analytics to industries and domains where it’s currently underutilized.  Improve the performance of existing analytic technologies, like computer vision and time series analysis.  Break down economic barriers, including language and translation barriers.  Augment existing abilities and make us better at what we do.  Give us better vision, better understanding, better memory and much more.    The goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks, but it’s not a replacement for humans – and won’t be anytime soon.
