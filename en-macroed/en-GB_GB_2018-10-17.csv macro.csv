To reach A.I.’s potential, we need to think beyond what it does for search, social media, security, and shopping – and beyond making things merely “smarter”.Instead, we should imagine how A.I. can be both smart and compassionate, a combination that can solve the most important human problems. Good design can lead the way by infusing an approach centered around the user and the real needs that A.I. can address.We should be thinking about A.I. in new contexts – the newborn of the overworked parent, the cancer patient who needs round-the-clock attention, and the child with learning and behavioral difficulties. A.I. holds great promise for them in combination with design that is empathic and follows a few principles.First, good design should help without intruding. A.I. must free our attention rather than take it away, and it must enhance human connection and abilities rather than replace humans. Great design can create A.I. interfaces that fit discreetly and seamlessly into users’ lives, solving problems without creating distraction.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSecond, good design can bring A.I.’s benefits to those who otherwise might be left out. That so much of A.I. is currently directed at the affluent contradicts the notion that good design can serve everyone, regardless of age, condition or economic background. We should take the “A.I. for all” approach, and it should follow a human need. Designers and researchers should work together in the early stages of design to identify those needs, develop A.I. that responds compassionately to human demands, and use design to ensure cost-effective, accessible A.I.-enabled products and services.Third, A.I. should never create emotional dependence. We see this danger in social media, where A.I. traps users in echo chambers and emotional deserts. Thoughtful design can create A.I. experiences that evolve with the user to continuously serve their needs. The combination of good A.I. and good design can ultimately create products that help people live healthier, longer and happier lives.This is not a purely utopian vision. It is achievable. Developers must recognize that while they can do important, valuable work for a range of commercial products and consumers, the most meaningful A.I. will touch those with greater needs and lack of access. The result will mean well-designed products and experiences that tackle real needs, with the power to improve, not complicate, human lives.ImageCredit...Ike EdeaniLILA IBRAHIMChief operating officer, DeepMindArtificial intelligence offers new hope for addressing challenges that seem intractable today, from poverty to climate change to disease. As a tool, A.I. could help us build a future characterized by better health, limitless scientific discovery, shared prosperity and the fulfillment of human potential. At the same time there’s a growing awareness that innovation can have unintended consequences and valid concern that not enough is being done to anticipate and address them.Yet for A.I. optimists, this increasing attention to risks shouldn’t be cause for discouragement or exasperation. Rather, it’s an important catalyst for thinking about the kind of world we want to live in — a question technologists and broader society must answer together.Throughout history few, if any, societal transformations have been preceded by so much scrutiny and speculation about all the ways they could go wrong. A sense of urgency about the risks of A.I., from unintended outcomes to unintentional bias, is appropriate. It’s also helpful. Despite impressive breakthroughs, A.I. systems are still relatively nascent. Our ambition should be not only to realize their potential, but to do so safely.Alongside vital public and political conversations, there’s plenty of technical work to be done too. Already, some of the world’s brightest technological minds are channeling their talent into developing A.I. in line with society’s highest ethical values.For example, as more people and institutions use A.I. systems in everyday life, interpretability — whether an A.I. system can explain how it reaches a decision — is critical. It’s one of the major open challenges for the field, and one that’s energizing researchers across the world.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA recent research collaboration between DeepMind and London’s Moorfields Eye Hospital demonstrated a system that not only recommended the correct referral decision for over 50 eye diseases with 94 percent accuracy but also, crucially, presented a visual map that showed doctors how its conclusions were reached.Meanwhile, researchers at Berkeley have been studying how humans can make sense of robot behavior, and in turn, develop ways for robots to signal their intentions. A team at OpenAI has developed approaches for interpretable communication among humans and computers. Others at DeepMind have been working on A.I. “theory of mind” — the ability to model what drives other systems’ actions and behaviors, including beliefs and intentions.These are just early examples of progress. Much more must be done, including deeper collaborations between scientists, ethicists, sociologists and others. Optimism should never give way to complacency. But the fact that more energy and funding is being invested into this kind of fundamental research is a positive sign. After all, these challenges are as complex, as important, and should be as prestigious as the many other impressive achievements in the A.I. field to date.Awareness of risks can also be a call to action. It’s precisely because A.I. technology has been the subject of so many hopes and fears, that we have an unprecedented chance to shape it for the common good.ImageCredit...Spencer LowellNILS GILMANVice president for programs at the Berggruen InstituteWe stand on the cusp of a revolution, the engineers tell us. New gene-editing techniques, especially in combination with artificial intelligence technologies, promise unprecedented new capacities to manipulate biological nature — including human nature itself. The potential could hardly be greater: whole categories of disease conquered, radically personalized medicine, and drastically extended mental and physical prowess.However, at the Berggruen Institute we believe that strictly engineering conceptions of these new technologies are not enough to grasp the significance of these potential changes.So profound is the potential impact of these technologies that they challenge the very definition of what it is to be human. Seen in this light, the development and deployment of these technologies represent a practical experiment in the philosophical, today conducted primarily by engineers and scientists. But we need a broader conversation.For millenniums Western philosophy took for granted the absolute distinction between the living and the nonliving, between nature and artifice, between non-sentient and sentient beings. We presumed that we — we humans — were the only thinking things in a world of mere things, subjects in a world of objects. We believed that human nature, whatever it may be, was fundamentally stable.But now the A.I. engineers are designing machines they say will think, sense, feel, cogitate, and reflect, and even have a sense of self. Bioengineers are contending that bacteria, plants, animals, and even humans can be radically remade and modified. This means that the traditional distinctions between man and machine, as between humans and nature — distinctions that have underpinned Western philosophy, religion, and even political institutions — no longer hold. In sum, A.I. and gene editing promise (or is it threaten?) to redefine what counts as human and what it means to be human, philosophically as well as poetically and politically.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe questions posed by these experiments are the most profound possible. Will we use these technologies to better ourselves or to divide or even destroy humanity? These technologies should allow us to live longer and healthier lives, but will we deploy them in ways that also allow us to live more harmoniously with each other? Will these technologies encourage the play of our better angels or exacerbate our all-too-human tendencies toward greed, jealousy, and social hierarchy? Who should be included in conversations about how these technologies will be developed? Who will have decision rights over how these technologies are distributed and deployed? Just a few people? Just a few countries?To address these questions, the Berggruen Institute is building transnational networks of philosophers + technologists + policy-makers + artists who are thinking about how A.I. and gene-editing are transfiguring what it means to be human. We seek to develop tools for navigating the most fundamental questions: not just about what sort of world we can build, but what sort of world we should build —— and also avoid building. If A.I. and biotechnology deliver even half of what the visionaries believe is in store, then we can no longer defer the question of what sort of human beings we want to be, both as individuals, and as a collective.ImageCredit...L. Kasimu Harris/Open Society FoundationsSTEPHANIE DINKINSArtist & associate professor of art, Stony Brook University; fellow, Data & Society Research Institute; Soros Equality Fellow; 2018 Resident Artist, EyebeamMy journey into the world of artificial intelligence began when I befriended Bina48 — an advanced social robot that is black and female, like me. The videotaped results of our meetings form an ongoing project called “Conversations with Bina48.” Our interactions raised many questions about the algorithmically negotiated world now being constructed. They also pushed my art practice into focused thought and advocacy around A.I. as it relates to black people — and other non-dominant cultures — in a world already governed by systems that often offer us both too little and overly focused attention.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBecause A.I. is no single thing, it’s difficult to speak to its overarching promise; but questions abound. What happens when an insular subset of society encodes governing systems intended for use by the majority of the planet? What happens when those writing the rules — in this case, we will call it code — might not know, care about, or deliberately consider the needs, desires, or traditions of people their work impacts? What happens if the codemaking decisions are disproportionately informed by biased data, systemic injustice, and misdeeds committed to preserving wealth “for the good of the people?”I am reminded that the authors of the Declaration of Independence, a small group of white men said to be acting on behalf of the nation, did not extend rights and privileges to folks like me — mainly black people and women. Laws and code operate similarly to protect the rights of those who write them. I worry that A.I. development — which is reliant on the privileges of whiteness, men and money — cannot produce an A.I.-mediated world of trust and compassion that serves the global majority in an equitable, inclusive, and accountable manner. People of color, in particular, can’t afford to consume A.I. as mere algorithmic systems. Those creating A.I. must realize that systems that work for the betterment of people who are not at the table are good. And systems that collaborate with and hire those missing from the table — are even better.A.I. is already quietly reshaping systems of trust, industry, government, justice, medicine and, indeed, personhood. Ultimately, we must consider whether A.I. will magnify and perpetuate existing injustice, or will we enter a new era of computationally augmented humans working amicably beside self-driven A.I. partners? The answer, of course, depends on our willingness to dislodge the stubborn civil rights transgressions and prejudices that divide us. After all, A.I. — and its related technologies — carry the foibles of their makers.A.I. presents the challenge of reckoning with our skewed histories, while working to counterbalance our biases, and genuinely recognizing ourselves in each other. This is an opportunity to expand — rather than further homogenize — what it means to be human through and alongside A.I. technologies. This implies changes in many systems: education, government, labor, and protest, to name a few. All are opportunities if we, the people, demand them and our leaders are brave enough to take them on.ImageCredit...Mauro Bottaro/European UnionANDRUS ANSIPEuropean Commission vice president for the digital single marketIn health care today, algorithms can beat almost all but the most qualified dermatologists in recognizing skin cancer. A recent study found that dermatologists could identify 86.6 percent of skin cancers, while a machine using artificial intelligence (A.I.) detected 95 percent.In Denmark, when people call 112 — Europe’s emergency number — an A.I.-driven computer analyzes the voice and background noise to check whether the caller has had a heart attack.A.I. is one of the most promising technologies of our times.It is an area where several European Union countries have decided to invest and research, to formulate a national strategy or include A.I. in a wider digital agenda. We encourage all our countries to do this, urgently, so that the E.U. develops and promotes A.I. in a coordinated way.This should be a Pan-European project, not a series of national initiatives that may or may not overlap. It is the best way for Europe to avoid a splintered A.I. environment that hinders our collective progress, and to capitalize on our strong scientific and commercial position in this fast-evolving sector.That can only happen if all E.U. countries work and pull together.Today, many breakthroughs in A.I. come from European labs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWe have a good talent and industrial base — as a world region, Europe is home to the highest number of service robot manufacturers. We have world-class expertise in techniques requiring less data — ‘small data’ — to train algorithms.The European Commission has long recognized the importance and potential of A.I. and robotics, along with the need for much higher investment and an appropriate environment that adequately addresses the many ethical, legal and social issues involved.This can only be achieved by starting from common European values — such as diversity, nondiscrimination and the right to privacy — to develop A.I. in a responsible way. After all, people will not use a technology that they do not trust. We set out Europe’s way forward on A.I. in a dedicated strategy earlier this year.Our aim is to be ahead of technological development, to maximize the impact of investment in supercomputers and research and to encourage more A.I. use by the private and public sectors. We are consulting widely — also with non-E.U. countries — to design ethical guidelines for A.I. technologies.The project to build a Digital Single Market based on common Pan-European rules creates the right environment and conditions for the development and takeup of A.I.in Europe — particularly concerning data, the lifeblood of A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt frees up data flows, improves overall access to data and encourages more use of open data.It aims to improve connectivity, protect privacy and strengthen cybersecurity.A.I. has the potential to benefit society as a whole: for people going about their everyday lives, for business.Europe is stepping up efforts to be at the forefront of the exciting possibilities that A.I. technologies offer.A correction was made on Oct. 19, 2018: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of Yves Béhar’s company.

Is it possible to build an AI that won't reflect the bone-deep distorted justice of our social systems?,N/A,Amazon just scrapped a sexist recruiting engine. Is it possible to build an AI that won't reflect the bone-deep distorted justice of our social systems?,N/A,N/A,N/A,"        Amazon’s AI gurus scrapped a new machine-learning recruiting engine earlier this month. Why? It transpired that the AI behind it was sexist. What does this mean as we race to produce ever-better artificial intelligence, and how can we understand the risks of machines learning the worst of our own traits?Trained on the past decade’s worth of data about job applicants, the Amazon model began to penalize CVs that included the word “women.” The incident calls to mind another experiment in AI bias, Microsoft’s “Tay” project, which the company pulled from the web after the bot learned racism from users it was chatting with on GroupMe and Kik. In Amazon’s case, however, rogue users weren’t to blame. The AI was learning from the historical data of tech’s largest global company.An artificial intelligence that dislikes women or people of color sounds like a concept straight out of a Twilight Zone episode. But sadly, it’s reality.How did we get to this situation? And is it possible to build an AI that won’t reflect the bone-deep prejudices that are – knowingly or unknowingly – built into our social systems? To answer that second question, it’s crucial to address the first one.How a Sexist AI HappensOkay, the first point to make is that sexist or racist AI doesn’t emerge from nowhere. Instead, it reflects the prejudices already deeply held within both society at large, and the tech industry specifically.Don’t believe us about sexism in tech? One study from earlier this year found that 57 out of 58 major U.S. cites paid women in tech less than men. Last year, two female tech cofounders demonstrated tech sexism at work by proving they could make better connections once they invented a fictional male cofounder.And as long as tech companies continue overlooking sexism, they’ll keep perpetuating a system that prioritizes male applicants and promotes male staff.Sexist AIs Start With a Blinkered Industry…The tech world loves rapid growth above all else. But this year, it’s finally begun to come to terms with the impact that its culture can make, and a sense of responsibility is finally taking root.Few sum it up better than former Reddit product head Dan McComas, whose recent New York Magazine interview (titled ‘I Fundamentally Believe That My Time at Reddit Made the World a Worse Place’) includes this insight:“The incentive structure is simply growth at all costs. There was never, in any board meeting that I have ever attended, a conversation about the users, about things that were going on that were bad, about potential dangers, about decisions that might affect potential dangers. There was never a conversation about that stuff.”…And Machine Learning Perpetuates ThemIt’s this attitude that’s at the core of prejudiced AI, which perpetuates the system just as clearly, if a little more mechanically. As Lin Classon, director of public cloud strategy at Ensono, puts it, the process of machine learning is the issue.“Currently, the most common application of AI is based on feeding the machine lots of data and teaching it to recognize a pattern. Because of this, the results are as good as the data used to train the algorithms,” she tells me.Ben Dolmar, director of software development at the Nerdery, backs her up.“Almost all of the significant commercial activity in Artificial Intelligence is happening in the field of Machine Learning,” explains Ben. “It was machine learning that drove Alpha Go and it’s machine learning that is driving the leaps that we’re making in natural language processing, computer vision and a lot of recommendations engines.”Machine learning begins by providing a model with a core data set. The model trains on this before producing its own outputs. Any historical issues in the core data are then reproduced. Translation? Sexist data turns into sexist outputs.“It’s not unlike painting with watercolors, where the brush has to be clean or it taints the colors,” says Classon. And, in modern society, sexism turns up everywhere, Classon says, whether it’s in “recruiting, loan applications or stock photos.” Or even in the emptiness of women’s restrooms at major tech conferences, as Classon has pointed out to Tech.Co before.How to Combat AI PrejudiceHow do we solve a problem like AI prejudice? Classon boils it down to a key guiding principle: conscientious and collective vigilance. And that begins with ensuring the community behind the AI developments is equipped to spot the issues. Which takes us right back to the core problem of ensuring that a diverse developer community is in place, to find issues faster and address them more quickly.Practically speaking, Classon has further suggestions:Increased TransparencyRight now, machine learning algorithms function like black boxes: Data goes in, trained models come out.“DARPA has recognized [that this leaves users unaware of how the system came to any decision] and is working on Explainable Artificial Intelligence so future AI will be able to explain the rationale behind each decision,” says Classon.In other words, the AI itself should need to explain its decision, opening up a conversation about how it got there.Routine Audits “An auditing approach can help mitigate the effect of inherent and unconscious biases. The machine learning and AI communities have an obligation to contribute to the larger data science,” Classon says, pointing me to one open source tool for bias testing that already exists.It’s not just a tech problem: Innovative AI companies are responsible for auditing their work and developing standards that can improve the entire industry. One example is Microsoft’s multidisciplinary FATE group. The accronym stands for “fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics,” and it’s examining how an ethical AI could work.A Feedback LoopInstituting audits and transparency is a step, but we’ll need to keep taking more and more steps to reduce a problem that will likely never be fully solved.“The biggest way to ensure a fair model would be to require a large number of users providing feedback from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” Pamela Wickersham, senior global partner solutions manager at Docusign + SpringCM, tells me. “It’s unfortunately never going to be perfect, since user input and decision making will always be required. All models need a constant feedback loop, so that if sexism or prejudiced data is found to be prevalent, the model can be re-trained.”Track Down the SubtletiesSo, find the issues and you’ll solve the problem, right? Not so fast.Let’s go back to our most recent example of AI bias. Amazon was likely aware of the potential sexism problem and still couldn’t correct it.“It appears like Amazon actively tried to address the bias in the dataset by removing features that would identify women. So, in theory, the output would be gender-neutral and select the best candidates,” Ben says. “However, machine learning models can key in on subtle differences, and what ended up happening is that the model basically found other, subtler ways to identify women and the bias returned in the output.”Even “highly reliable algorithms,” Ben notes, can turn up the wrong answer. Picture a model that’s 99 percent accurate reviewing one million records. It’ll get 10,000 incorrect results, and it won’t be clear which ones those are.One method to address bias is to adjust a model’s goals rather than the data. Data scientists and platform vendors, Ben says, are actively working to fight fire with fire. One demo from a major machine learning vendor at the Gartner ITXPO earlier this month debuted a model designed to monitor other machine-learning models, identifying their biases. “In a bit of irony,” Ben says, “the platform uses its own machine learning to generate the changes for the biased machine-learning models. Tools like this platform are what will ultimately help us address the bias that shows up in data when we accurately represent our current society and history. The problems here are hard, but they are tractable.” Where Next For AI?The bottom line? AI’s reflection of our biases can be addressed, but only through a slow process that emphasises feedback, audits, fact-checks, and transparency.It’s not unlike how prejudices must be addressed across the rest of society, too.

Is the art world ready for AI-generated work? Christie's is about to find out

Christie's 1st to auction AI portrait 











Christie's first to auction portrait created by artificial intelligence
04:38

Next week, Christie's will be the first auction house to offer artwork created by artificial intelligence. The Paris-based art collective, Obvious, created the ""Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"" using an algorithm that analyzed a data set of 15,000 portraits and from that created a unique image. The piece goes up for auction on October 25 and is estimated to fetch between $7,000 and $10,000, according to Christie's international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd. ""We put a lot of thought into the estimate because if we put a huge amount on it people would say 'Well what are you basing that valuation on because this is the first,"" Lloyd told ""CBS This Morning.""  






Lloyd also offered a deeper explanation of how the piece was generated using something called the GAN algorithm. The process starts with uploading thousands of portraits to a computer. One half of that computer is called the generator, which analyzes those images and learns what a portrait is. Then, it starts spitting out versions of its own.

""The second half of the computer, the discriminator, tries to spot that. And every time the cycle is run if the discriminator is able to say, wait a minute, that's created by computer, the generator runs it again and the cycle finishes when the discriminator says, 'I give up, I can't tell. I can't tell the difference between the computer-generated version and the human-generated version,'"" Lloyd explained. 


With this new category of art comes questions about how we define the artist. Is it the AI software? The people who wrote the original algorithm? Or even a combination of the artwork that was used as a basis for the portrait? ""I think this is why this is so inspiring and interesting, because we've never really had to ask those questions before,"" Lloyd said. As for how human artists might react to AI art, Lloyd sees their future alongside one another, progressing on ""parallel tracks.""""There will be human art, there will be artificial intelligence art, but there will also be a hybrid. I think that's what's come downing the pike in the near future. It's artists who have always been great early adopters, Warhol adapted screen printing which came from commercial packaging, photographers took the camera and thought well can do weird and wonderful things with this. So I think human artists will be working side by side with this algorithm and creating hybrid art. It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said.

It's just the beginning it's so fascinating what is going to be created,"" he said. ","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/christies-first-to-auction-portrait-created-by-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'name': ""Christie's first to auction portrait created by artificial intelligence"", 'description': ""Next week, Christie's will be the first auction house to offer artwork created by artificial intelligence.

Live00:0000:0000:00 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Dozens of employers looking to hire the next generation of tech employees descended on the University of California, Berkeley in September to meet students at an electrical engineering and computer sciences career fair.Boris Yue, 20, was one of thousands of student attendees, threading his way among fellow job-seekers to meet recruiters.But Yue wasn’t worried about so much potential competition.  While the job outlook for those with computer skills is generally good, Yue is in an even more rarified category: he is studying artificial intelligence, working on technology that teaches machines to learn and think in ways that mimic human cognition. Advertisement · Scroll to continueHis choice of specialty makes it unlikely he will have difficulty finding work. ""There is no shortage of machine learning opportunities,"" he said.He's right.Artificial intelligence is now being used in an ever-expanding array of products: cars that drive themselves; robots that identify and eradicate weeds; computers able to distinguish dangerous skin cancers from benign moles; and smart locks, thermostats, speakers and digital assistants that are bringing the technology into homes. At Georgia Tech, students interact with digital teaching assistants made possible by AI for an online course in machine learning.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe expanding applications for AI have also created a shortage of qualified workers in the field. Although schools across the country are adding classes, increasing enrollment and developing new programs to accommodate student demand,  there are too few potential employees with training or experience in AI.That has big consequences.Too few AI-trained job-seekers has slowed hiring and impeded growth at some companies, recruiters and would-be employers told Reuters. It may also be delaying broader adoption of a technology that some economists say could spur U.S. economic growth by boosting productivity, currently growing at only about half its pre-crisis pace.Andrew Shinn, a chip design manager at Marvell Technology Group  who was recruiting interns and new grads at UC Berkeley's career fair, said his company has had trouble hiring for AI jobs. ""We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years,"" he said. ""It does slow things down.""“COMING OF AGE”Many economists believe AI has the potential to change the economy’s basic trajectory in the same way that, say, electricity or the steam engine did. ""I do think artificial intelligence is … coming of age,"" said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in an interview. ""This will diffuse through the whole economy and will change all of our lives.”MaximizeItem 1 of 3 Students attend the University of California, Berkeley's electrical engineering and computer sciences career fair in Berkeley, California, U.S., September 5, 2018.

AI job postings as a percentage of overall job postings at Indeed nearly doubled in the past two years, according to data provided by the company. Searches on Indeed for AI jobs, meanwhile increased just 15 percent. (For a graphic, please see tmsnrt.rs/2CEi4eGUniversities are trying to keep up. Applicants to study artificial intelligence in UC Berkeley's electrical engineering and computer sciences doctoral programme numbered 341 a decade ago, but by last year had surged to 2,700, according to the department. The entering class of AI students was 38 in the fall of 2017, up from 10 in the fall of 2008.At the University of Illinois, professor Mark Hasegawa-Johnson last year tripled the enrollment cap on the school's intro AI course to 300. The extra 200 seats were filled in 24 hours, he said.Carnegie Mellon University this fall began offering the nation's first undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. ""We feel strongly that the demand is there,"" said Reid Simmons, who directs CMU's new programme. ""And we are trying to supply the students to fill that demand.""Still, a fix for the supply-demand mismatch is probably five years out, says Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. The company has algorithms that trawl job postings on company websites, and their data show AI-related job postings having doubled in the last 11 months. ""The supply of people moving into this field is way below demand,"" he said. A JOB-SEEKER’S MARKETThe demand has driven up wages. Glassdoor estimates that average salaries for AI-related jobs advertised on company career sites rose 11 percent between October 2017 and September 2018 to $123,069 annually.Michael Solomon, whose New York-based 10X Management rents out technologists to companies for specific projects, says his top AI engineers now command as much as $1000 an hour, more than triple the pay just five years ago, making them one of the company's two highest paid categories, along with blockchain experts.Liz Holm, a materials science and engineering professor at Carnegie Melon, saw the increased demand first-hand in May, when one of her graduating PhD students, who used machine learning methods for her research, was overwhelmed with job offers, none of which were in materials science and all of them AI-related. Eventually the student took a job with Proctor & Gamble, where she uses AI to figure out where to put items on store shelves around the globe. ""Companies are really hungry for these folks right now,"" Holm said.Mark Maybury, an artificial intelligence expert who was hired last year as Stanley Black and Decker's first chief technology officer, agreed. The firm is embedding AI into the design and production of tools, he said, though he said details are not yet public.""Have we been able to find the talent we need? Yes,"" he said. ""Is it expensive? Yes.""The crunch is great news for job-seeking students with AI skills. In addition to bumping their pay and giving them more choice, they often get job offers well before they graduate.Derek Brown, who studied artificial intelligence and cognitive science as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon, got a full-time post-graduation job offer from Salesforce at the start of his senior year last fall. He turned it down in favour of Facebook, where he started this past July.Additional reporting by Jane Lee; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Sue HortonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.New Tab, opens new tabShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsRead NextChevronChevronTechnologycategoryMusk signals delays to robotaxi unveiling for key design changeArtificial IntelligencecategoryApple at all-time high after Morgan Stanley calls stock 'top pick' for AI effortsCybersecuritycategoryExclusive: North Korean hackers sent stolen crypto to wallet used by Asian payment firmKKR-backed OneStream seeks $4.38 bln valuation in US IPOANALYSISNvidia investor dilemma: how much is too much in a stock portfolio?Regulatory OversightcategoryBritish regulators to examine Big Tech's digital wallets",https://schema.org,NewsMediaOrganization,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/logo-vertical-default-512x512.png?d=203', 'width': '512', 'height': '512'}","['https://www.facebook.com/Reuters/', 'https://twitter.com/reuters', 'https://www.instagram.com/reuters/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/reuters2/', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@reuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo']",,2018-10-18T01:07:38.000Z,,"As companies embrace AI, it's a job-seeker's market","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/as-companies-embrace-ai-its-a-job-seekers-market-idUSKCN1MP0LU/'}",2018-10-15T10:15:53.000Z,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ann Saphir', 'sameAs': 'https://www.reuters.com/authors/ann-saphir/', 'image': ['https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=628&width=1200&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1920&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1200&width=1200&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=2400&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true', 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FMBIVAJUOONDEBH26VPUYAC3JOE.jpg?auth=34a97b66b3d4973fd39ea7ee6654c323084cfeade6427c0b176937b92f387c46&height=1500&width=1200&quality=80&smart=true']}]",,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False}",,,,False,,https://www.reuters.com,https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/social-impact/social-impact-and-esg-report-2022.html#c7_Diversity%20%20inclusion,https://ir.thomsonreuters.com/static-files/f4169de5-ee8c-4c28-9971-75b0baf97365,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'A.I. talent shortage hampers some tech firms', 'description': 'As artificial intelligence takes center stage in the tech world, companies struggle to find talent to fill A.I. related jobs, even as students flock to learn the ropes.', 'datePublished': '2018-10-15T10:19:38Z', 'dateModified': '2023-11-30T07:59:32Z', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/api/v2/img/5bae5b64e4b05ce65e868229-1538153316469', 'duration': 'PNaNMNaNS', 'uploadDate': '2023-11-30T07:59:32Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/v3/playlist/265121/master.m3u8'}",https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html,,https://www.reutersagency.com/en/about/standards-values/,,,,,https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html,,2018-10-18T01:05:31.000Z,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'addressLocality': 'London, United Kingdom', 'postalCode': 'E14 5AQ', 'streetAddress': '5 Canada Square, Canary Wharf'}",https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/about,,,

What is ZipRecruiter?How Does ZipRecruiter Use AI?How Does ZipRecruiter Measure Up?Conclusion 









Last year we told you about an emerging trend in perhaps one of the dirtiest industries on the planet. No, we’re not talking about charcoal maker, animal bone charrer or even space miner. We’re talking about the use of artificial intelligence in HR recruiting. At first, we thought it was too good to be true that a machine would replace a human recruiter, which we put on par with used car salesmen and realtors, as professions that add little value to the advancement of the human race. Then it seemed as if the field exploded overnight, with countless startups emerging that promised to disrupt the hiring industry through AI. We even profiled one such company, PredictiveHire out of Australia. Now ZipRecruiter, a startup that runs an online job marketplace using artificial intelligence, is one of the newest members of the Unicorn Club, startups valued at $1 billion or more.
What is ZipRecruiter?
Founded in 2010, ZipRecruiter is based in sunny Santa Monica, outside of Los Angeles. The company took in a massive $156 million Series B earlier this month, more than four years after a pretty impressive $63 million Series A. That brings total disclosed funding to $219 million, earning it a valuation of about $1.5 billion, according to Bloomberg. The company started as a tool to help small businesses distribute job postings affordably, and today has grown to serve more than one million employers and 120 million job seekers. ZipRecruiter has nearly 1,000 employees in the U.S., U.K. and Israel.

The startup offers a couple of core services – posting jobs and searching for jobs – which are heavily tied to its mobile app. There’s the basic job posting service on its own platform, as well as across another 100-plus job boards, including companies from LinkedIn and Salary.com to Google and Facebook. However, it’s the company’s algorithms that potentially set it apart from other job search platforms like Monster.com and LinkedIn.
How Does ZipRecruiter Use AI?
ZipRecruiter’s AI-powered algorithm learns what each employer is looking for and provides a “personalized, curated set of highly relevant candidates” based on more than 60 factors. On the flip side of the equation, the company’s technology matches job seekers with jobs based on factors beyond job titles, potentially introducing them to jobs they may never even have considered before, like professional gamer or quant. The company claims that its algorithms are so good that 80 percent of employers who post a job online get a qualified candidate within the first 24 hours.

ZipRecruiter recently launched a new feature for employers called Candidate Calibration, which apparently is not a thinly veiled dystopian term meaning to wipe applicants’ brains clean in order to enslave them at low wages, as we first assumed. Rather, the tool lets employers give feedback about what types of candidates they like – before candidates apply – so they get better matches for their job posts. It works by showing employers potential applicants who might be a good match. The employer rates them Tinder-like (though using a simple thumbs up or thumbs down rather than a swipe left or swipe right). Based on the feedback, ZipRecruiter makes recommendations using parameters such as the applicant’s skills, job titles, years of experience, location, resume length and application rate. It’s a bit like how Netflix or Amazon might make movie or product recommendations.
How Does ZipRecruiter Measure Up?
At the moment, ZipRecruiter appears to be the hottest thing on the recruitment scene. ZipRecruiter CEO and co-founder Ian Siegel told TechCrunch his company accounts for about 10 percent of activity in the U.S. recruitment market, with over 5.6 million jobs listed on its app as of early October. The company’s recent $1.5 billion valuation is more than triple of what Randstad, an international recruitment firm, paid ($429 million in cash) for Monster.com back in 2016. That was the same year that Microsoft coughed up $26.2 billion for LinkedIn, which as far as we know is where recruiters troll for candidates, calling it “headhunting” so that they can charge big bucks for little effort. 
On the other hand, Microsoft did report that LinkedIn’s revenue rose 37 percent annually for the second quarter in a row and totaled $1.46 billion, so maybe that’s why all those headhunters are charging such a premium. More recently, another competitor, Glassdoor, was gobbled up for $1.2 billion after raising a similar amount of VC dollars as ZipRecruiter by a Tokyo-based HR and recruitment services company called, imaginatively enough, Recruit Inc.
Conclusion
ZipRecruiter is obviously producing results for somebody or they wouldn’t be attracting these big investment rounds and garnering a $1.5 billion valuation along the way, though no word on the company’s actual profitability. It’s been around for more than eight years now, so that’s encouraging. Still, it’s a very competitive market, with a pretty interesting history of acquisitions of major players in the last couple of years. We wouldn’t be surprised if a company like Google, which launched its own jobs search platform recently using its own AI technology, might be interested in removing acquiring a rival. Or Amazon might just swoop in and buy them because, well, it’s Amazon.

MIT Opening New College for Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is hot—and if you don’t believe that, look at the six-figure salaries paid out to the experts in the field. Now comes the next big step: creating as many A.I. experts as possible. In order to expand the pipeline of A.I.-knowledgeable graduates, many schools across the country have added A.I. and machine-learning courses to their curriculums. Now the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plans to take things another step further, with the launch of a $1 billion college dedicated to A.I. When the college opens in the fall of 2019, it will focus on helping students enhance their studies in another discipline with the latest A.I. techniques and tools. For example, if you’re studying biology, MIT wants you to use A.I. to radically upgrade your work in that arena. There’s also an emphasis on “responsible” use of A.I. tools. “Computing is no longer the domain of the experts alone. It’s everywhere, and it needs to be understood and mastered by almost everyone,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. “In that context, for a host of reasons, society is uneasy about technology—and at MIT, that’s a signal we must take very seriously.” The college will also create 50 new faculty positions, and provide a shared structure for A.I. research with the rest of MIT. A new building for the school is scheduled to open sometime in 2022. If this initiative succeeds, it will deeply bake A.I. into a host of disciplines, potentially equipping students for a future in which automation, machine learning, and other A.I. disciplines dominate various industries. For those who want to learn A.I. now, there are lots of options. For example, Bloomberg offers a (free) online course in machine learning, aimed at pros who already have some background in machine learning (and a lot of aptitude for mathematics). Google also has a (likewise free) course with 25 lessons and more than 40 exercises, which you can finish in 15 hours or so; it features lots of video of Google engineers describing the nuances of A.I. and machine learning. Online learning schools such as Udacity also have programs in machine learning, some of which are meant for beginners. And Microsoft is offering a Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence, with 10 online courses that teach 10 skills. If attending MIT isn’t an option, fortunately, the resources are there already for boosting your A.I. knowledge.

Mr. Sloan is writing his book with the help of home-brewed software that finishes his sentences with the push of a tab key.It’s probably too early to add “novelist” to the long list of jobs that artificial intelligence will eliminate. But if you watch Mr. Sloan at work, it is quickly clear that programming is on the verge of redefining creativity.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @davidstreitfeldA version of this article appears in print on Oct. 19, 2018, Section F, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.
