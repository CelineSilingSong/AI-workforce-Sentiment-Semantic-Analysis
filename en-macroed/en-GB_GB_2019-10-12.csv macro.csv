Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  This article is based on a talk by Emerj.com (formerly TechEmergence) CEO Daniel Faggella at a recently held independently organized TEDxURI event. Part of the talk was on the impact of artificial intelligence on job security. When I speak to my business readers or with businesspeople at conferences and events, the topic is always the same: The applications and implications of artificial intelligence in business That’s convenient because that’s what we exclusively focus on here at TechEmergence. From oil and gas to customer service, we’re exploring the current traction and latest applications of AI. When I talk to family members or friends of friends, the topic is also remarkably predictable: The automation of jobs by artificial intelligence This lead me to devote an entire TEDx talk to this topic and to spend three long weeks digging through hundreds of interviews to find the common threads and themes about job automation from all the experts we’ve spoken to over the last five years. I’ve decided to distill these ideas into a single article—and here it is. Below is the full video of the TEDx presentation on which this article is based. What follows is a breakdown of what I consider to be the three most important elements of job automation:  Job Automation – What Researchers Say In our recent study of PhD perspectives on “AI Risk”, we found that most common “20 year risk” in the eyes of most of our AI expert panel was “Technological Unemployment.” We periodically carry out interviews and surveys of those that work with the hard science of AI. To keep up with current trends and issues, we talk to those who have a deep understanding of AI and its attendant technologies.  For one of our surveys, we polled over 30 researchers—most of whom have PhDs in various disciplines including artificial intelligence, computer science, robotics, and linguistics—about what they believed would be the risks of AI in 20 years and 100 years. Various responses ranged from general mismanagement of AI to killer robots. However, of the 33 respondents, 12 believed that the biggest risks of AI would be to the economy through automation.  Below, respondents explain how they believed AI would change the job landscape: “Drastic changes to the employment market due to increased capability of autonomous systems (it’s more of a certainty than a risk and we should already be factoring this into education policies).” — Dr. Helgi Helgason, PhD in Artificial Intelligence, Reykjavik University (Iceland), VP Operational Intelligence at Activity Stream  “Massive unemployment and resulting huge wealth disparities.” — Prof. Lyle Ungar, Professor of Computer and Information Science, Bioengineering Science, Genomics and Computational Biology, Operations and Information Management, and Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania ​”Massive unemployment. Machines will be singing the song, “Anything you can do, I can do better; I can do anything better than you.” — ​Dr. Nils Nilsson, ​PhD in Electrical Engineering, Stanford Professor of Engineering (Emeritus) in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, Kumagai Professor of Engineering (Emeritus) in Computer Science at Stanford. It is apparent from the survey that many AI researchers believe that the AI risk to job security is a real concern, and they believe it is already happening today. This is supported by numerous other interviews and surveys carried out by TechEmergence at various points in time.  Three Factors Ensuring Job Security – Context, Coordination and Connection A rundown of recent news articles, as well as an MIT meta-analysis on job loss predictions, indicates that AI will certainly take over quite a few jobs in the future. However, there are many reasons why machines will not make all humans obsolete, and three factors stand out for people that have made it their business to know. Insights on this topic have emerged from interviewing numerous executives and researchers and diving back into previous surveys on TechEmergence that discuss the impact of AI on jobs in different sectors. From our research, we’ve found three factors that could ensure job security and fend off automation in the future. Factor 1: Context Most people believe that machines will take over mostly blue-collar jobs, such as in factories and manufacturing. While machines can improve some efficiencies, some tasks will require more context than machinery can handle. In the domain of welding, it is possible to automate the task in a repeatable or predictable production line. There has to be a specific kind of input that goes through a specific process to produce a specific output.  This type of rote work is particularly suited to automation. However, it is much harder to automate the repair of an automobile, as the welder has to make a judgment call based on the situation. For example, the welder would need to decide whether they would bang out a damaged portion of a car or cut through it and replace it. Many skilled workers, in particular, are not automatable. Take a plumber, for instance. The work is not predictable at all. When a plumber shows up at a house, many factors come into play that the plumber has to consider. The plumber may need to know the age of the boiler, the type of pipes, seasonality of the problem, and so on.  Only after getting the answers to these kinds of questions can the plumber even start to figure out what to do. This type of job involves a lot of context as well as physical dexterity. Robots are not able towalk like humans yet, so changing a pipe under the sink is probably out of the question. Another skilled type of work considered blue-collar is clothing and shoe production. Two companies claim to have developed AI-based software that can guide a robot to make shoes and sew clothes. However, these systems require humans to work alongside them and can only handle very specific and simple production lines. Much of the designing and implementing still depends largely on humans to work. Contrary to popular belief, white-collar jobs may actually be more automatable than many skilled blue-collar jobs. Quite a lot of automation implementation is going on in the world of white-collar workers, from life insurance agents to medical personnel. However, the most interesting thing about automation in these sectors is that the same rule applies as for blue-collar work: if it is repeatable and predictable, it is automatable. It does not matter how much a person is paid to do the work. A good example is in finance. An auditor, for example, that mainly goes through financial reports looking for variations or anomalies in order to pass them to the next person in the workflow is doing an automatable job. It is just a matter of detecting glitches in the reports, which an AI system can do. The same holds true for many bookkeeping and accounting tasks, where the work primarily involves handling and processing data.  However, a purchasing officer may also be looking for variations in the same set of financial reports, but will then use that information to make purchasing decisions. That is contextual and makes the work much harder to automate. The auditor and purchasing officer may get about the same pay, but one is automatable, and the other is not. Another good example is medical diagnostic AI, of which about a third of all SaaS AI companies focus. Current applications indicate that AI is not about to replace doctors for the simple matter of context.  Tests, machine vision, and medical records go a long way in reducing the huge amount of available data into manageable chunks to arrive at potential diagnoses. However, crunching the numbers and detecting patterns can only go so far. It takes that and a doctor to see, smell, hear and touch a patient to gather subtle clues that can lead to discovering the actual health problem. Context is probably the most salient point that emerged from all of the interviews and surveys performed. In a nutshell, if it is possible for someone to do a job in isolation without having to take into account any outside factors, influences, or situation, then job security in the face of AI is not assured. Context leads to complexity, and the real world is complex. Because of this, the best way to ensure job security is to embrace the complexities of a particular task and get involved in it in order to stay relevant. Factor 2: Coordination Context refers to situations, but people often create these situations, directly or indirectly. The second factor that can ensure job security in the face of AI is coordination. Coordination is primarily about managing people. It could be a small team of scientists working to find a cure for cancer. It could be a group of 50 sales representatives that are deployed throughout a state. In either case, the human element is the most important and confounding in effective coordination. While an AI system may match Scientist A to Scientist B as the best people to work on a certain portion of a clinical study because of their academic backgrounds, working together if they dislike each other may not provide optimal results.  In the case of a sales team, historical data may show that Sales Rep A has sold the highest number of products in a particular area. However, a new employee, Sales Rep B, lives in that particular area and has excellent relationships with retailers. A human coordinator can understand how those dynamics can affect an outcome. An AI system will crunch the numbers and provide the logical choices, which will not always work.   That said, AI does have a place in coordination, and that is in providing venues for effective team communication. This is particularly important when coordinating people in the field or in another country. Factor 3: Connection In a similar way, connection is important in ensuring job security in many sectors. It does not necessarily involve connecting with people in order to manage them, but jobs that require some type of human connection are probably going to be safe from human obsolescence. Call center agents to some degree are at risk from AI systems. Natural language processing can handle some initial interactions in the customer service tiers, such as self-service tasks (billing inquiries, identity verification), before referring to a live agent.  AI systems are also useful in customer service for sentiment analysis and customer data compilation. However, when the caller requires anything more complex than a scripted set of instructions or suggestions, a human connection needs to be established. A good example of complex interpersonal relationships is in education. AI systems have found their way into classrooms in the form of instructional design and content delivery, and even in tutoring.  However, student-teacher relationships have a profound effect on student engagement, and this has a direct impact on learning. It is not likely that students, especially young ones, will engage with a robotic teacher in quite the same way as a human teacher. Concluding Thoughts – Keep a Firm Grasp on Context According to asurvey by Bloomberg,  some of the highest paid jobs are also the most at-risk in the face of AI. These include compensation and benefits managers, accountants and credit analysts. Among the least vulnerable are doctors, teachers, and dentists. It is immediately apparent that the least vulnerable occupations are those that require human interaction and context at some level. The most vulnerable positions deal primarily with numbers and data. It is also interesting to note that blue-collar workers (except for truck drivers) are absent from the list of survey participants in our own AI risk analysis (mentioned with a graphic earlier in this article). As artificial intelligence progresses, programs will preempt human needs and take automatic action. The evolution of technology will be more than just upgrades in the tools used for work. It will involve different ways to relate and indeed live as human beings in an increasingly virtual world. The rolling process of creative destruction is moving faster and faster, and staying ahead of that is a major reason for keeping a grasp on context. If you want to see your own interests represented in the future of your industry, you must have your hands around the messy context of the industry itself. What skills are becoming more, or less, important? How is the nature of the customer changing? How is the nature of the product changing? Given the speed and pace of change, these aren’t questions to be handled just by founders and CEOs, but by anyone who wants to stay relevant and employable in the future we’re creating together. The factors discussed in this article are useful for anyone seeking job security in the face of AI as a litmus test to determine whether it will affect a certain career trajectory. It would be safe to say that for most people to whom these three concepts have no relevance, where interactions are so limited that it is not a critical part of their work, or whose activities are repeatable and scriptable, are the ones most likely to be at risk of losing their jobs to automation.

Big data isn’t quite the term de rigueur that it was a few years ago, but that doesn’t mean it went anywhere. If anything, big data has just been getting bigger.
That once might have been considered a significant challenge. But now, it’s increasingly viewed as a desired state, specifically in organizations that are experimenting with and implementing machine learning and other AI disciplines.
“AI and ML are now giving us new opportunities to use the big data that we already had, as well as unleash a whole lot of new use cases with new data types,” says Glenn Gruber, senior digital strategist at Anexinet. “We now have much more usable data in the form of pictures, video, and voice [for example]. In the past, we may have tried to minimize the amount of this type of data that we captured because we couldn’t do quite so much with it, yet [it] would incur great costs to store it.”
[ Could AI solve that problem? Get real-world lessons learned from CIOs in the new HBR Analytic Services report, An Executive’s Guide to Real-World AI. ]
How AI fits with big data
“The more data we put through the machine learning models, the better they get. It’s a virtuous cycle.”
There’s a reciprocal relationship between big data and AI: The latter depends heavily on the former for success, while also helping organizations unlock the potential in their data stores in ways that were previously cumbersome or impossible.
“Today, we want as much [data] as we can get – not only to drive better insight into business problems we’re trying to solve, but because the more data we put through the machine learning models, the better they get,” Gruber says. “It’s a virtuous cycle in that way.”
How AI uses big data
It’s not as if storage and other issues with big data and analytics have gone bye-bye. Gruber, for one, notes that the pairing of big data and AI creates new needs (or underscores existing ones) around infrastructure, data preparation, and governance, for example. But in some cases, AI and ML technologies might be a key part of how organizations address those operational complexities. (Again, there’s a cyclical relationship here.)
[ Sort out the jargon jumble. Read: AI vs. machine learning: What’s the difference? ]
About that “better insight” thing: How is AI – and ML as its most prominent discipline in the business world at the moment – helping IT leaders deliver that, whether now or in the future? Let us count some ways.
6 ways AI fuels better insights
1. AI is creating new methods for analyzing data
One of the fundamental business problems of big data could sometimes be summarized with a simple question: Now what? As in: We’ve got all this stuff (that’s the technical term for it) and plenty more of it coming – so what do we do with it? In the once-deafening buzz around big data, it wasn’t always easy to hear the answers to that question.
Moreover, answering that question – or deriving insights from your data – usually required a lot of manual effort. AI is creating new methods for doing so. In a sense, AI and ML are the new methods, broadly speaking.
“Historically, when it comes to analyzing data, engineers have had to use a query or SQL (a list of queries). But as the importance of data continues to grow, a multitude of ways to get insights have emerged. AI is the next step to query/SQL,” says Steven Mih, CEO at Alluxio. “What used to be statistical models now has converged with computer science and has become AI and machine learning.”
2. Data analytics is becoming less labor-intensive
As a result, managing and analyzing data depends less on time-consuming manual effort than in the past. People still play a vital role in data management and analytics, but processes that might have taken days or weeks (or longer) are picking up speed thanks to AI.
“AI and ML are tools that help a company analyze their data more quickly and efficiently than what could be done [solely] by employees,” says Sue Clark, senior CTO architect at Sungard AS.
Mathias Golombek, CTO at Exasol, has observed a trend to a two-tier strategy when it comes to big data, as organizations contend with the massive scope of the information they must manage if they’re going to get any value from it: The storage layer and an operational analytics layer that sits on top of it. News flash: the operational analytics layer is the one the CEO cares about, even if it can’t function without the storage layer.
“For specific use cases, it revolutionizes the way you get rules, decisions, and predictions done.”
“That’s where insights are extracted out of data and data-driven decisions take place,” Golombek says. “AI is enhancing this analytics world with totally new capabilities to take semi-automatic decisions based on training data. It’s not applicable for all questions you have for data, but for specific use cases, it revolutionizes the way you get rules, decisions, and predictions done without complex human know-how.”
(In an upcoming post, we’ll look at some use cases that illuminate how AI and big data combine forces, such as in predictive maintenance – essentially predicting when a machine might fail, for example – and other practical applications.)
In other words, insights and decisions can happen faster. Moreover, IT can apply similar principles – using AI technologies to reduce manual, labor-intensive burdens and increase speed – to the back-end stuff that, let’s face it, few outside of IT want to hear about.
“The real-time nature of data insights, coupled with the fact that it exists everywhere now – siloed across different racks, regions, and clouds – means that companies are having to evolve from the traditional methods of managing and analyzing [data],” Mih from Alluxio says. That’s where AI comes in. “Gone are the days of data engineers manually copying data around again and again, delivering datasets weeks after a data scientist requests it.”
3. Humans still matter plenty
Like others, Elif Tutuk, associate VP of Qlik Research, sees AI and ML as powerful levers when it comes to big data.
“AI and machine learning, among other emerging technologies, are critical to helping businesses have a more holistic view of all of that data, providing them with a way to make connections between key data sets,” Tutuk says. But, she adds, it’s not a matter of cutting out human intelligence and insight.
“Businesses need to combine the power of human intuition with machine intelligence to augment these technologies – or augmented intelligence. More specifically, an AI system needs to learn from data, as well as from humans, in order to be able to fulfill its function,” Tutuk says.
“Businesses that successfully combined the power of human and technology are able to expand who has access to key insights from analytics beyond data scientists and business analysts while saving time and reducing potential bias that may result from business users interpreting data. This results in more efficient business operations, quicker insights gleaned from data and ultimately increased enterprise productivity.”

Diplomacy in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

Theme
The key question on the mind of policymakers now is whether Artificial Intelligence would be able to deliver on its promises instead of entering another season of scepticism and stagnation.
Summary
The quest for Artificial Intelligence (AI) has travelled through multiple “seasons of hope and despair” since the 1950s. The introduction of neural networks and deep learning in late 1990s has generated a new wave of interest in AI and growing optimism in the possibility of applying it to a wide range of activities, including diplomacy. The key question on the mind of policymakers now is whether AI would be able to deliver on its promises instead of entering another season of scepticism and stagnation. This paper evaluates the potential of IA to provide reliable assistance in areas of diplomatic interest such as in consular services, crisis management, public diplomacy and international negotiations, as well as the ratio between costs and contributions of AI applications to diplomatic work.
Analysis
The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by an American computer scientist, John McCarthy in 1956, who defined AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.1In basic terms, AI refers to the activity by which computers process large volumes of data using highly sophisticated algorithms to simulate human reasoning and/or behaviour.2 Russell & Norvig use these two dimensions (reasoning and behaviour) to group AI definitions according to the emphasis they place on thinking vs acting humanly. 3
Another approach to defining AI is by zooming in on the two constitutive components of the concept. Nils J. Nilsson defines, for instance, artificial intelligence as the “activity devoted to making machines intelligent” while “intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment”. 4 Echoing Nilsson’s view, the European Commission’s High-Level Group on AI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the term:
“Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal.”5
While the concept of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, one could argue that the ambition to push forward the frontier of machine intelligence is the main anchor that holds the concept together. As the authors of the report on “Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030” point out, we should not expect AI to “deliver” a life-changing product, but rather to continue to generate incremental improvements in its quest to achieve and possibly surpass human standards of reasoning and behaviour. In so doing, AI also sets in motion the so-called “AI effect”: as AI brings a new technology into the common fold, people become accustomed to this technology, it stops being considered AI, and newer technology emerges.6
In the same way that cars differ in terms of their quality and performance, AI programs also significantly vary along a broad spectrum ranging from rudimentary to super-intelligent forms. In consular and diplomatic affairs, the left side of this spectrum is already visible. At the lower end of the complexity scale, chat-bots now assist with visa applications, legal aid for refugees, and consular registrations.7  More sophisticated algorithms are being developed by MFAs to either advance the spread of positive narratives or inhibit online disinformation and propaganda.8 However, all these applications, regardless of their degree of technical sophistication, fall in the category of ‘narrow’ or ‘weak’ AI, as they are programmed to perform a single task. They extract and process information from a specific dataset to provide guidance on legal matters and consular services. The ‘narrow’ designation for such AI applications comes from fact that they cannot perform tasks outside the information confines delineated by their dataset.
By contrast, general AI refers to machines that exhibit human abilities ranging from problem-solving and creativity to taking decisions under conditions of uncertainty and thinking abstractly. They are thus able to perform intellectual activities like a human being, without any external help. Most importantly, strong AI would require some form of self-awareness or consciousness in order to be able to fully operate. If so, strong AI may reach a point in which it will be able not only to mimic the human brain but to surpass the cognitive performance of humans in all domains of interest. This is what Nick Bostrom calls superintelligence, an AI system that can do all that a human intellect can do, but faster (‘speed superintelligence’), or that it can aggregate a large number of smaller intelligences (‘collective superintelligence’) or that it is at least as fast as a human mind but vastly qualitatively smarter (‘quality superintelligence’).9
That being said, strong AI, let alone superintelligence, remain merely theoretical constructs at this time, as all applications developed thus far, including those that have attracted media attention such as Amazon’s Alexa or Tesla’s self-driving prototypes fall safely in the category of narrow AI. However, this may change soon, especially if quantum computing technology will make significant progress. Results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI is relatively optimistic. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and even working as a surgeon (by 2053). Furthermore, they believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years.10
AI and Diplomacy
Riding the waves of growing interest about AI in IR and security studies,11 the debate about the role of AI in diplomacy is also gaining momentum, although academic discussions are progressing rather slowly, without a clear analytical focus. As the authors of a recent report on AI opportunities for the conduct of diplomacy point out, discussions about AI in the context of foreign policy and diplomacy often lack clarity in terminology. They suggest that a better understanding of the relationship between AI and diplomacy could come from building on the distinction between AI as a diplomatic topic, AI as a diplomatic tool, and AI as a factor that shapes the environment in which diplomacy is practised. As a topic for diplomacy, AI is relevant for a broader policy agenda ranging from economy, business, and security, all the way to democracy, human rights, and ethics. As a tool for diplomacy, AI looks at how it can support the functions of diplomacy and the day-to-day tasks of diplomats. As a factor that impacts the environment in which diplomacy is practised, AI could well turn out to be the defining technology of our time and as such it has the potential to reshape the foundation of the international order.12
Taking note of the fact that developments in AI are so dynamic and the implications so wide-ranging, another report prepared by a German think tank calls on Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) to immediately begin planning strategies that can respond effectively to the influence of AI in international affairs. Economic disruption, security & autonomous weapons, and democracy & ethics are the three areas they identify as priorities at the intersection of AI and foreign policy. Although they believe that transformational changes to diplomatic institutions will eventually be needed to meet the challenges ahead, they favour, in the short term, an incremental approach to AI that builds on the successes (and learns from the failures) of “cyber-foreign policy”, which, in many countries, has been already internalised in the culture of the relevant institutions, including of the MFAs.13 In the same vein, the authors of a report prepared for the Centre for a New American Security see great potential for AI in national security-related areas, including diplomacy. For example, AI can help improve communication between governments and foreign publics by lowering language barriers between countries, enhance the security of diplomatic missions via image recognition and information sorting technologies, and support international humanitarian operations by monitoring elections, assisting in peacekeeping operations, and ensuring that financial aid disbursements are not misused through anomaly detection.14
From an AI perspective, consular services could be a low-hanging fruit for AI integration in diplomacy as decisions are amenable to digitisation, the analytical contribution is reasonable relevant and the technology favours collaboration between users and the machine. Consular services rely on highly structured decisions, as they largely involve recurring and routinised operations based on clear and stable procedures, which do not need to be treated as new each time a decision has to be made (except for crisis situations, which are discussed further below). From a knowledge perspective, AI-assisted consular services may embody declarative (know-what) and procedural knowledge (know-how) to automate routinised operations and scaffold human cognition by reducing cognitive effort. This can be done by using data mining and data discovery techniques to organize the data and make it possible to identify patterns and relationships that would be difficult to observe otherwise (e.g., variation of demand for services by location, time, and audience profile).Case study #1: AI as Digital Consul AssistantThe consulate of country X has been facing uneven demand for emergency passports, visa requests and business certifications in the past five years. The situation has led to a growing backlog, significant loss of public reputation and a tense relationship between the consulate and the MFA. An AI system trained with data from the past five years uses descriptive analytics to identify patterns in the applications and concludes that August, May and December are the most likely months to witness an increase of the demand in the three categories next year. AI predictions are confirmed for August and May but not for December. AI recalibrates its advice using updated data and the new predictions help consular officers manage requests more effectively. As the MFA confidence in the AI system grows, the digital assistant is then introduced to other consulates experiencing similar problems.
Digital platforms could also emerge as indispensable tools for managing diplomatic crises in the digital age and for good reasons. They can help embassies and MFAs make sense of the nature and gravity of the events in real-time, streamline the decision-making process, manage the public’s expectations, and facilitate crisis termination. At the same time, they need to be used with great care as factual inaccuracies, coordination gaps, mismatched disclosure level, and poor symbolic signalling could easily derail digital efforts of crisis management.15 AI systems could provide great assistance to diplomats in times of crisis by helping them make sense of what it is happening (descriptive analytics) and identify possible trends (predictive analytics). The main challenge for AI is the semi-structured nature of the decisions to be taken. While many MFAs have pre-designed plans to activate in case of a crisis, it is safe to assume that reality often defies the best crafted plans. Given the high level of uncertainty in which crisis decision-making operates and the inevitable scrutiny and demand of accountability to occur if something goes wrong, AI integration can work only if humans retain control over the process. As a recent SIPRI study pointed out, AI systems may fail spectacularly when confronted with tasks or environments that differ slightly to those they were trained for. Their algorithms are also opaque, which makes difficult for humans to explain how they work and whether they include bias that could lead to problematic –if not dangerous– behaviours.16
As data is turning into the “new oil”, one would expect that the influence of digital technologies on public diplomacy to maximise interest in learning how to make oneself better heard, listened and followed by the relevant audiences. As the volume of data-driven interactions continue to grow at an exponential rate, one can make oneself heard by professionally learning how to separate ‘signals’ from the background ‘noise’ and by pro-actively adjusting her message to ensure maximal visibility in the online space, in real time. Making oneself listened would require, by extension, a better understanding of the cognitive frames and emotional undertones that enable audiences to meaningfully connect with a particular message. Making oneself followed would involve micro-level connections with the audience based on individual interests and preferences.17Case study #2: AI as Digital PD AssistantThe embassy of country X in Madrid would like to conduct a public diplomacy campaign in support of one of the following policy priorities: increasing the level of educational exchanges of Spanish students in the home country,  showcasing the strength of the military relationship between country  X and the Spain and boosting Spanish investments in the home country.  As it has only £25,000 in the budget for the campaign, it needs to know which version can demonstrate better return on investment. Using social media data, an AI system will first seek to listen and determine the level of interest and reception (positive, negative, neutral) of the public in the three topics. The next step will be to use diagnostic analytics to explain the possible drivers of interest in each topic (message, format, influencers) and the likelihood of the public reacting to the embassy’s campaign. The last step will be to run simulations to evaluate which campaign will be able to have the strongest impact given the way in which the public positions itself on each topic and the factors that may help increase or decrease public interest in them.
At the operational level of the digital diplomat decisions are expected to take a structured form as the way to meaningfully communicate with the audience would rely on continuously tested principles of digital outreach with a likely focus on visual enhancement, emotional framing, and algorithmic-driven engagement. AI could assist these efforts by providing reliable diagnostics of the scope conditions for impact via network, cluster and semantic analyses. Prescriptive analytics could also offer insight into the comparative value-added of alternative approaches to digital engagement (e.g., which method proves more impactful in terms of making oneself heard, listened and followed). On the downside, the knowledge so generated would likely stimulate a competitive relationship between the AI system and digital diplomats as most of the work done by the later could be gradually automated. However, such a development might be welcome by budget-strapped MFAs and embassies seeking to maintain their influence and make the best of their limited resources by harnessing the power of technological innovation.
Given the growing technical complexity and resource-intensive nature of international negotiations it is hardly surprisingly that AI has already started to disrupt this field. The Cognitive Trade Advisor (CTA) developed by IBM aims to assist trade negotiators dealing with rules of origin (criteria used to identify the origin /nationality of a product) by answering queries related to existing trade agreements, custom duties corresponding to different categories of rules of origin, and even to the negotiating profiles of the party of interest.18 CTA uses descriptive analytics to provide timely and reliable insight into technically complex issues that would otherwise require days or possibly weeks for an experienced team to sort out. It does not replace the negotiator in making decisions, nor does it conduct negotiations by itself, or at least not yet. It simply assists the negotiator in figuring out the best negotiating strategy by reducing critical information gaps, provided that the integrity of the AI system has not been compromised by hostile parties. The competitive advantage that such a system could offer negotiators cannot be ignored, although caveats remain for cases in which negotiations would involve semi-structured decisions such as climate negotiations or the Digital Geneva Convention to protect cyberspace. The problem for such cases lies with the lower degree of data veracity (confidence in the data) when dealing with matters that can easily become subject to interpretation and contestation, hence the need for stronger human expertise and judgement to assess the value of competing courses of action in line with the definition of national interests as agreed upon by foreign policy makers. 
Conclusions
As Bostrom has shown, the quest for Artificial intelligence has travelled through multiple “seasons of hope and despair”. The early attempts in the 1950s at the Dartmouth College sought to provide a proof of concept for AI by demonstrating that machines were able to perform complicated logical tests. Following a period of stagnation, another burst of innovative thinking took place in early 1970s, which showed that logical reasoning could be integrated with perception and used to control physical activity. However, difficulties in scaling up AI findings soon led to an “AI winter” of declining funding and increased scepticism. A new springtime arrived with the launch of the Fifth Generation Computer System Project by Japan in early 1980s, which led to the proliferation of expert systems as new tools of AI-supported decision-making. After another period of relative stagnation, the introduction of neural networks and deep learning in late 1990s has generated a new wave of interest in AI and growing optimism in the possibility of applying it to a wide range of activities, including diplomacy. The key question on the mind of policymakers now is whether AI would be able to deliver on its promises instead of entering another season of scepticism and stagnation. If AI would be able to demonstrate value in a consistent manner by providing reliable assistance in areas of diplomatic interest such as in consular services, crisis management, public diplomacy and international negotiations, as suggested above, then the future of AI in diplomacy should look bright. If, on the other hand, the ratio between costs and contributions of AI applications to diplomatic work would stay high, then the appetite for AI integration would likely decline.

2 In simple terms, behaviour refers to the way in which people act to a situation in response to certain internal or external stimuli. The classical theory of human behaviour, the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model argues that  individual behaviour is best explained by the way in which agents develop intentions (desires that the agent has committed to pursue) out of a broader range of desires (states of affairs they would like to bring about), which in turn are derived from a set of beliefs (information the agent has about the world). The way in which intentions are formed remain a matter of dispute between different schools of thought, with a traditional view emphasizing the role of rational reasoning (the rational dimension) , while others stressing the importance of internal mental processes (the cognitive dimension), or the social context in which this occurs (the social dimension).

“Efforts to cultivate algorithmic fairness lag far behind the enthusiasm to adopt the technology”

American industry is in the midst of another revolution. This one is taking us to a place where decisions of many kinds, from when you should go in for a coronary bypass to where your car should turn left, will no longer be made entirely by us; they will be guided by artificial intelligence. That’s good news, because artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for improving the health and welfare of much of the planet. But for society to take full advantage of the power of AI, algorithmic outcomes must be fair, and the application of those outcomes must be ethical.
So far, efforts to cultivate algorithmic fairness lag far behind the enthusiasm to adopt the technology. Industry, with its drive for competitive advantage and focus on profits, has shown little inclination to shoulder this responsibility. The institution that needs to play a critical role in leading the way to an AI-powered world that is both ethical and fair is higher education.
At many technology companies, concern about the potential for unethical use of AI is the elephant in the room, and employee unease has prompted the hiring of ethics officers and review boards. This is a step in a positive direction, but it is not enough to overcome the challenge we face.
That problem is twofold: there are the underpinnings of technology itself, and there is the application of AI in ethical and unbiased ways. Machines may be fast learners, but the data they learn from are often a compilation of human decisions. If those decisions are freighted with bias, and they often are, AI can bake that in too, creating a system that is perpetually unfair.
Research has shown, for example, that some AI-powered facial recognition software returns more false matches for African Americans than it does for white people. Such technological shortcomings are exacerbated by AI’s failure to recognize them as shortcomings, as humans might do. Algorithms do not self-correct. They self-reinforce.
And humans, although gifted with the ability to identify problems and make ethical corrections, apply that ability in a very human way—selectively. Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently combed the databases of driver’s licenses in states that use facial recognition technology without informing the drivers. And Amazon shareholders recently rejected a proposal to audit its facial recognition software, which critics claim can lead to false matches and arrests. With law enforcement engaging in questionable practices and industry failing to do the work needed, academia must redouble its leadership in this critical area.
With its teaching mission, its predilection for interdisciplinary research, and its indifference to quick profits from research projects, academia is well positioned to lay down the path to ethical AI. The teaching part of that effort is already underway. A Law for Algorithms course, which explores the impact of algorithms on society, was recently jointly taught at Boston University, Harvard, Columbia, and Berkeley, and many other universities include similar considerations in computer science courses. Cornell, MIT, Stanford, and the University of Texas offer specific courses on the ethical design of intelligent systems. Universities are undertaking the necessary research to power unbiased AI as well. 
At Boston University, researchers are investigating techniques that could be used to reliably apply algorithms trained on one population to other populations that were underrepresented in the training set. They are also trying to determine exactly how learning machines reach their conclusions, because it seems doubly unethical to apply potentially unfair conclusions when those conclusions cannot be explained to the humans who live by them. The goal of all this is the development of what is aptly called “fair machine learning,” which will allow us to tap the power of AI to study societal problems, ranging from affordable housing to the influence of fake news.
To accomplish that, universities need the government’s help. In line with the National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan recommendations, public policy and federal funding agencies should support research initiatives that bring the expertise of academic scientists to bear on projects that serve the public good. Laws and regulations must advance and support the research and applicable solutions coming out of higher education and require industry to incorporate the ethics of AI as a critical component of their business model. Additionally, federal funding will not only help advance AI, but as a recent study shows, it will also fuel innovation and job growth. That’s a win-win. 
That’s not enough. A comprehensive examination of AI’s potential for harm, as well as good, should be an integrated part of all computer science education, and should work toward cultivating ways of thinking that are particularly attuned to fairness. Furthermore, as AI expands its role in the guidance of our lives, the technology that we have long labeled computer science must be considered as much a social science discipline as it is a STEM discipline, replete with the moral mission inherent in fields like public health or economics. This broadening of the discipline, aided by greater engagement with the humanities and social sciences, is critical as higher education trains the next generation of computer science citizens.  
All of us, in government, academia, and industry, must work together to set the future of AI on the most beneficial and safest course for everyone—but higher education, with proper support and with leadership from the computer science community, must step up and lead the charge.

People have more trust in robots than their managers, according to the second annual AI at Work study conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace, a research firm preparing leaders for disruptions in recruiting, development and employee engagement. The study of 8,370 employees, managers and HR leaders across 10 countries, found that artificial intelligence has changed the relationship between people and technology at work and is reshaping the role HR teams and managers need to play in attracting, retaining and developing talent.

“With technology adding great value to all organizational functions, people are excited about increasingly leveraging technologies like AI in HR. The study shows that the equation between people and technology is being re-written and the organizations need to work closely with their HR teams to meet the changing expectations of people. The study also highlights another aspect that with technology taking care of transactional activities, leaders and managers need to bring more strategic value to management and use more of their soft skills with people. If managers want to survive the challenge of AI, they must embrace EI,” said Shaakun Khanna, Head of HCM Applications, Asia Pacific, Oracle.
Artificial intelligence is changing the relationship between people and technology at work
Contrary to common fears around how AI will impact jobs, employees, managers and HR leaders across the globe are reporting increased adoption of AI at work and many are welcoming AI with love and optimism.

There is a new piece of data software doing the rounds in football circles. Pitched as a recruiting tool, it uses artificial intelligence to crunch player data and work out how influential over 90,000 players across the world have been in their leagues – before further refining the data so that the same up-and-coming stars can be compared by position, player role, age, nationality or even league. It gives clubs who pay the subscription fee a definitive list on, say, the best 23 year-old left-backs available for under £5 million in 250 competitions across the globe. It’s the work of Dutch data firm SciSports, who are working with more than 75 clubs worldwide and who are trying to boost their influence in the Premier League market, and have developed a razor sharp algorithm that, they claim, can give clubs a recruitment edge.

 How Newcastle United got a sports science edge: Big data, blood tests and brilliant training plans

 One of the features they’ve been showing off to English clubs recently is the shadow squad option. This crunches the data for every club in the Premier League and allows them to measure the quality of the squad against various league positions. So if you pick top four and then connect it to, say, Newcastle it’ll be able to flag up how many of United’s players would – according to their algorithm – be capable of stepping into a squad challenging for those positions. Welcome to the world of recruitment in 2019: the growing influence of insight, data and artificial intelligence is a noticeable trend in a world that is becoming the testing ground for some really groundbreaking work. But how do you bring that new new world order together with the established order of scouts who still have so much to offer and agents and companies who hold the key to players? The rise of so-called transfer speed dating is one way – and an agent based in Newcastle has one of the UK-based events that is growing increasingly influential. 









 Middlesbrough-born Tony Sharkey was a young pro at Leeds United before become an agent almost 20 years. And his new venture – the Football Transfer Forum – is one of the so-called “transfer speed dating” events which enables agents, club recruitment officials, sporting directors, sports lawyers and Chief Scouts to network in the crucial weeks before the transfer window.

 Revealed: The transfer summit Newcastle United were involved in this week as they look to finally do deals

 December sees the fourth edition of the event at Anfield and around 150 professionals from clubs across the four professional leagues and the SPL – as well as La Liga – will pay up to £350 for a place. There are keynote speakers – Dan Ashworth, formerly of the FA and now at Brighton, has given a speech, as has Steve Walsh, the man credited with spotting many of the players who helped Leicester to win the note. Companies like Football Manager – who want to roll out their extensive database to professional clubs in England – and player insurance firms also pay for tables and introductions. Newcastle have been among the attendees at previous events - at the Riverside and the Etihad - and the company who connected Ludwig Francilette to United in the summer are one of the firms who have made the most of the opportunity to alert clubs to players who might not be on their scouting radars.

 What Steve Nickson does at Newcastle United as transfer chief

 And it is the recruitment work that is the basis for the event. It’s a fascinating way for “prep work” for transfer windows to be carried out, giving clubs the chance to lay the groundwork for their target lists and also for intermediaries to alert clubs about potential players – and vice versa. “It’s basically pre-work before the window. I’m an agent so what might happen is someone from one of the clubs might say ‘We need a left-back this January’ and I’ve got a left-back or know someone who has one, it gives them something to work on,” Sharkey explains over coffee in a Jesmond cafe. “This is a networking event and it’s bringing people in the football business in the recruitment and transfer of players together. “It’s just one day before the transfer window but it brings them together: some won’t have met, some will have had phone calls and know each other over a period of time but it’s a good way of touching base with everybody. There’ll be a lot of clubs, a lot of agents and some good companies as well.” Sharkey sees a more modern generation of recruitment professionals are entering the game who are brilliant at using the tech – scouting platforms Wyscout and Scout7 or video analysis tool Hudl – with their route into the game through university degrees, analytics or science rather than having played the game. Maybe they haven’t had quite as much experience of pressing the flesh as their senior colleagues. Transfer forums, and Wyscout also hold their own event in Amsterdam this November which draws clubs from across the Continent, are one way of changing that. “I’m starting to see younger element now coming into the game,” he says. 










Tony Sharkey, the founder of Football Transfer Forum, at the last event at Etihad

 “Scouts being employed by clubs are very good with the computer, they watch games on screens with the different data packages and are incredibly data savvy. They’ve been brought up on Football Manager or FIFA and that younger breed of scouts are coming into the game which is freshening things up a bit. “They probably know each other on LinkedIn or one of the other platforms but to actually go and meet in person is a benefit.” Each club is given a table and agents and intermediaries book “appointments”. Clubs can also network between themselves with five minute “dates”. Sharkey explains: “It’s five minutes of ‘speed dating’. It’s done like that but there’s lots of time during the day and the evening where you can meet informally.

 “The clubs have a table and then agents and some people from the companies that come, they book in an appointment with them. It’s a five minute conversation, an exchange of details or business cards or just a catch up and that’s how it works.

As the technology evolves, applications for autonomous vehicles, robotics, data mining and precision medicine, among others, are taking off and creating lucrative opportunities.AI is expected to add 14 per cent to the world’s gross domestic product by 2030, equivalent to $15.7 trillion (Dh57.7tn), according to business consultancy PwC. Experts estimate that AI’s contribution to the UAE economy will match the global increase of 14 per cent – the largest GDP share in the Middle East – in the same time frame. The country ranks 19th worldwide on the government AI readiness index, first in the region, according to Oxford Insights.“The invention of electricity, the railroad, smartphones all transformed the world as we knew it. AI can lead to an ever-greater societal and economic transformation,” said Dr Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of State and chairman of the MBZUAI board of trustees.Talent and academic institutions are essential, he said.  “The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence is an open invitation from Abu Dhabi to the world to unleash AI’s full potential.”Artificial intelligence in UAEThis is the teaching moment for artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence isn't coming to the UAE - it is already hereThe university was officially launched on Wednesday at its campus in Masdar City.The UAE was among the first nations to see an opportunity in AI for its economy. In 2017, the government rolled out an AI strategy, dubbed UAE 2031, outlining plans to use the technology to make governance more efficient and naming eight sectors it aims to transform including space, renewable energy, water and education. The country also appointed the world's first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Al Olama. Mr Al Olama was present at the launch on Wednesday, alongside Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, Minister of State for Higher Education and Advanced Skills, and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Hamad Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Airports. Mr Al Olama and Dr Al Falasi are also members of the university's advisory board.""You're seeing the AI race emerge, with more than 20 national strategies. Countries are saying we need to lead and not be playing catch-up on this opportunity,"" Faisal Hamady, principal at Boston Consulting Group, told The National. ""It's a bit of a positioning game.""The money governments are investing is primarily going into research and development, workforce training, data infrastructure and governance, as well as helping start-ups grow, Mr Hamady said.Start-up data aggregator Magnitt counts 128 Mena start-ups on its platform that use AI. Of those, 52 are based in the UAE.Combined, these 128 start-ups have raised $18 million to date, according to Magnitt, indicating that the application of AI is still in the early stages. However, half of the amount was raised within this year, which might point to an upward trend, Sietse van de Kerkhof, a venture capital data manager at Magnitt, told The National.GOV-FIVE-YEAR-COMMITMENT“Aside from certain hotspots around the world, like the US and China, pure AI research is rare,” Mr van de Kerkhof said.With the opening of MBZUAI, AI research will be both common and local in the UAE.The university's founding board of trustees comprise leaders in the field. They include MBZUAI interim president, Professor Michael Brady, who teaches oncological imaging at the University of Oxford; Prof Anil Jain, a lecturer at Michigan State University; Dr Kai-Fu Lee, a technology executive and venture capitalist based in Beijing; and Prof Daniela Rus, director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Professor Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, Dean of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University in Beijing and Peng Xiao, CEO of Group 42.MBZUAI has partnered with the Abu Dhabi-based Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI), an applied research lab, to supervise PhD students and curriculum development. IIAI will also serve as a principal partner for collaborative research.The university will offer master of science and PhD programmes in three of the fastest-growing areas of AI: machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing.""Following decades of research into machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are now at a turning point in the widespread application of advanced intelligence. That evolution is – among other things – creating exciting new career opportunities in nearly every sector of society,"" said Prof Brady, interim president of MBZUAI.",https://www.thenationalnews.com,2021-06-23T07:03:28.572Z,,,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Collection', 'headline': 'op 08 05 Oct Launch of MBZ University of Artificial

'width': 250, 'height': 69}","The UAE is rolling out its biggest effort yet to develop a workforce versed in artificial intelligence, as the rapidly-advancing technology transforms economies worldwide. The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), a new graduate-level AI research institution in Abu Dhabi, is accepting applications for its first masters and PhD programmes this month, with classes scheduled to begin in September 2020. As the first university to have a singular focus on AI, the institution aims to attract students from around the world to advance the technology and propel the UAE’s economic diversification efforts.  To compete with more than a hundred graduate degree programmes in AI – mainly in North America, China and the UK – MBZUAI is offering full scholarships, monthly stipends, health insurance and accommodation to all students. MBZUAI is named after Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, who believes in the transformative power of knowledge and scientific thinking. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, a subset of AI, are gaining leaps forward in mimicking human thinking – creating the building blocks for automatic systems that can be improved through experience and data. As the technology evolves, applications for autonomous vehicles, robotics, data mining and precision medicine, among others, are taking off and creating lucrative opportunities. AI is expected to add 14 per cent to the world’s gross domestic product by 2030, equivalent to $15.7 trillion (Dh57.7tn), according to business consultancy PwC. Experts estimate that AI’s contribution to the UAE economy will match the global increase of 14 per cent – the largest GDP share in the Middle East – in the same time frame. The country ranks 19th worldwide on the government AI readiness index, first in the region, according to Oxford Insights.  “The invention of electricity, the railroad, smartphones all transformed the world as we knew it. AI can lead to an ever-greater societal and economic transformation,” said Dr Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of State and chairman of the MBZUAI board of trustees. Talent and academic institutions are essential, he said.  “The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence is an open invitation from Abu Dhabi to the world to unleash AI’s full potential.”  The university was officially launched on Wednesday at its campus in Masdar City. The UAE was among the first nations to see an opportunity in AI for its economy. In 2017, the government rolled out an AI strategy, dubbed UAE 2031, outlining plans to use the technology to make governance more efficient and naming eight sectors it aims to transform including space, renewable energy, water and education. The country also appointed the world's first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Al Olama. Mr Al Olama was present at the launch on Wednesday, alongside Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, Minister of State for Higher Education and Advanced Skills, and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Hamad Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Airports. Mr Al Olama and Dr Al Falasi are also members of the university's advisory board. ""You're seeing the AI race emerge, with more than 20 national strategies. Countries are saying we need to lead and not be playing catch-up on this opportunity,"" Faisal Hamady, principal at Boston Consulting Group, told <em>The National</em>. ""It's a bit of a positioning game."" The money governments are investing is primarily going into research and development, workforce training, data infrastructure and governance, as well as helping start-ups grow, Mr Hamady said. Start-up data aggregator Magnitt counts 128 Mena start-ups on its platform that use AI. Of those, 52 are based in the UAE. Combined, these 128 start-ups have raised $18 million to date, according to Magnitt, indicating that the application of AI is still in the early stages. However, half of the amount was raised within this year, which might point to an upward trend, Sietse van de Kerkhof, a venture capital data manager at Magnitt, told <em>The National</em>.  “Aside from certain hotspots around the world, like the US and China, pure AI research is rare,” Mr van de Kerkhof said. With the opening of MBZUAI, AI research will be both common and local in the UAE. The university's founding board of trustees comprise leaders in the field. They include MBZUAI interim president, Professor Michael Brady, who teaches oncological imaging at the University of Oxford; Prof Anil Jain, a lecturer at Michigan State University; Dr Kai-Fu Lee, a technology executive and venture capitalist based in Beijing; and Prof Daniela Rus, director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Professor Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, Dean of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University in Beijing and Peng Xiao, CEO of Group 42.  MBZUAI has partnered with the Abu Dhabi-based Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI), an applied research lab, to supervise PhD students and curriculum development. IIAI will also serve as a principal partner for collaborative research. The university will offer master of science and PhD programmes in three of the fastest-growing areas of AI: machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing. ""Following decades of research into machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are now at a turning point in the widespread application of advanced intelligence. That evolution is – among other things – creating exciting new career opportunities in nearly every sector of society,"" said Prof Brady, interim president of MBZUAI.",Technology,https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/Q3B47OQVEWV5GFYLELAONN4TPA.jpg?smart=true&auth=95a8568e4f2f1deab29ad8e812583e3dd46b39fbae9e7262a26534187d86f8f2&width=400&height=225,[],

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Banks and other financial institutions can be tight-lipped about how they implement AI technologies within their businesses. Citi, however, has been relatively open about their current AI initiatives. Since 2017, they have published press releases and other announcements of AI initiatives that are both internal and customer-facing. In this article, we cover three of Citi’s AI initiatives and explain how they work: Document Digitization: Digitizing paper forms for a risk analytics platform. Customer Service Chatbot and Mobile App: Citi’s mobile app that features a conversational interface for customer service and account inquiries.  Fraud Detection: Leveraging Feedzai’s anomaly detection platform for more accurate risk management.  Document Digitization Citi announced a collaborative project with Ernst & Young (EY) and SAS to leverage AI for an advanced risk analytics scoring engine. The initiative is intended to help streamline the manual processes required to review large amounts of global trade transactions while keeping regulatory compliance intact.  Citi Global Trade has been progressively digitizing its platform. Part of this involves digitizing millions of trade-related documents each year using an optical character recognition (OCR) component which likely involves machine vision. In order to create an AI-powered document digitization application, Citi would need to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine vision. This would allow the application to automatically recognize each character and copy them into a digital version of the document. The document could then be searchable with an NLP-based enterprise search application. Customer Service Chatbot In 2018, Citi released its first chatbot, called Citi Bot SG, for Facebook Messenger in Singapore. The chatbot was available for all consumer banking customers after a beta testing period involving 600 customers and employees. While the initial release was for Singapore customers exclusively, Citi claims they will be rolling out the chatbot for other markets such as North America and parts of China.  The company claimed Citi Bot is able to help customers with a variety of needs, such as account specific questions like account balances. This also includes inquiries about recent transactions, bill summaries, and reward point balances. In order to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with this kind of conversational interface, Citi would need to develop an ML model trained on hundreds of thousands of customer service questions and their correct responses.  Once the model and the NLP software are combined, the resulting chatbot may be able to offer “intuitive” answers to customer questions, as Citi states. An intuitive answer likely is one that the chatbot delivers in complete sentences that are intended to give the customer the feeling that a real person is sending them the message.  While Citi is unclear on the complete functionality of the Singapore version of the chatbot, we can infer that it can request the company’s account files and provide users with information about their accounts on request. It may be able to link or redirect users to a page of Citi’s website where they may be able to find or update that information, but the company has not confirmed this functionality. In July of 2019, Citi Bot SG was replaced with Citigroup’s new mobile app aimed at global consumer banking customers. They claim this app features all of the same services Citi Bot SG users came to appreciate during its run. According to Citi’s website, users can now automatically offset their spending with their virtual points, find discounts, and withdraw cash from credit cards on this new version. However, it is unclear how much of this new functionality is accessible through the conversational interface itself. Anomaly Detection-based Fraud Detection Citi also partnered with Feedzai in 2018 in order to make use of their AI platform for risk management and fraud detection in banking. Citi claims they intend to integrate Feedzai’s platform f into its currently available services such as accounts payable. This may empower clients with more control over risk management for all their transactions. Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions (Citi TTS), has stated that this strategic partnership is a good example of their commitment to using new technologies to drive innovation. In reference to this partnership, Kohli said, “With the help of Feedzai’s solution, we can scale rapidly in an effort to deliver value to our clients, allowing them to make payments securely, efficiently and without friction, across the globe.” Citi may appear focused on providing risk management without slowing down their claims processing tech stack. In addition to the constant innovations of fraud detection and payment processing, cyber-attacks and other fraud methods are constantly improving. It is because of this that Citi’s clients expect progressively faster and safer transactions. They claim that their integration of Feedzai’s software will help these clients stay aware of new threats without taking more of their time. Feedzai has claimed their OpenML Engine helps banking data science teams create new ML models for fraud detections using provided sample models. It is likely that Citi has used some form of this to develop their models for banking and commerce customers. This offering may have helped Citi decide to partner with Feedzai, because the existing machine learning models indicated a higher chance of security and perhaps success.  The following image explains how the Feedzai’s platform works. The data flows from large storage units referred to as “data lakes” and APIs into the OpenML Engine platform. The platform then routes the data towards experiments and real-time analysis.  The data from this deployment also funnels into the “Feedzai risk studio,” which is likely a database Feedzai uses to improve future products. It is unclear whether Citi has access to the full Feedzai risk studio:  Feedzai’s software can purportedly accomplish this by monitoring all transactions for any discrepancies or unusual payment behavior. It would then analyze these anomalies before the transactions are cleared to continue through the system. Citi claims that they may have a new solution using Feedzai’s anomaly detection in 2019.   Header Image Credit: Fortune Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at JPMorgan - Current InitiativesAccording to Fortune, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S. and controls over… Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Artificial Intelligence at Barclays - Current InitiativesBarclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks.… Artificial Intelligence in Retail Banking - Current ApplicationsMany business processes in retail banking are ripe for automation with AI.

Abu Dhabi has launched the world’s first graduate level artificial intelligence (AI) university, it was revealed on Wednesday. 
Located in Masdar City, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) will offer Master of Science, Msc, and PhD level programmes in key areas of AI such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.


MBZUAI has partnered with the Abu Dhabi-based Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI) for the supervision of PhD students and curriculum development. IIAI will also serve as a principal partner for collaborative research.
MBZUAI will also bring together experts from the AI community by hosting regional and international conferences, seminars and workshops, a statement said. 
The university will provide all admitted students with a full scholarship, plus benefits such as a monthly allowance, health insurance, and accommodation. It will also work with local and global companies to secure internships and assist students in finding employment opportunities, officials said. 
Graduate students can now apply to MBZUAI via the university’s website with registration set to open in August 2020. The first class of graduate students will commence coursework in September 2020.


Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, minister of State has been appointed chair of the MBZUAI board of trustees and is spearheading the establishment of the university. 
The board of trustees will also include MBZUAI interim president, Sir Michael Brady, professor of Oncological Imaging at the University of Oxford, UK as well as academics from the US and China. 
It will also have an advisory board chaired by Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, UAE’s minister of State for Artificial Intelligence.

“AI is already changing the world, but we can achieve so much more if we allow the limitless imagination of the human mind to fully explore it,” said Al Jaber. 
“The university will bring the discipline of AI into the forefront, molding and empowering creative pioneers who can lead us to a new AI empowered era,” he added. 
AI is booming is expected to add roughly $15.7 trillion to the world’s gross domestic product by 2030, according to PwC. In line with that, the UAE also made AI a strategic national priority in 2017 and announced a strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031 with the appointment of the world’s first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence. 
“The invention of electricity, the railroad, smartphones all transformed the world as we knew it. AI can lead to an ever greater societal and economic transformation, but first we must ensure we have the right infrastructure, talents, and academic institutions,” said Al Jaber. 
“The launch of the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence is a clear demonstration of the UAE’s commitment to encouraging innovation and empowering younger generations in the UAE and around the world.”
