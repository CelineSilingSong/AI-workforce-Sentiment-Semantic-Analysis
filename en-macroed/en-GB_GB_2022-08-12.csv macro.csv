Today, AI has transformed our lives, from voice recognition devices to intelligent chatbots. This amazing technology has brought many good and bad things into our lives, and it will have an even greater impact in the coming decades. However, every good thing has a drawback, and AI is no exception.

Some of the most respected leaders of science, most notably the late Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that super-intelligent machines could pose a long-term threat to humanity. Fears of a potentially evil AI or AI gone rogue have been legitimized. While businesses are often eager to take advantage of all that AI has to offer, they may also be concerned about what might happen if AI were to overpower humankind. Regardless of how unlikely that is, with the advancement of AI algorithms and machine learning, it is now a topic worth discussing.


The Emergence of Different Types of AI
AI and its variants are used to devise novel solutions to various problems. This assists in reaching and exceeding human performance in any task. The systems are programmed to play a specific role as well as or better than a human. They have also become more successful in a brief period, which no one could have predicted—for example, beating human opponents in complex games, which experts predicted would take years.

As many are concerned about the power AI may one day wield over humanity, the reality is that top AI academics are equally worried about its more sinister potential. It is past time for people to realize that there will be no more attempts at developing powerful artificial intelligence. Unlike other revolutionary developments for humanity, if this fails, there is no chance to try again and learn from the mistakes. There have already been a few instances of developed AI gone rogue or AI functioning in unexpected ways, creating concern over AI dystopia—for example, Microsoft's Tay chatbot engaged in misogynistic and racist content within hours of launch. Within 16 hours, Tay was taken offline.

PROMOTED
How Will AI Effect Human Society?
There are legitimate reasons to be concerned. Current AI research is overly focused on making advances in a narrow set of domains and pays insufficient attention to the disruptive effects on society's fabric. If AI technology continues on its current trajectory, it will likely cause social upheaval for at least two reasons. Firstly, AI will have an impact on the future of work. Our current trajectory over-automates work while refusing to invest in human productivity. Further advances will displace workers while failing to create new opportunities and, as a result, miss out on AI's full potential to boost productivity. Also, AI has the potential to undermine democracy and individual liberties.

Unemployment
The next step will be unemployment, as many jobs will be replaced by machinery. Many automobile assembly lines are now filled with machines and robots, forcing traditional workers out of work.

Wealth Inequality
Wealth inequality will be created as AI investors take the lion's share of the earnings. The gap between rich and poor will grow wider. The so-called ""M"" shape of wealth distribution will become more apparent.
Self-Learning Algorithms
Issues emerge not only in the social sense but also in AI itself, as the AI that is trained and taught how to operate the given task can eventually take off to the point where human control is lost, resulting in unanticipated problems and consequences. It refers to AI's ability to function autonomously after being loaded with all necessary algorithms, ignoring the command given by the human controller.
Origin of racial and egocentric bots
The human creators of AI may create something with racial bias or egocentrically oriented to harm certain people or things. AI has the potential to target specific races or programmed objects to carry out the programmers' command of destruction, resulting in a global disaster.
The AI revolution is a contentious issue. Many AI experts have openly spoken out about the negative effects of AI gone rogue on human society and asked researchers to investigate the societal effects of AI. The rapid advancement of AI technology necessitates constant regulation and monitoring before the negative consequences become too severe.
AI takeover will be limited to the entertaining plots of dystopian movies and fictional worlds if proper laws protect the users. The omniscient and nearly omnipotent power of AI has been called into question. There may be no definitive answer to the question of AI replacing humans in various industries. Only predictions and observations are available. The future of AI remains hazy, which justifies the question that we are repeatedly asked - will AI replace humans? The answer remains a mystery.

It's old news that locating, hiring and retaining top talent is HR's No. 1 challenge. However, the vast changes stemming from the pandemic's impact on remote work and many people's reassessment of their personal life choices, not to mention the ""great resignation,"" have exacerbated these perennial challenges. Systemic issues such as the dearth of child and family care with its outsized effect on the employment of women, the ongoing toll of COVID variants on workforce participation and productivity, the continual stress on healthcare professionals, and the unknown long-term effects of COVID and monkeypox present further complications.







All is not bleak for HR teams facing employee volatility, though, as advancements in AI have increasingly been applied to talent acquisition and other parts of HR. While talent acquisition vendors tentatively poked their toes into AI pre-pandemic, they made use of the time to create ""smart"" deep-learning platforms that underlie their cloud talent cloud applications. Today, AI is ubiquitous in products for sourcing, hiring and managing employees.
But what has changed and why does it matter?

What is artificial intelligence?
First, AI is not a product, a ""thing"" that an HRIS professional would go procure. It is, rather, an underlying platform or infrastructure on which specific products such as a recruitment system are built.
Implemented in software, an AI platform consists of a variety of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), predictive analytics and robotic process automation (see the sidebars for deeper dives into the last three). Collectively described as an ""engine,"" AI can support functions across the enterprise, creating efficiencies in supply chain management, customer relationships, product production and delivery, and business planning, to name a few. Now, AI is increasingly making inroads in HR processes and employee management -- specifically in easing issues in sourcing, hiring, onboarding, learning and the overall employee lifecycle.

An AI engine analyzes data -- ordinarily an immense amount of it -- then decides or recommends what should happen next to complete a task. Some products use multiple engines to improve reliability. The data could be in resumes, employee profiles, patient records, images like MRIs and X-rays, production schedules, employee promotion rates -- basically anything.



These capabilities of NLP are increasingly used in HR processes, including talent acquisition.





For example, iCIMS, a provider of talent management software, uses an ensemble AI methodology that learns from employer and job-seeker activity over more than 4,000 customers and hundreds of millions of data points across job openings, applications and hires.
The benefits are twofold: Not only can AI-powered systems deliver expected information faster and more efficiently, they can provide insight into areas that otherwise may not be obvious. The ability of the application to use machine learning to continually ""learn"" and adapt is a fundamental aspect of any AI program.


What is natural language processing?
Natural language processing is a key capability of AI. Consider the vast differences and nuances in written and oral language, and the varied ways humans ask questions and supply answers -- then multiply that across languages and dialects. Now add the computational power of today's machines that learn to understand text and spoken words and respond like people do.
A ready example is Amazon Alexa. Consider the following questions:

What is the temperature today?
How hot is it outside?
What's the temp?

All are variations of the same question that the AI is likely to respond to with the same correct answer: ""It is 86 degrees Fahrenheit outside now.""
Machines are getting smarter about nuances and better at assessing a speaker's intent or sentiment. Understanding subtleties of sarcasm or irony may be beyond what's necessary in evaluating resumes or applications, but it may have a place in video interviews.




How can AI be used in talent acquisition?
Here are 10 areas in which AI can benefit the talent acquisition process.


1. Job descriptions
Recruiters can't be expected to know everything about the nuances of job requisition language, especially new recruiters or recruiters for highly technical positions. What are the keywords in a given field that attract the most qualified responses? Which words unintentionally signal gender preference? This is where AI comes into play. Competitive talent acquisition products for several years have deployed intelligence that reviews linguistic choices and suggests alternatives. For example, if a recruiter is writing a req for a welder, and in their experience, all welders were male, the language may be unintentionally biased toward male applicants. The AI engine shouldn't have the same bias. As in all cases, it is necessary to apply a human eye to the results because if the AI data set consists only of male welders, the engine, looking at features that tend to surround welding skill, might conclude erroneously that other male traits are essential to being a proficient welder.


2. Job postings
CareerBuilder claims that its AI helps recruiters create job postings five times faster. The platform provides a candidate appeal score to help recruiters gauge how effective a post will be in attracting applicants, increasing applications by 175%, according to the company. A veteran in the hiring industry, CareerBuilder says its AI learns from data from more than 2.3 million job postings, 680 million unique profiles, 310 million resumes, 10 million job titles and 1.3 billion skills.
Recent AI tools can predict the salary range from a job posting that doesn't include salary data, potentially giving applicants more interview ammunition than recruiters intended.


3. Candidate sourcing
Starting with the wording of requirements in the job description, the AI engine can expand the search beyond the exact wording in the job post to related industry-specific language and terms. Unlike a simple word-matching algorithm, AI-enabled sourcing provides a semantic search by intent or meaning.
In addition, through the deep learning that permeates AI systems, the concept of skills adjacency is addressed. If a candidate knows how to do a certain thing, the software can infer the prerequisites of that skill or knowledge and determine the likelihood of the person having a similar but different skill, based on analysis of millions of data points. Candidate sourcing is thereby facilitated with a wider, more inclusive pool of candidates that humans may miss, and over time can answer such questions as the following:

What are the best sources of high-performing candidates who will stay on the job for more than two years?
What are the best sources of women who have been promoted into management positions?
What sources are yielding healthcare workers who can fill the position on day one?

When sourcing candidates or, later, evaluating them, AI has the ability to infer skills or interests from, for example, prior jobs held, volunteer positions or education. Because the program is always learning, it retains associations it can then apply in different recruitment scenarios. This can increase the possible positions within an organization for which the candidate or a current employee may be suited, even if they did not actually apply for them.


What is predictive analytics?
Predictive analytics uses predictive modeling to analyze patterns in data and create forecasts. Because AI engines can be fed big data -- millions and millions of data points -- they can report patterns that humans might take years to perceive. They can generate models to provide insights for business decisions and predict anomalies, for example, which is useful in product quality control and demand forecasting. Devoid of emotion, the engine can expose patterns and correlations that humans may miss or prefer to overlook. Prior history is only one input -- few in business want to recreate the past -- but combined with current data on trends and outcomes, AI-based predictive analytics can provide deep, relevant insights on which to base decisions and actions.




4. Applicant screening
In candidate screening, as in sourcing, the kinds of data from which a machine learning program can learn rules and patterns may be varied and include past or current employee resumes; competency or skill models that are tied to the specific industry or task; incoming resumes or records of employee success or longevity based on skills, education or even location. It may also include art or design portfolios, physical objects or electronic samples such as videos and games. External data sources such as national or international salary ranges, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics job classifications, etc., can also be fed into the ""brain"" that is AI. Machine learning can then help provide answers to questions such as ""What candidate traits correlate with long-term success in this position?"" Some firms use AI-powered games or video games to ascertain the fit between the candidate's personality or working preferences and the position.
Because candidates often want to apply to a company rather than a specific job, AI can recommend positions that are relevant to the skill set, education or soft skills of each candidate. It is also useful for recommending new positions or opportunities for current employees based on their skills, interests and aspirations.
This is a great advantage to both applicants and hiring companies. For example, a college graduate who might want to work for Microsoft can submit their resume and the AI-based talent acquisition tools can recommend the jobs for which they may be a likely candidate. In another scenario, if a non-degreed applicant is a gamer that a recruiter might reject out of hand (or perhaps never see their application at all), AI can look at non-traditional skills such as gaming and social media as applicable to a particular position. It is a huge time-saver for recruiters, hiring managers and candidates alike.


5. Skill assessment
Deep learning generally implies the use of vast neural networks, such as those Eightfold.ai uses: billions of profiles and global data points and over 1 million unique skills to provide data-driven insights about skills. With the goal of understanding an applicant's potential, Eightfold.ai helps companies identify the prevalence of capabilities on a global scale so they can find talent in particular locations. The software assesses a candidate's validated skills, likely adjacent skills, those that remain to be validated and missing skills. It's particularly important for reskilling for the AI to identify capability gaps in the workforce and find people with the best potential to fill them.





6. Bias mitigation
Many vendors employ AI in talent acquisition applications to alleviate bias in hiring and further diversity instead of perpetuating homogeneity in race, ethnicity, gender, gender preference, color, etc. An unbiased application can help eliminate bias arising from other characteristics that lead to discrimination, such as regional accents, perceived social standing and parental status. An AI tool is not going to be overly impressed with a beautiful resume layout or underwhelmed if a resume has a typo -- two things that can unconsciously influence human decisions.
Such smart programs evaluate job requisitions, postings and other written communications for gender-laden language. However, not all products purporting to use AI for talent acquisition are the same. If a company only uses its own historical data -- which is by definition limited -- biased output is likely to result. Successful applications that embed AI have access to deep-learning neural networks of external data with which to complement internal data sets.
Even so, recruiters have to be diligent in reviewing AI recommendations, as systemic bias in the past is not alleviated solely by using vast numbers of records. More than a few organizations have realized that the historical preponderance of white males still colors the AI-generated suggestions.


7. Online interviewing
In video interviews, AI can catch subtleties such as gestures and facial expressions that humans might not pay attention to and miss. Conversely, the tool can purposefully overlook mannerisms that the human interviewer may find distracting but which wouldn't impede the candidate's success in the job. Similarly, because AI can analyze huge volumes of data without fatigue, patterns may well emerge that would otherwise be overlooked by busy recruiters and hiring managers. It is this ability to make sense or find correlations in masses of information that makes AI such a valuable tool.
Not to be ignored is the ability of AI tools to look across calendars and manage interview scheduling, often one of the greatest sources of annoyance in the hiring process. Scheduling via AI can be less painful and more rewarding for everyone.



RPA is increasingly used for HR service tasks that are repetitive and labor intensive but have clearly defined rules.







8. Candidate experience
Robotic process automation (RPA) uses bots -- think Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri -- to replicate human actions in handling time-consuming questions and tasks. The increasingly widespread use of these natural language chatbots, some of which can understand and respond to both written and spoken input, is becoming de rigueur in human capital management software. Today's users are accustomed to bots as sources of information and direction and are used to interacting in natural language with bots in online and telephone transactions. Some recent studies show that younger people prefer interacting with a bot than a real person.
Hiring management platforms use chatbots to answer candidates' questions, guide them in timely choices and actions, and keep them informed of their status, while letting them know about new opportunities that might be good fits. In HR, bots are noted for their value in handling the repetitive questions employees tend to ask, such as ""What holidays does the company take off? How do I get proof of employment?"" As the number of people accustomed to chatbots increases, and as the bots get smarter, chatbot use lessens the number of escalations to humans that are required. In fact, Gartner anticipates that all future customer service will be conducted by bots. The same is likely true of candidate management.
Judicious use of bots in talent acquisition is an advantage because bots can respond to a candidate immediately and often in personalized ways. In response to the pervasive reliance on text messaging in recruiting conversations, tools such as HireVue and iCIMS' text engagement tools use NLP and machine learning to enable dual-conversation live chat and initiate intelligent text-based discussions, both of which are easy and convenient for the candidate. These applications understand people's natural inputs and ultimately improve feedback and predictions by learning over time. Their conversational interfaces can improve candidate engagement and personalize responses, and obviously, delivering bot-supplied answers in real time minimizes the need for human intervention. That saves time for the recruiter, the hiring manager and the candidate.
With intelligent bots, candidates often cannot tell they aren't dealing with a human. Today's smart bots, often referred to as digital assistants, can schedule interviews, respond in any language, walk candidates through video or text processes and provide encouragement if they get stuck in the application process. They are useful for career site chat, when a passive job seeker is just browsing a site, by calling attention to jobs of interest. The bot can embed employee video testimonials to further attract the potential applicant's interest.


What is RPA?
The word ""robot"" usually brings up images of Star Wars characters R2D2, C-3PO or the smooth-voiced Hal of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Today's factories and warehouses are heavily automated with robots used in production, picking and packing, and delivery. My personal favorite robot is a natural-language-aware barista in San Francisco that makes perfect lattes and cappuccinos without human intervention.
More commonly, though, RPA refers to software robots that handle repetitive and rule-based tasks. It generally uses structured data, and humans define the logic and rules. Today, such bots are everywhere on websites from banking to airlines, providing customer and candidate self-service. More sophisticated bots are likely to dominate all service in the future and human intervention or escalation will rarely be needed.




9. Economic advantages
The efficiency and speed of AI-enabled talent acquisition applications have positive cost benefits in that the AI engine never tires or takes a day off. CareerBuilder, for one, reports that its talent acquisition software has reduced the cost per candidate by as much as 50% since the product was rebuilt to employ AI. Chatbots allow recruiters to focus their talents in the bottom of the applicant funnel, a productivity boon. More expedient hiring, including improved time-to-fill and time-to-hire metrics, brings real cost savings to an organization. An empty seat is always an expensive proposition, and delays in responding to applicants is a sure way to lose them.


10. Onboarding
Employees feel most positive about their new position on the day they get the offer letter. Unfortunately, that high level of engagement can decline between offer acceptance and the first day on the job. Here is another major role for AI and bot-initiated communication. First, AI ""knows"" the forms that are necessary for what jobs in which locations, ensuring that the new hire gets the appropriate ones. Because all this can be done online with digital signatures, the tasks can be completed long before the first day at work. AI can also tell if the forms are complete and correct by spotting deviations in responses about age, Social Security number, addresses and the like and automatically requesting data verification or reentry.
As important, if not more, is the welcoming information for the new candidate. The hiring management program knows what location the person is working at or if they are working from home. Site-map simulations can walk the new hire through the building, showing them where to go on day one, where their office or cube is, where the cafeteria and restrooms are and where to get a badge or other ID. AI can automate requisition of the right materials and ensure that business cards are on the new employee's desk on the first day, a proven engagement technique. Bots with employee videos can introduce the new hire to other team members, all in the first few days after offer acceptance. Bots can answer FAQs of new hires, saving HR time and easing the employee's anxiety. Nevertheless, the welcome from the hiring manager, one would hope, is always real person to real person.


Summary
AI is ubiquitous in the new talent acquisition applications hitting the market. That it will make sourcing, screening and hiring easier and more efficient is clear. AI's applicability in HR and in all of business will be widespread, and organizations will be well served to create governance committees to oversee its use.
Because AI technology is in effect recommending, making choices and predicting, human vigilance remains necessary to ensure relevant data is being fed to the engine and that the output makes sense for the organization. Cathy O'Neil, author and data scientist, makes a compelling point in discussing the use of AI in decision-making: ""Algorithms are opinions embedded in code."" Those opinions are only good when they relate to the requirements of your business.

Artificial intelligence large language models used for writing and text-prediction are notoriously biased, but can be fine-tuned to become more inclusive.
Engineering and journalism researchers from the University of Southern California in the United States have teamed up to quantify and fix anti-queer bias in AI language models.
AI language models are capable of reading and writing text and predicting words in a sentence. But as most are trained by scraping text from the internet, they tend to repeat and amplify social biases. In fact as these models become more capable, their level of bias and toxicity increases.
Katy Felkner, a PhD student in computer science specialising in natural language processing says the problem of bias in language models is well documented.
“Large language models are very much a product of their training data. When the training data is scraped from the web with very minimal auditing, like most of the training data is today, you’re going to pick up a lot of the sort of nasty and hateful sentiments that are that are out there on the web.”
As part of the research, Felkner and team developed a new benchmark for measuring bias.

She says while there are generalised fairness measures available, there was limited research dealing with the issue of anti-queer and anti-trans bias in AI language models, and a lack of tailored benchmarks or metrics.
“I set out to do a more specific metric that would just address anti queer and anti trans bias but hopefully in a in a more nuanced and more holistic way.”
The project found that a popular model called BERT (short for bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) showed significant homophobic bias, measured through Felkner’s benchmark, which compares the likelihood that the model predicts heteronormative sentences versus sentences that include a queer relationship.
The team chose to focus on BERT as one of the first large language models to establish the power and potential of these technologies. There were practical reasons too as it was more accessible and practical to test and fine tune than other models.



By feeding more inclusive content like queer twitter and queer news, the research team successfully trained BERT to be less biased towards LGBTQI people.

The team was able to shift the bias score from 74% (using the off-the-shelf model) down to 55% through their fine-tuning.
She says the results mean that models “fine-tuned using our method are less likely to produce text that is toxic, harmful or mean, or homophobic or transphobic, and they are more likely to produce text that is is inclusive.”

This is important because large language models are increasingly driving other kinds of downstream applications, like job advertisements or clinical applications.
“As these models are getting better and better, people are encountering more AI generated, or partially AI generated text in their daily lives. And so we want to make sure that those models are not are not going to inadvertently produce harmful outputs.”

The project was presented by Felkner at the Queer in AI workshop at the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) conference and the team plans to publish a full conference paper.
For the next stage, the team hopes to crowd-source a wider set of perspectives from the queer community and audit more existing language models.

Is It Worth Learning A.I. and Machine Learning Skills Right Now?

Despite the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and machine learning, A.I. remains a relatively specialized job. The latest edition of CompTIA’s monthly jobs report shows only a few thousand postings for A.I.-related jobs in some of the biggest tech states (California, Texas, Washington, and so on). What does this mean for anyone interested in A.I. as a career?  
First, the CompTIA chart. If all the A.I.-related jobs seem concentrated in places like California, there’s a reason for that. These states boast massive tech hubs filled with a combination of tech giants and aggressive startups, and these companies have the resources to afford expensive A.I. talent (as well as the tech infrastructure needed for those specialists to do their jobs):   
  
Given the high degree of specialization, it’s not a shocker that A.I. jobs tend to draw high salaries. Last year, O’Reilly estimated the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent annually. It’s also a profession likely to expand rapidly in coming years: According to Lightcast (formerly Emsi Burning Glass), which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, job postings requesting artificial intelligence skills will increase nearly 300 percent over the next two years.  
While the number of A.I. jobs remains relatively small, in other words, the need for A.I. skills in the context of other, “regular” technology jobs is much larger. According to Lightcast, some 142,346 job postings asked for artificial intelligence skills of some kind over the past 12 months. From data science to software development, there’s more emphasis on knowing everything from TensorFlow to how ML models work.    
And which jobs are asking for those A.I. skills? Let’s break it down:   
  
If you’re a data scientist or researcher, you’ll definitely want to study how A.I. can impact your workflow—the arc of your career might depend on it.

How we show up at home and at work sends a ripple of either positive or negative energy into the world we interact in. Research has shown that happiness is the precursor to success, not the result of success. Experts like Harvard researcher, Shawn Anchor, writes about his research on over 1,600 Harvard students and Fortune 500 companies world-wide in his acclaimed book, The Happiness Advantage, that further validated that Happiness First drives productivity, safety, and accelerates growth.


If you studied Old English which I did, you may recall reading Paradise Lost, by John Milton, written in 1667 which said, “The Mind has its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven.”

In other words, we become what we think and our outlook on life is a reflection of our own minds’ eye.

There is a business imperative to ensure happiness, from work and at home, is a strategic goal to develop healthy supply chains where ever there are human connections. Over 80% of supply chain disruptions/incidents happen with a human error and errors can increase 10X when people are angry or sad. These emotions are on tsunami like increases and the waves are increasing in intensity and impacting supply chain productivity —- everywhere — but how many board room director discussions or C suite discussions are measuring happiness daily - what if you could have an AI MRI vision across your control systems to identify and detect emotional health?

PROMOTED
This is the theme we will explore in this blog series - as Corporate Purpose will increasingly become more focus on happiness insights to manage risks.
Looking ahead, it is not conceivable that robotics and machine learning approaches will control all supply chain management control systems where there are no human connections. Although in less than 20 years, robots will increasingly become more mainstream. One only needs to follow Ford’s testing of DIGIT, a robot, to help make deliveries in self-driving cars, or Elon Musk’s Tesla robot designed to fetch tools, and perform dangerous repetitive tasks. Future supply chains will increasingly have robotic integrations and humans will be positioned for decision control(s) and higher order functions. In the meantime, our world is far from eliminating humans from supply chain logistics.
So what does happiness have to do with supply chain ecosystems?
First, it is important to understand that within our social context, we are living in that the happiness of humans in all countries globally is rapidly declining. Unhappiness is growing and the secondary impacts on the human condition are becoming more evident.

For example, there are very more human signs of increasing fatigue, depression, anxiety, and growing health concerns.
Here are some key facts to validate the decline of happiness:

1.) The Happiness Index Report (2022) reveals the steady increase of stress and rising rates of unhappiness over the past 15 years of data analysis.

2.) A Conference Board Survey found that only 45 % of workers surveyed were happy at their jobs, the lowest in 22 years of polling (2010 Research)
3.) Depression rates at 10x higher than they were since 1960. COVID-19 pandemic triggers 25% increase in prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide (WHO Research 2022)
4.) Forty-four percent of employees experienced a lot of daily stress in the previous day. While almost half of the world's workers felt the burden of stress, working women in the U.S. and Canada region were among the most stressed employees globally. (Global Workplace Report - 2022)
5.) The Misery Index (2022) tracks a combination of inflation and unemployment rates created by economist Arthur Okun has for example Canadian have the 6th worst Misery Index score (combined rates of inflation and unemployment) in 2021 out of 35 industrialized countries. The USA Misery Index rating due to increasing inflation rates are also plummeting.
6.) According to a paper in the American Economic Review called “Preferences over Inflation and Unemployment: Evidence from Surveys of Happiness unemployment causes 1.7 times as much misery as inflation.
7.) Between 1913 and 2020, the number of motor-vehicle deaths in the United States (which include all types of motor vehicles, including passenger cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles) increased 831%, from 4,200 deaths in 1913 to 42,338 in 2020. However, the role cars play in daily life is vastly different now than when tracking began.In 1913, there were about 1.3 million vehicles and 2 million drivers, and the number of miles driven was not yet estimated. The latest 2020 data report 275.9 million vehicles, 228 million licensed drivers, and 2,904 billion miles driven annually (Injury Facts)
Impact of Unhappiness 
1.) Unhappy Employees Risk Customer Happiness - Inc. magazine research has validated that employee satisfaction is at an all-time low. About 40 % of American workers say their job is very or extremely stressful. According to a Gallup survey, eight in 10 Americans feel stressed during the day. About 40% say they lack the time to do what they want. Another survey conducted by Gallup reports that more than 20% of employees feel burned out at work. Heavy workloads, team conflicts, poor management and wage gaps all contribute to job dissatisfaction. If left unaddressed, these factors lower productivity and increase turnover rates. In addition, customers are impacted as when one is unhappy this manifests in employee’s patience with customers often more evident in their communication tonality. Also when an employee is sad, it is difficult to feel empathetic with customers, or listen attentively.
2.) Unhappy Employees Risk Job Satisfaction and as a result productivity declines, hostile work environments increase, etc. Unhappy, disgruntled employees can create a negative and stressful atmosphere in the workplace, which over time impacts the overall team productivity of team and in many cases creates a toxic work environment. A 2019 Deloitte survey revealed that only 49% of employees are satisfied with their jobs. The impact of low job satisfaction goes beyond high turnover rates. Employees are a company's biggest asset. If their expectations are not met, they may lack the motivation needed to reach peak performance and excel in their roles.
The Financial Performance Impact of Unhappiness
American companies lose $450 to $500 billion per year because of disengaged employees. Furthermore, replacing employees who quit their jobs costs 100 to 300% of their annual salary. As a manager, the best thing you can do is take a close look at these numbers and make the necessary changes to keep your staff engaged and motivated (Inc.) and The Gallop Poll.
The impact of job dissatisfaction in an organization shouldn't be taken lightly. According to Forbes, only 21% of employees are engaged at work. More than one-third of workers are planning to quit their jobs and find something better. They're doing just enough to receive their pay-checks, but they don't put in the time and effort to do their best work.
Forbes reports that disengaged employees are 15% less profitable and 18% less productive than those who are satisfied with their jobs. This kind of behavior costs companies thousands a year, affecting the bottom line. Job dissatisfaction also negatively affects job involvement and organizational commitment, reported in Frontiers in Psychology.
Job dissatisfaction may also foster bad habits in the workplace, notes the Society for Human Resource Management. Approximately 40% of employees who are unhappy with their jobs play pranks on their colleagues. Another 55% shop online, and 15% take naps while at work. Alcohol consumption and social media usage in the workplace are common, too. With the increase of employees working from home, these risks may also increase.
To put the magnitude of this issue in perspective, the same Gallup report cited earlier estimates that a full 50% of all employees are ""not engaged"" after just six months, and an additional 20% of employees ""actively disengaged,"" meaning they proactively look for ways to undermine employee morale and retention.
Conclusion
So when 70% of your employees are to some degree disengaged, I think it’s safe to say that board directors, C- Level leaders need to build a focused Happiness Supply Chain Ecosystem. I have been saying for some time that people are strategic assets and their happiness is one of the most important foundations to accelerate a company’s growth and sustainability. Happiness Economics is a correlation to productivity and growth.
Yet is happiness a daily conversation in organizations?
Already many businesses have put a Health first as a corporate priority and advanced Mindfulness programs - yet acknowledgment and celebration practices to boost employee engagement, and well being behaviours often are lacking. Most companies do a annual employee satisfaction rating - however once a year is hardly sufficient given the speed of change across complex supply chains and market dynamics.
There are many ways in small ways happiness health can multiply.
One opportunity to appreciate and practice more is that happiness germinates often from the most simplest and least expensive leadership behaviours - simply saying: Thank you everyday to put a smile on an employee’s face.
When you smile, your brain releases tiny molecules called neuropeptides to help fight off stress. Then other neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and endorphins come into play too. The endorphins act as a mild pain reliever, whereas the serotonin is an antidepressant. (Source: Health Benefits of Smiling)
A team of economists performed a study and found that “human happiness has large and positive causal effects on productivity. Positive emotions appear to invigorate human beings, while negative emotions have the opposite effect."" Another study linked decision-making, processing and learning to the release of dopamine triggered by happiness, so smiling can also make you a more creative and efficient worker.
According to research, 89 % of employees agree that employee recognition improves their experience.


It leads to positive business outcomes such as increased performance, a sense of belonging, improved alignment, and a sense of purpose.
Leaders are encouraged to recognize their employees on a regular basis, rather than just on one day of the year during an employee performance review.
However, this can only happen if employee recognition, acknowledgment becomes ingrained in a company's culture.


A smile is contagious as well,  one Swedish study suggests that we can’t help but react with a smile of our own smile when we see someone smiling.
A supply chain that starts everyday with a health and mood check in at the beginning of your day and the end of day, as emotions change, is what we will explore in our next blog on creating a Happiness Supply Chain Advantage. We will also identify all the connectors that can be wired into an organization supply chain ecosystem to ensure happiness is always front and center.
We simply cannot see year over year decreases in global happiness and ignore this increasingly new normal. We must accelerate sourcing leaders that are authentic, respectful of diversity and inclusiveness and value creating an organizational culture that values happiness and ensures it grows and is sustained.
Without happiness supply chain ecosystems carefully architected into process controls/checkpoints - growth, economic productivity gains will continue to erode.
So what are you doing everyday to increase your team’s happiness and reflect on your personal happiness heartbeat?

It can correct spelling, make financial investments, and even compose music; but it cannot alert someone to the fact that they have their t-shirt on inside out without being explicitly ”taught” to do so. More to the point, it cannot discern why this might be useful information to have. And yet a five-year-old, just beginning to dress herself, will notice and point out the white tag at the base of her father’s neck.Most researchers in the AI field are well aware that amid the numerous advances in deep neural networks, the gap between human intelligence and AI has not significantly narrowed, and solutions allowing for computationally efficient adaptive reasoning and decision-making in complex real-life environments remain elusive. Cognitive AI, that is intelligence that would allow machines to comprehend, learn and perform intellectual tasks similarly to humans, remains as elusive as ever. In this blog post, we will explore why this chasm exists and where AI research must go if we are to have any hope of crossing it.Why ‘Mr. AI’ Can’t Hold a JobHow great would it be to work side-by-side with an AI assistant that could shadow us throughout the day, picking up our slack? Imagine how wonderful it would be if the algorithms could truly unburden us humans from the “drudge” tasks of our workday so we could focus on the more strategic and/or creative aspects of our jobs? The problem is, with a partial exception for systems like GitHub Copilot, a fictional ‘Mr. AI’ based on current state-of-the-art would likely receive its pink slip before the workday’s end.For starters, Mr. AI is painfully forgetful, particularly when it comes to contextual memory. It also suffers from a crippling lack of attention. To some, this may seem surprising given the extraordinary large language models (LLM) of today, including LaMDA and GPT-3, which in some situations appear like they could well be conscious. However, even with the most advanced state-of-the-art deep learning models, Mr. AI’s work performance will invariably fall short of expectations. It doesn’t adapt well to changing environments and demands. It cannot independently ascertain that advice it provides is epistemologically and factually sound. It cannot even come up with a simple plan! And no matter how carefully engineered its social skills are, it’s bound to stumble in a highly dynamic world with complex social and ethical norms. It simply doesn’t have what it takes to thrive in a human world.But what is that?Four Key Properties of Advanced IntelligenceTo impart more human-like intelligence to machines, one must first explore what makes human intelligence distinct from many current (circa 2022) neural networks typically used in AI applications. One way of drawing such a distinction is through the following four properties:1. World ModelHumans naturally develop a “world model” that allows them to envision an endless number of short- and long-term “what if” scenarios that inform their decision-making and actions. AI models could become vastly more efficient with a similar capability, one that would allow them to simulate potential scenarios from beginning to end in a resource-efficient manner. An intelligent mechanism needs to model a complex environment with multiple interacting individual agents. An input-to-output mapping function (such as can be achieved with a complex feed-forward network), needs to “unroll” all the potential paths and interactions. The complexity of such an input-to-output unrolled model in a real-life environment would quickly explode in complexity, especially when accounting for tracking arbitrary duration of relevant history for each of the agents. In contrast, an intelligent mechanism that can model each of the factors and agents independently in a simulation environment, can evaluate numerous what-if future scenarios and grow the model by replicating copies of the actors, each with their knowable relevant history and behavior.Key to acquiring a world model with such capacity for simulation is the decoupling between the construction of the building blocks of the world model (an epistemic reasoning process) and their subsequent use in simulation of possible outcomes. The resulting “what-if” scenarios could then be compared in a way that remains consistent even if the simulation methodology changes over time. A special case example of such approach can be found in Digital Twins, where the machine is equipped (through self-learning or explicit design) with a model of its environment and can simulate the potential futures of various interactions.Figure 1. Digital Twin technology creates multifaceted models of complex actors in an interactive setting. Image credit: chesky via Adobe StockIntelligent beings and machines use models of the world (‘World Views’) to make sense of observations and assess potential futures to select the best course of action. In transitioning from a ‘generic’ large-scale setting (like replying to web queries) to direct interaction in a particular setting that includes multiple actors, the world model must be effectively scaled and customizable. A decoupled, modular, customizable approach is a logically different and far less complex architecture than one that attempts to simulate and reason all in a single “input-output function” step.2. Theory of Mind“Theory of mind” refers to a complex mental skill that has been defined by cognitive science as a capacity to understand and predict the actions and beliefs of another person by tracking that person’s attention and ascribing a mental state to them.In the simplest of terms, it is what we do when we attempt to read another person’s mind. We develop and use this skill throughout our lives to help us navigate our social interactions. It’s why we don’t remind our dieting co-worker of the giant plate of fresh chocolate chip cookies in the breakroom.We see traces of the theory of mind being used in AI applications such as chatbots that are uniquely attuned to the emotions of the customer they are serving, based on the reason they opened the chat, the language they are using, etc. However, performance metrics used to train such social chatbots — typically defined as conversation-turns per session, or CPS — merely train the model to maximize the attention from the human, and do not force the system to develop an explicit model of the human’s mind as measured by reasoning and planning tasks.Figure 2. AI system with Theory of Mind capability can modify its output based on end user needs and preferences.

Moreover, such a model would have to keep track of the varied behavioral profiles, be predictably updateable with the influx of new information and avoid relapsing into a previous model state.3. Continual learningWith some exceptions, the standard machine learning paradigm of today is batched, offline learning, potentially followed by fine-tuning to the specific task. The resulting models are therefore unable to extract useful long-term updates from the information they are being exposed to while deployed. Humans have no such limitation. They learn continuously and use this information to build cognitive models like world views and theories of mind. In fact, continual learning is what enables humans to maintain and update their mental models.The problem of continual learning (also dubbed lifelong and continuous learning) is now garnering much stronger interest in the AI research community, in part due to the practical demands brought by the advent of technologies like federated learning and workflows like medical data processing. An AI system that employs a world model of an environment it operates in, with theories of mind associated with the various agents in that environment, a continual learning capability would be critical to maintain and update historical and current state descriptors for each object and agent.While the industry’s need is very clear, much remains to be done. Specifically, solutions that enable continual learning of information to then be used for reasoning or planning are still in their nascency — and such solutions would be required to enable the model-building capabilities above.4. Late binding contextLate binding context refers to the combination of contextually specific (rather than generic) responses and utilizes the latest relevant information available at the time of query or decision. Contextual awareness embodies all the subtle nuances of human learning — it is the ‘who’, ‘why’, ‘when’ and ‘what’ that inform human decisions and behavior. It keeps humans from resorting to reasoning shortcuts and jumping to imprecise, generalized conclusions. Rather, contextual awareness allows us to build an adaptive set of behaviors tailored to the specific state of environment that needs to be addressed. Without this capability, our decision-making would be greatly impaired. Late binding context is also closely intertwined with continuous learning. For more information on late binding context please see the previous blog, Advancing Machine Intelligence: Why Context Is Everything.Human Cognition as a Roadmap to the Future of AIWithout the key cognitive capabilities listed above, many of the critical needs of human industry and society will not be met. There is therefore a fairly urgent need to apportion more research to the translation of human cognitive capabilities into AI functionality — in particular those properties that make it unique from current AI models. The four properties listed above are a starting point. They lay at the center of a complex web of human cognitive function and provide a path towards computationally efficient adaptive models that can be deployed in real-life multi-actor environments. As AI proliferates from centralized, homogenized large models to the multitude of uses that are integrated within socially complex settings, the next set of properties will need to emerge.ReferencesMitchell, M.
