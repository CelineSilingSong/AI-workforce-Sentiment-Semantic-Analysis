  Much attention has been paid recently to the potential for generative AI to disrupt labour markets in the long term, rendering certain professions redundant whilst enhancing the productivity of human labour in others. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the impact AI has already had on the labour market. This column investigates the effect of generative AI models on affected professions, using data from an online labour platform showing that AI has diminished the potential earnings of exposed writers and image-related professionals across skills distribution.

Artificial intelligence in schools – everything you need to know

Schools



Artificial intelligence (AI) is here to stay – it’s already having a positive impact across society, including in the education sector.
We believe it could be used to improve our education system, for example, early research suggests it could be used to free up teachers’ time and provide personalised support to pupils.
While we want to make the most out of this emerging technology, we need to understand its risks, as well as its opportunities.
Here, we set out what we’re doing to develop artificial intelligence in education safely and explore how it could benefit both teachers and young people.
What are you doing to develop AI in education?
From investing in AI tools, to gathering evidence about how teachers and pupils are using AI, we’re already investigating how we take can advantage of AI in education.
These are just first steps, but we have already:

Launched a call for evidence on AI

To understand how those in education already use generative AI – including its use to produce content, such as text imagery and audio – we launched a call for evidence to gather views from educational professionals, academics and the edtech sector on its risks and possibilities. The results show AI is already being used to reduce administrative tasks and are optimistic about its potential.

Organised a ‘hackathon’ 

We organised a two-day hackathon for teachers and school leaders from across England, which allowed teachers and school leaders to work with data scientists to come up with solutions which use AI to tackle real-life issues like teacher workload. The results of the hackathon will be published next year.

Invested up to £2 million in AI tools for Oak National Academy 

This boost for Oak National Academy, an online learning platform, will help develop new, free resources for teachers which are powered by AI, such as lesson planners and classroom quizzes.
How could AI help teachers?
We’re still in the early stages of exploring the possibilities of AI and how it could benefit teachers. One area we’re looking at includes using AI tools to cut teacher workload by providing teachers with a virtual ‘assistant’.
From drafting curriculum plans to producing high-quality teaching resources, AI has the potential to reduce the amount of time teachers spend doing administrative tasks, so they can focus on what they do best– teaching and supporting their pupils.
Does this mean pupils could be taught by AI?
Absolutely not.
Teachers are irreplaceable, and AI could never be a substitute for teachers’ professional judgement and the personal relationship they have with their pupils.
We’re aiming to develop AI to serve teachers better, not to take away from the unique role that they play.
We’re also making sure that with any AI tools, teachers are always in charge and that there is always a “human in the loop”. For example, we wouldn’t support the use of AI to draft personalised plans or guidance without expert human involvement.
How could AI help pupils?
There is much more work to be done to explore how AI could enhance how pupils learn, and we know that there are concerns around the risks for young people, especially as this is a new form of technology. The development of any AI tools for young people would prioritise their safety and security.
This includes ensuring that children and young people are not accessing or creating harmful or inappropriate content online through generative AI, and that their data and intellectual property is protected.
As AI tools are interactive and can be easily personalised, they could be used to provide all young people with their own virtual ‘tutor’. To name one example, AI could help provide pupils with a bespoke workplan, based on marking and assessments from teachers.
What are you doing to stop pupils using AI to cheat?
While there are many positive uses for AI tools, we know that some parents and teachers are concerned about pupils using them to do their homework for them, or cheat in exams.
Results of the call for evidence and the hackathon will provide the base for future policy on AI, including how schools can work around the possibility of students using it to cheat.

The potential is unprecedented — the technology not only transforms routine work, but brings the power of AI to creative and knowledge work, putting companies in position to achieve not only great gains in productivity, but also to create entirely new paths for enterprise reinvention.
To pursue those paths, company leaders should first seek to understand the potential impact of generative AI on their particular industry, which could be much larger than it might now appear. Functional leaders should similarly analyze the potential impact in their domains. Then, working collaboratively with IT and technology leaders, executives throughout the organization can get down to the hard work of reinventing jobs, reconstituting processes, and refocusing the organization’s talent and reskilling strategies to realize the full potential of generative AI.
The Impact of Generative AI Across Industries
How big is the opportunity? Building on our initial study, we analyzed the potential impact of large language models (LLMs) on how workers spend time on tasks across 19 major industries, weighted by their 2022 employment levels (our data source is O*NET / BLS).
We found that 44% of all working hours across industries have the potential to be impacted by generative AI. The largest opportunity lies in banking, where 72% of working hours can potentially be transformed by generative AI. In insurance, the figure is 68%. In capital markets, it’s 67%. For industries in the middle of the pack, like retail, travel, health, and energy, the number of working hours that generative AI could potentially transform ranged from 40% to nearly 50%. In a similar analysis across 22 job categories, we found that LLMs will impact every category, ranging from 9% of a workday at the low end to 63% at the high end. In five of the 22 categories we examined, more than half of working hours can be transformed by LLMs.
Insight Center CollectionHow Generative AI Is Changing WorkExploring the impact on workers, companies, and the economy.
What’s even more promising is that our analysis of 19,265 tasks found that more than half can use generative AI as an input to unleash creativity and enable novel solutions. Whereas earlier generations of machine learning and intelligent software mainly impacted jobs and tasks that were routine, repeatable, and rules-based, generative AI will impact creative work like never before. This changes the way executives can and should think about improving productivity. Take the job of data scientist, where 76% of all work time can be impacted by generative AI, enabling a 25% improvement in achievable productivity given the current state of technology and practice.
Moreover, the ability to augment creativity presents an even greater productivity-boosting opportunity: using generative AI to accelerate AI innovation. In other words, one of the most powerful productivity drivers to appear in our lifetime — generative AI — could be used to improve its own productivity.
Reinventing Jobs, Reconstituting Processes, Refocusing Talent 
Currently, we’re at a phase in the adoption cycle of generative AI when most organizations are starting to experiment by using off-the-shelf “foundation models” (platforms for AI applications). However, the biggest value for many will come when they customize or fine-tune models using their own data to address their unique needs. In organizations that have moved beyond off-the-shelf generative AI to models the company continually customizes for its operations and business, the opportunity for enterprise reinvention is particularly large.
In what follows, we use the example of data scientists to explore the potential of generative AI in the IT function. But what we are proposing can and should be applied to almost any AI-facing job. Here’s how:
Decompose AI-facing jobs by tasks.
Tasks, not jobs, will be the building blocks of workplace transformation going forward. To understand where and how generative AI might work most effectively, first break down a job into the tasks that it entails for a particular role. For example, among the many tasks that a data scientist performs are the processing of digital or online data; evaluating the quality or accuracy of data; designing computer or information systems applications; developing models of systems, processes, or products; and numerous other tasks. Second, determine whether the task involves the intensive use of language (natural, computational, or mathematical) for completion. Data scientists employ a number of computational and mathematical languages like Python, C++, or JavaScript. Data scientists must also use natural language to communicate a compelling business case or to explain to business leaders and other stakeholders why a particular insight matters. Why is action needed? How can a decision be improved? Where is change urgently needed?
Third, assess how knowledge is used to perform a particular task. Are its problems ambiguous? Does completion of the task require collaboration with others or validation by a subject matter expert? In order to model an operational or business process, data scientists must understand it in the context of the company’s business and industry. Achieving that understanding requires collaboration with, and validation by, colleagues in many parts of the organization.
Recompose AI-facing jobs around generative AI.
Once a job has been broken down into its constituent tasks, you can then analyze how generative AI might affect each of those tasks. As a rule of thumb, tasks that entail recurring processes are candidates for full automation with generative AI, while tasks that require creative reasoning, collaboration, and judgment are candidates for augmentation with AI. For example, generative AI can help data scientists understand an industry process much faster, augmenting their collaborative and validation activities. Tasks with low potential for transformation through generative AI can continue to be performed exclusively by humans, while new high-value human tasks might emerge as a result of the recomposition of a job.
In our analysis of a typical data scientist’s job, we found five tasks — such as processing digital or online data or evaluating the quality or accuracy of data — that can be automated. Seven tasks can be augmented with generative AI to enable the data scientist to perform the task more effectively and efficiently. For example, Microsoft, GitHub and MIT Sloan researchers gave developers randomized access to GitHub Copilot (a generative AI for coding). It took Copilot users 57% less time than non-users to develop a web server in JavaScript. We also identified five tasks — such as communicating with others about operational plans or supervising personnel — that have little potential for automation or augmentation.
Reconstitute processes.
Automated, augmented, and human tasks — these are the initial building blocks around which to redesign jobs to begin to unlock value from generative AI. These redesigned jobs must then be woven into processes with other redesigned jobs in the organization, which will radically change the way works gets done. Consider how Lemonade, the upstart online insurer, rethought the processes that make up typical insurance features like claims and underwriting, and then redesigned them by looking through the lens of AI and the way humans regard the industry, and reknit those processes into what amounts to a reinvention of the insurance experience for consumers. How? By combining AI chatbots, the cloud, and an approach that made the customer the linchpin of a unique human-in-the-loop process to eliminate the mutual distrust between insurance companies and customers.
For instance, to file a claim, users tap the “claim” button in the Lemonade app and simply tell the chatbot, named Maya, what happened. There are no forms to fill out, there’s no waiting in a phone queue, and there’s no being handed off from one department to another. The company’s AI runs its anti-fraud algorithms and if the claim is instantly approved — as some 30% are — the AI pays it immediately. If not, the claim is escalated to a human who contacts the insured as soon as possible. To counter the insurer’s incentive to deny or reduce a claim and the customer’s incentive to inflate claims, the company simply takes a flat percentage of each premium and returns the unclaimed remainder in an annual “Giveback Day,” when the money is donated to worthy causes that policyholders have identified. The humans in the loop in the claims process are the customers themselves. When they enter a claim, they know that Lemonade has no incentive to unreasonably deny or reduce it. Just as important, they know that every dollar by which they inflate a claim means less money for a cause they care deeply about.
Reconstituting and reintegrating processes is hard work, and companies will need to be realistic about the challenges that come with profoundly rethinking how the organization works. An enterprise-wide strategy needs to account for all the variants of AI and associated technologies you intend to use, not only generative AI and large language models.
Refocus talent and skilling strategies. 
Companies need to invest as much in evolving operations and training people as they do in technology. Radically rethinking how work gets done, and helping people keep up with technology-driven change, will be two of the most important factors in realizing the full potential of generative AI. Nearly every job will be impacted — some will be eliminated, most will be transformed, and many new jobs will be created.
Because employees will participate in the decomposition and recomposition of their jobs, they will acquire new AI-facing skills on the job — the preferred method of learning for many people. Generative AI itself will play a role in reskilling: We found that nearly six in 10 organizations plan to use generative AI for learning purposes and more than 4 in 10 want to make a large investment.
It should be noted that enterprise reinventions that encompass generative AI impose new responsibilities on company leaders. Leaders must ensure that generative AI technologies are responsible and compliant by design. Applications should not create unacceptable risk for the business. The output of generative AI — carefully reviewed and overseen by humans — must be accurate, unbiased, and free from intellectual property issues. As organizations decompose and recompose jobs into tasks, reconstitute processes, and invest in training people to work differently alongside machines, a commitment to responsible AI will further distinguish them from competitors.Read more on AI and machine learningBGBhaskar Ghosh  is Accenture’s Chief Strategy Officer and a member of the firm’s Global Management Committee.

As adoption and utilization of generative AI expands, organizations will need to make sure that not only are they using generative AI to the best advantage but that their employees are on board and understand the new technology as well. In a recent webinar hosted by the MIT Sloan Management Review, MIT Sloan senior lecturer George Westerman and Boston College professor Sam Ransbotham discussed early uses for generative AI, how generative AI compares to previous advanced analytics technology, and why businesses should use caution.
ChatGPT enables anyone to create content
Generative AI tools make it possible for anyone with an internet connection to create customized written, audio, or visual content. When ChatGPT, arguably the most well-known chatbot, was released to the public in November 2022, it became immensely popular, reaching 100 million users in just two months.
One reason for the popularity of generative AI is its widespread applicability, including these use cases for businesses:
It can generate summaries of lengthy documents or recorded meetings.
Engineers can give generative AI prompts to write code. This is particularly useful for those working in an unfamiliar language.
Sales and marketing teams can use it to create highly personalized online shopping experiences by recommending related products.
Design teams can generate a multitude of models and weed out the impractical ones. This has big potential in automotive design, where brands can spend $3 billion on new models.
Call centers can provide training powered by conversational assistants, helping new employees get up to speed faster and improve efficiency — and increase the odds that they’ll stay on the job.
As with all AI products, business leaders will want to tread carefully so generative AI will augment human workers and not replace them, Westerman said. “The idea is that generative AI can work with you to make you a better worker,” he said. “It’s a very nice story, as opposed to so many of the stories that are out there about replacing workers.”
Four types of advanced analytics tools 
Generative AI is the latest in a line of advanced analytics tools. The tools vary in how much data and domain expertise is needed to use them, whether their results are repeatable, and how easy it is to understand how they generate results.
Rules-based systems, based on “if-then” automation, have existed for decades, Westerman said. Given their relative simplicity and the limitations of their computing power, this type of AI is typically used with well-understood problems, like processing insurance claims. “You really don’t need a whole lot data, but you do need a lot of expertise,” Westerman said. The results are also highly repeatable and explainable.
Econometrics, the next step forward, estimates relationships between things that can be distilled down to numbers. This requires less expertise than rules-based automation but more data, and, as a result, it requires careful thought about how models will be built. The results are usually repeatable but less explainable than those of rules-based automation.
Deep learning tools enable automated classification of data, process optimization, and predictive modeling. For example, Google used deep learning to reduce the energy consumed to cool its data centers by nearly 40%. “The machines are running the air conditioner better than people are,” Westerman noted. Deep learning requires a lot of data but less domain expertise. The results are somewhat repeatable but not very explainable.
Finally, generative AI enables the automation of creative processes. Like deep learning, generative AI requires little domain expertise but needs lots of data, and it has taken off thanks to accompanying advances in computing power. As Westerman noted, GPT models must work through trillions of data points.
Accuracy, privacy, and other reasons for caution
The power of generative AI also poses concern. Because generative AI tools don’t express their rules or the relationships within their underlying training data, they produce results that are neither repeatable nor explainable. One user’s output might look completely different from another’s, and the outputs aren’t always accurate. If data is incomplete or biased, the results will also be incomplete and biased.

Study: Generative AI helps inexperienced workers  


In some ways, this variance is beneficial. When different prompts lead to different results, it can get the creative juices flowing, Westerman said. But if you’re looking to get the same answer every time, generative AI might not be the ideal tool.
All of this should deter business leaders from implementing generative AI hastily, particularly in certain cases.
“Will there be a lot of risk or cost if the model’s wrong?” Westerman asked. “If the financial advice you give can get you sued, or if the medical advice you give can get somebody hurt very badly, then you might want to be careful or put extra controls in place.”
Privacy is another concern. When users type questions into an open generative AI tool, the prompt and the reply become another piece of data for the model to use. Again, this has some benefits — the model has information it can use to continue to learn — but it also introduces the risk that private data will get released to the public or otherwise be used to modify models.
Ultimately, organizations that have seen the most success using generative AI have treated the process like putting a spare tire on a car.
“You don’t screw one bolt in really tightly, because you’re likely to bend things. You get them all on there a little bit, and then you tighten them all up,” Westerman said. “It’s a constant process — do something, do something more, do something more — rather than just trying one technique and sticking with it.”

  GPUs have been called the rare Earth metals — even the gold — of artificial intelligence, because they’re foundational for today’s generative AI era.
Three technical reasons, and many stories, explain why that’s so. Each reason has multiple facets well worth exploring, but at a high level:

GPUs employ parallel processing.
GPU systems scale up to supercomputing heights.
The GPU software stack for AI is broad and deep.

The net result is GPUs perform technical calculations faster and with greater energy efficiency than CPUs. That means they deliver leading performance for AI training and inference as well as gains across a wide array of applications that use accelerated computing.
In its recent report on AI, Stanford’s Human-Centered AI group provided some context. GPU performance “has increased roughly 7,000 times” since 2003 and price per performance is “5,600 times greater,” it reported.
A 2023 report captured the steep rise in GPU performance and price/performance.
The report also cited analysis from Epoch, an independent research group that measures and forecasts AI advances.
“GPUs are the dominant computing platform for accelerating machine learning workloads, and most (if not all) of the biggest models over the last five years have been trained on GPUs … [they have] thereby centrally contributed to the recent progress in AI,” Epoch said on its site.
A 2020 study assessing AI technology for the U.S. government drew similar conclusions.
“We expect [leading-edge] AI chips are one to three orders of magnitude more cost-effective than leading-node CPUs when counting production and operating costs,” it said.
NVIDIA GPUs have increased performance on AI inference 1,000x in the last ten years, said Bill Dally, the company’s chief scientist in a keynote at Hot Chips, an annual gathering of semiconductor and systems engineers.
ChatGPT Spread the News
ChatGPT provided a powerful example of how GPUs are great for AI. The large language model (LLM), trained and run on thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, runs generative AI services used by more than 100 million people.
Since its 2018 launch, MLPerf, the industry-standard benchmark for AI, has provided numbers that detail the leading performance of NVIDIA GPUs on both AI training and inference.
For example, NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips swept the latest round of inference tests. NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, inference software released since that test, delivers up to an 8x boost in performance and more than a 5x reduction in energy use and total cost of ownership. Indeed, NVIDIA GPUs have won every round of MLPerf training and inference tests since the benchmark was released in 2019.
In February, NVIDIA GPUs delivered leading results for inference, serving up thousands of inferences per second on the most demanding models in the STAC-ML Markets benchmark, a key technology performance gauge for the financial services industry.
A RedHat software engineering team put it succinctly in a blog: “GPUs have become the foundation of artificial intelligence.”
AI Under the Hood
A brief look under the hood shows why GPUs and AI make a powerful pairing.
An AI model, also called a neural network, is essentially a mathematical lasagna, made from layer upon layer of linear algebra equations. Each equation represents the likelihood that one piece of data is related to another.
For their part, GPUs pack thousands of cores, tiny calculators working in parallel to slice through the math that makes up an AI model. This, at a high level, is how AI computing works.
Highly Tuned Tensor Cores
Over time, NVIDIA’s engineers have tuned GPU cores to the evolving needs of AI models. The latest GPUs include Tensor Cores that are 60x more powerful than the first-generation designs for processing the matrix math neural networks use.
In addition, NVIDIA Hopper Tensor Core GPUs include a Transformer Engine that can automatically adjust to the optimal precision needed to process transformer models, the class of neural networks that spawned generative AI.
Along the way, each GPU generation has packed more memory and optimized techniques to store an entire AI model in a single GPU or set of GPUs.
Models Grow, Systems Expand
The complexity of AI models is expanding a whopping 10x a year.
The current state-of-the-art LLM, GPT4, packs more than a trillion parameters, a metric of its mathematical density. That’s up from less than 100 million parameters for a popular LLM in 2018.
In a recent talk at Hot Chips, NVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally described how single-GPU performance on AI inference expanded 1,000x in the last decade.
GPU systems have kept pace by ganging up on the challenge. They scale up to supercomputers, thanks to their fast NVLink interconnects and NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networks.
For example, the DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer, combines up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center-sized GPU with 144 terabytes of shared memory.
Each GH200 superchip is a single server with 72 Arm Neoverse CPU cores and four petaflops of AI performance. A new four-way Grace Hopper systems configuration puts in a single compute node a whopping 288 Arm cores and 16 petaflops of AI performance with up to 2.3 terabytes of high-speed memory.
And NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs announced in November pack up to 288 gigabytes of the latest HBM3e memory technology.
Software Covers the Waterfront
An expanding ocean of GPU software has evolved since 2007 to enable every facet of AI, from deep-tech features to high-level applications.
The NVIDIA AI platform includes hundreds of software libraries and apps. The CUDA programming language and the cuDNN-X library for deep learning provide a base on top of which developers have created software like NVIDIA NeMo, a framework to let users build, customize and run inference on their own generative AI models.
Many of these elements are available as open-source software, the grab-and-go staple of software developers. More than a hundred of them are packaged into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform for companies that require full security and support. Increasingly, they’re also available from major cloud service providers as APIs and services on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.
SteerLM, one of the latest AI software updates for NVIDIA GPUs, lets users fine tune models during inference.
A 70x Speedup in 2008
Success stories date back to a 2008 paper from AI pioneer Andrew Ng, then a Stanford researcher. Using two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, his three-person team achieved a 70x speedup over CPUs processing an AI model with 100 million parameters, finishing work that used to require several weeks in a single day.
“Modern graphics processors far surpass the computational capabilities of multicore CPUs, and have the potential to revolutionize the applicability of deep unsupervised learning methods,” they reported.
Andrew Ng described his experiences using GPUs for AI in a GTC 2015 talk.
In a 2015 talk at NVIDIA GTC, Ng described how he continued using more GPUs to scale up his work, running larger models at Google Brain and Baidu. Later, he helped found Coursera, an online education platform where he taught hundreds of thousands of AI students.
Ng counts Geoff Hinton, one of the godfathers of modern AI, among the people he influenced. “I remember going to Geoff Hinton saying check out CUDA, I think it can help build bigger neural networks,” he said in the GTC talk.
The University of Toronto professor spread the word. “In 2009, I remember giving a talk at NIPS [now NeurIPS], where I told about 1,000 researchers they should all buy GPUs because GPUs are going to be the future of machine learning,” Hinton said in a press report.
Fast Forward With GPUs
AI’s gains are expected to ripple across the global economy.
A McKinsey report in June estimated that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases it analyzed in industries like banking, healthcare and retail. So, it’s no surprise Stanford’s 2023 AI report said that a majority of business leaders expect to increase their investments in AI.
Today, more than 40,000 companies use NVIDIA GPUs for AI and accelerated computing, attracting a global community of 4 million developers. Together they’re advancing science, healthcare, finance and virtually every industry.
Among the latest achievements, NVIDIA described a whopping 700,000x speedup using AI to ease climate change by keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere (see video below). It’s one of many ways NVIDIA is applying the performance of GPUs to AI and beyond.

Headlines are fewer, and the market capitalization of the largest US companies considered to be direct beneficiaries of AI has stabilized after soaring initially. It seems an appropriate time to take stock of how ChatGPT and similar tools have been applied in a range of industries over the past year, and what they could mean for economies going forward.Have you read?Why we need to be realistic about generative AI’s economic impactHere's why ChatGPT is just the start of the generative AI boomRedefining the work experienceThe transformational impact of generative AI should not be underestimated. When the primatologist Jane Goodall first witnessed Gombe chimpanzees fishing for termites by manipulating blades of grass in 1960, the line between humans and other animals suddenly blurred. The intelligent use of tools was no longer known to be a uniquely human trait, leading her mentor, the paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, to famously say, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.” It is by now evident that generative AI is a tool we can use to perform tasks with such efficiency that we never thought possible, and this is redefining the work experience. Imagine you are tasked with digging a hole and there is a rock blocking the spot. Generative AI is the equivalent of being handed a shovel that transforms into a pickaxe to break down that rock, then goes back to being a shovel to finish the job.More concretely, generative AI is already being used innovatively in a range of industries. Below is a small sampling of its less-publicized use cases that nonetheless hold the potential for transformational applications:1. Healthcare: Doctors are using generative AI to help capture summaries of large amounts of medical literature or brainstorm potential causes of hard-to-diagnose conditions. Hospitals are using personas to better empathize with individual patients to anticipate their needs or communicate with them in a more understandable way.2. Law: Legal firms are using AI to stress-test the strength of arguments and explore ways to negotiate middle grounds. The technology is also being used to support humans performing contract review by looking for specific terms (such as “indemnification”) and identifying sections for further human review.3. Agriculture: AI is helping farmers with irrigation optimization by collecting and analyzing hectare-by-hectare data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction, among others. Farmers can use generative AI to find possible causes of and remedies for low crop yield or identify pests and diseases.4. Manufacturing: Car companies are using AI to analyze focus group feedback by automatically turning recorded discussions into structured data and summarizing group sentiment regarding different vehicle features. Manufacturers are using unstructured data in surveys, dealer warranty reports, and other language from vehicle owners to identify problems faster, determine consumer needs, and plan marketing campaigns.One other way the technology is impacting productivity is by empowering employees with little to no programming background to write programs that suit their employers’ needs. For example, companies in highly regulated industries, worried about putting data into ChatGPT, have started using the technology to produce custom tools in Python and VBA that they can then apply to their internal data for processing and analysis. By contrast, many software companies have been reluctant to put their code into ChatGPT for fear of compromising their intellectual property.At an individual level, innovative workers are enhancing productivity by using generative AI to draft plans, agendas and emails; aid in brainstorming; analyze an issue from multiple angles; write personalized software tools; or summarize large sets of information needed to perform specific tasks. As the technology is integrated into workplace platforms that emphasize collaboration, tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s GSuite can broaden the scope of the productivity benefits.Macroeconomic impact of generative AIYet the macroeconomic impact of generative AI will not be immediately measurable through common indicators such as GDP growth, inflation and factor productivity. History suggests that the impact of past technological breakthroughs on macroeconomic variables takes years to be felt, not quarters. Nevertheless, the timelines for measuring the impact of generative AI may be accelerated by the fact that the technology can be rolled out quickly via software, and by their relative ease of use with less demanding learning and training requirements. In our view, a key variable that will influence the macroeconomic impact of generative AI is the degree of public-private cooperation and overall regulatory approach toward the technology. Without proactive public sector involvement and sensible regulation, countries will lack the necessary amount of investment in both human and physical capital to harness the full power of AI.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. An example of a country that is adapting to this new reality is the United Arab Emirates. In a recent visit to the country as part of the World Economic Forum’s Young Leaders Program, we learned that the UAE had created the world’s first Ministry of Artificial Intelligence. UAE authorities are confident other countries will follow suit – similar to what happened over a century ago with the creation of the first-ever energy ministries. By contrast, countries that don’t promptly recognize the power of generative AI and work on mitigating its risks may not be able to close the gap between innovative micro-level initiatives and macro-level results. The potential is theirs to lose.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Tech and InnovationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesFourth Industrial RevolutionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

A new survey by KPMG in Canada has found a growing trend in the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools among Canadians in the workplace. The latest Generative AI Adoption Index found that 22 percent of respondents reported using these tools to assist with their job responsibilities.




The survey, gathering data from 4,515 Canadians, highlighted a rise in the number of users and an increase in the frequency of use compared to just six months ago. Over 60 percent of generative AI users now employ the technology multiple times a week, a jump from 52 percent in the previous survey conducted in May.




“The incredible speed of adoption after just one year of being introduced to the general public shows how generative AI has not only revolutionized the way people work, but it's supercharged the speed of technology innovation as well, with breakthroughs happening at a much faster rate,” says Seamus Blackmore, partner at KPMG in Canada and product leader at Lighthouse.




“For business leaders, it's imperative to keep up with this rapidly evolving technology, understand how it could affect their business, and adapt their strategies accordingly if they want to compete,” Blackmore adds.









The survey also found an annualized growth rate of 32 percent in the adoption of generative AI tools, suggesting that half of all Canadian workers could be using them within the next three years.




“When the tool first became available, workers were experimenting with it to see what it could do and if it could help them work smarter. Our survey clearly shows that generative AI has become a key resource for many Canadian professionals,” says Blackmore.




Generative AI at work
The survey found that employees using generative AI at work are experiencing higher productivity gains than previously reported. Nearly 58 percent of users reported that generative AI helped them save between one to five hours of work per week, up from 55 percent in May.




More than three-quarters (76 percent) of users rely on publicly available generative AI tools, while the remaining quarter (24 percent) use private generative AI tools developed exclusively by their employers.









“We're likely to see more organizations adopting private generative AI systems as access to customizable tools continues to expand - and the more employees use these tools, the more they will reap the benefits,” says Marc Low, director at KPMG Ignition.




Reluctant employers
Low notes that many organizations express interest in adopting private generative AI systems but hesitate due to the overwhelming influx of new tools, frequent updates, and the ever-changing dynamics of the market. He recommends that organizations conduct a thorough assessment of how generative AI will impact their operations.




“Adopting generative AI because it's the latest trend or because everyone else is doing it is not a sound business strategy. Organizations need to be intentional about generative AI; define why it's needed, where it will have the greatest impact, and how to measure improvements in productivity and competitiveness to ensure return on investment,” Low adds.




Among respondents not using generative AI tools for work, 27 percent do not perceive the benefits of the technology in their roles. Nearly the same proportion find the technology either too complex or lacks the necessary training for effective utilization. “This suggests that more education is needed for employers and employees to fully understand how transformative generative AI can be if integrated and deployed effectively,” he says.




Key findings of KPMG’s latest Generative AI Adoption Index:

20 percent of generative AI users reported using the technology daily, up from 18 percent in May. 41 percent reported using it a few times a week, compared to 34 percent in the previous survey.
77 percent stated that their employers were aware of their use of generative AI at work, an increase from the previous 64 percent. 90 percent expressed that generative AI tools enhanced the quality of their professional work, an increase from 84 percent.
72 percent deemed using generative AI essential to managing their workload, up from 65 percent. 76 percent reported that generative AI tools allowed them to take on additional work that they wouldn't have the capacity for, an increase from 67 percent.
55 percent reported always checking the accuracy of information produced by generative AI, up from 49 percent.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in healthcare as stakeholders work to assess how these tools can be used to drive improvements in areas like clinician burnout, population health, and precision medicine.







As health systems begin deploying these tools, more clinicians are getting a chance to learn about how models can help assist them with a variety of tasks. But as AI becomes ubiquitous in the healthcare industry, a major question remains: how can medical institutions effectively educate students about these tools?
The Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) and the University College at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) are working to prepare the next generation of clinicians for further integration of advanced technologies through the United States’ first dual degree program combining medicine and AI.
The program, which takes five years to complete, confers a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from UT Health San Antonio and a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) from UTSA.
Ronald Rodriguez, MD, PhD, director of the program and professor of medical education at UT Health San Antonio, was recently featured on Xtelligent Healthcare Media’s Healthcare Strategies podcast to discuss the program’s development, its benefits for medical students, and how to incorporate AI into medical education more effectively.
Listen to the full podcast to hear more details. And don’t forget to subscribe on iTunes, Spotify, or Google Podcasts.

BUILDING THE MD/MS IN AI PROGRAM
The program’s development began roughly four years ago when Rodriguez was giving a report about where the medical school should invest and focus more of its efforts.
“The one area that I felt was particularly pressing was artificial intelligence and the increasing use of these technologies in science and medicine, and how I felt at some point, it was going to become a very important aspect of how we practice medicine,” he explained.
When these suggestions were brought to the school’s dean, Rodriguez and others were tasked with holding a retreat to discuss the current technological landscape and how UT Health San Antonio and UTSA could collaborate on efforts to invest more heavily in analytics, AI, and computer science.
“The university had decided to invest in the development of a school of data science, and they were going to invest heavily in artificial intelligence and hire new faculty specifically in that arena,” Rodriguez noted. “Once they hired several people in that core area, then we got together with them and started to vet how we would actually put together a training program to specifically allow our medical students to capitalize on [AI].”
From there, stakeholders had to meet regularly to determine next action steps, such as what would constitute the core requirements of such a training program, what would be a reasonable amount to teach medical students about these topics, and the logistics of how the program would be carried out across two campuses.
Rodriguez and his colleagues faced multiple obstacles while developing the MD/MS in AI program. One major challenge was how the degrees should be conferred.
“Initially, we were trying to do it as a joint degree program where one degree would be conferred by two institutions simultaneously,” Rodriguez stated. “Once we started that path, we were notified that the complexities of that made it so difficult that it would be better if we had one institution confer the degree and the other form a memorandum of understanding and agreement through which they would allow us to provide students with provisions such as a waiver for the GRE.”
He and his colleagues also had to navigate hurdles related to tuition costs, academic schedules, legal considerations and paperwork, how students would be vetted for participation in the program, and what types of training would be credited toward completion of the dual degree.
Rodriguez noted that overcoming these challenges was a tedious process that took over three years, but that the hard work eventually paid off.
“Now, [the program’s development team is] quite happy with the result,” he said. “Even more importantly, should we ever decide to do other dual degree programs, we have a really good template in place now that would allow this to go much faster.”





HOW THE PROGRAM WILL BENEFIT MEDICAL STUDENTS 
When the idea to develop the MD/MS in AI program was first laid out, the prospect received a lukewarm response from many.
“I couldn't get people really excited about it, but I did my due diligence,” Rodriguez explained, describing how he sent out a questionnaire to all the medical students to gauge their interest in the program.
The students were very receptive to the idea, indicating that they thought being educated about AI in medicine was important enough for their careers that they would be interested to learn about the program and potentially consider taking on the extra training required.
“They were much more in tune with this than I think a lot of the older people in the institutions were,” Rodriguez stated. “They knew immediately how important this was going to be, and more than two-thirds said that they would very much like to hear more, and as much as a third would seriously consider taking an extra year.”
He underscored that the students’ willingness to even consider participating in the program was significant, as the extra year of required training would require a significant financial investment in terms of tuition fees and an additional year of potentially not earning income.
For medical students in a position to do so, making that sacrifice has the potential to pay off in terms of residency placements, Rodriguez noted.
“[Medical students] recognize that in this current environment, getting into a high-quality residency is not easy,” he said. “There is a limited number of slots, and there are more students in line for the slots than there are slots.”
The process is extremely competitive, and students who want to get into a good program must be exceedingly strong students. But not everyone can be at the top of the class, even if they perform well academically. This raises the question of how medical students can set themselves apart from their peers in other ways, Rodriguez emphasized.

“One way you can distinguish yourself is by developing a niche while you're a student that demonstrates additional skills that you have that may bring value to the place that you're going to go train for your residency,” he explained. “[The MD/MS in AI program] was one of those things where it was obvious immediately to the students that there could be great value in knowing how to utilize artificial intelligence tools.”

Now, the program is launching with three students already enrolled at the time of this interview, and more have been in contact with Rodriguez to get more information about the program.
The current program structure involves students completing the first three years of their medical school training as normal. Between their third and fourth years, they take a leave of absence to prepare for their MS in AI training.
The leave of absence helps address the challenges of scheduling classes across two campuses, as UTSA runs on a semester-based schedule while medical schools typically use a block schedule, with each block being anywhere from four to 12 weeks long and based on rotations.
To align the schedules, medical students finish their third year of medical school in July, then start didactic courses at UTSA in August. These courses give them some background on AI, computer science, and data analytics.
When their year at UTSA ends in May, the students prepare to return formally to UT Health Science Center again in July. Currently, one of the courses being developed for students in the program will focus on the use of technologies to interface with the electronic medical record through an application programming interface (API), Rodriguez highlighted.
During their training, students will also be required to complete two additional courses, which are capstone projects to demonstrate their understanding and use of the skills they’ve acquired through the MD/MS in AI program. From there, each student must write a formal thesis and submit it for publication.
Upon completion of these requirements, the MD/MS in AI dual degree can be conferred.
The hope is that the program can prepare the next generation of doctors to be able to use technologies like AI effectively and safely to improve healthcare.
As the first program of its kind in the United States, the program may also provide a blueprint for other academic institutions that want to ensure that their medical students are educated about health AI.


INCORPORATING AI INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULA
Rodriguez emphasized two different approaches that medical schools can take to incorporate AI into their curricula.
“One is to use [AI] as a tool to achieve medical education. So, in that case, schools might be utilizing it to help improve the way that students ingest content and get tested on it. And there are some novel ways to do that,” he said.
The other approach involves allowing students to take a much deeper dive into how these technologies are impacting medicine.
To do this, Rodriguez noted that medical schools must make efforts to establish necessary infrastructure, which is part of what the MD/MS in AI tries to do. By investing in and establishing infrastructure, schools can more easily adapt to challenges along the way. However, some medical schools are in a better position to take this on than others.
“If you look across the country, there are multiple medical schools that have access to engineering facilities, computer science departments within a university, or schools of data science and bioinformatics. Most of these have been set up as standalone institutions,” he indicated.
Such standalone institutions are not set up to train medical students to become doctors well-versed in AI. Rather, many of these institutions focus on conducting AI research to create tools for clinicians to use.
Rodriguez noted that this approach could be shortsighted as AI becomes increasingly integrated into healthcare.
“The paradigm shift here is expecting that medical students are going to be more than just end users. They're going to be the innovators. They're going to be the drivers,” he explained. “And it's really important that [clinicians] take that stance because if not, then we will be just the end users, and we will have the technology developers telling us how to take care of patients.”
He likened this to how payers have slowly gained more control over aspects of care like claims denials, impacting how clinicians practice medicine in ways that are not always in the best interests of the patient.
“I feel the same thing could happen with AI technologies if we are not careful,” he underscored. “It is possible that [clinicians] could be the ones being told by AI what to do and not driving the AI to empower us to be the most effective we can be.”
Rodriguez stated that clinicians, rather than technology experts, are likely to be much more in tune with health AI’s potential limitations and the direction in which these technologies should be developed.
“That's part of my drive for wanting to do this. I want the students that we graduate to not only know how to use the tools, but how to create the tools, to understand how we can best apply them, to understand where the best impact can be achieved for their particular area, and to develop them. We should be leading this; we should not be led.”

There was a time when it was unimaginable that you could generate original prose or poetry, write code, or create art – just by prompting a digital tool using our everyday, natural language. By now, many of us at least experimented with such a tool – generative AI. Generative AI is a form of AI that can generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. 
Here is one example of how it is being used in India. A research group, AI4Bharat, developed an AI-powered chatbot, Jugalbandi, to help Indian villagers gain easier access to government services. Accessible via mobile phones, the chatbot can understand questions in multiple languages. It then gathers information on relevant government initiatives and relays it back in local language. In less than half a year, Jugalbandi has expanded to cover 10 of India’s 22 official languages and 171 government programs.  
Now, imagine the possibilities of applying generative AI in your day-to-day work. A recent report released by the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Malaysia Centre4IR) and Access Partnership, titled, ‘The Economic Impact of Generative AI: The Future of Work in Malaysia’, estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD113.4 billion of productive capacity for Malaysia, equivalent to 28% of GDP in 2022.  
The report also identified three channels, through which generative AI will change the processes of production within an economy, and reprioritize the types of tasks undertaken, as well as the skills that will be valuable in the workforce.  
Three channels of change 
The first channel of change looks at unleashing creativity using generative AI, which can help generate new ideas to augment the creative process, enabling efficiencies of time and cost. Today, it is already being used to support creative endeavors across industries. 
This aligns with findings from Microsoft’s recent Work Trend Index, which found that 87% of workers in creative roles who are extremely familiar with AI said they’d be comfortable using AI for creative aspects of their job. Closer analysis of the findings revealed that more than 4 in 5 workers in Malaysia would be comfortable using AI not just for administrative tasks, but also analytical work and creative aspects of their role.  
Secondly, generative AI can help in accelerating discovery, reducing the cost of research and potentially supporting better learning outcomes. For instance, students can use generative AI to help them better understand difficult topics by making use of the technology’s ability to simplify complex concepts and provide an easy-to-digest summary to speed up the learning process.  
Beyond education, the potential of generative AI in accelerating discovery is also relevant in jobs across other sectors. The top occupations with the greatest share of tasks that can be transformed by this capability of generative AI include biochemists and biophysicists, astronomers, and biologists. 
The third channel of change is the role generative AI plays in enhancing efficiency, primarily in tasks that require analyzing data sets and information sources.  
Across the world, the pace of work has accelerated faster than humans can reasonably manage. We have all likely seen or experienced this ourselves, as 77% of Malaysians say that they do not have enough time and energy to get their work done. While there are some (62%) worried about AI replacing their jobs, many more (84%) would delegate as much work as possible to AI in order to lessen their workloads. Likewise, managers in Malaysia are 1.4x more likely to say that AI adds value to their workplace by boosting productivity rather than reducing headcount. 
With its ability to break down, summarize, and interpret large amounts of data in a matter of minutes or seconds, the AI-assistant becomes a powerful tool to support decision making and problem solving. 
The opportunity for Malaysia 
Shifting to an economic perspective, the report also finds that, given the structure of the nation’s economy, the highest potential impact of the use of generative AI is most likely in the manufacturing sector, taking up 46% of the contribution to economic value potentially unlocked by the technology. This is followed by the wholesale and retail trade sector (13%) and financial intermediation sector (7%).  
At Microsoft, we believe that AI is the defining technology of our time, and we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industries, and society. Understanding its transformative capability, we are cognizant that this technology will undoubtedly play a part in reshaping how we work. It may change the nature of some jobs, allowing people to focus on the more meaningful and enjoyable parts of their work, and may also lead to the creation of new jobs that did not exist before. In line with our aim to democratize our AI breakthroughs, Microsoft is committed to help prepare Malaysians for this future.   
As part of our Bersama Malaysia initiative to empower the country’s inclusive and sustainable digital economy, we have pledged to upskill an additional 1 million Malaysians by the end of 2023 to ensure every person has an equal opportunity to thrive in the digital era. To realize this, we are working closely with government agencies, non-profit organizations, corporates, and education institutions, among others. With their support, we have achieved more than 90% of our target as of November 2023. 
Harnessing the potential of generative AI 
It is vital to have a strategy to harness the potential of AI. Following through from the study, which includes insights from key stakeholders, as well as recommendations for harnessing the potential of generative AI as a country, which include: 

Increasing access and adoption –  the need for AI-ready infrastructure as well as conducive digital policies and regulations, so organizations and employees are encouraged to implement and leverage the technology. Additionally, public-private collaboration to ensure workforce readiness, so employees are equipped with the skills to best leverage the technology, will be important. 
Mitigating risks – the need for necessary guard rails needed to minimize risks and prevent the harmful use of the technology. As designers of the technology, we understand there is a crucial need for responsibility when creating and working with AI, and we aim to continue collaborating in this area, including with sharing our best practices. 
Inspiring innovation – Taking both the benefits and potential risks of generative AI into account, it is critical to find the right balance between protecting and promoting innovation. While accelerating innovation is important to build an AI-ready culture, policy frameworks should also be regularly reviewed in order to achieve a balanced approach that encourages innovation while protecting human interests. 

AI is poised to deliver significant benefits and it is a great time for us to work together to ensure that these can be enjoyed by all, to enable inclusive economic growth to be truly achieved.  
I recently also had the chance to share my thoughts with BFM on the opportunities that generative AI brings to the table and how it’s redefining our nation and way of work.

The job market for software developers has always been competitive, but we’re about to experience a talent crunch unlike anything we’ve ever seen in this industry.
Generative AI is everywhere, and anyone who works in software is trying to figure it out. While developers experiment with AI, business leaders are grappling with what it means for their teams. Most of the discussion revolves around what and who AI can replace.

[ AI is my copilot: The promise of AI code generation ]

The reality? AI is here, and it’s up to us, as software developers, product builders, and organizational leaders, to figure out how we keep up with this phenomenon very few understand. We have only scratched the surface of what AI can do since it became mainstream, yet we’re already talking about how it will replace human intuition. Something about this doesn’t seem right.

Crunch time for developer talent

Developers are under immense pressure to deliver new features faster and more securely, which provides an opportunity for AI to fill a gap in the talent market.
AI introduces a fundamental shift in how we think about software development. When it comes to developer talent, AI can, and most likely will, automate the repetitive work that junior developers currently do. AI-driven tools can unlock developer productivity and efficiency by rapidly building and deploying proofs of concept (POCs), auto-generating sections of code, auto-running A/B tests, and beyond. 











 
 
 
If we replace developers with machines, we won’t have engineers trained to do the more subjective and thoughtful work required to move software forward. The long-term impact of AI will be far more detrimental than beneficial, without the talent that is required to innovate, responsibly.
Redefining the role of a junior developer 
For the last 20 years, we’ve had a multitude of strategies to reduce the amount of duplicative, lower-level code (e.g., frameworks, libraries, and open source) that developers have to write. The goal has been to build on the shoulders of those who came before you so that you could focus on the things that made your application, and specific contributions to it, unique and special.
The goal is the same with AI, just accelerated. It’s about automating the creation of the code that is repeated, and then having your developers spend time reasoning and thinking about the code that is unique and requires deep thought and customization.











 
 
 
Without developers moving up through various career milestones, who will be here to mind the AI skills gap we’ve created?
Preparing for the developer skills shortage, now 
The focus needs to shift to training, specifically to investing in the next generation of software developers. Literally in a matter of weeks, everything changed. Just a few months ago, proficient developers wrote perfect code. Today, developers need to be experts in areas like prompt engineering, testing, and training large language models, or dealing with non-deterministic outcomes.
Software development will always be about experimentation, but delivering the next great feature that brings value to your customers will always be the priority. How do we continue to do this? The industry must prepare for the imminent developer skills crunch by investing in educational initiatives, upskilling programs, and fostering an environment that nurtures talent and promotes continuous learning.











 
 
 
At the junior developer level, that means continuing to hire talent and ensuring that developers gain early exposure to how AI will impact their workflow and approach to building software. For example, an entry-level developer may no longer be responsible for authoring code from scratch, so giving them exposure to validating and testing pre-authored code authored by AI will be essential. Hands-on experience writing code early on in a developer’s career is critical to developing their understanding of the systems they will eventually help build and maintain.

[ Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers ]

We need to provide our engineers who are just embarking on their careers an opportunity to learn in this space. Then, as AI becomes increasingly integrated into our workflows, there will be less emphasis on whose job is replaced, and more attention paid to how talent is trained to leverage AI. Future developers will spend the better part of their career thinking creatively, solving complex problems, and building the future. Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?

Generative AI is beginning to impact the analysis of structured enterprise data. It enables the conversion of natural language queries to structured query language (SQL) and facilitates vector similarity search to uncover valuable insights previously buried in the data, says Chad Meley, CMO at Kinetica.
Generative AI has captured widespread attention by producing novel and innovative outputs in creative domains, from captivating music compositions and breathtaking artwork to crafting compelling pieces of writing. In the business realm, the initial applications of generative AI have focused on extracting insights from the same kinds of unstructured data, such as call center notes or customer contracts. However, its influence now extends into structured enterprise data analysis. By leveraging the power of generative AI, organizations can unlock hidden insights, fundamentally transforming how businesses extract intelligence from their data. This innovative expansion highlights the adaptability of generative AI.
Generative AI is ushering in a transformative era in analyzing structured enterprise data through two key innovations. First, it enables the conversion of natural language queries to structured query language (SQL), a process often referred to as conversational query. This breakthrough allows users to interact with databases and extract insights using plain language, democratizing data access and analysis across organizations. Secondly, generative AI facilitates vector similarity search based on structured data. Structured data, encompassing well-organized information like orders, inventory, web traffic, and sensor readings in IoT, is the foundational data type that fuels industry innovation. Generating embeddings specific to structured information enhances search capabilities, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in vast datasets, greatly expediting decision-making processes, and uncovering valuable insights previously buried in the data.
Natural Language to Structured Query Language (NL2SQL)
NL2SQL processes plain language queries or questions, converting them into structured SQL queries that databases can understand. It involves a two-step process. First, the Large Language Model (LLM) uses natural language understanding to dissect the user’s query, identifying key components such as the entities, conditions, and desired data. This comprehension phase is critical, as it accurately interprets the user’s intent. Second, the LLM generates SQL queries based on the parsed information. It maps the natural language elements to corresponding SQL commands, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN statements, tailored to the database’s schema. This transformation allows users to effortlessly communicate with data sources using conversational language, making data analysis more accessible and efficient for an organization’s broader range of individuals.
Language to SQL conversion, although a transformative technology, faces some limitations. One challenge lies in the potential for incorrect syntax in user queries, as natural language can be imprecise and context-dependent. Furthermore, generative AI models may occasionally generate “hallucinations,” where the AI produces SQL queries that do not align with the user’s intent or database lexicon. Lastly, sub-optimized query planning can occur, leading to inefficient database interactions.
However, these limitations are actively being addressed. Improved training data, fine-tuning techniques, and robust validation processes help reduce incorrect syntax and hallucinations. Additionally, innovations in query optimization and reinforcement learning enhance query planning, ensuring that the generated SQL queries are syntactically correct, semantically accurate, and efficient. These ongoing developments are making language-to-SQL SQL conversion more precise and user-friendly, paving the way for natural language to become the lingua franca of business analytics.

Vector Similarity Search 
Vector similarity search, a powerful concept closely intertwined with generative AI, enables the discovery of patterns and insights that were previously beyond the reach of traditional analytical approaches. At its core, vector similarity search leverages the capabilities of generative AI models to transform structured data into high-dimensional vectors, facilitating efficient comparisons and pattern recognition.
Traditional analytical methods typically rely on structured queries or deterministic methods to identify patterns in data. While effective in many scenarios, these approaches often need help with complex or high-dimensional datasets like customer profiles, sensor data, network traffic data, financial data, etc. Vector similarity search, on the other hand, taps into the inherent relationships and similarities within data by encoding it into multi-dimensional vectors. These vectors encapsulate the essence of the data’s attributes and their interconnections.
Generative AI models, such as deep learning-based autoencoders and transformers, are pivotal in creating these vectors. By training on vast datasets, these models understand the data’s latent structures, enabling them to map data points to vectors in a way that captures essential features, even in high-dimensional or complex data like time series and spatial datasets. 
What sets vector similarity search apart is its ability to uncover patterns and associations not explicitly defined in advance. This data-agnostic approach means patterns emerge organically from the relationships encoded in the vectors rather than relying on predefined rules or queries. As a result, vector similarity search can unveil hidden connections, anomalies, or trends that traditional methods might overlook.
Consider a picture of a dog with its intricate features, such as breed, size, coat color, tail length, tail curliness, eye shape, ear shape, paw size, paw pad texture, snout length, nose color, body weight, whisker presence, and thousands of other features. Those features are stored as a series of numbers within a long vector representation. This vector encapsulates the essential attributes of the image in a high-dimensional space. Utilizing this vector space, the AI can discern similarities between objects. For instance, searching for animals similar to a dog may find a vector corresponding to a wolf, recognizing common traits despite their differences. 
This same principle extends beyond images and can be applied to profile things like stocks in financial analysis. The features of a stock at any point in time may include P/E ratio, liquidity, volatility, volume weighted average price, bid, ask, bid-ask spread, market capitalization, beta, dividend yield, free cash flow, etc. By encoding these various financial data characteristics of a  stock into vectors, generative AI can create a meaningful representation of the stock’s profile. These vectors can then be used to identify other stocks that exhibit similar qualities, enabling investors and analysts to uncover potential investment opportunities or assess risks effectively. Generative AI’s ability to distill complex data into structured vectors provides a versatile and powerful tool for finding analogs and making data-driven decisions across diverse domains. 
The features of a security event may include IP addresses, timestamps, types of threats, packet sizes, source and destination ports, and more. Generative AI can identify similar events that aid in threat detection by encoding these various network security event characteristics into vectors. The features of a logistics operation may encompass shipment weight, origin and destination locations, delivery times, transportation modes, weather events, driver attributes, and cargo types. Generative AI can facilitate the identification of similar logistics scenarios that enhance supply chain efficiency by encoding these various logistics data characteristics into vectors. Similar implications exist in automotive, retail, healthcare, and national defense.  
Vector similarity search and natural language to SQL, enabled by generative AI, will revolutionize structured data analysis by transcending the limitations of traditional approaches. It equips organizations to explore data at the speed of thought and exploit intricate patterns and insights that were once elusive.

But beyond fun smartphone apps and ways for students to shirk essay-writing assignments, what can generative AI do? How does it work? How will it AI technology affect the way that businesses operate? And possibly most heavy on your mind: will generative AI models take your job?As Ainsley Harris has written in Fast Company, in a profile of Mira Murati, the CTO of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI, “Nearly every aspect of economic activity could be affected by OpenAI’s tools. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, relatively narrow applications of AI, such as customer service automation, will be more valuable to the global economy this decade than the steam engine was in the late 1800s. [Artificial general intelligence] will be worth many, many trillions of dollars more, or so say its most ardent believers.”What is generative AI?Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can generate novel content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data.AI (short for artificial intelligence) broadly refers to the idea of computers that can learn and make decisions in a human-like way. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on teaching computers to recognize patterns through data and algorithms. It differs from traditional programming in that the computer doesn’t need to be explicitly coded to address every potential scenario. Natural language processing (or NLP) refers to the specific ability of certain machine learning models to understand written or spoken language (as opposed to numerical data or specific, previously coded language).Generative AI models take this pattern recognition a step further and use it to create text, images, computer code, and other novel content.How does generative AI work?If you’re using a generative AI model, you enter a prompt describing the output you’d like, and the program gives it to you, whether it’s in the form of text, code, images, or—increasingly—sound and video. But behind the scenes, things are a bit more complicated.When programming a generative AI model, developers will feed it massive amounts of training data. For example, consider a large language model (or LLM). LLMs are the kind of generative AI used in ChatGPT and the basis of many generative AI tools in use today. These machine learning models utilize deep learning algorithms to process and understand language. LLMs are trained with immense amounts of previously written text to learn language patterns so they can perform tasks. Those tasks can range from translating content to responding in chatbot conversations—basically anything that requires language analysis of some sort. Generative AI models are comprised of multiple layers of “neural networks,” which are machine learning models that mimic the neurons in the human brain, using a network of nodes to process data through algorithms. This allows the generative AI to make connections between lots of different data points and learn which ones are the most important when responding to query or prompt.Generative AI also makes use of deep learning, which is a type neural network whose data passes through several layers of processing—some of which are hidden from the programmer—before arriving at a response.For LLMs, these neural networks work together to analyze text and predict outputs. They’re also trained with a left-to-right or bidirectional transformer, which works to maximize the probability of following and preceding words in context—just like a human could reasonably predict what might come next in a sentence. LLMs also have an attention mechanism that allows them to focus selectively on parts of text in order to identify the most relevant sections for summaries, for example. What are the applications of generative AI?Even it’s early stages, generative AI can already do a lot and the tools available are incredibly diverse. Generative AI models can take in such content as images, longer text formats, emails, social media content, voice recordings, program code, and structured data. Then the AI model can output new content, translations, answers to questions, sentiment analysis, summaries, and even videos.These universal content machines have many potential applications in business. Today the most common uses of generative AI are for marketing. In the future, there is potential for generative AI to impact healthcare and life sciences—to make diagnoses, for example, or find new cures for disease.Not surprisingly, many of the early stages of generative AI began with large tech, or digital native, companies. Over the next several years, we see generative AI permeating traditional industries, like manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals, for example. Once a generative AI model has been trained, it can be fine-tuned for specific content domains with much less data.We are now starting to see specialized generative models for biomedical content, legal documents, and translated text, which will give rise to additional use cases in those industries and domains. They may help organizations to manage their knowledge and content more effectively so that it can be easily accessed by employees and customers.What is ChatGPT?The current wave of generative AI hype comes from the popularity of ChatGPT, a conversational chatbot created by OpenAI using an LLM that emphasizes back-and-forth dialog. GPT is short for “Generative Pre-Trained Transformer,” but the name itself requires some unpacking:“Generative” refers to its ability to generate text.“Pre-Training” means using the model from one machine learning task to train another, similar to how humans draw on existing knowledge when learning new things. In this case, GPT involves using a large corpus of text as training data.A “Transformer” is a kind of neural network that holistically learns about the relationship between all parts of a data sequence (in this case, the words in a sentence). It’s seen as a breakthrough for AI and generative AI technologies because it understands context and nuance better than previous approaches.Basically, users can ask ChatGPT questions or they can ask it to generate text for them that fits certain parameters. ChatGPT then draws on all the data it was trained on in order to generate a response.But ChatGPT—and generative AI tools in general—cannot come up with original ideas instead it uses its pattern recognition on from its training data and applies those patterns to the user prompts.Image generationEven though many current AI tools are based on large language models and respond to text input, generative AI can be used to create images. Diffusion models are one method for image generation from text prompts. These generative AI algorithms work by adding random noise to a set of training images, then learning how to remove noise to construct the desired image.OpenAI’s text-to-image tool, DALL-E, uses GPT-3 (the same AI text model that underpins ChatGPT) to interpret users’ requests.Generative AI assistantsWe can all use a little help sometimes—that’s why the rich and famous have armies of personal assistants to help them out. We can’t all afford that, but artificial intelligence is coming to the rescue with a new wave of AI assistants to help get get things done, handling the tedious details of making things happen.It’s a huge growth area, with billions of dollars invested in hundreds of companies creating generative AI models for specific tasks, such as AI marketing assistants, AI recruiting, HR, or even sorting out expenses. Others can handle tasks like taking notes in meetings, negotiating bills, or even doing math homework.Chances are that whatever someone wants help with, there is, or will soon be, a generative AI assistant available to help.Popular generative AI appsIn addition to ChatGPT, generative AI apps and tools have been popping up so fast it’s hard to keep track. From AI tools that can create images for use on social media platforms to video enhancers that are capable of deleting objects and creating virtual avatars, we’ve found some of the best generative AI tools for enhancing productivity, improving writing, and generating multimedia content, including sounds and videos.Here are just a few of the most popular:Generative AI text toolsAISEO.ai: If you have content that’s already written, it makes sense to use it as widely as possible. AISEO’s content repurposer lets you take something like a blog post and rewrite it into a Twitter campaign, an email, or even a script for a YouTube video. AISEO also offers a neat tool called the Paraphraser, which uses generative AI to tweak your written content, including shortening, extending, and even changing the tone of it for different audiences. Grammarly: This is an invaluable tool for anyone who writes. At the simplest level, it is a kick-ass grammar and spelling checker far superior to the ones built into Word or Google Docs. But that’s just the beginning: It can also advise on tone, readability, and engagement.Jasper.ai: As the name suggests, Jasper uses AI to provide inspiration. Feed the system a few prompts, and it can crank out anything from Instagram captions to essays on the meaning of life, providing multiple options.Generative AI image toolsStable Diffusion: An open-source text-to-image application created by Stability AI. The official version has a laborious installation process and runs through a command line, but third-party developers have used the open source code to create more accessible versions for desktop computers and the web.Imagen: Another image generation tool that uses a diffusion model, this one created by Google. The company has chosen not to release its code or demonstrate it publicly for now, citing its potential to create inappropriate content.Dreambooth: A deep learning model, developed by Google, that can fine-tune images created through diffusion. Its most notable use case is the ability to generate new pictures of specific people based on existing photos—for better or worse.Lensa: An image editing app for iOS and Android from Prisma Labs that first launched in 2018.Nightcafe: An online AI image generator with a twist: It allows the user to use several different AI image generators, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and others. Users can also apply a range of styles, so the experience is easy to get started with.Image.AI: AI image generators seldom produce good results the first time around. Instead, it is a process of evolution, refining the things that work and removing those that don’t. Image.ai does this, creating image after image until the user accepts the result.Photoleap: If you want to see how your house might look on the set of The Last of Us, Photoleap can help. The AI scenes feature of this iOS-only app uses generative AI to turn an image into a post-apocalyptic, fantasy cartoon or any one many other scene types.Generative AI video toolsNova AI: Upload a video to Nova AI, and it will automatically caption, categorize and tag it. Nova AL struggles with music, though: when uploading a Leonard Cohen live video to it, and it subtitled “Let’s not talk of love or change” as “Let’s smart things we can’t.” Not quite what Leonard meant, but it has a certain poetry of its own.  Make-A-Video: Need a video of a confused bear in a calculus class? Meta’s new Make-A-Video tool can create a video from pretty much any text thrown at it.Synesthesia.io: This AI video generator for pitches creates pitch videos from text in a few minutes using a computer-generated avatar.Generative AI sound toolsSoundraw: This generative AI tool can create multiple pieces of incidental music in seconds. Pick a mood, a genre and a theme and the AI system creates 15 short music clips to choose from. Murf: Speech generation was one of the first applications of AI, and the latest evolution is Murf, which creates AI voiceovers. This sophisticated service can create very natural-sounding speech from text in 120 voices and 20 languages.NaturalReader: Another voiceover service, but with a twist: The app snaps a smartphone photo and extracts the text and read it out loud in any one of the several hundred voices on offer. Their Personal Reader app can also read eBooks, PDFs, screenshots, and other texts.Cleanvoice.ai: Record yourself speaking and you will be horrified at the background noises, umms, ahhs and lip-smacking. Cleanvoice.ai cuts these out of your audio, leaving only the important stuff.What are the drawbacks of generative AI?Because the end user can’t see what ChatGPT and similar generative AI models are doing behind the scenes, it’s impossible to know the “source” of any given information they generate. ChatGPT has been known to generate false or offensive information, and even if you ask it to list its sources, the AI tool may invent a source whole-cloth.advertisementGenerative AI models also can’t discern bias in a source, leading to output that may not be objective.There are some potential legal and ethical concerns related to generative AI and content creation as well. One is the ability to easily create “deepfakes”—images or video created by AI that appear realistic but are false or misleading.Additionally, generative AI raises questions about what is original and proprietary content and may have a significant impact on content ownership. For example, if you use generative AI for creating content, is that content protected by copyright law? Or on the flip side, generative AI relies on existing content to use as training data, but what recourse does an author or artist have when their work is used as raw data to train an AI model?Generative AI models can also be incredibly expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated that the cost of training a LLM with 1.5 billion parameters can be as high as $1.6 million.Will generative AI replace humans in the workplace?In a word: No. Or at least not yet.Generative AI is a tool that can provide new ideas and help refine existing practices, but it can’t replace human intelligence in the form of the person who comes up with ideas and concepts. Instead, AI models can make this person more efficient and help them make more of the resources they have. AI assistants, for example, are excellent at specific tasks and definitely make work easier, but they are not adaptable: You can’t throw a new task at generative AI and leave it to figure it out like you can with a real person. That will probably take a few more generations. But for now, AI assistants can definitely make life easier by automating everyday tasks and leaving humans to tackle new, unique, or creative challenges. How can (and will) businesses use generative AI?Babson College Professor Thomas Davenport and Nitin Mittal, head of U.S. artificial intelligence growth at Deloitte, are the authors of All In on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence. Their book examines how companies including Alphabet, Ping An, Airbus, Walmart, and Capital One leverage AI in business strategy, key processes, change management, and competition.Here, Davenport and Mittal provide Fast Company with an excerpt from their book offering an overview on AI archetypes, capabilities, and general principles.The general path to using AI (excerpt from All in on AI)Reprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press. Excerpted from All in on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence by Thomas H. Davenport and Nitin Mittal. Copyright 2023 Deloitte Development LLC. All rights reserved.The path to becoming all-in on AI is not particularly well trodden; we’ve estimated that fewer than 1% of large organizations would meet our definition of the term. However, there are capability maturity models for virtually every business capability, and we will describe a similar approach for AI. Advancing maturity in AI is based on a variety of factors, including:Breadth of AI use cases across the enterpriseBreadth of different AI technologies employedLevel of engagement by senior leadersThe role of data in enterprise decision makingExtent of AI resources available—data, people, technologyExtent of production deployments, as opposed to AI pilots or experimentsLinks to transformation of business strategy or business modelsPolicies and processes to ensure ethical use of AICapability maturity models tend to have five levels, and we see no reason to depart from that standard. They also tend to have low capabilities at Level 1 and high ones at Level 5, and we follow that pattern as well.AI Fueled (Level 5). All or most of the components we’ve described above, fully implemented and functioning—the business is built on AI capabilities and is becoming a learning machine;Transformers (Level 4). Not yet AI fueled but relatively far along in the journey with some of the attributes in place; multiple AI deployments that are creating substantial value for the organization;Pathseekers (Level 3). Already started on the journey and making progress, but at an early stage—some deployed systems, and a few measurable positive outcomes achieved;Starters (Level 2). Experimenting with AI—these companies have a plan but need to do a lot more to progress; they have very few or no production deployments;Underachievers (Level 1). Started experimenting with AI but have no production deployments and have achieved little to no economic value.We might also add a “Level 0” to describe companies that have no AI activity whatsoever, but this is certainly a minority category among large firms in sophisticated economies.The key difference with other maturity models is that we’re offering three alternative archetypes for the use of AI, but a company can be at various levels no matter what the primary focus of their efforts.We would argue that in talking about AI-fueled enterprises, we are almost always describing Level 5 organizations. Like our examples, they are companies that have a wide variety of AI technologies and use cases in place, along with specialized technology platforms to support them. They do experiment, and companies striving to create may do more experimentation than those seeking operational improvements.The goal of all these organizations, however—usually achieved—is to actually do business with AI by putting AI systems into production deployment. New business processes are employed. New products and services are introduced to the marketplace and used by customers. Senior executives are engaged and active in identifying use cases and monitoring performance. They have established data science groups, modernized their digital infrastructures, and identified large volumes of data for training and testing models.Perhaps most importantly, there are alternative archetypes for employing AI, and somewhat different versions of capability models for different strategies. As we noted earlier, our view is that the three major archetypes can be summarized as:Creating new businesses, products, or servicesTransforming operationsInfluencing customer behaviorWhile operational improvements are the most common objective for AI according to our survey research, it’s clear that at least some companies don’t just use AI to make their existing strategies, operations, and business models somewhat more efficient. Instead, they use it to enable new strategies, radically new business process designs, and new relationships with customers and partners. Those companies would assess their capabilities in terms of the degree to which they have successfully developed new strategies, business models, or products.Operationally focused AI objectives would involve achievement of substantial operational  improvements, and customer behavior objectives would focus on how much actual customer behavior change has actually been achieved. Of course, that level of business transformation requires the active engagement and participation in strategic deliberations by senior management that Level 5 organizations typically display.Thomas H.

From AI tools that can create images for use on social media platforms to video enhancers that are capable of deleting objects and creating virtual avatars, we’ve found some of the best generative AI tools for enhancing productivity, improving writing, and generating multimedia content, including sounds and videos.\n\n\n\nHere are just a few of the most popular:\n\n\n\nGenerative AI text tools\n\n\n\nAISEO.ai: If you have content that’s already written, it makes sense to use it as widely as possible. AISEO\'s content repurposer lets you take something like a blog post and rewrite it into a Twitter campaign, an email, or even a script for a YouTube video. AISEO also offers a neat tool called the Paraphraser, which uses generative AI to tweak your written content, including shortening, extending, and even changing the tone of it for different audiences.\xa0Grammarly: This is an invaluable tool for anyone who writes. At the simplest level, it is a kick-ass grammar and spelling checker far superior to the ones built into Word or Google Docs. But that’s just the beginning: It can also advise on tone, readability, and engagement.Jasper.ai: As the name suggests, Jasper uses AI to provide inspiration. Feed the system a few prompts, and it can crank out anything from Instagram captions to essays on the meaning of life, providing multiple options.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI image tools\n\n\n\nStable Diffusion: An open-source text-to-image application created by Stability AI. The official version has a laborious installation process and runs through a command line, but third-party developers have used the open source code to create more accessible versions for desktop computers and the web.Imagen: Another image generation tool that uses a diffusion model, this one created by Google. The company has chosen not to release its code or demonstrate it publicly for now, citing its potential to create inappropriate content.Dreambooth: A deep learning model, developed by Google, that can fine-tune images created through diffusion. Its most notable use case is the ability to generate new pictures of specific people based on existing photos—for better or worse.Lensa: An image editing app for iOS and Android from Prisma Labs that first launched in 2018.Nightcafe: An online AI image generator with a twist: It allows the user to use several different AI image generators, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and others. Users can also apply a range of styles, so the experience is easy to get started with.Image.AI: AI image generators seldom produce good results the first time around. Instead, it is a process of evolution, refining the things that work and removing those that don’t. Image.ai does this, creating image after image until the user accepts the result.Photoleap: If you want to see how your house might look on the set of The Last of Us, Photoleap can help. The AI scenes feature of this iOS-only app uses generative AI to turn an image into a post-apocalyptic, fantasy cartoon or any one many other scene types.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI video tools\n\n\n\nNova AI: Upload a video to Nova AI, and it will automatically caption, categorize and tag it. Nova AL struggles with music, though: when uploading a Leonard Cohen live video to it, and it subtitled “Let’s not talk of love or change” as “Let’s smart things we can’t.” Not quite what Leonard meant, but it has a certain poetry of its own.\xa0\xa0Make-A-Video: Need a video of a confused bear in a calculus class? Meta’s new Make-A-Video tool can create a video from pretty much any text thrown at it.Synesthesia.io: This AI video generator for pitches creates pitch videos from text in a few minutes using a computer-generated avatar.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI sound tools\n\n\n\nSoundraw: This generative AI tool can create multiple pieces of incidental music in seconds. Pick a mood, a genre and a theme and the AI system creates 15 short music clips to choose from.\xa0Murf: Speech generation was one of the first applications of AI, and the latest evolution is Murf, which creates AI voiceovers. This sophisticated service can create very natural-sounding speech from text in 120 voices and 20 languages.NaturalReader: Another voiceover service, but with a twist: The app snaps a smartphone photo and extracts the text and read it out loud in any one of the several hundred voices on offer. Their Personal Reader app can also read eBooks, PDFs, screenshots, and other texts.Cleanvoice.ai: Record yourself speaking and you will be horrified at the background noises, umms, ahhs and lip-smacking. Cleanvoice.ai cuts these out of your audio, leaving only the important stuff.\n\n\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of generative AI?\n\n\n\nBecause the end user can\'t see what ChatGPT and similar generative AI models are doing behind the scenes, it\'s impossible to know the ""source"" of any given information they generate. ChatGPT has been known to generate false or offensive information, and even if you ask it to list its sources, the AI tool may invent a source whole-cloth.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI models also can\'t discern bias in a source, leading to output that may not be objective.\n\n\n\nThere are some potential legal and ethical concerns related to generative AI and content creation as well. One is the ability to easily create “deepfakes”—images or video created by AI that appear realistic but are false or misleading.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, generative AI raises questions about what is original and proprietary content and may have a significant impact on content ownership. For example, if you use generative AI for creating content, is that content protected by copyright law? Or on the flip side, generative AI relies on existing content to use as training data, but what recourse does an author or artist have when their work is used as raw data to train an AI model?\n\n\n\nGenerative AI models can also be incredibly expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated that the cost of training a LLM with 1.5 billion parameters can be as high as $1.6 million.\n\n\n\nWill generative AI replace humans in the workplace?\n\n\n\nIn a word: No. Or at least not yet.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is a tool that can provide new ideas and help refine existing practices, but it can’t replace human intelligence in the form of the person who comes up with ideas and concepts. Instead, AI models can make this person more efficient and help them make more of the resources they have.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAI assistants, for example, are excellent at specific tasks and definitely make work easier, but they are not adaptable: You can’t throw a new task at generative AI and leave it to figure it out like you can with a real person. That will probably take a few more generations. But for now, AI assistants can definitely make life easier by automating everyday tasks and leaving humans to tackle new, unique, or creative challenges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow can (and will) businesses use generative AI?\n\n\n\nBabson College Professor Thomas Davenport and Nitin Mittal, head of U.S. artificial intelligence growth at Deloitte, are the authors of All In on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence. Their book examines how companies including Alphabet, Ping An, Airbus, Walmart, and Capital One leverage AI in business strategy, key processes, change management, and competition.\n\n\n\nHere, Davenport and Mittal provide Fast Company with an excerpt from their book offering an overview on AI archetypes, capabilities, and general principles.\n\n\n\nThe general path to using AI (excerpt from All in on AI)\n\n\n\nReprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press. Excerpted from All in on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence by Thomas H. Davenport and Nitin Mittal. Copyright 2023 Deloitte Development LLC. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nThe path to becoming all-in on AI is not particularly well trodden; we’ve estimated that fewer than 1% of large organizations would meet our definition of the term. However, there are capability maturity models for virtually every business capability, and we will describe a similar approach for AI. Advancing maturity in AI is based on a variety of factors, including:\n\n\n\nBreadth of AI use cases across the enterpriseBreadth of different AI technologies employedLevel of engagement by senior leadersThe role of data in enterprise decision makingExtent of AI resources available—data, people, technologyExtent of production deployments, as opposed to AI pilots or experimentsLinks to transformation of business strategy or business modelsPolicies and processes to ensure ethical use of AI\n\n\n\nCapability maturity models tend to have five levels, and we see no reason to depart from that standard. They also tend to have low capabilities at Level 1 and high ones at Level 5, and we follow that pattern as well.\n\n\n\nAI Fueled (Level 5). All or most of the components we’ve described above, fully implemented and functioning—the business is built on AI capabilities and is becoming a learning machine;Transformers (Level 4). Not yet AI fueled but relatively far along in the journey with some of the attributes in place; multiple AI deployments that are creating substantial value for the organization;Pathseekers (Level 3). Already started on the journey and making progress, but at an early stage—some deployed systems, and a few measurable positive outcomes achieved;Starters (Level 2). Experimenting with AI—these companies have a plan but need to do a lot more to progress; they have very few or no production deployments;Underachievers (Level 1). Started experimenting with AI but have no production deployments and have achieved little to no economic value.\n\n\n\nWe might also add a “Level 0” to describe companies that have no AI activity whatsoever, but this is certainly a minority category among large firms in sophisticated economies.\n\n\n\nThe key difference with other maturity models is that we’re offering three alternative archetypes for the use of AI, but a company can be at various levels no matter what the primary focus of their efforts.\n\n\n\nWe would argue that in talking about AI-fueled enterprises, we are almost always describing Level 5 organizations. Like our examples, they are companies that have a wide variety of AI technologies and use cases in place, along with specialized technology platforms to support them. They do experiment, and companies striving to create may do more experimentation than those seeking operational improvements.\n\n\n\nThe goal of all these organizations, however—usually achieved—is to actually do business with AI by putting AI systems into production deployment. New business processes are employed. New products and services are introduced to the marketplace and used by customers. Senior executives are engaged and active in identifying use cases and monitoring performance. They have established data science groups, modernized their digital infrastructures, and identified large volumes of data for training and testing models.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most importantly, there are alternative archetypes for employing AI, and somewhat different versions of capability models for different strategies. As we noted earlier, our view is that the three major archetypes can be summarized as:\n\n\n\nCreating new businesses, products, or servicesTransforming operationsInfluencing customer behavior\n\n\n\nWhile operational improvements are the most common objective for AI according to our survey research, it’s clear that at least some companies don’t just use AI to make their existing strategies, operations, and business models somewhat more efficient. Instead, they use it to enable new strategies, radically new business process designs, and new relationships with customers and partners. Those companies would assess their capabilities in terms of the degree to which they have successfully developed new strategies, business models, or products.\n\n\n\nOperationally focused AI objectives would involve achievement of substantial operational&nbsp; improvements, and customer behavior objectives would focus on how much actual customer behavior change has actually been achieved. Of course, that level of business transformation requires the active engagement and participation in strategic deliberations by senior management that Level 5 organizations typically display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas H.

But none of that compares to the seismic shift AI represents as it starts to fundamentally redefine the way we work across sectors and societies.
As the CEO of LinkedIn, a platform dedicated to creating economic opportunity for the global workforce, it’s no surprise then that in almost every conversation I have these days, especially with fellow CEOs, I’m consistently asked the same question: “What is happening with AI and work, and what does it mean for me?
Here’s my response: The world of work is changing this fast and the most important thing to do is realize that the old playbooks, especially around talent management, will not work — now, it’s time to adapt. Ignoring that truth all but guarantees that your business will fall behind. But embracing it, with a focus on three big shifts, will set your business up for new levels of success in the age of AI.
Redefine jobs as a collection of a skills and tasks, not titles.
The smartest companies today are starting to redefine jobs as a collection of skills and tasks — instead of just titles — and are considering how those skills and tasks will evolve as AI advances.
If this thinking is new to you, it’s easy to embrace. Take the jobs done by your team or across your workforce and categorize them not by title but by the key tasks that get done every day. We know that AI will eventually impact virtually all tasks at some level given the increasing integration of AI tools into our day to day. But the impact of AI is going to be more pronounced on some teams than others.
When you see jobs as a collection of tasks, you’ll quickly be able to see which jobs are more prone to be automated than others. In those areas, it’s not a given that a job goes away. Instead, you can focus on up-skilling workers to manage more complex tasks and help them develop the people skills that AI is least likely to automate, such as communication and collaboration. This view of jobs as tasks not titles empowers leaders to identify the skills your workforce must cultivate to stay competitive and agile in the age of AI.
If that sounds too big of a shift to implement at your company, consider what’s being done at places like Unilever. Unilever is one of the world’s largest consumer goods brands and has been redefining roles as a collection of skills for some time. That shift enabled them to create flexible pathways for employees to unlock opportunities they may otherwise not have been considered for, fostering a more dynamic internal talent marketplace. Unilever’s innovative employment model, U-Work, helps employees transition between a diverse set of assignments based on their skills, rather than being tied to fixed titles and roles. In between assignments, U-Work employees (or “U-workers”) can pursue other passions, whether that’s setting up their own business or spending more time with family. This offers employees flexibility and creates agility for the organization.
Insight Center CollectionHow Generative AI Is Changing WorkExploring the impact on workers, companies, and the economy.
Figuring out how best to build this new thinking — and the systems around it — at your company is going to be one of the most important tasks every leader faces in the coming years. In fact, it’s likely we will see an entirely new category of jobs at companies crop up centered around the idea of “AI transformation,” where teams are tasked with figuring out which AI tools are the right tools to grow your business and, as a result, which workforce strategies are the right strategies to keep your teams agile and engaged. The battle for that talent will be fierce and it’s already begun.
Bring skills and workforce learning to the center of talent management.
Jobs are changing on us, even if we’re not changing jobs. The average LinkedIn member has seen the skills needed for their job change by 25% over the past eight years. That number is expected to reach at least 65% by 2030 due to AI.
Think about it. We’re already upskilling en masse on AI-adjacent skills to keep pace with change. How many of us have tried ChatGPT, experimenting with a slew of questions, trying to get the best results from AI? “Prompting” as a skill isn’t something taught in school, but being proficient in it has already become core to work in the last year.
For leaders, that means one thing: We need to prioritize and accelerate workforce learning, as it’ll be practically impossible for a one-off moment of learning (like a degree, or a two-year stint at a company) to last an entire career. Companies should start embracing a “training to hire” mindset with onboardings and apprenticeships as well as a “training to promote” mindset through upskilling and tours of duty that help guide employees into new functions, and perhaps even new careers.
IBM does this well. A longtime leader on skills-first thinking, IBM launched an apprenticeship program a few years ago to develop the skills that were essential for future roles at the company, building a framework centered on learning courses and on-the-job training. Now, they’ve had a thousand apprentices across 35 roles including cybersecurity, software development, data science, and design. The success of the program led IBM to commit to investing $250 million toward their Registered Apprenticeship and other training programs by 2025.
Another company leading the way is Genpact. This global professional services company has built an AI-enabled, scalable learning platform that harnesses the collective intelligence of Genpact experts at scale and delivers personalized reskilling paths for their 115,000+ global workforce. For example, as soon as GenAI took off, they identified it as a key skill for everyone and were quick to curate training courses on the basics, including prompt engineering and how large language models can be leveraged for their clients. So far, over 75,000 people have taken the beginner course, contributing to Genpact’s remarkable threefold increase in learning since 2019 — totaling nearly 40 million learner hours to date.
To help companies assimilate to the AI-led changes, leaders need to foster a culture of learning. Not just to boost AI literacy, but to build great soft skills, like leadership and problem solving, and create a workforce that’s resilient and agile in the face of change. And AI will help us do this better too — features like AI-powered coaching in LinkedIn Learning can help offer employees real-time advice and tailored learning content recommendations all personalized based on job title, career goal, and skills they follow.
Embrace AI to focus teams on human-to-human collaboration.
We’re seeing that professionals are excited that AI can help improve their productivity and reduce their workloads. Microsoft’s Work Trend Index shows that 70% of employees would like to delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads and, at LinkedIn, our estimate is that more than 80% of our members are in a position to use AI to automate at least a quarter of the mundane and repetitive tasks that we do every day.
This is big news for leaders. It means, with the right AI tools in place, your employees will have more time for the tasks that require human innovation and strategy. For example, recruiters can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process — like speaking to and building relationships with candidates — while AI takes on the heavy lifting of helping find the right pipeline of candidates that have the right skills. Or salespeople can focus on deepening customer trust and enhancing relationships, as AI helps with lead qualification and sales forecasting.
At LinkedIn, we’ve already seen the benefits of AI with our customer service team. By embracing self-service AI-powered experiences, our teams are no longer spending time on the basic questions they get all the time (How do I edit my profile? How do I get more followers?) and instead are spending time solving complex inquiries that only humans have the skills to do (think: empathy, patience, and cross-company collaboration). As a result, we’re becoming more effective by the day at solving all customer inquiries.
While it’s easy to look at AI as a tool that’s going to take away parts of our work, now is the time to reframe your mindset to see all your teams stand to gain with the help of AI. Simply put, AI is helping people focus more on the people part of work, which is why we see 70% of U.S. executives agree that soft skills are more valuable to their organization than AI skills.
What’s possible when we get this right
As big a deal as AI is, it’s not the first time — even in our lifetime — when technological change upended everything in our lives. When the internet became more mainstream in the 1990s, the conversation was very similar to the one we’re having today. Some jobs were lost, but ultimately, many more were created — in fact, 60% of employment in 2018 was found in jobs that didn’t exist in 1940.
Today, we don’t talk about the “internet.” Instead, we talk about the things we do with the internet: e-commerce, content creation, remote work, and the list goes on. The same will be true with AI. Eventually, we won’t talk about “AI,” we’ll talk about the ways AI is changing how we work and live, and that’s what makes this such a defining moment.
Across history, leaders just like us built and rebuilt the world of work time and again. This is our moment to rebuild the systems and pathways in place today and make them more equal, dynamic, and transparent than ever before. In creating these new playbooks, we could see economic opportunity reach more people in more places than ever before for decades to come, leading to innovation and growth at levels previously unseen. That future is not decided or inevitable. It’s up to us to create together.Read more on Talent management or related topics Technology and analytics, AI and machine learning and AutomationRyan Roslansky  is the CEO of LinkedIn, the world’s largest and most powerful network of professionals.

PNB and AmBank employees share their experience working with Copilot for Microsoft 365
As generative AI becomes more widely available, many industries are seeking intelligent solutions to transform their capabilities. The financial services industry (FSI) is no exception. Already, AI-powered productivity tools like Copilot for Microsoft 365 is empowering people to be more efficient, productive, and creative at work. 
Introducing a new way of working with AI

Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), one of Malaysia’s largest fund management companies, is among the first in Malaysia to deploy Copilot for Microsoft 365. 
The organization first embarked on its digital transformation journey in 2021, leveraging Microsoft 365 to ease transition into a remote working environment. The experience made PNB realize the benefits of cloud solutions for an efficient, collaborative, and secure workspace, regardless of employees’ location.  
While technology can make work easier, AI is only as good as the quality of the data it uses. The benefits, however, are unprecedented in how quickly and easily AI can analyze the data and generate insights that are both reliable and relevant to the task at hand. With the wealth of data it holds, PNB experienced a significant difference after using Copilot for Microsoft 365. 
Ts. Izzat Aziz, Chief Technology Officer of PNB said, “The ability of Copilot for Microsoft 365 to decipher large amounts of context and generate relevant input in a matter of minutes, or even seconds, showcases the outstanding level of sophistication of the AI.” 
Echoing this sentiment, El Zahrul, Head of Application of the Technology Division at PNB shared his experience. “I’ve heard so much about Copilot for Microsoft 365, and after trying it myself, I must say that it truly opens up a new way of working. Using Copilot in my daily tasks has allowed me to save time, especially in simplifying information search. No more manual searches through countless documents or emails – Copilot’s intelligent search quickly locates the needed information.”
Simplifying financial services in the era of AI

AmBank, one of the largest banking groups in Malaysia, is also among the first financial services organizations in Malaysia to experience this next-generation AI innovation in their workplace. 
Since embarking on their journey with Copilot, employees have reported a positive change in their work quality and efficiency. For instance, they can easily create personalized and engaging presentations with Copilot in PowerPoint, schedule and prepare for meetings efficiently with Copilot in Outlook, and present data in a clear and concise manner with Copilot in Excel. 
Rozidatul Akmal Kamil, Project Manager at AmBank shared, “It has significantly improved my work experience. Copilot for Microsoft 365 helps me work smarter and faster, while enhancing the quality and impact of my output.” 
She elaborated, “Copilot on Teams is one of my favorite features. The recap function has helped me save about 40% of the time I usually spend on minute-taking. When enabled, it listens to, captures, and summarizes the meeting discussions and action items in a clear and concise way, providing the minutes within an hour after the meeting ends. This liberates users, including myself, from mundane tasks; allowing us to focus on more strategic and impactful work.” 
All around the world, early users of Copilot do not want to go back to working without it. In a Work Trend Index Special Report by Microsoft, 77% of users said they do not want to give up Copilot. This is consistent with the findings from our annual Work Trend Index report released in May 2023, which found that while 62% of people in Malaysia are worried AI will replace their jobs, even more (84%) would delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads.  
This shows that employees are excited about the benefits of AI for their work. Leaders also have a positive attitude towards AI in Malaysia, with managers being more interested in using AI to boost productivity than to cut costs. They are 1.4 times more likely to use AI for this purpose than to reduce headcount.
Our approach to AI 
For 30 years now, Microsoft Research has been at the forefront in advancing the foundations of computing and translating new scientific discoveries into innovative AI technologies to create value for our customers and benefit the broader society.  
A recent study by the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Access Partnership estimates that generative AI can unlock USD113.4 billion in productive capacity in Malaysia, equivalent to a quarter of GDP in 2022. This highlights the transformative role that AI can play in driving economic growth and innovation. 
In our ongoing journey, we are committed to helping organizations unlock the potential of AI in an ethical manner – balancing innovation with responsibility – ensuring that privacy is protected, rights are upheld while still allowing for positive uses of the technology to continue.

Last year, a record 39% of the US workforce did freelance work, per the freelance platform Upwork. But this year, the growing popularity of ChatGPT is posing a threat to some of their jobs.A paper published in July by researchers from Washington University in St. Louis and New York University examined how the November 2022 rollout of the generative AI tool ChatGPT impacted the earnings of Upwork freelancers. The key finding: freelancers whose work was the most exposed to AI earned over 5% less in April 2023 than they did before that chatbot's release. Additionally, the researchers said workers who focused on writing-related tasks were among the most impacted.

It's not just Upwork freelancers who are earning less. Sheraz Shoukat, an Australia-based freelancer who offers various writing services on the Fiverr platform, said tools like ChatGPT have led to less demand for his work.""The impact on our earnings is huge, and to be honest, in a negative sense,"" he told Business Insider. He said he's seen some freelancers' earnings fall from roughly $2,500 to $3,000 per month to around $1,000 today.

NEW: Generative AI is already taking white collar jobsAn ingenious study by @xianghui90 @oren_reshef @Zhou_Yu_AI looked at what happened on a huge online freelancing platform after ChatGPT launched last year.The answer? Freelancers got fewer jobs, and earned much less pic.twitter.com/kbtp8uDUPU— John Burn-Murdoch (@jburnmurdoch) November 10, 2023 
Shoukat is among the many workers around the world who are monitoring how the AI boom will impact their jobs in the years to come. The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT could expose millions of jobs to automation and force many US workers to switch occupations over the next decade.Freelance workers, who are often narrowly specialized, could be the workers at ""greatest risk of automation,"" Oxford economist Carl Benedikt Frey told Business Insider.""If all you are doing is copy editing, translation, or web design, generative AI is more capable of substituting for you than if you are part of a larger organization or team, where you perform a bundle of tasks,"" he said.As AI tools make it easier for companies' in-house workers to perform certain job tasks, the demand for some types of freelance work could decline, Mark Muro, an expert on technology and workforce development and a policy director at the Brookings Institution, told Business Insider.

By Sam Becker for the BBC
Humans already work alongside robots in industries such as manufacturing. Now, for knowledge workers, the threat of AI replacement is coming faster than they imagined.
In early 2023, OpenAI's ChatGPT ushered in a new era - one in which artificial intelligence went from a pipe dream to a very real, contentious issue for workers.
The stakes are high: an April report from Goldman Sachs estimates ChatGPT, and other similar generative AI tools, could increase global GDP by as much as 7 percent, while replacing 300 million full time workers.
Many workers may have believed that burger-flipping robots in fast food restaurants, or advanced fabrication machines in factories, would represent the first wave of AI-related job losses.
A threat to creative positions
Yet the light-speed adoption and evolution of generative AI tools may now mean knowledge-work jobs that were long considered ""safe"" could be threatened even faster than workers anticipated. That includes creative positions that many presumed would be hard to automate, in fields like marketing, music production and graphic design.
Accordingly, researchers have found that the ""exposure curve is upward-sloping"", said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, who focuses on the interplay of technology, people and places. This means people in what may have traditionally been thought of as higher-echelon, professional positions are the workers most at threat of replacement by AI.
That's because generative AI tools and technologies can - or will soon be better able - to do all many things that have, in years past, been left to highly skilled humans: think tasks such as putting together marketing plans, search strategies and much more.
Part of this is new technology hitting the market. Robots that act like AI colleagues are on the way - and in some cases, they're already here. While there is reason to think that AI may be a boon to workers, there are reasons that many people working in knowledge-work positions should be looking over their shoulders.
Artisan AI
In early December, Artisan AI - a San Francisco-based startup, founded by 22-year-old Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, who is from the UK - will unveil its first ""Artisan"", an AI-powered digital worker. It is designed to integrate with human teams, and for all practical purposes, become a member of those groups.
While Artisan AI plans to have several ""Artisans"" hit the market throughout the next year, the first, ""Ava"", will automate the job of a sales representative, marking a significant improvement over chatbots and similar AI tools already on the market.
""After a 15-minute conversation with Ava, it'll have the ability to build a knowledge base, and with that information, create prospects,"" said Carmichael-Jack. ""It's like having sales software, but it comes with a manager or account executive built-in - she can make suggestions, edit campaigns, join meetings and take notes,"" he said.
Carmichael-Jack said Artisans can function autonomously, in the background, with little or no input. As such, Artisans, added to an organisation's team, could and should help boost productivity significantly. The technology is already attracting the attention of investors; Artisan AI has raised more than two million USD in pre-seed money within two weeks, according to Carmichael-Jack.
""Our goal is to have digital workers who can do anything a human can do, like join a meeting or have a phone call,"" he said. ""The goal is to have Artisans working alongside humans directly and have cohesion, and we want the boring work to be shifted on the Artisan, which doesn't have feelings about whether something is boring or difficult.""
Playing catch-up to the threat of AI
The looming threat of AI to knowledge workers may feel new, but the foundation for the threat has been building for some time. Yet policymakers and others are playing catch-up in grappling with the potential economic effects. US President Biden, for instance, issued an executive order in October, putting in place guardrails for AI's continued use and development that future-proof American jobs.
Although much AI technology is already shaking up the workforce as we know it, ""we're still at the beginning"" when it comes to AI integration into the workplace, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University professor and Director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. ""I'm more of the belief that we ain't seen nothing yet - this is just the first wave"" of AI integration into the economy.
He said AI adoption will make its way through more of the economy, and as that happens, it should increase output, productivity and revenues for businesses.
Human toll from AI growth
The question, however, is what the human toll of that growth will be, particularly in terms of job losses.
Brynjolfsson said that ""the typical company has 15,000 to 20,000 distinct tasks carried out by employees, and software can run through and see where the biggest opportunity for automation lies"".
If some of those tasks can be automated or streamlined with AI or other technology, he said, there's no reason not to lean into those technologies, especially if there's a potential for cost-cutting.
Given the immediate potential benefits to businesses, knowledge workers likely should carry some degree of concern regarding their jobs.
""All things being equal, this is a white-collar issue,"" said The Brooking Institution's Muro. That's why paying attention to what Artisan AI is bringing to the market in the coming months is so important for workers - especially those who spend their time doing knowledge or creative work.
""Part of the intense interest and concern is that this isn't somebody else's problem now, it's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" he said. ""All of this is surrounded by tremendous uncertainty in part because the technology is somewhat mysterious and a black box, so we don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""
Whether the white-collar workforce is diminished by AI technologies will, ultimately, be a societal choice. Workers will need to have a say in how AI is introduced and used in particular industries - and hopefully, that can lead to better outcomes for everyone, he said.
One example of this is the deal between the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and Hollywood studios that outlines limits for the use of AI in film and television production. The question is whether other industries will codify similar stipulations to preserve their workers' livelihoods.
Even Carmichael-Jack agrees that there will need to be some sort of plan or oversight for how AI continues to be rolled out into new industries. ""We will need regulation,"" he said, even if it does make growing Artisan AI, in the immediate term, more challenging. ""We are inevitably going to get to a point where AI makes much of human work redundant, and that'll be a painful period.""

More from At WorkWorker fired after X-rated reply-all emailWin for glam banker facing 120 fraud chargesHow some Aussies will get $21k super bumpAustralians are already experiencing job losses amid the artificial intelligence revolution – and many more across the country have been warned to prepare for a new reality.A 2023 survey revealed more than a third of Aussie small businesses already have, or are planning to, replace some of their workforce with AI.The survey found that 56 per cent of small business operators believe that AI will either reduce the number of people they employ or are unsure about the impact it will have on employee numbers.AI use by small businesses is growing, with 41 per cent of Aussie small businesses saying they use it, compared to just 26 per cent of UK small businesses.Of those Aussie small businesses using AI, the top three functions it’s being used for are administration tasks (39 per cent), creative writing (28 per cent) and drafting internal or company communications (20 per cent).This week, one employee who used to work in wine subscription sales spoke about 121 positions that were recently made redundant in his field.“All our jobs were replaced by chatbots, data scraping and email,” the anonymous worker said via the ABC.“We all got AI-ed.”The redundant worker said his former company, Endeavour Group, sold the job cuts as part of a wider plan to become a more “digitally-led offering”.But he says it was clear the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence had made online customer service workers obsolete in the eyes of the company’s executives.“From the perspective of anyone who was made redundant, there was nothing ambiguous going on. It’s pretty interesting to watch them twist themselves in knots to not say ‘AI’ when that’s exactly what it was,” he said.“There were people in their 60s who had been doing it forever, saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do now.‘”AI-related job losses often go unnoticed as employers attribute cuts to various factors and avoid explicitly mentioning AI. Reductions in work hours, rather than outright job losses, also contribute to the hidden impact of AI on employment in Australia.Despite the obvious problem of those being forced out of a job, business analysts believe artificial intelligence is actually creating more jobs than it eliminates, for the time being.Jobs in the AI field have seen a whopping five-fold increase since 2017, and a doubling of jobs in 2023 alone.While nobody can know for certain what the landscape looks like in 10 years, industry analysts have warned workers to adapt to the storm as technological disruption in the labour market continues.While nobody can know for certain what the landscape looks like in 10 years, industry analysts have warned workers to adapt to the storm as technological disruption in the labour market continues. Some occupations, like telemarketers, educators, events professionals and some legal professionals that have been pinned as particularly vulnerable.Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley Capital International ranked US industries by their estimated share of employment that could be exposed to AI-driven automation, using data from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.Office and administrative support is at the top of the list, with an estimated 46 per cent of these jobs in the US facing potential replacement by AI-driven automation.In Australia, there are 415,300 people whose main job is in administrative and support services, according to Jobs and Skills Australia’s latest labour market update in February.If 46 per cent of the Australian industry were at risk of AI-driven automation like the analysis predicts for the US, more than 191,000 Aussie jobs could be in trouble in this one industry alone.“Many common tasks in these roles, such as scheduling meetings, writing reports and data input are likely to be fully automated in the future,” the analysis says.As expected, MSCI reported industries that rely heavily on manual labour will be impacted the least.While some believe we have adopted AI too quickly, others say Australia should be investing more to maximise the benefits.While some believe we have adopted AI too quickly, others say Australia should be investing more to maximise the benefits as the tech tide rolls in. The cutting edge technology, which is now in the hands of children as young as kindergarten, has immediately sent a shockwave through the education system. Group of Eight chief Vicki Thomson sounded the alarm on the government’s need to step up on innovation during a parliamentary inquiry into the use of generative AI in the education sector.But university peak bodies agreed equity and fair access to the groundbreaking technology should be front and centre of any future government response.Ms Thomson said there was “no question” generative AI would shake up higher education but providers needed to be ahead of the curve.“What is concerning, given this is such an important, subject is that Australia is lagging behind competitor nations when it comes to our investment in AI and indeed research more broadly,” she told the inquiry.The federal government committed $100m in the last budget towards helping businesses to integrate quantum and AI tech.It’s compared to the European Union’s €20 billion per-year target towards AI to 2030.“We’ve got a lot of ground to make up,” she added.Read More
