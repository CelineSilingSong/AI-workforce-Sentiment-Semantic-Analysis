The Fine Art of Creating a Top-Quality AI Whisky

Mackmyra partnered with Finnish technology company Fourkind to develop an AI system that augments and automates some of the tasks of the distillery’s master blender, who is responsible for whisky flavor and product development.

PROMOTED
Master blenders spend their time meticulously tasting and experimenting to create the best flavors possible, and that process can be time-consuming. Mackmyra wanted machine learning to work its magic in sifting through massive amounts of data to find new combinations.
Fourkind created their AI system using Machine Learning Studio and Microsoft Azure, then fed the system datasets that included:

●    Evaluations from whisky experts
The AI system analyzed 70 million possible combinations and created a framework for creating innovative new recipes that taste great.
After the first batch of recipes, Macmyra's master blender, Angela D'Orazio, provided feedback so the AI system could learn more about whisky combinations that work for the palette and sell well in the market.
In each round, the distillery narrowed down their options and increased the quality of the recipes. At the end of the process, D'Orazio selected recipe #36 as the final pick for their innovative new product.
AI Can't Replace the Human Touch
Master blenders aren't going anywhere, though. Even the most sophisticated AI system cannot replicate or replace the intelligence and discernment of the human senses. The human side of whisky-making is here to stay.
Instead, Mackmyra embarked on their AI-created whisky experiment to see if they could augment the skills of their master blender to create an innovative new recipe.
The AI technology that allowed Fourkind and Mackmyra to sift through vast amounts of data to develop new formulas and recipes could have all kinds of other applications. Be on the lookout for new AI software in industries like perfumes, desserts, medicines, and clothing.
Companies are looking for ways to partner with AI technology companies to augment and expand what their internal experts can do, so they can get the most out of every new product they develop, and reduce some of the heaviest data analysis and learning from their employees' shoulders.
The end result of the next consumer AI experiment? It might just have notes of toffee, pear, apples, and creamy vanilla with a light tone of oak.

Commanders could use an artificial intelligence advocate by their side to explain how to use the new technology in combat, former deputy secretary of defense Robert Work said Monday.
Work, who served as vice-chair of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, compared the position to that of a staff judge advocate “at all levels of command” in the war on terror. He explained that, like the staff judge advocate, this member of the staff would advise commanders of the implications of their decision and “this could happen” in selecting targets. The advocate would also express concerns over possible collateral damage and ensure that they are operating within “universal humanitarian laws” in carrying out the mission.
Commanders “don’t have to be experts” in all aspects of artificial intelligence, he said during an online forum sponsored by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. But they do have to be familiar with it and other new technologies.
In an answer to a follow-up question about educating commanders, the former under secretary of the Navy stressed that he didn’t “want to overload” professional military education with another set of required courses for officers and noncommissioned officers.
Work did call for assessing all enlisted and officer for occupational skills on all entrance exams to the military services. It also means overhauling the personnel system to delineate career paths for enlisted, officers and civilians who have these needed skills.
Those paths don’t exist now, he and the other panelists agreed.
Harrison Schramm, a senior fellow at CSBA and Naval Academy graduate, said that in the sea services “all paths to success [promotion] go through command.”
The sea services and the Pentagon are not alone in this regard, Jose-Marie Griffiths, president of Dakota State University and a member of the commission, said. “Very few parts of the government track AI [or technological skills] through career paths” for their workers. “The government doesn’t even know … who has those skill sets,” she said.
In his opening remarks, Work said the commission recognized that “AI is a group of technologies” that starts with talent and runs through integration.
The biggest issue is that while the government can attract “young men and women who are digitally savvy”, they can spend months waiting to get hired and even longer for security clearances, then get placed “in jobs where they don’t practice their skills.” All of this translates into them leaving for the private sector.
Work added that the Office of Personnel Management does not have a way of classifying an applicant who is experienced in coding, but lacks a college degree, yet has skills that could fill an important role in government.
Likewise, “we don’t even know how to score our talent for the military” in those areas, he said.
“The big idea” from the commission, according to Work and Griffiths, is creating a digital corps to work in all agencies and departments of the government. Young people “want to graduate from college without crushing debt. We think that would be an enormous attraction” for them to join, Work said.
Included in that idea is the creation of a digital service academy with a seven-year course of instruction, operated in a similar way to the service academies, but designed for the civilian side of the government. “It’s not trying to duplicate the service academies,” Work said. He added that a reserve digital corps would also be established and function in a way that is similar to the military’s reserve components: one weekend a month of training; two weeks a year on assignment as an agency intern or observer.
He estimated the cost at about $70,000 per year for students at the academy, comparable to the military service academies; but the digital academy would not require as large a faculty or staff for things like intercollegiate athletics or need for training ranges.
To succeed in the long term, career paths are required for these government employees, the panelists said.
Griffiths said that a new National Defense Education Act, based upon the lessons learned from the first bill passed after the Soviet Union’s successful launch of the Sputnik satellite, is also needed to improve kindergarten through 12th-grade education. She later emphasized the need for science, technology, engineering and mathematics in middle schools and the continuing education of teachers to keep them current in technological developments.
She also called for more investment in National Science Foundation scholarships and fellowships to build the domestic talent pool in artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing and engineering.
Griffiths and Work said the most politically charged commission recommendations lay in overhauling immigration laws “to remain the world’s magnet for technological talent” and “it’s not an easy problem” to get through Congress. Griffiths noted that one-quarter of American patents in recent years have gone to immigrants. Work added that 79 percent of the graduate students in computer science in American universities are from other countries.
“There’s a great deal more demand than supply” in the domestic tech industry and globally, Schramm said.
Work said the commission recognized security concerns over technology transfers to competitors like China that could arise from issuing more Green Cards to foreign-born doctorate holders from American institutions. He said those concerns also exist among insiders wanting to profit by selling their expertise. Even more common now is the pirating of proprietary technology information through cyber intrusion.
For the military, Schramm said, there is a “glamorous aspect” to artificial intelligence, but also a mundane aspect to it that can address Navy and Air Force problems and achieve immediate results, like personnel rotations and household moves.
Schramm added that another area worth exploring is using it to enhance aviation safety. Data in that area “is well-curated” and can be used in building recommendations for new practices that enhance safety.

Does the Future of Artificial Intelligence Favor Authoritarianism?

 


Photo Credit: Seeedstudio.com
In our networked world, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies can be copied and pasted with minimal modification until they become geopolitical forces. On April 8, 2021, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released its Global Trends 2040 report, noting more centrally than ever that AI is not only an isolated technology but also an increasingly indivisible character of the global system due to its potential to disrupt every aspect of civilization by processing and analyzing data faster and more imaginatively than the human mind. The report summarizes new trends in AI, such as converging seemingly unrelated technologies, accelerating development timelines, and compounding first adopter advantages particularly in standards setting.[i] Yet, the report concurrently highlights dark undertones of these seemingly neutral trends, such as the increasing inequality and raw power imbalance between knowledgeable states who create technology versus those who use and amplify said technological capabilities. The ODNI is concerned that the diffusion of digital technologies and their rapid ‘copy-paste’ proliferation means that more authoritarian states will have access to and take advantage of this new domain, giving them the capacity to shape the development of the field and the norms and structures related to it in their image.[ii] This begs the question: are these AI technologies truly neutral forces?
Political powers play a role in determining the direction of accelerating and disruptive technologies as technology and technological capacity are increasingly recognized as geopolitical power. [iii] This is particularly concerning as authoritarian regimes employ AI and possess distinct advantages over non-authoritarian governments. Firstly, not only can they coerce or self-select individuals into government service to generate strong technologically-savvy talent pools, but they can also use AI to centralize and amass data without having to consider political restraints and/or individual liberties.[iv] As such, authoritarian systems can deploy AI at the national level with little consent of their population or intra-bureaucratic wrangling. Secondly, authoritarian systems will be able to rapidly advance existing technologies, as scientists and technicians integrate capabilities to disrupt competitors by centralizing financial resources and statecraft behind state-backed enterprises. Thirdly, because AI exists in a world where it is first deployed and then evaluated, meaning that consequences and standards setting can become secondary to development, “corporations and states at the forefront of emerging technology will shrink timelines and choose to develop technologies before the implications of these choices are fully known.”[v] Authoritarian economies closely managed by the state may be better prepared to react quickly and fund new and risky technologies, while open economies rely heavily on private sector funding for innovation and are vulnerable to planned economies who are able to buy, steal, or develop any successful AI methodology. Lastly, the basic building blocks of operating systems require logs that record every process within a computer, inherently generating an almost perfect surveillance opportunity for authoritarians wishing to crush dissent. [vi]
Even assuming that authoritarian regimes produce fewer innovators in AI, as quantity and lack of constraints can sometimes overcome quality, what advantage is openness if it enables the instant theft and deployment of new AI models by authoritarian states? Open societies will not be able to use innovation to compete with these authoritarian coercion tactics or AI data reservoir advantages, as adversarial learning allows authoritarian systems to leverage state-backed cyber operations that will increasingly be automated to identify, collect, and iterate technologies that instantly gain access to systems, collect intellectual property, and secure data in automated ways that advance state power.[vii] As a result of these power imbalances, could AI development favor authoritarianism?
US policymakers must question the intent and consequences of AI technologies with a critical eye in order to protect US national security. In an AI-enabled future, labor and societal forces will be disrupted by transformational change that will move faster than human minds and traditions can tolerate, and democratic governance must work to navigate these accelerating currents. The ODNI report notes that “although many countries will develop strict rules on the use of personal data, there will be debate on whether these rules can coexist with the full realization of AI capabilities.” As is visible today, when personal data protection is limited, states and corporations work to bypass controls with a push-pull of data collection, sophisticated spyware, and enhanced decryption techniques to enhance their data reservoirs.[viii] US policymakers must look inward and develop strategic objectives before applying AI results to ensure that use cases serve collective goals. Leaving AI development to authoritarian competitors is an unacceptable abdication. Instead, agile prototyping, funding, and scaling of national security innovation by organizations like the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) is desperately needed. [ix] AI will be vital to securing future national security interests and handling the complexity of future systems; but, AI for national security must remain lean—able to continue to pivot and innovate at every stage of development, self-evaluate, and evolve in real time while deployed.
Moreover, AI technologies–statistical, rules-based systems unlike the natural world they model–advance and become more complex, they become relatively more dynamic but conversely less human intelligible; fewer individuals understand end-to-end what data and data pipelines rely on to operate.[x]  Mathematical complexity can thus obscure policymakers and citizens from the bias and inaccuracy of AI while limiting accountability and enabling only large, hierarchical organizations to foster cutting-edge development. Because AI that works in a corporate setting may create unacceptable risks and inaccuracies in the context of national security, the U.S. must educate and attract AI expertise to public service.[xi] 
Overall, policies must not be shaped by the needs of the AI training sets; AI exists as a human tool, and loss of human-centrism risks further “exacerbating inequalities within and between states.”[xii] As such, democratic states should apply AI’s potential to take advantage of weaknesses in authoritarian systems by exposing corruption, breaking through propaganda narratives, and delivering better outcomes for their citizens. It is critical that AI development becomes agile and adaptable to the needs of individual teams and missions within the government instead of shaping and being shaped by organizations that serve what best suits the algorithm.

This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, April 18, to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)It’s not altogether surprising that a company earning billions of dollars a year making the chips that power today’s hyperrealistic video games has a business plan inspired by a science-fiction novel. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, the nation’s most valuable semiconductor company, with a stock price of $645 a share and a market cap of $400 billion, is out to create the metaverse, what Huang describes “a virtual world that is a digital twin of ours.” Huang credits author Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, filled with collectives of shared 3-D spaces and virtually enhanced physical spaces that are extensions of the Internet, for conjuring the metaverse.  This is already playing out with the massively popular online games like Fortnite and Minecraft, where users create richly imagined virtual worlds. Now the concept is being put to work by Nvidia and others. Partnering with Nvidia, BMW is using a virtual digital twin of a factory in Regensburg, Germany, to virtually plan new workflows before deploying the changes in real time in their physical factory. The metaverse, says Huang, “is where we will create the future” and transform how the world’s biggest industries operate.From their roots in the gaming industry, Nvidia chips are now an important component of many of the world’s most powerful computers, powering AI, drug discovery and the coming generation of autonomous vehicles. Huang joined TIME for a video conversation this week to talk about the chip shortage, the future of the car industry and his belief in the goodness of human nature. Subscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.(This interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been condensed and edited for clarity. Note: Some of Huang’s comments, below, are from a keynote speech he gave earlier this week and the press conference that followed.)You describe the latest iteration of AI as “the modern Big Bang.” Can you share your view of the transforming potential of AI?AI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans’ fundamental technology is intelligence. We’re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that’s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It’s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We’re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We’re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we’re going to see the automation of automation.Not to make any value judgments about the importance of video games, but do you find it ironic that a company that has its roots in entertainment is now providing vitally important computing power for drug discovery, basic research and reinventing manufacturing?No, not at all. It’s actually the opposite. We always started as a computing company. It just turned out that our first killer app was video games. At the time video games was a zero billion-dollar market, and we postulated that this new industry called video games, with 3-D graphics that are really rich and beautiful was going to be one of the largest technology industries in the world. The condition is extremely rare that a market is simultaneously large and technologically demanding. It is usually the case that the markets that require really powerful computers are very small in size, whether it’s climate simulation or molecular-dynamics drug discovery. The markets are so small, it can’t afford very large investments. That’s why you don’t see a company that was founded to do climate research. Video games were one of the best strategic decisions we ever made. AI is a watershed moment for the world.What’s your philosophy regarding entering new markets?Our primary preference is that we don’t build something. If somebody else is building it, we’re delighted to use it. That allows us to spare our critical resources in the company, and focus on advancing the industry in a way that is rather unique and advance the industry in a way that nobody else does. Why are recommendation algorithms so hard and so important?Recommender systems are the most important AI system of our time, the most important machine-learning pipeline in the world today. It is the engine for  search, ads, online shopping, music, books, movies, user-generated content, news.  They are processing hundreds of petabytes of data and moving toward terabytes. One of the most important things that intelligent people do is make recommendations. Recommender systems predict your needs and preferences from past interactions with you, your explicit  preferences, and learned preferences using methods called collaborative and content filtering. Trillions of items to be recommended to billions of people.How has the chip shortage affected the car industry?One of the dynamics that COVID exposed is a weakness in the supply chain of the automotive industry, which has too many components built into cars. When it shut down abruptly because of COVID, the recovery process—the restart process—was far more complicated than anybody imagined. It is very clear that the car has to be rearchitected, and instead of thousands of components, it really wants to be a few centralized components, because you could keep your eyes on four things a lot better than you can keep an eye on 1,000 things or 10,000 things coming from different places. We're going to see the automation of automation.Beyond the chip shortage, you work closely with major car companies: How will AI impact the automotive industry?The car industry could start thinking about their cars not as vehicles that they sell, but as part of their fleet and their installed base. They could provide software services over the course of the 15, 20 years that these cars are on the road. So the business model is transformed. How important is the advent and the adaptation of digital twins for manufacturing, business and society at large?In the future, the digital world or the virtual world will be thousands of times bigger than the physical world. There will be a new New York City. There’ll be a new Shanghai. Every single factory and every single building will have a digital twin that will simulate and track the physical version of it. Always. By doing so, engineers and software programmers could simulate new software that will ultimately run in the physical version of the car, the physical version of the robot, the physical version of the airport, the physical version of the building. All of the software that’s going to be running in these physical things will be simulated in the digital twin first, and then it will be downloaded into the physical version. And as a result, the product keeps getting better at an exponential rate. The second thing is, you’re going to be able to go in and out of the two worlds through wormholes. We’ll go into the virtual world using virtual reality, and the objects in the virtual world, in the digital world, will come into the physical world, using augmented reality. So what’s going to happen is pieces of the digital world will be temporarily, or even semipermanently, augmenting our physical world. It’s ultimately about the fusion of the virtual world and the physical world.Do you worry about bad actors getting their hands on all this powerful technology and using it to sow chaos, perpetrate evil and disrupt this utopian vision of the future? The best way is to democratize the technology in order to enable all society, which is vastly good—and to put great technology in their hands, so that they could use the same technology—and, ideally, superior technology—to stay safe.

The administrative staff, management, teachers, and students are all using AI in different ways to achieve similar goals. During the last few years, AI has spread its roots much wider and deeper in this sector..Markets and Markets&nbsp;has predicted that the global market share of&nbsp;AI in education&nbsp;is estimated to reach $3.68 billion by 2023 at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 47%. Another platform,&nbsp;Market Search Engine, has predicted that the share will reach $5.80 billion by 2025..Though we haven't seen humanoids replacing teachers, we sure are seeing AI systems taking over teaching and guiding students during their online courses. Whether it is automating tasks or personalized training courses based on students' capabilities, AI is changing the way people look at education..Before we say the various ways in which artificial intelligence is contributing to the education sector, let us look at how an educational institution should implement AI in its establishment..How to Implement AI in the Educational Sector?.Do you want to implement&nbsp;artificial intelligence solutions&nbsp;in your educational institution? You will first need to define the long-term goals and understand the limitations of the existing system. Without knowing what you want to achieve, investing in AI will not be beneficial..Then, you will either have to hire AI experts to bridge the talent gap or outsource the responsibility to a&nbsp;machine learning consulting company. If you want to hire a third-party company, it is recommended to do so in the beginning. This will ensure that your institutional goals and the company's services are aligned and in sync with each other.&nbsp;Well-known institutions such as Nuance (Massachusetts), Querium (Texas), Kidsense (California), and many others have successfully adopted AI models in their educational systems..Identify Needs:&nbsp;What do you expect AI to do in your establishment? Which processes do you want to automate? Which training areas do you want to focus on?.Determine Objectives:&nbsp;Are you aware of how AI works? Do you know the drawbacks of using AI systems? How do you plan to overcome the challenges in adopting artificial intelligence?.Align Processes:&nbsp;The&nbsp;AI solutions&nbsp;you choose should create the right environment to align your establishment's talent, technology, and work culture. You need to convert your institution into an analytical-based model that focuses on actionable insights to make better decisions..Control the Environment:&nbsp;The new work environment should accommodate and allow humans and AI systems to work in tandem. The processes should be transparent, efficient, effective, and secure..Role of Artificial Intelligence in Education.Automating Administrative Tasks.Is there an establishment that can function without backend work by the administrative department and the teaching faculty? Whether it is filing paperwork, sending emails and messages, contacting students and their parents, or making periodic reports, the administrative staff constantly works from morning to evening..Similarly, the teachers and professors have to mark the homework, test papers, create a teaching schedule, prepare for the next classes, etc. Do you know that a teacher spends less than half their time actually teaching the students?&nbsp;According to an article posted by The Telegraph, teachers spend only 43% of their time on teaching..The remaining time is allotted to marking test sheets, planning future lessons, and completing the administrative work. The&nbsp;artificial intelligence consultant&nbsp;will help you create an AI system that will allow the staff and the teachers to be more productive at work.&nbsp;Teachers can use smart question generators like PrepAI that help them set better question papers for the tests and save time in the process..Personalizing Learning for Students.Personalized learning is pretty much similar to personalized recommendations offered by online marketplaces or Netflix. The courses and subjects are recommended based on the interests and preferences of the students.&nbsp;AI for online learning&nbsp;doesn't replace teachers. Instead, it helps teachers understand the abilities and limitations of each student. It makes things easier for the students and teachers to create an exclusive course plan for each student..Smart tutoring systems also offer instant personalized feedback to help students understand how they can do better. Teachers can convert their lessons into interactive sessions and flashcards so that students will take more interest in learning the subjects..Creating Smart Content.Smart content is a popular topic in the education sector. It is nothing but creating virtual content by digitizing textbooks, notes, creating video lessons and lectures, developing interactive training sessions, and more.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence in education&nbsp;helps create customizable interfaces for the students to learn easily and understand better. Be it the elementary level or the postgraduate level, smart content can be developed for any subject and any class..Microlearning and skills mapping are two concepts that belong to this category. Skills mapping is the process of creating a visual representation of the skills needed by students to perform well in their studies. Microlearning is a skill-based learning module that deals with specific areas to achieve expertise in the field..Breaching the Geographical Barriers.Online courses have made it possible for students from any region to join a course from any other country. The physical barriers between countries have been eliminated in terms of online education. Technology made it possible to acquire specialized skills from the best teachers, no matter where they are located..Now, students have even better chances of updating their skills through AI-powered training sessions. Information Technology is one area where numerous courses are using AI. That shouldn't be surprising since artificial intelligence is an inherent part of the industry. Students and professionals who wish to become AI and ML experts are enrolling for these courses..Education Made Easy for People with Special Needs.It has always been a challenging task to create a learning program for people with special needs. Though there are exclusive schools for students with hearing, speech, and visual impairment, the teaching process could have been more effective..Also, students with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, etc., have to be enrolled in special schools to help them deal better. But why can't these students continue to be a part of regular schools? Is there a way teachers can understand and pay more attention to these kids? Artificial intelligence is making it possible for kids with special needs to study most comfortably. SpeakIt!, Widex's Evoke, and Empower Me are a few examples of AI in education that cater exclusively to kids with special needs..Providing 24*7 Access to Learning and Study Material.Wouldn't it be wonderful if a student can study anytime he/ she wants to? We aren't talking about studying at home with the books a student owns. Several teachers would have gotten calls from students asking for references or study materials even in the middle of the night. What if students can directly access the online library and download the material? What if students can rely on AI-powered sessions to learn a difficult concept instead of troubling the faculty at odd times?.People need rest, but systems don't. AI strategy consulting for educational institutions provides solutions to these questions by creating a model that is accessible 24*7 by students. In fact, the student's training schedule can be created based on when he/ she is most productive and likely to pay the maximum attention to what's being taught..Increase Student Engagement and Interest.Taking a lead from the previous point, artificial intelligence also provides a solution to make learning interesting. Even the best faculty can have some tough moments when students just don't pay enough attention to the class. It could be the lack of interest in the subject, the teaching approach, or the environment (be it at school or online classes). One teaching program doesn't fit all, and it's time to focus on customizing learning sessions..You can use artificial intelligence to create interactive modules and lessons suited to different types of students. Visualization is a great way to make students understand a concept. Graphs, charts, 3D images, etc., keep kids interested in learning. Interactive training through touchscreens is now fast becoming a part of online education..Reducing Workload for Teachers and Students.One of the major advantages of hiring artificial intelligence consulting services is that the AI-powered systems and processes can reduce the workload for teachers and give them enough space to focus on making education better. We have already discussed how automating administrative tasks can cut down the work of the office staff..The same theory is applied to students as well. Students can create schedules that allow them to work at their own speed. They don't need to feel burdened about completing multiple assignments for the same day. This allows everyone involved to breathe easily and give their best shot. The pressure to learn at the same pace as other students is also eliminated. This gives students more confidence to study even those subjects they are usually terrified of..Helping Teachers Understand Students' Abilities and Limitations.With many students in each class, it can be difficult for teachers to pay attention to individual students and understand the limitations of each one of them. Artificial intelligence solves this problem by creating a model training session for each student. Teachers and students can work together with the help of AI-powered tools to improve the comprehension skills and fine-tune the abilities of each student..When a teacher is in a better position to understand their students, it will create a healthy relationship between both parties and enable effective communication. The teacher can rely on AI to chart the next course program from the students and use it as a basis to plan their lessons..Creating a Virtual Learning Environment.An AI business consultant can create a virtual learning environment where students can clear their doubts by asking the chatbots and virtual assistants instead of contacting the teacher. If a student feels susceptible to get their doubts cleared by the teacher, they can take the assistance of technology. There is no need to feel demotivated or give up on the subject because of these reasons..The topics that students don't understand at school or cannot be properly explained by parents are better handled by artificial intelligence. The same virtual environment can be used to conduct online exams as well..There are already various such test tools for recruitment. The same is implemented in the educational sector as well. AI services can be used to build a secure online examination tool that allows the teachers to create and customize test forms..The students can attempt the tests from their existing locations at any time they choose. These tests are evaluated by the system rather than by the teachers. The teachers can, of course, track the entire process..Increased Security Using Facial Recognition.Security has become a point of concern in many schools, especially in the US. China has started using facial recognition systems to scan the identity of the students and confirm it before allowing them to enter the campus. Instead of the regular student ID cards, the scanners are used to recognize the student and mark their entry, be it at school, library, or the canteen..With CCTV cameras not being enough to provide security at educational institutions, the establishments are working with the leading AI solutions company to revamp and upgrade their security systems and provide a safer work environment for the staff, teachers, and students. Schools across the globe are looking at this development with an eagerness to implement it in their establishments..However, AI in the educational sector is not entirely a rosy picture. Excess use of technology can make students, especially young kids, get addicted to smartphones and computers. This can harm their physical, emotional, and psychological health if parents and teachers are not alert at right times. The increase in cyberbullying is another aspect you need to consider before adopting artificial intelligence in your educational institution..Conclusion.As machine learning algorithms improve and refine themselves to become even more accurate, the education sector will depend more on technology to create a holistic learning environment for students and teachers to interact..While the future of AI in education is still not fully defined, we can be assured that students of abilities and limitations will have better chances of learning and proving themselves. As new AI tools are developed, students can plan their career paths with clarity and work in achieving their goals. Educational institutions can build smarter next generations by investing in artificial intelligence..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

With the arrival of industrial revolution 4.0, businesses of all sizes and types are increasingly capitalizing on advanced, intelligent technologies. They are taking advantage of automation to reduce time-consuming, tedious tasks, especially automating assembly line work. However, as such intelligent technologies are better performing than humans, it is necessary businesses must think of knowledge management for their employees. Knowledge is significantly a crucial aspect in achieving high-quality performance for employees. The field of knowledge management consists of psychology, epistemology, and cognitive science. Gaining information provided by artificial intelligence can play a crucial role in helping business employees make timely decisions..Knowledge grows when used and deflates when kept under lock. That's true! Artificial intelligence provides the mechanisms that enable machines to learn. It allows them to gain, process and utilize knowledge to perform tasks. AI also enables machines to unlock knowledge that can be delivered to humans to improve the decision-making process..Employing Artificial Intelligence in Your Business.Artificial intelligence has a crucial role to play in modern businesses. Every year, a fresh trove of companies emerge implementing AI-driven solutions across business processes. Many executives believe employing AI in their businesses will help both people and machines, and enable them to work together to improve operations. Furthermore, reports indicate that the increasing development and adoption of AI will boost the global GDP by up to 14% by 2030..AI allows people in organizations to make effective business decisions, ensure customer loyalty and avert expensive production downtime. It does so as advanced forms of AI are programmed into insight engines and knowledge management systems. Insight engines emerged recently from the world of search, work with data stored in multiple silos within an organization and connect them together to populate answers in search results..Insight engines work as an intelligent solution that makes information to be found resource-efficient and available to the user in the right context for their respective business case. These systems are equipped with artificial intelligence that helps obtain and glean existing corporate knowledge, excerpt the information, and show correlations between the individual pieces of data to provide a comprehensive overall picture. With the help of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language question answering (NLQA), insight engines can deliver search queries in more innate language and be processed directly. These intelligent solutions assess and interpret structured metadata and text content and use this to accurately determine what the user needs. Most knowledge management systems use these technologies along with the semantic processing of content that enables natural human-machine interaction..Leveraging Knowledge Management.Most companies around the world perceive knowledge management as an IT project. They try to convey information from one place to another. Nonetheless, knowledge management is more about comprehending the resource and getting aware of how to leverage it for business growth. It is like an intellectual asset for the business..In his book, &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot;, Peter Senge, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, points out that learning organizations are always intensifying their knowledge, finding new ways of creating knowledge, moving it seamlessly throughout the organization, and transforming it so that people have insights into what they need to do. This requires a knowledge infrastructure involving numerous components such as databases, internal experts, libraries, research centers, outside information agents, and other knowledge-based sources for filling the knowledge gaps within the organization. There is also a need to measure and manage the value of knowledge so that it fits efficiently within the organization. Many companies have positions like Chief Knowledge Officers or Chief Learning Officers to help drive this process..Above all, the new developments in intelligent systems will enable businesses to make effective use of enterprise search and knowledge management. Employees can use artificial intelligence that allows them to unlock knowledge to improve the decision-making process and generate high ROI..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AI is gradually becoming a part of our daily lives, from fast recommendations on search engines and auto-focus in smartphones to robot waiters at coffee shops and the list goes on. AI has a lot of room for creativity and growth, and it will continue to change the world in a variety of ways in the future..The news media industry has changed dramatically as a result of technological advances. Furthermore, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning has reshaped the ramifications of technology across a wide range of journalism fields. In this area, the growth of the robot reporter and automated journalism has developed rapidly..Automated Journalism.By using computer algorithms to translate raw data into news reports that resemble those written by humans, automated journalism is upending conventional journalism and the position of the news reporter. From satellite communications to the Internet and social media, the media has long been an integral part of technological progress. With the rise of AI and big data, it was only a matter of time before journalism underwent a transformation in terms of production and distribution..Automated journalism raises the bar for media-machine interaction to new heights. It automates every phase of the news production process, from research to final production and distribution. Automated news reports work better with reality stories, in which organized and accurate data can be translated into content that is not only cheaper and faster to generate, but also tailored, to the reader's preferences. It's no surprise that it's seen as a challenge to conventional journalism standards and efficiency, as well as a source of job insecurity in the industry..What effect does it have on the media?.While this may seem to be a grim update in the face of what seems to be a shrinking market, it allows journalists to concentrate on the most critical stories, speeding up the process. The small items, on the other hand, can be easily handled by AI. Furthermore, repetitive and boring work, such as data, can be easily avoided, and it eliminates the possibility of human error, resulting in more reliable and precise reporting. Programs can also strip out fake news, guaranteeing the reports are as accurate as possible, which is critical because readers aren't as willing to fact-check media outlets..There is also a growing demand for robotic journalism to encourage more contact between readers and reporters, which it does by responding to feedback and inquiries for more real time information, as well as handling content to mask insulting comments. Overall, this recent advancement is expected to continue to expand, as it provides the industry with more reliable, up-to-date, and simpler reporting..Artificial intelligence (AI) Tools for the Automated Journalism.Connexun- news api.Users can use Connexun's news API to get real-time multiple languages headlines, posts, and interactive overviews from thousands of reputable online news sources all over the world. It keeps improving intelligent tools that analyse vast datasets of aggregated information using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Its ability to create overviews from aggregated papers automatically can save reporters a lot of time and energy when it comes to describing and creating original material..The New York Times — Editor.According to Medium, BBC'S Juicer technology is not the only semantic discovery tool out there. In 2015 The New York Times implemented its experimental AI project known as Editor. When writing an article, a journalist could use tags to highlight a phrase, headline, or main points of the text. Over time, the computer learns to recognize these semantic tags and learns the most salient parts of an article. By searching through data in real time and extracting information based on requested categories, such as events, people, location and dates Editor can make information more accessible, simplifying the research process and providing fast and accurate fact checking..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AI startup UneeQ have launched Digital Einstein, which is essentially a digital human platform that recreates the theoretical physicist’s personality traits and mannerisms. That’s right this AI-powered chatbot is available to anyone who would like to speak with him, 24 hours a day. It can be used to test an individual’s knowledge on a variety of topics through his daily quiz, or just to hold  a personal conversation about his life’s work and research.





Albert Einstein’s likeness and rights to his research were provided by The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, along with Greenlight, a subsidiary of BEN Group Inc. a global rights clearance / licensing company who works to ensure the physicist’s legacy and research have a lasting impact on society. UneeQ also partnered with several innovative companies including Aflorithmic (Digital Einstein’s voice), Goodbye Kansas Studios (Digital Einstein artist rendering), and WolframAlpha (Digital Einstein’s intellectual responses), to make this project a reality.
