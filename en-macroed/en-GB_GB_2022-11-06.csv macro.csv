The buzz around generative AI today is deafening.

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can generate novel content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data. No topic in the world of technology is attracting more attention and hype right now.


The white-hot epicenter of today’s generative AI craze has been text-to-image AI. Text-to-image AI models generate detailed original images based on simple written inputs. (See here for some examples.) The most well-known of these models include Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E.

It was the sudden emergence of these text-to-image AI models over the summer that catalyzed today’s generative AI frenzy: billion-dollar funding rounds for nascent startups, over-the-top company launch parties, nonstop media coverage, waves of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists hastily rebranding themselves as AI-focused.

PROMOTED
It makes sense that text-to-image AI, more than any other area of artificial intelligence, has so captivated the public’s imagination. Images are aesthetically appealing, easy to consume, fun to share, ideally suited to go viral.
And to be sure, text-to-image AI is incredibly powerful technology. The images that these models can produce are breathtaking in their originality and sophistication. We have explored text-to-image AI’s tremendous potential in previous articles in this column, last month as well as in early 2021. Image-generating AI will transform industries including advertising, gaming and filmmaking.

But make no mistake: current buzz notwithstanding, AI-powered text generation will create many orders of magnitude more value than will AI-powered image generation in the years ahead. Machines’ ability to generate language—to write and speak—will prove to be far more transformative than their ability to generate visual content.

Language is humanity’s single most important invention. More than anything else, it is what sets us apart from every other species on the planet. Language enables us to reason abstractly, to develop complex ideas about what the world is and could be, to communicate these ideas to one another, and to build on them across generations and geographies. Almost nothing about modern civilization would be possible without language.

In the classic 2014 blog post “Always Bet On Text”, Graydon Hoare persuasively articulates the many advantages of text over other data modalities: it is the most flexible communication technology; it is the most durable; it is the cheapest and most efficient; it is the most useful and versatile socially; it can convey ideas with a precisely controlled level of precision and ambiguity; it can be indexed, searched, corrected, summarized, filtered, quoted, translated. In Hoare’s words, “It is not a coincidence that all of literature and poetry, history and philosophy, mathematics, logic, programming and engineering rely on textual encodings for their ideas.”
Every industry, every company, every business transaction in the world relies on language. Without language, society and the economy would grind to a halt.
The ability to automate language thus offers entirely unprecedented opportunities for value creation. Compared to text-to-image AI, whose impacts will be felt most keenly in select industries, AI-generated language will transform the way that every company in every sector in the world works.
To illustrate the depth and breadth of the coming transformation, let’s walk through some example applications.

From Sales to Science
The first true “killer application” for generative text, in terms of commercial adoption, has proven to be copywriting: that is, AI-generated website copy, social media posts, blog posts and other marketing-related written content.
AI-powered copywriting has seen stunning revenue growth over the past year. Jasper, one of the leading startups in this category, launched a mere 18 months ago and will reportedly do $75 million in revenue this year, making it one of the fastest-growing software startups ever. Jasper just announced a $125 million fundraise valuing the company at $1.5 billion. Unsurprisingly, a raft of competitors has emerged to chase this market.
But copywriting is just the beginning.
Many pieces of the broader marketing and sales stack are ripe to be automated with large language models (LLMs). Expect to see generative AI products that will, for instance: automate outbound emails from sales development representatives (SDRs); accurately answer questions from interested buyers about the product; handle email correspondence with prospective customers as they move through the sales funnel; provide real-time coaching and feedback to human sales agents on calls; summarize sales discussions and suggest next steps; and more. As more of the sales process is automated, human representatives will be freed up to focus on the uniquely human aspects of selling, like customer empathy and relationship building.
In the world of law, generative AI will largely automate contract drafting. Much of the back-and-forth between legal teams on deal documents will come to be carried out by LLM-powered software tools that understand each client’s particular priorities and preferences and automatically hash out the language in transaction documents accordingly. Post-signing, generative AI tools will greatly simplify contract management for companies of all sizes.
Language models’ powerful ability to summarize and answer questions about text documents will likewise transform legal research, discovery and various other parts of the litigation process.
In healthcare, generative language models will help clinicians compose medical notes. They will summarize electronic health records and answer questions about a patient’s medical history. They will help automate time-intensive administrative processes like revenue cycle management, insurance claims processing and prior authorizations. Before long, they will be able to propose diagnoses and treatment regimes for individual patients by combining an in-depth understanding of the existing research literature with a given patient’s particular biomarkers and symptoms.
Generative AI will transform the world of customer service and call centers, across industries: from hospitality to ecommerce, from healthcare to financial services. The same goes for internal IT and HR helpdesks.
Language models can already automate much of the work that happens before, during and after customer service conversations, including in-call agent coaching and after-call documentation and summarization. Soon, paired with generative text-to-speech technology, they will be able to handle most customer service engagements end-to-end, with no human needed—not in the stilted, brittle, rules-based way that automated call centers have worked for years, but in fluid natural language that is effectively indistinguishable from a human agent.
To put it simply: nearly all of the interactions that you as a consumer will need to have with a brand or company, on any topic, can and will be automated.
The way that we handle structured data—a foundational business activity at the heart of most organizations—will be transformed by generative language models. Recent research out of Stanford shows that language models are remarkably effective at completing various data cleaning and integration tasks—e.g., entity matching, error detection, data imputation—even though they weren’t trained for these activities. A fun demo recently posted on Twitter hints at the ways that generative AI will transform how we work with programs like Microsoft Excel.
News reporting and journalism will become highly automated. While human investigative journalists will continue to chase down stories, the production of the articles themselves will increasingly be handed over to generative AI models. Before long, the majority of the online content that we consume in our daily lives will be AI-generated.
In government, lawmakers will rely on LLMs to help draft legislation. Regulators will employ them to help translate laws into detailed regulations and codes. Bureaucrats from the federal to the municipal level will use them to help streamline the many functions of the administrative state, from processing permitting applications to handing out petty fines.
In academia, generative language models will be used to draft grant proposals, to synthesize and interrogate the existing body of literature, and—yes—to write research papers (both by students and professors). A scandal involving students using generative language tools to write their school essays for them is no doubt just around the corner.
The process of scientific discovery itself will be accelerated by generative language models. LLMs will be able to digest the entire corpus of published research and knowledge in a given field, assimilate key underlying concepts and relationships, and propose solutions and promising future research directions.
This is not a speculative future possibility; it has already been done. A group of researchers from UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory recently showed that large language models can capture latent knowledge from the existing literature on materials science and then propose new materials to investigate.
It is worth quoting directly from their paper, which was published in Nature: “Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings without human supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure-property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery.”

Beyond Natural Language
One of the most promising commercial applications of generative language models does not involve natural language at all: LLMs promise to revolutionize the creation of software.
Whether it’s Python, Ruby or Java, software programming happens via languages. As with natural languages like English or Swahili, programming languages are symbolically represented, with their own internally consistent syntax and semantics. It therefore makes sense that the same powerful new AI methods that can gain incredible fluency with natural language can likewise learn programming languages.
Today’s world runs on software. The size of the global software market today is estimated at half a trillion dollars. Software has become the lifeblood of the modern economy. The ability to automate its production therefore represents a staggeringly large opportunity.
The first mover and 800-pound gorilla in this category is Microsoft. Together with its subsidiary GitHub and its close partner OpenAI, Microsoft launched an AI coding companion product named Copilot earlier this year. Copilot is powered by Codex, a large language model from OpenAI (which in turn is based on GPT-3).
Soon thereafter, Amazon launched its own AI pair programming tool named CodeWhisperer. Google has likewise developed a similar tool, though the company only uses it internally and does not offer it publicly.
These products are only a few months old, but it is already becoming evident how transformative they will be.
In a recent study, Google found that employees who used its AI code completion tool saw a 6% reduction in coding time compared to those not using the tool, with 3% of those employees’ code being written by the AI.
Recent data from GitHub is even more remarkable: the company found in a recent experiment that using Copilot can reduce the time required for a software engineer to complete a coding task by 55%. According to GitHub’s CEO, up to 40% of the code written at the company is now being produced by AI.
Now imagine scaling these productivity gains across all of Google, all of Microsoft—all of today’s software industry. Untold billions of dollars of value creation are up for grabs.
Is Microsoft’s Copilot destined to own this market? Not necessarily.
For one thing, many organizations will not feel comfortable exposing their full internal codebases to a big tech player like Microsoft in the cloud, and will prefer to work with a neutral startup that deploys its solution on-premise. This will be particularly true in highly regulated industries like financial services and healthcare.
In addition, Copilot faces an interesting organizational challenge: the product is jointly built and maintained by Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI. These are three different organizations with different teams, cultures and cadences. This space is moving at breakneck speed right now; rapid product iterations and short development cycles will be essential as the technology and market evolve. The Microsoft/GitHub/OpenAI triad may struggle with coordination and agility as they seek to compete with more nimble startups in this category.
Most importantly, software development is an enormous, sprawling field. The market for AI-generated software will not be winner-take-all. Just as there is a deep, diverse ecosystem of tools for different parts of today’s software engineering stack, a number of different winners will emerge in the world of AI code generation.
For instance, successful startups might be built that focus solely on automating code maintenance, or code review, or documentation, or front-end development. A wave of promising new startups has already emerged to pursue these opportunities.

Zooming Out
Having walked through a wide range of possible commercial applications for generative language models, three big-picture points are worth making.
First, some readers, especially those who have not spent much time working first-hand with today’s language models, may be asking themselves: are the use cases described here actually plausible? Will generative language models really be able to effectively and reliably draw up a contract, or email back and forth with a sales prospect, or draft a piece of legislation—not just in a highly controlled demo or research setting, but when faced with all of the messiness of the real world?
The answer is yes.
We have delved into the technology breakthroughs underpinning today’s language AI revolution in detail in previous articles. But one important factor is worth mentioning here: the vast majority of content that humans produce—messages we write, ideas we articulate, proposals we put forth—is unoriginal.
This may sound harsh. But the fact is that most website copy, most email exchanges, most customer service conversations, even most laws contain little true novelty. The exact words vary, but the underlying structure, semantics and concepts are predictable and consistent, echoing language that has been written or spoken a million times before.
Today’s AI has become powerful enough to learn these underlying structures, semantics and concepts from the vast corpora of existing text on which it has been trained—and to convincingly replicate them with new output when prompted.
Our current state-of-the-art language models could not produce writing with the disruptive originality of, say, Friedrich Nietzsche, whose unprecedented ideas reframed centuries of prior thought. But how much of the content that humans generate on a day-to-day basis—in any of the use cases described above, or in any other setting—falls into that category?
We will find that LLMs are effective at automating a surprisingly large amount of humanity’s language production—those parts that are essentially unoriginal.
The second big-picture point: one important reason why generative language models will become so powerful is that any output from a language model can in turn serve as the input to a language model. This is because language models’ input and output modalities are the same: text in, text out. This is a key difference between language models and text-to-image models. This may sound like an arcane detail, but it has profound implications for generative AI.
Why does this matter? Because it enables what has come to be known as “prompt chaining.”
Even though large language models are incredibly capable, many tasks that we will want them to complete are too complex to be carried out by a single run of the model—i.e., tasks that require intermediate actions or multi-step reasoning. Prompt chaining enables users to break one broad goal into various simpler subtasks that the language model can tackle in succession, with the output of one subtask serving as the input of the next.
Clever prompt chaining enables LLMs to carry out far more sophisticated activities than would otherwise be possible. Prompt chaining also enables models to retrieve information from external tools (e.g., searching Google, pulling information from a given URL), by incorporating this action as one of the steps in the chain.
An illustrative example of prompt chaining comes from Dust, a new startup building tools to help people work with generative language models. Dust built a web search assistant that can answer a user’s question (e.g., “Why was the Suez Canal blocked in March 2021?”) by searching Google, taking the top 3 results, pulling the content from those sites, summarizing it, and then synthesizing a final answer that includes citations.
Another fun prompt chaining example: an app that, when provided with the URL of a research paper, automatically generates a Twitter thread summarizing the paper’s main points.
Prompt chaining will make the creation of LLM-powered applications more composable, extensible and interpretable. It will enable the creation of complex software programs with generalized capabilities. There is no equivalent to this recursive richness in text-to-image AI.
This brings us to our third and final point: one of the most important considerations in productizing and operationalizing LLMs will be how and when to have a human in the loop.
At least initially, most generative language applications will not be deployed in a fully automated way. Some level of human oversight of their outputs will continue to be prudent or necessary. What exactly this looks like will vary considerably depending on the application.
In the near term, the most natural mode of engagement for human users of LLM applications will be iterative and collaborative: that is, the end user will be the human in the loop. The human user will, say, present the model with an initial prompt (or prompt chain) to generate a given output; review the output and then tweak the prompt to improve the quality of the output; run the model many times on the same prompt in order to select the most relevant versions of the model’s output; and then manually refine this output before deploying the language for its intended use.
This type of workflow will be effective for many of the example applications discussed above: drafting contracts, writing news articles, composing academic grant proposals. If the AI system can produce a draft that is 50%, or 75%, or 90% complete out of the box, that translates to massive time savings and value creation.
For some lower-stakes use cases—say, writing outbound sales emails or website copy—the technology will soon be advanced and robust enough that users motivated by the potential productivity gains will feel comfortable automating the application end-to-end, with no human in the loop at all.
At the other end of the spectrum, some safety-critical use cases—say, using generative models to diagnose and propose treatments for individual patients—will for the foreseeable future require a human in the loop to review and approve the models’ output before any real action is taken.
But make no mistake: generative language technology is improving fast—almost unbelievably fast. Within months, expect industry leaders like OpenAI and Cohere to release new models that represent dramatic, step-change improvements in language capabilities compared to today’s models (which themselves are already breathtakingly powerful).
Over the longer term, the trend will be decisive and inevitable: as these models get better, and as the products built on top of them become easier to use and more deeply embedded in existing workflows, we will hand over more responsibility for more of society’s day-to-day functions to AI, with little or no human oversight. More and more of the use cases described above will be carried out end-to-end, in a closed-loop manner, by language models that we have empowered to decide and act.
This may sound startling, even terrifying, to readers today. But we will increasingly acclimate to the reality that machines can carry out many of these functions more effectively, more quickly, more affordably and more reliably than humans could.
Massive disruption, vast value creation, painful job dislocation and many new multi-billion-dollar AI-first companies are around the corner.

We can't manage what we don't measure, goes the old business adage. This rings true more than ever today as the world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, pollution, and waste.
More climate data is available than ever before, but how that data is accessed, interpreted and acted on is crucial to managing these crises. One technology that is central to this is Artificial Intelligence (AI).
So, what exactly does AI mean?
""AI refers to systems or machines that perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, and can iteratively improve themselves over time, based on the information they collect,"" says David Jensen, coordinator of the United Nations Environment Program's (UNEP's) Digital Transformation sub-programme.
Jensen highlights several areas where AI can play a role in tackling environmental challenges, from designing more energy-efficient buildings to monitoring deforestation to optimizing renewable energy deployment.
""This can be on a large scale – such as satellite monitoring of global emissions, or a more granular scale – such as a smart house automatically turning off lights or heat after a certain time,"" he adds.
Informing real-time analysis

UNEP's World Environment Situation Room (WESR), launched in 2022, is one digital platform that is leveraging AI's capabilities to analyze complex, multifaceted datasets.
Supported by a consortium of partners, WESR curates, aggregates and visualizes the best available earth observation and sensor data to inform near real-time analysis and future predictions on multiple factors, including CO2 atmospheric concentration, changes in glacier mass and sea level rise.
""WESR is being developed to become a user-friendly, demand-driven platform that leverages data into government offices, classrooms, Mayor's offices, and boardrooms,” says Jensen. “We need credible, trustworthy and independent data to inform decisions and drive transparency – WESR provides this,” he adds.
“Over time, the goal is for WESR to become like a mission control centre for planet earth, where all of our vital environmental indicators can be seamlessly monitored to drive actions.”
Monitoring methane emissions

One of the UNEP-led initiatives inside the WESR digital ecosystem is the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), which leverages AI to revolutionize the approach to monitoring and mitigating methane emissions.
The platform operates as a global public database of empirically verified methane emissions. It leverages AI to strategically interconnect this data with action on science, transparency, and policy to inform data-driven decisions.
“IMEO’s technology allows us to collect and integrate diverse methane emissions data streams to establish a global public record of empirically verified methane emissions at an unprecedented level of accuracy and granularity,” Jensen says.
“Reducing the energy sector’s methane emissions is one of the quickest, most feasible, and cost-effective ways to limit the impacts of climate warming, and reliable data-driven action will play a big role in achieving these reductions,” he adds.

Tracking air quality 
Another environmental monitoring initiative that UNEP has co-founded, in partnership with IQAir, is the GEMS Air Pollution Monitoring platform. It is the largest global air quality information network in the world. IQAir aggregates data from over 25,000 air quality monitoring stations in more than 140 countries and leverages AI to offer insights on the impact of real-time air quality on populations and help inform health protection measures.
“These platforms allow both the private and public sector to harness data and digital technologies in order to accelerate global environmental action and fundamentally disrupt business as usual,” Jensen says. “Ultimately, they can contribute to systemic change at an unprecedented speed and scale,” he adds.
Measuring environmental footprints 
Other areas where AI can make a difference is calculating the environmental and climate footprints of product. “AI will be fundamental in this area,” Jensen says.
“It can help calculate the footprint of products across their full lifecycles and supply chains and enable businesses and consumers to make the most informed and effective decisions. This kind of data is essential for sustainable digital nudging on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com. Shopify or Alibaba.”
Reducing ICT emissions
While data and AI are necessary for enhanced environmental monitoring, there is an environmental cost to processing this data that we must also take into account, says Jensen.
“The ICT sector generates about 3-4 per cent of emissions and data centres use large volumes of water for cooling. Efforts are underway to reduce this footprint –including through the CODES Action Plan for a Sustainable Planet in the Digital Age – one of the spin-off initiatives from the UN Secretary General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation.
But e-waste is a major concern as only 17.4 per cent currently recycled and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. According to the UN Global E-waste Monitor report, E-waste will grow to almost 75 million metric tonnes by 2030.
UNEP research shows that to target this waste, consumers should reduce consumption, recycle electronic goods and repair those that can be fixed.

UNEP is at the front in support of the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the global temperature rise well below 2°C and aiming - to be safe - for 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To do this, UNEP has developed a Six-Sector Solution roadmap to reducing emissions across sectors in line with the Paris Agreement commitments and in pursuit of climate stability. The six sectors are Energy; Industry; Agriculture and Food; Forests and Land Use; Transport, and Buildings and Cities. The UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) in November 2022 will focus on adaptation, finance and a just transition – and you can do your part by acting now on your own consumption or speaking up to voice your concerns.

                                                09 November 2022
                                            







In a Journal of the Royal Society Interface paper, artificial intelligence methods are used to analyse fossil tracks. The work sheds light on why this approach outperforms conventional methods.


A recent Journal of the Royal Society Interface paper examines how deep convolutional neural networks, a form of artificial intelligence, can help researchers analyse dinosaur tracks. We spoke to one of the authors, Dr Jens Lallensack, to find out more. Please can you introduce your research and tell us what it’s about?We tested if artificial intelligence, more specifically deep convolutional neural networks, can solve longstanding problems in the analysis of fossil tracks. We focused on a particularly difficult problem: the discrimination between three-toed tracks from the plant-eating ornithischians from those of the meat-eating theropods. On an independent test set, our neural network outperformed human experts by a wide margin. We then used our neural network to classify some controversial cases, including the trackway of a large dinosaur in Queensland, Australia, that is thought to have triggered a stampede of smaller dinosaurs. It is the first application of artificial intelligence methods to fossil tracks.How does deep convolutional neural network analysis work?Such artificial neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain. They learn from a larger number of examples – in our case, 1372 track outlines of known category – either ""theropod"" or ""ornithischian"". Based on these training examples, the neural network will attempt to determine features, or combinations of features, that are helpful for distinguishing the categories. It therefore figures out everything by itself, and could possibly find ways to distinguish these categories that humans haven't thought about yet.Why does this approach outperform more traditional methods of fossil track analysis?It is a much more flexible approach. Traditional methods are based on linear measurements (e.g., track length), angular measurements (e.g., angles between toes), or landmarks (e.g., coordinates of the toe tips). However, these measurements can only capture parts of the complex shape information. More importantly, measurements need to be consistent in all tracks that are to be analysed. However, the shape of a track may change drastically from one step to the next, and different species may show different features in their tracks. A neural network is able to model all of this complexity. Given that traditional methods had such limitations, the study of tracks remained a largely qualitative discipline, relying in large parts on human intuition. We now show that neural networks may outperform such human intuition.What do you think the future potential of this approach is for palaeontology?We believe that deep convolutional neural networks are the most promising technique that may significantly advance our field in the near future. A track is the result of multiple factors, including the anatomy of the foot, the consistency of the substrate, the movements of the animal that made the track, and alteration of the track that occurred after it was formed. This makes interpreting fossil tracks so difficult. To go further, we need powerful quantitative methods rather than human intuition, and neural networks may be a real game changer.For more research that applies innovative techniques to complex questions, check out Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Image caption: Theropod (meat-eating) dinosaur track from Münchehagen, Germany.

Meet PatentPal, the Generative AI Startup For Patent Applications

Generative AI

Generative AI is an approach that is going to grow and grow in the legal tech sector, and PatentPal is part of this new breed of startups based on transformer technology. In this case it is able to automatically generate key elements of a patent application.
Artificial Lawyer spoke to the company’s San Francisco-based founder, Jack Xu, who was an IP lawyer, about the startup and recorded an AL TV Product Walk Through (see below) showing how it all works.
Put simply, it works by using a GPT-3 style transformer approach (see Wikipedia for more info), but with its own separate library of ‘source material’ related to patents, which it then draws upon to generate aspects of an application. You ‘drop your [invention] document into the browser to input your claims, this then produces:
– Flowcharts for methods
– Block diagrams for systems and devices
– Detailed descriptions of generated figures
– Abstract and summary to support all claims.’
The benefit here is clearly all about efficiency, something that matters especially in the patent filing world. As Xu explained, a lot of this type of work is on a fixed fee, not the hourly rate, and so efficiency is instantly helpful.
So, here is a short AL TV video that shows the system at work, plus some questions from this site, which was very interested to learn more. Press the ‘Play’ button to watch inside the page. Enjoy!


AL TV Productions, Nov 2022.
And here is an extended interview with Xu.
What is Generative AI and how does PatentPal use it?
Generative AI is a machine learning model that has been trained to generate useful content. This can be images, text, or, in our case, legal writing. PatentPal’s generative AI is a proven product that is currently in use by professionals in drafting patent applications to be filed and prosecuted with the USPTO. The first PatentPal patent was issued two months ago. You can read more about it here. 
How does PatentPal work then?
To address the problems described above, we need an approach that gives the user a lot more control over the underlying language model when they are trying to describe a new invention in a patent application. For PatentPal, the interface between our machine learning model and the domain expertise of a patent attorney is the knowledge graph.
We extract this knowledge graph from a set of claims written by the attorney. We do this by using transformers (similar to GPT-3) to extract concepts and relationships from the attorney’s claims at an unprecedented accuracy. Based on this knowledge graph understanding of the invention, we can then generate new language that’s required in a patent application.
Where are you today as a company?
As described above, PatentPal is currently in use by patent attorneys in drafting and prosecuting patent applications. Since launching the product at the beginning of the year, we have a core group of power users who use the tool on every application they write. Many of these users have also already committed to resubscribing for the following year.
And here is one example of a happy patent lawyer customer. ‘PatentPal has saved me an enormous amount of drafting time. I used to transcribe claims into specification language manually, which was a significant endeavour. The tool does all of this for me, freeing me to revise and add additional details. My applications have become more robust even with less time spent on them. I don’t know how I could run my practice without PatentPal. I would never sleep!’ said Ryan Schneer of Schneer IP.
–
So, there you go. As noted, this is not about just using GPT-3, but rather taking that same approach and applying it through other custom-built ‘libraries’ to create useful tools for lawyers that can quickly create documents, or parts of documents.
It’s an area that will grow much further. As techniques develop and new custom libraries fill out, the outputs will also become better and better – although in this case they appear to already be at a level that lawyers can rely upon. 
Patents is just one area that has now been shown to work for generative AI in the legal sector. More use cases are out there and no doubt more will follow. Exciting times!

As a result, AI writing is becoming increasingly commonplace, with businesses and organisations using it to create everything from marketing copy to financial reports. While AI writing is still in its early stages and far from perfect, it's clear that it poses a threat to the livelihood of professional writers. After all, if a machine can produce text that is indistinguishable from that of a human writer, why would anyone need to hire a real person to do the job? It's not just low-skilled jobs like content writing that are at risk of being automated by AI. Even highly skilled jobs like journalism and novel-writing could eventually be replaced by machines. In fact, one Japanese company has already developed an AI system that can write novels better than humans. Of course, it will be some time before AI writing becomes good enough to completely replace human writers across all genres and formats. But as the technology continues to improve, the day when machines can do our jobs better than we can is fast approaching. The end for human writers? The four paragraphs above were generated by OpenAI’s deep-learning AI writing model, called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). Indistinguishable from the words of a human writer, the programme can respond to any prompt entered by a user, and amongst many other forms of writing it can construct a short story, hold a conversation, or write a news piece. This begs the question: is this the end for human writers? According to Professor Mike Sharples, who has decades of experience in researching writing and AI, the answer is “not yet”. “You can either take a sort of apocalyptic view of, AI is going to put professional writers out of a job, it's all doom and gloom and AI is going to take over,” he told Euronews Next. “Or you can take the glass-half-full approach, which is that there are some amazing tools that are coming and as writers we can make good use of them and as teachers, we can make good use of them”. Sharples, a professor of Educational Technology at the Open University in the UK, has  written extensively  on AI writing and its development, and he sees attempts to resist it - whether in professional writing, business, or academia - as futile. Luckily for journalists or others who write on topical issues, the way the AI systems are trained means they are not fully up to speed with the latest developments going on in the world. Even so, while writers don’t need to panic just yet, he does say they “should be worried”. AI writing is being increasingly used for churning out content on the web, especially for the likes of marketing or blog posts as companies compete for SEO supremacy. Freelance gig work sites like UpWork are seeing more and more job posts looking for writers to specifically use AI writing tools such as Jasper in order to generate content more quickly. “You could either see this as a huge boon, a huge tool to help you write more quickly to get your words out, to get published. Or you could see it as a threat because anyone else could be doing that,” said Sharples. Standard plagiarism detection methods don’t work Social media sites like Reddit are awash with users telling their stories of using AI writing tools to successfully get good marks at school or university, or asking for advice on which are the best tools to use to avoid being found out. One user, who said they were a university biochemistry student, told Vice’s Motherboard: “For biology, we would learn about biotech and write five good and bad things about biotech. I would send a prompt to the AI like, ‘what are five good and bad things about biotech?’ and it would generate an answer that would get me an A”. Work that would have taken them two hours now only took 20 minutes. The problem for those setting and assessing academic writing tasks, is that even the most up-to-date plagiarism checkers cannot keep up. According to Sharples, attempting to do so would be “a futile computational arms race”. “The AI isn't just copying bits from the web, it's genuinely creating new text,” he says. “It's inventing new ways of expressing. So the standard methods are not going to detect it”. It is not infallible. Sharples used AI to write some essays, which on the surface looked entirely plausible, and wouldn’t be picked up by a plagiarism check. However, there were some flaws. The AI knew to include references like any good academic essay, but on closer inspection it turned out some of the references were made up. Other citations the AI included were actually taken from studies that had argued the exact opposite of the point the AI was making. The other more obvious way assessors could detect if students are using AI writing tools, he added, is if the quality of their writing suddenly improved. Instead of trying to fight it, Sharples believes that just as professional writers need to accept AI writing is here to stay, educational institutions need to do the same. He argues that educators and policymakers need to rethink how to assess students, and that AI systems could help students to learn to be better writers. They can for example be used to quickly show students different ways to express an idea, or as a creativity exercise, where students could write a story in tandem with an AI tool. How does AI writing work? Sharples describes the AI writing model used by OpenAI as a “highly souped-up text completer”. Just as your phone does if it has predictive text turned on, AI writing models look at what has been written before and predict what comes next. But while a phone’s predictive text looks at the last few characters typed, OpenAI’s model can look back at around the last 700 words, and generate hundreds of words of suggested text. And what it writes makes sense, because it has been trained on almost all of the written text available on the Internet. It knows the context it is writing in, and so is usually indistinguishable from text written by a human, “It's been trained on Wikipedia. It's been trained on blog articles. It's been trained on e-books, online books, and the world's literature. So it uses that vast database,” said Sharples, explaining it creates an internal “mental store” of how the language is processed. And it is not just mindlessly regurgitating text either - it can come up with new ideas. “This is what still even the developers of these systems don't quite understand - that it's not just parroting text,” he said. “It's not just taking previous words and reusing them, but it's creating an internal representation, not just at the surface text, but of the ideas and the concepts behind it”. “It's creating this neural network, this multilayered network. And we know that some of those layers are about the words, the style, but some other layers are about how the text is structured and about the content, the underlying ideas”. This all has major implications for more complex, time-consuming writing endeavours, such as writing books. One recent post  on OpenAI’s community forum details a member’s use of GPT-3 to write an entire 38,000-word book about proverbs, platitudes, and truisms. “I used GPT-3 to generate many lists of proverbs and quotations from around the world and then used it again to write a brief description for each one,” user daveshapautomator wrote. “This book has over 600 proverbs and quotations. I sent it out to a friend for beta reading, and will format it for printing while working on proofreading with Grammarly. All in all, it should take only a few weeks to go from first draft to printed”. The future of AI writing The flourishing of AI writing tools has happened alongside the release of a number of other AI creation tools. Facebook parent company Meta recently unveiled an AI tool that creates GIF-like videos from text prompts. Another of OpenAI’s tools which anyone can access, DALL-E 2, creates still images from text prompts. Sharples, the professor, sees the future of AI content creation going multimedia, with more sophisticated options for creating text, images and videos as a package. He also expects further refinement of pure AI writing, with the “pre-training” of the AI systems including more recent content, making them capable of writing about more topical items. Furthermore, he believes they will begin to blend with models of how the world actually works, so the writing becomes even “more coherent and more plausible”. And soon, he predicts, we will begin to see sophisticated AI writing assistants in our day-to-day word processors. He cites Microsoft as an investor in OpenAI: “So Microsoft is going to want to get its investment back by integrating these into Microsoft Word and into other tools. So you're just going to see them used routinely, and it's just going to be part of the writer's repertoire”.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important emerging technologies today. It has the potential to revolutionize many industries and sectors, including health care, transportation, manufacturing, and more. However, many people say AI also poses some risks, such as job displacement and privacy concerns. These concerns are exaggerated.
Congress and policy makers need to pay more attention to AI in order to ensure that its benefits are maximized and its risks are minimized. Some specific policy areas that should be addressed include taking a hands-off approach to AI regulation, encouraging its development through permissive policies like regulatory sandboxes.
The overwhelming majority of studies show that there will be few if any significant job losses due to advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, many jobs will be created as machines learn how to do things faster than people can.
Privacy concerns about the use of AI have been overblown too; currently available technology does not allow for true “smart” surveillance or infinite tracking of individuals’ activities without their knowledge or consent. Furthermore, current data protection laws would likely prevent large-scale invasions of privacy by companies using powerful AI algorithms for marketing purposes or other commercial reasons. …
We need to pay more attention to AI because it is improving rapidly and has the potential to enhance human intelligence
Despite concerns about the potential for AI to displace human workers, there is evidence that AI can actually enhance human productivity and create new job opportunities. For example, AI has the potential to help us solve complex problems and make better decisions by providing us with more data and insights. Additionally, as AI gets smarter, it will become increasingly important to ensure that its goals remain aligned with our own values and ethical principles.
AI has the potential to help us automate repetitive tasks and improve accuracy in areas such as medicine and finance. As a result of these improvements, we may see an increase in jobs that are currently performed by humans being automated.
The potential for AI to enhance human intelligence was demonstrated in a study published in December of last year which found that computers outperformed some of the world’s best students on a task involving logical reasoning. This suggests that artificial intelligence has the ability to improve upon human cognitive abilities even further in the future.
We need to pay more attention to AI because it is improving rapidly; this means that we have the opportunity to harness its capabilities before they reach their full potential and potentially outpace our own abilities as humans.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of intelligent machines that can think and work like humans. AI technologies are being used in a variety of fields, including health care, finance, manufacturing, transportation, and more. AI has the potential to revolutionize our economy and society, but while there are risks associated with its development and deployment these are often exaggerated. There are several different forms of intelligence. For example, spatial intelligence and linguistic intelligence. AI can specialize in these different forms. It is generally not a human-like general intelligence. So AI can help people enhance their intelligence by helping them to learn faster, remember more information, or do better on tasks that require focus or concentration.
How AI is improving rapidly
We need to pay more attention to AI because it is improving rapidly. Artificial intelligence is already being used in many different areas, including health care, finance, and transportation. It has the potential to improve our lives in a number of ways, including making us healthier and more efficient. However, there are concerns that AI may be developed inappropriately or without consideration for its potential impact on society as a whole. These concerns are based on a misunderstanding of how AI is developing. In fact, responsible and ethical development of AI is becoming increasingly important as its capabilities continue to grow.
AI is improving at an unprecedented rate, becoming faster, more accurate, and more capable every day. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives—from communication and interaction to work and living.
AI is being used more and more in industry and government. Its benefits are clear: It can speed up processes, improve accuracy, and save time and money.
The potential for AI to improve our lives is immense—from making our interactions with others easier to managing complex tasks efficiently.
However, there are also risks associated with this rapid development; lawmakers need to be aware of these so that they can make informed decisions about how best to proceed.
While heavy-handed regulation could stunt AI’s development, Congress should take a proactive stance in order not reduce the benefits it offers society as a whole.
We must ensure that we capitalize on the incredible opportunities that artificial intelligence presents while mitigating its risks.
This post was (mostly) AI-generated
If you’ve gotten this far, you may have felt that this post was slightly different in style from my previous posts. That’s because this post was mostly generated from a list of key phrases I entered into the AI writing tool Moonbeam.
I did have to alter it, though. It kept insisting that I worry more about the risks of AI and suggested regulation and federal funding as solutions. Either it was trying to warn me about impending SKYNET, or (more likely) as of yet this writing AI rejects heterodox opinions and prefers to parrot received wisdom about policy issues. However, when I edited the (AI-generated) outline to concentrate on the benefits, it included the references above to research that demonstrates those benefits.
Now if only I could get it to include hyperlinks. …

Comments Off on Meet Spellbook the GPT-3 Generative AI Word Add-In For Contracts






In another example of the use of generative AI approaches in the legal sector, Toronto-based Rally has launched a GPT-3 based add-in for Word called Spellbook, which is designed to help lawyers with legal drafting.
Spellbook’s use of OpenAI’s GPT-3 large language model, an AI trained on 45 terabytes of data from books and the internet, is further ‘tuned’ on legal datasets for ‘optimal contracting performance’, they explained.
It can handle the following tasks:
‘Language Suggestion: Spellbook can draft new clauses and sections, taking the full context of the contract into account.Negotiation Suggestions: Spellbook can list common points for negotiation based on the contractTerm Summaries: Spellbook can instantly create short term summaries for any common contract.’
Artificial Lawyer was understandably curious to know some more, especially after recently highlighting the work by PatentPal, which uses a non-GPT-3 generative AI model.
This site asked Scott Stevenson, CEO of Rally – which provides its core legal management platform to 110 law firms – about how they are leveraging this technology.
When did this start and what is Rally? 
Rally is five years old, we’re a legal automation platform targeted at businesses and their law firms. Spellbook is our new GPT-3 based drafting and review tool that we officially launched on September 1st this year.
How do you get the right text examples into the GPT-3 system so that they can be drawn upon? 
We have a proprietary set of documents, built using open-source documents, our own legal team, and our own templating technology which allows us to create many variations. We use these for fine-tuning, few-shot examples and prompt engineering – which helps Spellbook perform significantly better than raw GPT-3 at legal tasks.
Since GPT-3 is trained on much of the internet, including public databases like EDGAR (as well as non-fiction books and Wikipedia), it has had exposure to many contracts and has a sort of ‘general knowledge’ about them. We are able to constrain outputs to the contracting domain.
But, isn’t GPT-3 just a very random collection of texts? How can a lawyer rely upon its output? 
GPT-3 has consumed a wide variety of texts, just like a well-read lawyer! This actually helps give it general knowledge (e.g. when reviewing an employment contract, it has knowledge of salaries in different jurisdictions from websites like Glassdoor.com).
We’ve been very effective at constraining outputs to the legal domain. GPT-3 has digested tonnes of legalese. That said, we don’t think lawyers should trust Spellbook. It is more like a muse that gives marble to carve where you didn’t have any. It’s also a ‘Second set of eyes’ for detecting missing provisions, missing definitions, unusual language, etc.
Do you use playbooks for the new text? 
Currently, no, but this is a highly requested feature that is on our roadmap.
And, what happens to the documents? How can you control privacy if the document is going to a 3rd party, e.g. OpenAI? 
Privacy is deeply important to us, in our core product and especially in Spellbook:
Data is encrypted for its whole journeyWe do not store any document data at SpellbookData is sent to OpenAI’s GPT-3 servers for processing – there is no way around some kind of 3rd party data processing for using this kind of technology – these models are too massive to run on your own computer.Data is not accessible to any 3rd parties outside of OpenAIWe opted out of OpenAI’s programme to use data to train their model further, so it will not be used for that purposeOpenAI may retain encrypted data for up to 30 days:This data is encrypted and is only accessible to authorised engineers for (1) debugging purposes in the event of a failure, (2) investigating patterns of abuse and misuse or (3) improving the content filtering system through using the prompts and completions flagged for abuse or misuse.
Overall, OpenAI is a secure, reputable company with many high-profile customers like Microsoft. Cloud-computing is the norm now–if a lawyer is using tools like Office365 or the latest version of Word, they are also sending documents to a 3rd party, and storing the data there much longer.
Thanks Scott, very interesting work!
So, there you go. This site has not seen a detailed demo yet, but this looks promising albeit the privacy aspect of working with OpenAI is still something of a conundrum. But, Rally believes they have sufficient safeguards in place. (There is however a short promotional video provided by Rally that you can check out below.)


A Rally Production, 2022.
More broadly, the approach of using generative AI to tap a corpus of texts that relate to what you are writing makes total sense. 
Of course, there is much more finessing to come – there always is. No doubt more companies will come to market with different approaches and the techniques will be refined, just as NLP doc review has evolved over the last decade in the legal field. The first NLP ‘doc AI’ companies in the early 2010s had a lot of development ahead of them before they reached the levels of proficiency they have now – but they got there.
To conclude, kudos to Rally for experimenting and exploring, that’s what legal innovation is all about.

Mark Rylance is the very definition of a multifaceted actor, able to jump readily from theater to film to television without either breaking a sweat or blinking an eye, having worked with Steven Spielberg on several occasions, including his Oscar-winning work in Bridge of Spies and his box office smash Ready Player One. One area of acting that he’s rarely ventured into, however, is that of the audio drama.
That changed recently with the assistance of Trudie Styler, who provided Rylance with a starring role in the new dramatic podcast series Spark Hunter, in which he plays a genius in artificial intelligence whose finds himself face to face with his most advanced creation (voiced by Rebecca Ferguson), an A.I. which is… Well, let’s just say it’s suffering through some growing pains. 
Decider had the opportunity to chat with Rylance about this new dramatic endeavor, but he was also kind enough to tackle a few topics from elsewhere in his catalog, including the first time he didn’t work with Spielberg, making Bob Dylan laugh, the challenges of his 2001 film Intimacy, and a very unique version of Macbeth.

I’m just sorry I didn’t have time to finish the whole series before our conversation. But I’m definitely at a point where I’ll be seeing it through to the end.
Oh, good! That’s great to hear. So it’s caught your imagination!
To say the least. Well, my first question is the obligatory secret origin story. How did you find your way into this project in the first place? Did they come to you and pitch you on it?
I was doing some work with Kenneth Miller on his ancestors, the Carnegie family, and he brought it up and talked about it with such a deep passion and philosophical interest… I didn’t even understand everything he was talking about! [Laughs.] But I could see it was really a passionate project for him, and…I think at that time he actually wanted to make it a film. But when I read it, I said, “This is very dialogue-heavy for a film. Is there maybe another way of making it in this version? And then you could adapt it or bring it down to make a film version. But this sounds like radio to me.” And I didn’t know much about technology, but he then developed it into a podcast and asked me who would direct. And I’ve always wanted to work with Trudie Styler, so I suggested Trudie, and – bless her – she came onboard, and that made it a great pleasure. So that’s how I got involved!
Well, obviously, you’ve got at least a little bit of sci-fi in your background. Are you actually a sci-fi fan, per se?
That’s the kindest thing that anyone has ever said to me: that there’s only a little bit of sci-fi in my background. [Laughs.] I mean, 2001: A Space Odyssey and stuff, but I haven’t seen Dune yet, and I’m not a great reader of science fiction. So this was very interesting to me. But I have been reading a lot about A.I. and robots ever since high school, when I was in a version of Rossum’s Universal Robots (by Karel Capek), where the word was first invented, apparently. 
How did you enjoy working with Rebecca Ferguson? Did you actually record it at least in her general vicinity or was it a virtual situation?
No, that was very nice: we were all together for a week or so, however long it took. But Trudie and Rebecca and I, and Charles Dance and Sting and…I think those were the people I met that summer when we recorded it. And then later on Vanessa Redgrave and the other people came onboard. But Rebecca and I sat across the table reading it, and that was really fun. We’d look in each others eyes. We played it with each other very close to the reality of sitting together at a dinner table. 
I will say that it feels very much like a theater piece, the way it unfolds with the two of you. Which I guess you’d call a two-hander.
Yes, it could be a theater piece, too, you’re right. It’s a two-hander, yeah. It very much is, the subject matter of it. Though there are incredible things described that you could film, the subject matter, really, is the relationship between the creator and his creation, isn’t it?
It is indeed. And I will say that, in a word where people find themselves forced to multitask, I don’t know that you can fully appreciate this production without solely listening to this. It’s very intellectual, as you said.
Yeah, it’s complex. It was quite a task just to humanize it and make sure it was coming from a real need. That’s why I think we wouldn’t have been able to do it on Zoom. We had to – with Trudie’s help – make a connection and keep the need alive through it. Yeah, it’s an immersive piece in a way, isn’t it? You go down into places where you’re not quite sure where you are, and then you emerge again, and then you go down again. 
But it becomes hypnotic in the process. When I first started listening to it, I was reading email, and then I realized, “I need to stop this and just focus on what I’m listening to.” Which is high praise.
Well, thank you. Good, I’ll pass that on!
So what was your history with audio dramas? This is obviously considered a podcast, but in general, had you done anything like this for radio, for example?
I did earlier in my career. And I’ve read Keats’ poetry, but I think at that time it was for cassette tapes. [Laughs.] I hear they’re coming back, though! But, no, I haven’t really done a lot of this stuff. I’ve been caught up in live theater and, now, in film and television. But this was fun. It was very focused. And intimate. And those are very nice aspects of any job you do. If you can get to those places, you’re happy. 
So would you say it piqued your interest enough to do another one if something else like this came down the pike?
Yeah! Yeah, it was a subject matter that interested me. And the relationship with artificial intelligence is very critical and is happening all over. I mean, you can’t walk down the street without bumping into someone who’s got a closer relationship to their phone than the walkers on the pavement. I was riding down the bikeway along the Hudson this morning, and you’ve just got to be so careful about all of the artificial intelligence in scooters and bicycles and things as they’re whipping along. I was thinking about this, and our inability to know if something is true or not… That seems to be a lot to do with artificial intelligence and our skills at discerning whether someone is lying, making things up, speaking very honestly from the heart… Those are diminishing a little bit, I think, as people don’t talk with each other so much, perhaps, or don’t talk to strangers, or our suspicions of algorithms and different things that are involved in bringing us news and opinions. 
So it’s not so far-fetched, this story about someone having a conversation with an A.I.
Absolutely not. I think there are people who are doing that already. At a cruder level than in this story, obviously. This story is a little bit in the future, and the sophistication of Rebecca’s character is complex. But thinking about that, I think that’s probably partly why it is very dense: because the conversation is between an incredibly dense computer and a human being who was part of the team that created that computer. So it wouldn’t be very believable if it was a shallow conversation, would it?
I wanted to ask you about a few things from your back catalog. You’ve worked with Steven Spielberg a few times in your career, of course, but I recently discovered that you had an opportunity to work with him even earlier than you did, back in 1986.
That’s right, yeah. I thought when I turned down Empire of the Sun, I’d never work with him again nor even see him again. But fate had a different path! That was a powerful thing to turn down, because my grandfathers spent their time in Japanese prisoner of war camps, one of them in a civilian camp like that book and the film described. 
Not long after turning that down in favor of a theater opportunity, you did get another film opportunity, one that gave you a chance to work with Bob Dylan.
[Cheerily.] I did work with Bob Dylan, yeah! Hearts of Fire…or Farts for Hire, as it was called on set. [Laughs.] Hearts of Fire with Bob. I got to play bass with him, because I was a member of the band. I even made him laugh once. I was wearing glasses – I was a shy bass player, like Paul McCartney with glasses – and my glasses had got tilted down looking at some rather violent punk behavior in the crowd, and he raised my glasses to give me confidence, and I said, “Cheers!” And it made him laugh. It was an unconscious joke of mine, but…it still got the laugh!
Has it occurred to you that, in a sense, you’re effectively playing the same character in both Ready Player One and Don’t Look Up? 
Oh, I hadn’t heard that. That hadn’t occurred to me! Yes, I suppose a similar character of authority, you’re right, and of technological advancement. I get the impression that Halliday, he’s the actual Steve Jobs type genius, isn’t he? I mean, he isn’t just an entrepreneur who wants to be considered a genius, which is the case of the man in Don’t Look Up. He’s a businessman who takes great offense when he wants to be considered as an evolutionary force in humanity, doesn’t he? That’s his grandiosity. The other guy, Halliday, wants actually to have privacy and intimacy and humanity and is famous because he has invented something that everyone wants. But you’re right, they’re both interested in control, as all computer people are, I think. Well, maybe that’s too generalized. But most technology seems to be promising or offering more control of your time, more control of your communication. It doesn’t really deliver… [Laughs.] 
On a different note, I’m curious if you think a film like 2001’s Intimacy could be made in 2022.
No, probably not.

I felt like that was almost a rhetorical question. At the very least, I doubt that it could be made in the same manner.
Well, I suspect it would probably want a more diverse cast, for one. I don’t know, do you think we’ve gotten more sexually prurient or moral, or that a film like that wouldn’t… [Hesitates.] Why do you think a film like that wouldn’t be allowed nowadays?
Well, not so much that it wouldn’t be allowed, but you’d certainly have to have an intimacy coordinator on set. I don’t know if that was something that you had at the time, but I didn’t get the impression that you did.
No, it wasn’t. And, actually, that would’ve been helpful, yeah. I don’t know if that would’ve stopped it being made, but that might’ve helped it be made in a more protected environment. If Patrice Chereau… Bless his heart, he’s passed now, but if a present-day Patrice Chereau wanted to make a film like that and wanted the two players to be abandoned in their intimacy and allow the camera to go where it wanted, I would’ve thought the intimacy coach would’ve been pleased that they had real work to do in terms of looking after everyone on set and those two performers. Much as if you’d offered a stunt man a very dangerous particular stunt, a good stuntman’s going to want to rise to the challenge of that, rather than say ‘no.” Unless it’s too dangerous, of course.
What do you think? Be the first to comment.
Lastly, is there a favorite project you’ve worked on over the years that didn’t get the love you thought it deserved?
[Laughs.] Yeah, there’s a whole bunch of ’em! Oh, my, that’s such a great question. Yeah, I did a production of Macbeth once that was based on David Koresh, as a cult leader needing to be brought down by people who adore the cult leader, or at least adore the guru that the cult leader was following before the guru was killed. I thought it deserved better treatment than it got. But I directed it and was in it, so I would think that!

				Examples of Artificial Intelligence in Workers' Compensation & Managed Care

				  Favorite  Add to Documents  Print  Share   By: Nikki Jackson, CPCU, ARM, CDMS Powerful innovation is fueled by artificial intelligence and 5G, but as busy professionals, we may struggle to understand how these ingredients impact workers' compensation programs. Truth be told, technology and the concept of digital transformation have accelerated at an incredible pace in recent years. In fact, it is resonating through almost every aspect of the claims journey through technology-enabled apps, cloud technology, rapid advancements in clinical and operational systems, staffing, and overall culture. At its core, artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to perform tasks that we commonly associate with intelligent beings. AI is often the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, like our ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Say what? Let's go through a few examples.  Like many of you, I do a lot of online shopping, and there is no denying the power of AI in eCommerce. Think about the notifications, ads, or recommendations that pop up on your devices when you've purchased or searched for a product. Not a fan of online shopping? Think about the airline industry. There are tons of examples of AI usage such as revenue management, crew management, and fuel efficiency. As passengers, we want the airline to communicate with us when issues arise. So, when my flight was delayed last month on the way to National Comp, not only did I receive timely communication and apologies about the delayed flight, I also received recommendations for food and shopping experiences. We call this messaging automation. At MTI America, we provide a host of health care, transportation, and language services for injured workers. One of the health solutions includes diagnostics. In this space, AI powers advanced medical screenings, improves precision medicine, and can help us indicate and assess risk. Coupling AI with 5G can deliver massive economic and societal benefits, and we're seeing it transform our industry. Fifth-generation wireless (5G) is simply the latest iteration of cellular technology, and it's engineered to greatly increase the responsiveness and speed of wireless networks — a major factor for apps that require real-time, high-quality video such as health care or interpretation delivery platforms. AI is also impacting remote patient monitoring. IoT refers to ""The Internet of Things"" which describes physical objects with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems. Remote patient monitoring is the most common application of IoT devices for health care. Using IoT devices, our providers can remotely monitor vitals, track movement, and transfer current data to help therapists make faster, more informed decisions. Another core function of AI is predictive analytics. Predictive analytics tools collect data from a variety of internal and external sources to help us understand and predict behavior, trends, and actions. These predictive analytics tools are often driven by machine learning which models human thought. Many of you may have heard of predictive modeling, which is a form of predictive analytics. A vendor, TPA, broker, carrier, etcetera, may look at an organization's claims data to predict if the current claim has the likelihood of becoming a high-cost loss. At MTI America, our physical medicine providers can use predictive analytics to assist in decision-making and evaluate big data, ultimately improving patient outcomes and providing relief for healthcare workers. For example, machine learning algorithms can be programmed from big data and past patient outcomes to provide treatment insights that work best for the current patient. Want to learn more?
