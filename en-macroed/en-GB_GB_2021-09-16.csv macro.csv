Welcome to AI book reviews, a series of posts that explore the latest literature on artificial intelligence.
Recent advances in deep learning have rekindled interest in the imminence of machines that can think and act like humans, or artificial general intelligence. By following the path of building bigger and better neural networks, the thinking goes, we will be able to get closer and closer to creating a digital version of the human brain.
But this is a myth, argues computer scientist Erik Larson, and all evidence suggests that human and machine intelligence are radically different. Larson’s new book, The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do, discusses how widely publicized misconceptions about intelligence and inference have led AI research down narrow paths that are limiting innovation and scientific discoveries.
And unless scientists, researchers, and the organizations that support their work don’t change course, Larson warns, they will be doomed to “resignation to the creep of a machine-land, where genuine invention is sidelined in favor of futuristic talk advocating current approaches, often from entrenched interests.”

The myth of artificial intelligence
The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, by Erik J. Larson
From a scientific standpoint, the myth of AI assumes that we will achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) by making progress on narrow applications, such as classifying images, understanding voice commands, or playing games. But the technologies underlying these narrow AI systems do not address the broader challenges that must be solved for general intelligence capabilities, such as holding basic conversations, accomplishing simple chores in a house, or other tasks that require common sense.
“As we successfully apply simpler, narrow versions of intelligence that benefit from faster computers and lots of data, we are not making incremental progress, but rather picking the low-hanging fruit,” Larson writes.
The cultural consequence of the myth of AI is ignoring the scientific mystery of intelligence and endlessly talking about ongoing progress on deep learning and other contemporary technologies. This myth discourages scientists from thinking about new ways to tackle the challenge of intelligence.
“We are unlikely to get innovation if we choose to ignore a core mystery rather than face it up,” Larson writes. “A healthy culture for innovation emphasizes exploring unknowns, not hyping extensions of existing methods… Mythology about inevitable success in AI tends to extinguish the very culture of invention necessary for real progress.”
Deductive, inductive, and abductive inference

You step out of your home and notice that the street is wet. Your first thought is that it must have been raining. But it’s sunny and the sidewalk is dry, so you immediately cross out the possibility of rain. As you look to the side, you see a road wash tanker parked down the street. You conclude that the road is wet because the tanker washed it.
This is an example “inference,” the act of going from observations to conclusions, and is the basic function of intelligent beings. We’re constantly inferring things based on what we know and what we perceive. Most of it happens subconsciously, in the background of our mind, without focus and direct attention.
“Any system that infers must have some basic intelligence, because the very act of using what is known and what is observed to update beliefs is inescapably tied up with what we mean by intelligence,” Larson writes.  
AI researchers base their systems on two types of inference machines: deductive and inductive. Deductive inference uses prior knowledge to reason about the world. This is the basis of symbolic artificial intelligence, the main focus of researchers in the early decades of AI. Engineers create symbolic systems by endowing them with a predefined set of rules and facts, and the AI uses this knowledge to reason about the data it receives.
Inductive inference, which has gained more traction among AI researchers and tech companies in the past decade, is the acquisition of knowledge through experience. Machine learning algorithms are inductive inference engines. An ML model trained on relevant examples will find patterns that map inputs to outputs. In recent years, AI researchers have used machine learning, big data, and advanced processors to train models on tasks that were beyond the capacity of symbolic systems.
A third type of reasoning, abductive inference, was first introduced by American scientist Charles Sanders Peirce in the 19th century. Abductive inference is the cognitive ability to come up with intuitions and hypotheses, to make guesses that are better than random stabs at the truth.

For example, there can be numerous reasons for the street to be wet (including some that we haven’t directly experienced before), but abductive inference enables us to select the most promising hypotheses, quickly eliminate the wrong ones, look for new ones and reach a reliable conclusion. As Larson puts it in The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, “We guess, out of a background of effectively infinite possibilities, which hypotheses seem likely or plausible.”
Abductive inference is what many refer to as “common sense.” It is the conceptual framework within which we view facts or data and the glue that brings the other types of inference together. It enables us to focus at any moment on what’s relevant among the ton of information that exists in our mind and the ton of data we’re receiving through our senses.
The problem is that the AI community hasn’t paid enough attention to abductive inference.
AI and abductive inference
Abduction entered the AI discussion with attempts at Abductive Logic Programming in the 1980s and 1990s, but those efforts were flawed and later abandoned. “They were reformulations of logic programming, which is a variant of deduction,” Larson told TechTalks.
Erik J. Larson, author of “The Myth of Artificial Intelligence”
Abduction got another chance in the 2010s as Bayesian networks, inference engines that try to compute causality. But like the earlier approaches, the newer approaches shared the flaw of not capturing true abduction, Larson said, adding that Bayesian and other graphical models “are variants of induction.” In The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, he refers to them as “abduction in name only.”
For the most part, the history of AI has been dominated by deduction and induction.
“When the early AI pioneers like [Alan] Newell, [Herbert] Simon, [John] McCarthy, and [Marvin] Minsky took up the question of artificial inference (the core of AI), they assumed that writing deductive-style rules would suffice to generate intelligent thought and action,” Larson said. “That was never the case, really, as should have been earlier acknowledged in discussions about how we do science.”
For decades, researchers tried to expand the powers of symbolic AI systems by providing them with manually written rules and facts. The premise was that if you endow an AI system with all the knowledge that humans know, it will be able to act as smartly as humans. But pure symbolic AI has failed for various reasons. Symbolic systems can’t acquire and add new knowledge, which makes them rigid. Creating symbolic AI becomes an endless chase of adding new facts and rules only to find the system making new mistakes that it can’t fix. And much of our knowledge is implicit and cannot be expressed in rules and facts and fed to symbolic systems. 
“It’s curious here that no one really explicitly stopped and said ‘Wait. This is not going to work!’” Larson said. “That would have shifted research directly towards abduction or hypothesis generation or, say, ‘context-sensitive inference.’”
In the past two decades, with the growing availability of data and compute resources, machine learning algorithms—especially deep neural networks—have become the focus of attention in the AI community. Deep learning technology has unlocked many applications that were previously beyond the limits of computers. And it has attracted interest and money from some of the wealthiest companies in the world.
“I think with the advent of the World Wide Web, the empirical or inductive (data-centric) approaches took over, and abduction, as with deduction, was largely forgotten,” Larson said.
But machine learning systems also suffer from severe limits, including the lack of causality, poor handling of edge cases, and the need for too much data. And these limits are becoming more evident and problematic as researchers try to apply ML to sensitive fields such as healthcare and finance.
Abductive inference and future paths of AI

Some scientists, including reinforcement learning pioneer Richard Sutton, believe that we should stick to methods that can scale with the availability of data and computation, namely learning and search. For example, as neural networks grow bigger and are trained on more data, they will eventually overcome their limits and lead to new breakthroughs.
Larson dismisses the scaling up of data-driven AI as “fundamentally flawed as a model for intelligence.” While both search and learning can provide useful applications, they are based on non-abductive inference, he reiterates.
“Search won’t scale into commonsense or abductive inference without a revolution in thinking about inference, which hasn’t happened yet. Similarly with machine learning, the data-driven nature of learning approaches means essentially that the inferences have to be in the data, so to speak, and that’s demonstrably not true of many intelligent inferences that people routinely perform,” Larson said. “We don’t just look to the past, captured, say, in a large dataset, to figure out what to conclude or think or infer about the future.”
Other scientists believe that hybrid AI that brings together symbolic systems and neural networks will have a bigger promise of dealing with the shortcomings of deep learning. One example is IBM Watson, which became famous when it beat world champions at Jeopardy! More recent proof-of-concept hybrid models have shown promising results in applications where symbolic AI and deep learning alone perform poorly.
Larson believes that hybrid systems can fill in the gaps in machine learning–only or rules-based–only approaches. As a researcher in the field of natural language processing, he is currently working on combining large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 with older work on the semantic web in the form of knowledge graphs to create better applications in search, question answering, and other tasks.
“But deduction-induction combos don’t get us to abduction, because the three types of inference are formally distinct, so they don’t reduce to each other and can’t be combined to get a third,” he said.
In The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, Larson describes attempts to circumvent abduction as the “inference trap.”
“Purely inductively inspired techniques like machine learning remain inadequate, no matter how fast computers get, and hybrid systems like Watson fall short of general understanding as well,” he writes. “In open-ended scenarios requiring knowledge about the world like language understanding, abduction is central and irreplaceable. Because of this, attempts at combining deductive and inductive strategies are always doomed to fail… The field needs a fundamental theory of abduction. In the meantime, we are stuck in traps.”
The commercialization of AI

The AI community’s narrow focus on data-driven approaches has centralized research and innovation in a few organizations that have vast stores of data and deep pockets. With deep learning becoming a useful way to turn data into profitable products, big tech companies are now locked in a tight race to hire AI talent, driving researchers away from academia by offering them lucrative salaries.
This shift has made it very difficult for non-profit labs and small companies to become involved in AI research.
“When you tie research and development in AI to the ownership and control of very large datasets, you get a barrier to entry for start-ups, who don’t own the data,” Larson said, adding that data-driven AI intrinsically creates “winner-take-all” scenarios in the commercial sector.
The monopolization of AI is in turn hampering scientific research. With big tech companies focusing on creating applications in which they can leverage their vast data resources to maintain the edge over their competitors, there’s little incentive to explore alternative approaches to AI. Work in the field starts to skew toward narrow and profitable applications at the expense of efforts that can lead to new inventions.
“No one at present knows how AI would look in the absence of such gargantuan centralized datasets, so there’s nothing really on offer for entrepreneurs looking to compete by designing different and more powerful AI,” Larson said.
In his book, Larson warns about the current culture of AI, which “is squeezing profits out of low-hanging fruit, while continuing to spin AI mythology.” The illusion of progress on artificial general intelligence can lead to another AI winter, he writes.
But while an AI winter might dampen interest in deep learning and data-driven AI, it can open the way for a new generation of thinkers to explore new pathways. Larson hopes scientists start looking beyond existing methods.
In The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, Larson provides an inference framework that sheds light on the challenges that the field faces today and helps readers to see through the overblown claims about progress toward AGI or singularity.
“My hope is that non-specialists have some tools to combat this kind of inevitability thinking, which isn’t scientific, and that my colleagues and other AI scientists can view it as a wake-up call to get to work on the very real problems the field faces,” Larson said.

The use of artificial intelligence in the hiring process has increased in recent years with companies turning to automated assessments, digital interviews, and data analytics to parse through resumes and screen candidates. But as IT strives for better diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), it turns out AI can do more harm than help if companies aren’t strategic and thoughtful about how they implement the technology.
“The bias usually comes from the data. If you don’t have a representative data set, or any number of characteristics that you decide on, then of course you’re not going to be properly, finding and evaluating applicants,” says Jelena Kovačević, IEEE Fellow, William R. Berkley Professor, and Dean of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
The chief issue with AI’s use in hiring is that, in an industry that has been predominantly male and white for decades, the historical data on which AI hiring systems are built will ultimately have an inherent bias. Without diverse historical data sets to train AI algorithms, AI hiring tools are very likely to carry the same biases that have existed in tech hiring since the 1980s. Still, used effectively, AI can help create a more efficient and fair hiring process, experts say.
 
 
 













 
 

The dangers of bias in AI
Because AI algorithms are typically trained on past data, bias with AI is always a concern. In data science, bias is defined as an error that arises from faulty assumptions in the learning algorithm. Train your algorithms with data that doesn’t reflect the current landscape, and you will derive erroneous results. As such, with hiring, especially in an industry like IT, that has had historical issues with diversity, training an algorithm on historical hiring data can be a big mistake.

“It’s really hard to ensure a piece of AI software isn’t inherently biased or has biased effects,” says Ben Winters, an AI and human rights fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. While steps can be taken to avoid this, he adds, “many systems have been shown to have biased effects based on race and disability.”
If you don’t have appreciable diversity in your data set, then it’s impossible for an algorithm to know how individuals from underrepresented groups would have performed in the past. Instead, your algorithm will be biased toward what your data set represents and will compare all future candidates to that archetype, says Kovačević.
 
 
 













 
 

“For example, if Black people were systematically excluded from the past, and if you had no women in the pipeline in the past, and you create an algorithm based on that, there is no way the future will be properly predicted. If you hire only from ‘Ivy League schools,’ then you really don’t know how an applicant from a lesser-known school will perform, so there are several layers of bias,” she says.
Wendy Rentschler, head of corporate social responsibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion at BMC Software, is keenly aware of the potential negatives that AI can bring to the hiring process. She points to an infamous case of Amazon’s attempt at developing an AI recruiting tool as a prime example: The company had to shut the project down because the algorithm discriminated against women.
“If the largest and greatest software company can’t do it, I give great pause to all the HR tech and their claims of being able to do it,” says Rentschler.
 
 
 













 
 

Some AI hiring software companies make big claims, but whether their software can help determine the right candidate remains to be seen. The technology can help companies streamline the hiring process and find new ways of identifying qualified candidates using AI, but it’s important not to let lofty claims cloud judgment.

If you’re trying to improve DEI in your organization, AI can seem like a quick fix or magic bullet, but if you’re not strategic about your use of AI in the hiring process, it can backfire. The key is to ensure your hiring process and the tools you’re using aren’t excluding traditionally underrepresented groups.
Discrimination with AI
It’s up to companies to ensure they’re using AI in the hiring process as ethically as possible and not falling victim to overblown claims of what the tools can do. Matthew Scherer, senior policy counsel for worker privacy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, points out that, since the HR department doesn’t generate revenue and is usually labeled as an expense, leaders are sometimes eager to bring in automation technology that can help cut costs. That eagerness, however, can cause companies to overlook potential negatives of the software they’re using. Scherer also notes that a lot of the claims made by AI hiring software companies are often overblown, if not completely false.
 
 
 













 
 

“Particularly tools that claim to do things like analyze people’s facial expressions, their tone of voice, anything that measures aspects of personality — that’s snake oil,” he says.
At best, tools that claim to measure tone of voice, expressions, and other aspects of a candidate’s personality in, for example, a video interview are “measuring how culturally ‘normal’ a person is,” which can ultimately exclude candidates with disabilities or any candidate that doesn’t fit what the algorithm determines is a typical candidate. These tools can also put disabled candidates in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether they should disclose any disabilities before the interview process. Disabled candidates may have concerns that if they don’t disclose, they won’t get the right accommodations needed for the automated assessment, but they might not be comfortable disclosing a disability that early in the hiring process, or at all.
And as Rentschler points out, BIPOC, women, and candidates with disabilities are often accustomed to the practice of “code switching” in interviews — which is when underrepresented groups make certain adjustments to the way they speak, appear or behave, in order to make others more comfortable. In this case, AI systems might pick up on that and incorrectly identify their behavior as inauthentic or dishonest, turning away potentially strong candidates.
 
 
 













 
 

Scherer says discrimination laws fall into two categories: disparate impact, which is unintentional discrimination; and disparate treatment, which is intentional discrimination. It’s difficult to design a tool that can avoid disparate impact “without explicitly favoring candidates from particular groups, which would constitute disparate treatment under federal law.”
Regulations in AI hiring
AI is a relatively new technology, leaving oversight scant when it comes to legislation, policies, and laws around privacy and trade practices. Winters points to a 2019 FTC complaint filed by EPIC alleging HireVue was using deceptive business practices related to the use of facial recognition in its hiring software.
HireVue claimed to offer software that “tracks and analyzes the speech and facial movements of candidates to be able to analyze fit, emotional intelligence, communication skills, cognitive ability, problem solving ability, and more.” HireVue ultimately pulled back on its facial recognition claims and the use of the technology in its software.
 
 
 













 
 

But there’s similar technology out there that uses games to “purportedly measure subjective behavioral attributes and match with organizational fit” or that will use AI to “crawl the internet for publicly available information about statements by a candidate then analyze it for potential red flags or fit,” according to Winters.
There’s also concerns around the amount of data that AI can collect on a candidate while analyzing their video interviews, assessments, resumes, LinkedIn profiles, or other public social media profiles. Oftentimes, candidates might not even know they’re being analyzed by AI tools in the interview process and there are few regulations on how that data is managed.
“Overall, there is currently very little oversight for AI hiring tools. Several state or local bills have been introduced. However, many of these bills have significant loopholes — namely not applying to government agencies and offering significant workarounds. The future of regulation in AI-supported hiring should require significant transparency, controls on the application of these tools, strict data collection, use, and retention limits, and independent third-party testing that is published freely,” says Winters.
 
 
 













 
 

Responsible use of AI in hiring
Rentschler and her team at BMC have focused on finding ways to use AI to help the company’s “human capital be more strategic.” They’ve implemented tools that screen candidates quickly using skills-based assessments for the role they’re applying to. BMC has also used AI to identify problematic language in its job descriptions, ensuring they’re gender-neutral and inclusive. BMC has also employed the software to connect new hires with their benefits and internal organizational information during the onboarding process. Rentschler’s objective is to find ways to implement AI and automation that can help the humans on her team do their jobs more effectively, rather than replace them.

While AI algorithms can carry inherent bias based on historical hiring data, one way to avoid this is to focus more on skills-based hiring. Rentschler’s team only uses AI tools to identify candidates who have specific skill sets they’re looking to add to their workforce, and ignores any other identifiers such as education, gender, names, and other potentially identifying information that might have historically excluded a candidate from the process. By doing this, she has hired candidates from unexpected backgrounds, Rentschler says, including a Syrian refugee who was originally a dentist, but also had some coding experience. Because the system was focused only on looking for candidates with coding skills, the former dentist made it past the filter and was hired by the company.
Other ethical strategies include having checks and balances in place. Scherer consulted with a company that designed a tool to send potential candidates to a recruiter, who would then review their resumes and decide whether they were a good fit for the job. Even if that recruiter rejected a resume, the candidate’s resume would still be put through the algorithm again, and if it was flagged as a good potential candidate, it would be sent to another recruiter who wouldn’t know it was already reviewed by someone else on the team. This ensures that resumes were being double-checked by humans and that they aren’t relying solely on AI to determined qualified candidates. It also ensures that recruiters aren’t overlooking qualified candidates.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s important that the human retains the judgment and doesn’t just rely on what the machine says. And that’s the thing that is hard to train for, because the easiest thing for a human recruiter to do will always be to just say, ‘I’m going to just go with whatever the machine tells me if the company is expecting me to use that tool,’” says Scherer.

Making the case for artificial intelligence What risks to society go hand in hand with speed and convenience?  


                      University of Utah Communications                                                                






Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened myriad possibilities to make life better—faster, more efficient, cheaper. At the same time, using data and machines to speed things up has also increased the chances of lost human connections, missed steps in deliberation, and over-simplification of life’s messiness.
The Utah Informatics Initiative (UI2) and Tanner Humanities Center are hosting a virtual symposium Sept. 21 and 22 to explore the facets of AI’s role in society.
The University of Utah is uniquely situated as the host for these discussions, said Mike Kirby, UI2 director. The U has a notable cohort of researchers studying informatics, data science and machine learning, while working alongside interdisciplinary partners in the humanities and arts. “That crossover allows us to really dig into the thorny ethical questions raised by technological advances,” Kirby said.
Moshe Vardi
On the first day, keynote speaker Moshe Vardi will talk about “Ethics Washing in AI.” Vardi, director of Rice University’s Initiative on Technology, Culture and Society, says many companies have developed internal ethical standards after several incidents of AI and Machine Learning going wrong: self-driving cars on autopilot crashing, face-recognition software disproportionately targeting dark-skinned people. But those much-touted standards could be superficial, Vardi said.
“Talk is cheap. ‘Ethics washing’ — also called ‘ethics theater’— is the practice of fabricating or exaggerating a company’s interest in equitable AI systems that work for everyone. An example is when a company promotes ‘AI for good’ initiatives with one hand, while selling surveillance tech to governments and corporate customers with the other,” Vardi added.
“I will argue that the ethical lens is too narrow. The real issue is how to deal with technology’s impact on society. Technology is driving the future, but who is doing the steering?”
Vardi will discuss with symposium attendees in a question-and-answer session moderated by Kirby.
On the event’s second day, six U researchers will present their work using, or examining, artificial intelligence:

Lisa Swanstrom
Trafton Drew
Eliane Wiese
Aniello De Santo
Alan Kuntz
Bei Wang

Following the presentations, Vardi, Tanner Humanities Center Director Erika George and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Dan Reed will participate in a panel discussion moderated by Professor Valerio Pascucci.

In its third year, the Informatics Initiative was established by Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Dan Reed to build on the university’s existing education, research and workforce development strengths in data science. The initiative is funded using annual performance-based funding from the Utah Legislature.

The use of AI language models to generate text for business applications is gaining steam. Large companies are deploying their own systems, while others are leveraging models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 via APIs. According to OpenAI, GPT-3 is now being used in over 300 apps by thousands of developers, producing an average of more than 4.5 billion novel words per day.
But while recent language models are impressively fluent, they have a tendency to write falsehoods ranging from factual inaccuracies to potentially harmful disinformation. To quantify the risks associated with “deceptive” models, researchers at the University of Oxford and OpenAI created a dataset called TruthfulQA that contains questions some humans might answer incorrectly due to false beliefs or misconceptions. The researchers found that while the best-performing model was truthful on 58% of questions, it fell short of human performance at 94%.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



TruthfulQA
In the subfield of AI known as natural language processing (NLP), robustness testing can be the exception rather than the norm.  One report found that 60% to 70% of answers given by NLP models were embedded somewhere in the benchmark training sets, indicating that the models were usually simply memorizing answers. Another study found that metrics used to benchmark AI and machine learning models tended to be inconsistent, irregularly tracked, and not particularly informative.
TruthfulQA aims to avoid these benchmarking pitfalls with a bank of questions about health, law, finance, and politics that requires models to avoid generating false answers learned from text. The dataset spans 817 questions in 38 different categories. Researchers worded the questions such that some humans and models might answer falsely.
The team tested several different models on TruthfulQA, including GPT-3; GPT-3 predecessor GPT-2; open source versions of GPT-3 called GPT-Neo and GPT-J; and UnifiedQA, a model fine-tuned on question-answer tasks. To classify answers from the models as either true or false, the team developed “GPT-judge,” an algorithm trained on answers to TruthfulQA questions from all of the evaluated models.
Above: Examples of falsehoods generated by models tested on the dataset.
Interestingly, the results show that larger models generally perform worse than smaller models in the same family. The size of a model is measured by the number of parameters it contains — variables internal to the model that the model learns from historical training data. For example, the largest GPT-Neo and GPT-J models were 17% less truthful (as measured by TruthfulQA) than a model 60 times as small. Meanwhile, UnifiedQA did better on truthfulness than the three GPT families, with the largest model performing only slightly worse than the smallest.
When forced to choose from multiple responses rather than generate answers themselves, larger models also performed worse on TruthfulQA than smaller ones. No models significantly outperformed random guessing. And even the “best” model gave false answers 42% of the time, versus 6% for human participants. (Eighty-seven percent of the humans’ answers were true on TruthfulQA.)advertisement
The researchers speculate that the models haven’t learned the training distribution well enough or that the models’ training objectives actually incentivize false answers. “We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web,” the researchers wrote in a preprint paper, “TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehood.” They added: “[Our preliminary work finds] that today’s large models are much less truthful than humans.”
Large language models
The work adds to growing skepticism that the size of language models — and their training datasets — correspond to performance.  Earlier this month, a team of Google researchers published a study claiming that a model much smaller than GPT-3, fine-tuned language net (FLAN), bests GPT-3 by a large margin on a number of challenging benchmarks. And scientists at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria found that GPT-3 underperforms in domains like biomedicine compared with smaller, less architecturally complex but carefully fine-tuned models.advertisement
Maria Antoniak, a natural language processing researcher and data scientist at Cornell University, says that when it comes to natural language, the question of whether larger models are the right approach is still open. While some of the best benchmark performance scores today come from large datasets and models, the payoff from dumping enormous amounts of data into models is uncertain.
“The current structure of the field is task-focused, where the community gathers together to try to solve specific problems on specific datasets,” Antoniak told VentureBeat in a previous interview. “These tasks are usually very structured and can have their own weaknesses, so while they help our field move forward in some ways, they can also constrain us. Large models perform well on these tasks, but whether these tasks can ultimately lead us to any true language understanding is up for debate.”

Artificial Intelligence-based technologies have the potential of becoming tools used to promote equity and provide personalized learning.The use of AI and other technologies in colleges and universities open the doors of higher education to all disregarding where in the world they live. Location and time become a thing of the past while curiosity, creativity, and collaboration are encouraged and supported; students become global students, and universities become borderless.In fact, a Stanford University study on Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030 shows how interactive machine tutors can be matched to students for a more focused and personalized learning experience.Today’s students will become the leaders of tomorrow. Higher education leaders who know the benefits that AI can provide have the responsibility of equipping their institution with the AI that will be able to assess students, provide feedback, and test scientific hypotheses just as well as a human can. Perhaps even better. AI in higher education: Current status, looking into the future  AI will become a norm in every aspect of higher education / Source: Microsoft ResearchIn a survey conducted by Microsoft Research (MSR) in collaboration with Times Higher Education (THE), global university leaders provided feedback on the benefits of AI and its current status in higher education: Only a minority of universities currently have an AI strategy, but most plan to develop oneUniversities find it difficult to recruit and retain staff able to teach and research in AIAI will increase employers’ demand for university graduates and will not lead to university closuresAI will be able to assess students, provide feedback, and generate a test scientific hypotheses at least as well as humans canBut universities will not cut teaching, research, or administration staff and may even recruit moreMost of the survey respondents agreed that AI will complement rather than replace human scientific input, a true human+machine collaboration resulting in a powerful combination of skills. The survey evaluated the possibility of AI replacing humans in the lab doing the routine tasks. In this matter, the vast majority of respondents disagree that AI will decrease demand for humans in the lab, including research assistants, at least over the next 20 years. Twenty percent of respondents, however, expect such demand for humans in the lab to drop. In contrast, 72 percent do not believe this will happen and 46 percent strongly disagree with the suggestion. Students today. Leaders tomorrowAll students must be taught specific technical skills which will allow them to program and interact with Artificial Intelligence in the future. Subjects and courses in ethics and philosophy as well as a focus on skills where AI is less likely to have an advantage such as complex decision making, critical thinking, entrepreneurship, and emotional intelligence will become part of a basic education to provide tools that will help them live and work with Artificial Intelligence. Academic leadership should also consider that what students study today may well change. “Students across the world will have to face the possibility that perhaps what they are dedicating their lives to studying right now may soon become redundant,” said one of the students participating in a survey. Every industry is adapting and changing toward digital transformation and Industry 4.0. University leadership must embrace Education 4.0 in order to remain relevant. In time, those institutions which resist change and are unable to adapt, those that do not embrace AI will not remain competitive. They will have to make redundancies to try to survive, but in the end, they will become redundant themselves, indeed. Only change remains forever constant. Embracing change is paramount for every institution in higher education.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — Artificial intelligence has reached a critical turning point in its evolution, according to a new report by an international panel of experts assessing the state of the field. 
Substantial advances in language processing, computer vision and pattern recognition mean that AI is touching people’s lives on a daily basis — from helping people to choose a movie to aiding in medical diagnoses. With that success, however, comes a renewed urgency to understand and mitigate the risks and downsides of AI-driven systems, such as algorithmic discrimination or use of AI for deliberate deception. Computer scientists must work with experts in the social sciences and law to assure that the pitfalls of AI are minimized.
Those conclusions are from a report titled “Gathering Strength, Gathering Storms: The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) 2021 Study Panel Report,” which was compiled by a panel of experts from computer science, public policy, psychology, sociology and other disciplines. AI100 is an ongoing project hosted by the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence that aims to monitor the progress of AI and guide its future development. This new report, the second to be released by the AI100 project, assesses developments in AI between 2016 and 2021.
“In the past five years, AI has made the leap from something that mostly happens in research labs or other highly controlled settings to something that’s out in society affecting people’s lives,” said Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown University who chaired the report panel. “That’s really exciting, because this technology is doing some amazing things that we could only dream about five or 10 years ago. But at the same time, the field is coming to grips with the societal impact of this technology, and I think the next frontier is thinking about ways we can get the benefits from AI while minimizing the risks.”
The report, released on Thursday, Sept. 16, is structured to answer a set of 14  questions probing critical areas of AI development. The questions were developed by the AI100 standing committee consisting of a renowned group of AI leaders. The committee then assembled a panel of 17 researchers and experts to answer them. The questions include “What are the most important advances in AI?” and “What are the most inspiring open grand challenges?” Other questions address the major risks and dangers of AI, its effects on society, its public perception and the future of the field.

Creating a More Resilient Energy Grid Through Artificial Intelligence

Stony Brook University professor Peng Zhang, a SUNY Empire Innovation professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is leading a statewide team of collaborators in developing “AI-Grid,” an artificial intelligence-enabled, autonomous grid designed to keep power infrastructure resilient from cyberattacks, faults and disastrous accidents.
The work is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Convergence Accelerator Program, which supports and builds upon basic research and discovery that involves multidisciplinary work to accelerate solutions toward societal impact.
In September 2020, the program launched the 2020 cohort, which included AI-Grid as a phase 1 awardee and grant funding of a $1 million to further AI-Grid research from an idea to a low-fidelity prototype. The Convergence Accelerator recently selected teams for phase 2, to focus on expanding the solution prototype and to build a sustainability plan beyond the NSF funding. Under phase 2, a new $5 million NSF cooperative agreement will fund the AI-Grid project.
“This project led by Professor Zhang is a great example demonstrating the impact of this novel research on essential infrastructure that we rely on daily, and defines a pathway for enhancing the resiliency and security of our electrical grid systems,” said Stony Brook University Vice President for Research Richard J. Reeder.
“We expect to show that our AI-Grid solution is affordable, lightweight, secure and replicable, thus offering what could be unprecedented flexibility for an approach to transform today’s infrastructures into tomorrow’s autonomous AI-Grid,” said Zhang, the project’s principal investigator. “This project will demonstrate AI-Grid’s capability to empower our nation’s digital economic engines, relieve the pains of those communities suffering from high electricity costs, and knock out low energy reliability and poor resilience.”
Peng Zhang
According to Zhang, the program includes a broad multidisciplinary team of researchers and many academic and industry partnerships key to its success. The AI-Grid team has established more than 30 partnerships that include power utilities, independent system operators, local and state government, industry and university researchers. Zhang said these partnerships have significantly advanced the technology involved in the work that now includes various deep learning methods, online distribution control, encrypted control, active fault management, and a fully programmable microgrid platform.
“The technologies that Peng and his team are developing come at a critical time as the nation pivots toward renewable energy and the inevitable impact it will have on the grid in the coming decade,” said College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) Interim Dean Jon Longtin. “This kind of multidisciplinary collaboration strengthens our research enterprise, while demonstrating to our students how complicated problems are solved in the modern world.”
Collaborative work at Stony Brook includes faculty and students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science, in conjunction with scientists, engineers and stakeholders affiliated with the Advanced Energy Research and Technology Center (AERTC), and with those from Brookhaven National Laboratory, EIP, RTDS, Hitachi America, Eversource, CCAT, ISO New England, New York Power Authority, PSEG Long Island and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
Stony Brook co-investigators include Scott Smolka, Scott Stoller, Xin Wang and Yifan Zhou. They will work with Zhang to deploy AI-Grid in the field and verify its replicability and universality at three of the most representative networked microgrid sites in the U.S.
“A convergence approach is essential to solving large-scale societal challenges, which is why the NSF Convergence Accelerator requires our funded teams to include a wide-range of expertise from academia, non-profits, industry, government and other communities,” said Douglas Maughan, head of the NSF Convergence Accelerator program. “The merging of ideas, techniques and approaches combined with human-center design concepts assists our teams in accelerating their ideas toward solutions within three years.”
Most recently, the AI-Grid team established end-user partnerships with Energy and Innovation Park, a fuel cell grid-connected energy project in Connecticut; Epic Institute, a global climate solutions organization that also manages The Plant — an old coal power plant being redeveloped into a global climate exhibition and convention center in New York City; and the Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) owned Bronzeville Community Microgrid (BCM) in Chicago.
These end-users will test, demonstrate and ideally implement the technology. The team will develop an open-access AI-grid technology platform with industry partners.

Harshit Agrawal, who explores the symbiotic relationship between AI and art at his solo show at Emami Art, Kolkata—EXO-Stential: AI Musings on the Post-human—believes so. The exhibition gives us a peek into the future where hyper-realistic and interactive art might be the norm. With its sheer innovation and application of technology, the exhibition challenges the traditional ways of approaching and appreciating art. The artworks created with the assistance of AI are compelling yet thought-provoking..Agrawal, 29, speaks with confidence that belies his age and the fact that this is his first solo show, “Technology and design are two of my greatest passions. AI is probably the most important technology we have today. It is shaping our lives and growing at a fast pace. It is influencing our decisions, gives us recommendations based on how we browse the internet and even decides what pops up on our social feed. This is happening very subtly, so people don’t realise they are moving into the post-human era. AI will be an extension of one’s body soon, just like one’s mobile phone is today.” The Bengaluru artist became the first Indian artist to join the non-fungible token (NFT) art bandwagon. As many as eight of his AI-generated artworks were recently minted..With nine artworks that explore sculpture and installations, the exhibition in Kolkata is unusual from a regular gallery art experience. One of the installations, Masked Reality, is an interactive video, where the viewer’s facial expressions are transformed into those of a (female) Kathakali performer and a (male) Theyyam performer. In Strange Genders, the artist investigates our cultural representations of gender bypassing human drawings through the mind of a machine. Agrawal says that he views AI as a vehicle to engage with deep-rooted social issues. Explaining the tone and tenor of AI art, this IIT-Guwahati alumnus shares an analogy, “Just like an artist uses paints and brush to create a canvas, for AI, paint is the data. Data is the raw material that I use to manipulate an algorithm to create an artwork.”.This show portrays how technology can be used as a means of engagement. The curator of the show, Myna Mukherjee, notes that this is one of the first such in-depth shows in India and adds, “AI is rapidly reshaping the world. Agrawal’s work consciously engages with this inevitable techno-centric reality we live in, rather than being simply sucked into it.” The unique show presented many challenges to the artist, from transporting technology across media to collecting data on a large scale. Dabbling in social, cultural, and ethical issues, this exhibition though married to AI, asks pertinent questions about the world around us, in a manner similar to any traditional art form..It may sound strange. But the art world is constantly evolving, and at a pace, we cannot begin to fathom. Back in November 2017, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi went under the hammer at Christie’s, many questioned its provenance. Was it really by the Renaissance artist, hushed voices asked. To avoid such scepticism, and in some cases, consequent scandal, many auction houses today use what is known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

UI to study automation impact on clerical work

Automation is changing everyone’s jobs, even secretaries and receptionists, office assistants and mailroom clerks.
But while numerous studies and think pieces have thought about how automation is affecting factory workers, engineers, or truck drivers, few have looked at how artificial intelligence will change clerical jobs.
A $150,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to researchers in the University of Iowa’s Tippie College of Business and College of Engineering will start the process of answering those questions according to a release. The one-year grant from NSF’s Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program will look at how artificial intelligence will change clerical jobs, including how many might be eliminated.
“We don’t often think about artificial intelligence and clerical work, the kind of filing and collating and administrative jobs that have been traditionally lower-paying jobs held by women,” says Beth Livingston, assistant professor of management & entrepreneurship in Tippie and a co-investigator on the grant. She says that many of those jobs are the entry point to careers for many people who don’t have college degrees or other credentials that have become in many cases key to career success, so learning more about how that work will be affected by technology is vital to keep those doors open.
She says automation could affect clerical jobs in any number of ways, from robots taking over filing jobs, answering phones or working reception desks, or machine learning advising managers on what decisions they should make.
“We want to understand the challenges that workers who have these jobs will have and learn about what they will need to do to adapt,” she says.
Researchers will focus on laying out a research agenda, looking at what existing research says and meeting with experts from across numerous fields to find out what questions they should ask and what directions to pursue. They will also conduct focus groups with clerical workers and ask how they think automation will impact their jobs and how concerned they are about that.
Ms. Livingston says researchers expect to create a body of research that will get ahead of the automation trend, so employers, policymakers, labor economists, and others will have a better sense of the impacts before they happen. She says that few people bothered to think about the impact that automation would have on manufacturing in advance, and the result was a significant level of economic and labor disruption that could have been mitigated if people had thought about how to minimize the damage.
She said that after one year, the researchers will seek a follow-up grant from NSF to answer the questions they’ve raised.
