Rubenstein Fellow at the Brookings Institution and an adjunct professor and affiliated scholar at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.As the world confronts the outbreak of coronavirus, many have lauded AI as our omniscient secret weapon. Although corporate press releases and some media coverage sing its praises, AI will play only a marginal role in our fight against Covid-19. While there are undoubtedly ways in which it will be helpful—and even more so in future pandemics—at the current moment, technologies like data reporting, telemedicine, and conventional diagnostic tools are far more impactful. So how can you avoid falling for the AI hype? In a recent Brookings Institution report, I identified the necessary heuristics for a healthy skepticism of AI claims around Covid-19.Let’s start with the most important rule: always look to the subject matter experts. If they are applying AI, fantastic! If not, be wary of AI applications from software companies that don’t employ those experts. Data is always dependent on its context, which takes expertise to understand. Does data from China apply to the United States? How long might exponential growth continue? By how much will our interventions reduce transmission? All models, even AI models, make assumptions about questions like these. If the modelers don’t understand those assumptions, their models are more likely to be harmful than helpful.Trending NowDr. Seema Yasmin Debunks Coronavirus MythsThankfully, in the case of Covid-19, epidemiologists know quite a bit about the context of the data. Even though the virus is new and there is much to be learned, there is tremendous depth of expertise around what questions to ask and how they can be answered. Modern statistical epidemiology dates to the early 1900s, which means the field is incorporating a century of scientific research into its analyses. In contrast, machine learning methods tend to assume that everything can be learned directly from a data set, without incorporating the broader scientific context.Consider, for example, the claim that AI was the first to detect the coronavirus. Machine learning is very dependent on historical data to create meaningful insights. Since there is no database of prior Covid-19 outbreaks, AI alone cannot predict the spread of this new pandemic. What’s more, the claim implicitly overstates the ability of AI to inform us about huge and rare events, which is not the strength of AI at all. As it turns out, while software may have sounded the alarm, grasping the significance of the outbreak required human analysis.AI’s real value lies in its ability to create many minute predictions. For instance, the AI epidemiology company BlueDot has successfully helped the state of California monitor the spread of the coronavirus. The company augmented traditional epidemiological models with machine learning, using flight patterns to predict the spread at the zip code level. That’s the value of AI. Those granular estimates can enable precise allocation of funding, supplies, and medical staff.AdvertisementThat said, you should not trust all individualized estimates from AI. Frequently, a company will report accuracy—the percent of predictions that are correct during development—to purport the effectiveness of an AI model. Unfortunately, this number is easy to juke and often offers an incomplete picture. For instance, Alibaba has claimed it can diagnose Covid-19 from CT scans with 96 percent accuracy. But, if you check in with the subject matter experts, you’ll see that the American College of Radiology has said that CT scans should not be used as “first-line tests to diagnose Covid-19.""

CINCINNATI - By leveraging the basics of artificial intelligence technology now used to predict risk for suicide or other mental health issues, researchers developed an AI system that analyzes linguistic patterns to predict a youth's risk for committing acts of school violence.
Study data published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics by physicians and clinical informaticians at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center show the system can detect the risk of aggression for individual subjects.
The AI system uses pattern-recognizing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. It combines the analytical scope and speed of information technology with clinical risk-assessment data and practitioner expertise, thereby automating a complex and time-consuming process, according to Yizhao Ni, PhD, co-principal investigator and a clinical informatician in the Division of Biomedical Informatics.
The technology uncovered multiple warning signs that could deliver useful clinical insights to assist personalized interventions, Ni explained. When fully developed, the system's built-in risk assessment scales and automated risk prediction algorithms should produce an accurate and scalable computerized screening service to prevent school violence.
""Students are physically or verbally bullied on school property, electronically through texting or social media, and youth violence costs society billions of dollars in health care expenses or lost productivity,"" Ni said, citing data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 ""Our study demonstrates that overall, our AI system matches the clinical judgements and accuracy of psychiatrists 94 percent of the time. It has tremendous potential to help address youth violence at school and eventually other mental health conditions.""
Empowering a Solution
Earlier research shows that using NLP and machine learning technologies pioneered at Cincinnati Children's and elsewhere improve risk prediction for mental health problems like suicide. Current study authors note that so far there are no automated solutions developed to predict the risk for violent behaviors at school. 
Recent advancements in school-based crime prevention programs demonstrate the best results occur when at-risk youth receive timely and individualized intervention, according to Drew Barzman, MD, co-principal investigator and director of the Child and Adolescent Forensic Psychiatry Service at Cincinnati Children's.
But high patient need and busy clinical schedules can constrain the ability to complete the complex, labor intensive tasks needed for timely clinical evaluation of mental health patients. An effective automated system could help overcome this challenge and help mental health caregivers deliver timely interventions based on a youth's individual needs, he said.
Study Design
The study was tested by embedding it as a clinical service in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Cincinnati Children's. The division's inpatient units receive about 30,000 psychiatric admissions annually. Its outpatient clinic has over 52,000 patient visits every year.
Conducted between May 2015 and April 2018, the study prospectively recruited 131 students between ages 10 and 18 years from middle and high schools in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee.
Clinical assessments by psychiatrists indicated that 68 students (52 percent) were considered high risk towards others. For analysis with the AI assessment tool, the patients were segmented into smaller groups to compare the system's predictive reliability when compared physician-generated patient clinical assessments. These comparisons yielded the AI system's overall risk assessment match rate of 94 percent.
Future development plans for the tool include seeking research collaborations with other medical institutions and school systems to test live implementation in educational and medical settings, according to the researchers. Researchers said that based on funding capabilities, this will be the next phase of their work. ###
The study was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (1R01LM012230, 1U01HG008666, UL1TR001425), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1R21HS024983) and internal funding from Cincinnati Children's.

How Artificial Intelligence Impacts Healthcare



The global healthcare market was valued at $8,452 Bn in 2018 and the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9%. The healthcare costs are also rising, and the industry is actively involved in not only reducing the costs of care but also enhancing the overall caregiving. 
Artificial Intelligence is one such technology — which if invested in and implemented thoroughly can improve the healthcare industry. 
AI technology has mighty applications in the industry, and the outcomes are going to be revolutionizing and impressive if adopted properly. The AI application in healthcare will work towards reducing spending and improving patient outcomes. 
Currently, the influence of AI in healthcare is still at its nascent stage. Even in these early years, you can see a phenomenal improvement in the operations and healthcare costs.
What is the one issue that the healthcare industry faces? There are a lot of tasks that require human intervention, and most of them are repetitive in nature. This consumes a lot of time and energy of the resources, leaving limited to no time for important and core tasks. Apart from this, the patients are not empowered, and there is no system where their care needs can be met instantaneously.
Many healthcare providers are planning to invest in Artificial Intelligence. The initial investment is mostly focused on the admin areas. Gradually, the industry will move its investment in the clinical segments.
#1 Managing the EHR
Electronic health records brought about the much-needed transformation in the healthcare industry. The transition from paper-based records to something more intelligent and improved was worth it. However, with this transition came the limitations of data overload and seemingly long documentation. This led to complexities in handling the data and managing it.
Artificial Intelligence seems to be taking this aspect a bit too seriously and planning to transform it. The idea is to automate most of the processes involved in managing and maintaining these records.
The clinical documentation, which is the most important aspect, involves a lot of time and effort. Combine the Natural Language Processing abilities of AI with voice recognition and dictation, you can process the documents with ease and comfort. With an effective and intuitive UI, you can retrieve the information and even store it effortlessly.
With all the information related to medication and the medical condition available in real-time, doctors can treat the patients with ease, without worrying about the overdose of the drugs. They will be aware of the allergies and infections the patient has, which helps them improve the caregiving. The next set of medications is also recorded in the health records, making it accessible to the users as well.
#2 Virtual Assistance
The second most sought after the influence of AI in the healthcare industry is in the form of a virtual assistant.
Virtual assistance helps the patient overcome their issues and manage their health in a better way. It helps the patients feel empowered and understand their goals better and work towards them. it is almost as if they have an assistant taking personal care of them. This will help the healthcare industry shower in-person care and help the patients recover faster.
The virtual assistants are responsible for timely reminders. These reminders help the patients take their medicines and ensure they don’t miss out on the appointments with the caregiver or the doctor.
In case the patients are on a strict diet, the assistants can help by sharing diet plans, healthy ways of eating and other aspects.
Artificial intelligence comes in many forms from virtual assistance, bots, and digital access to doctors’ care.
Many patients need to procure medicines regularly, which they fail to remember. The virtual assistant will take note of the date when the medicines will finish, and help the patients reorder their medicines for the month.
In case of emergency, the virtual assistant will take remote help from the doctor and get immediate assistance. They will also notify the patients about the upcoming appointments and tests that they need to take before visiting the doctor next.
In short, they will assist and remind the patient for everything needed, thus indulging in self-care goals.
#3 Proactive Care
Earlier, before technology intervention, doctors used to offer reactive care. In this method, the disease was diagnosed, symptoms studied, and then care was offered to them. However, things have changed with AI. You would notice that the systems are not able to study your medical condition and analyze your body to understand the high-risk factors. 
For instance, if you have a family history of diabetes, then the system will monitor your body and keep a close eye on the transforming conditions. The system will immediately identify the symptoms that will lead to diabetes or possible condition. 
When the symptoms are identified, you will receive alerts that will ask you to conduct a test or change your diet. This will majorly depend on the factors identified, the algorithm fed into the machine, and other aspects.
The system will monitor all the factors and offer suggestive healthcare remedies, which will make your life smooth and easy.
#4 Bots for Support
In many cases, the healthcare providers, especially the caregivers are busy throughout the day. This makes it difficult for them to offer patient management and ensure that the patients remember their appointments. They are also unable to keep track of the schedule of the day, and in many cases, they don’t possess all the reports related to the patient.
The bots do a wonderful job of assisting and providing assistance. The bots will not only provide alerts in real-time to the caregivers but also send the alerts to the patients, thus ensuring proper scheduling.
Apart from this, immediate customer service happens to be a tedious affair for the stakeholders of the healthcare industry. With bots, the physicians and other caregivers can support the patient immediately, and ensure they get timely solutions.
#5 Personalized Services
Personalize services in the healthcare industry are possible with every segment of the healthcare industry. For instance, healthcare insurance is an important part of the industry. Most people look for options that suit their requirements, premium budget, and other factors. 
AI will consider everything and offer personalized insurance solutions that cater to your needs. It will also consider the external factors responsible for the choice before helping you choose the right insurance solution.
Caregiving is an important part of the healthcare industry. Personalizing the treatment plan can improve the patient’s health and empower them. For instance, the same treatment cannot be given to two different individuals. Though they are suffering from the same problem. One person would be allergic to a particular component while the other may not. 
You will need to devise the treatment plan after considering all the factors, medical history, diagnosis, and family history. It is impossible for you to go through all this data and build the insights correctly — that’s why you need AI. 
Incorporating this technology, you will be able to offer personalized treatment plans, and ensure better facilities for the patient. To know more about how Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing eCommerce, you can refer to this blog to know 5 different ways how it is transforming the industry. 
Summing Up
A lot of healthcare organizations and hospitals are upping their game by investing a good amount in Artificial Intelligence and using the latest Artificial Intelligence frameworks and tools. They aim to improve their services and offer better care management. From advancing their diagnosis to improving their treatment methods, the stakeholders are working towards offering fulfilling solutions to healthcare issues. 
In combination with Blockchain and IoT, AI will offer impressive solutions to the healthcare industry, and there are many reasons why Artificial Intelligence is important. Moreover, share your views on AI and how it will revolutionize different industries.

Researchers unveil a pruning algorithm to make artificial intelligence applications run faster

                                        by Kim Martineau,                                                                                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology







                MIT researchers have proposed a technique for shrinking deep learning models that they say is simpler and produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods. It works by retraining the smaller, pruned model at its faster, initial learning rate. Credit: Alex Renda
             

As more artificial intelligence applications move to smartphones, deep learning models are getting smaller to allow apps to run faster and save battery power. Now, MIT researchers have a new and better way to compress models.





It's so simple that they unveiled it in a tweet last month: Train the model, prune its weakest connections, retrain the model at its fast, early training rate, and repeat, until the model is as tiny as you want.
""That's it,"" says Alex Renda, a Ph.D. student at MIT. ""The standard things people do to prune their models are crazy complicated.""
Renda discussed the technique when the International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR) convened remotely this month. Renda is a co-author of the work with Jonathan Frankle, a fellow Ph.D. student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and Michael Carbin, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science—all members of the Computer Science and Artificial Science Laboratory.
The search for a better compression technique grew out of Frankle and Carbin's award-winning Lottery Ticket Hypothesis paper at ICLR last year. They showed that a deep neural network could perform with only one-tenth the number of connections if the right subnetwork was found early in training. Their revelation came as demand for computing power and energy to train ever larger deep learning models was increasing exponentially, a trend that continues to this day. Costs of that growth include a rise in planet-warming carbon emissions and a potential drop in innovation as researchers not affiliated with big tech companies compete for scarce computing resources. Everyday users are affected, too. Big AI models eat up mobile-phone bandwidth and battery power.






The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis triggered a series of mostly theoretical follow-on papers. But at a colleague's suggestion, Frankle decided to see what lessons it might hold for pruning, in which a search algorithm trims the number of nodes evaluated in a search tree. The field had been around for decades, but saw a resurgence after the breakout success of neural networks at classifying images in the ImageNet competition. As models got bigger, with researchers adding on layers of artificial neurons to boost performance, others proposed techniques for whittling them down.
Song Han, now an assistant professor at MIT, was one pioneer. Building on a series of influential papers, Han unveiled a pruning algorithm he called AMC, or AutoML for model compression, that's still the industry standard. Under Han's technique, redundant neurons and connections are automatically removed, and the model is retrained to restore its initial accuracy.
In response to Han's work, Frankle recently suggested in an unpublished paper that results could be further improved by rewinding the smaller, pruned model to its initial parameters, or weights, and retraining the smaller model at its faster, initial rate.
In the current ICLR study, the researchers realized that the model could simply be rewound to its early training rate without fiddling with any parameters. In any pruning regimen, the tinier a model gets, the less accurate it becomes. But when the researchers compared this new method to Han's AMC or Frankle's weight-rewinding methods, it performed better no matter how much the model shrank.
It's unclear why the pruning technique works as well as it does. The researchers say they will leave that question for others to answer. As for those who wish to try it, the algorithm is as easy to implement as other pruning methods, without time-consuming tuning, the researchers say.
""It's the pruning algorithm from the 'Book,'"" says Frankle. ""It's clear, generic, and drop-dead simple.""
Han, for his part, has now partly shifted focus from compression AI models to channeling AI to design small, efficient models from the start. His newest method, Once for All, also debuts at ICLR. Of the new learning rate method, he says: ""I'm happy to see new pruning and retraining techniques evolve, giving more people access to high-performing AI applications.""

Using data has been an important element of Bayer Crop Science for decades, but the organization got a real data-driven shot in the arm with Bayer’s 2018 acquisition of Monsanto. Since then, it has sought to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to every aspect of its business.
One area where AI is playing an increasingly important role is precision agriculture. Traditional farming today means planting your field with seeds, spraying the entire field with fertilizer and pesticides, and irrigating the entire field. But fields aren’t uniform: The soil isn’t necessarily the same across the field, some parts need more fertilizer or less; some areas need more water or less; and so on. Precision agriculture seeks to bring more intelligence to the process.
[ Learn the secrets of highly successful data analytics teams. | Beware the 12 myths of data analytics and the sure-fire ways organizations fail at data analytics. | Get the latest on data analytics by signing up for CIO newsletters. ]
“For precision planting and precision farming, companies like Bayer work really closely with the farmers to understand their land, their acreage, the type of soil they have, the water flow, and then work with them,” says Michelle Lacy, data strategy lead for R&D in the Plant Biotechnology Division at Bayer Crop Science. “These are the best seeds; these are the best plant breeds that work well in this area of your farm. Planting the right seed type — the right corn line or soybean line or what have you — that will thrive in that soil type or the amount of water or nitrogen that you have. That’s precision farming.”











 
 
 
This data-driven approach to agriculture requires data to be collected by farmers and their equipment, such as combines that take soil measurements as they work; third parties, including academics and government employees; and Bayer Crop Science employees.

Bayer is now leveraging image analytics powered by TIBCO Spotfire visual analytics as part of that effort. It uses drones that take high-definition pictures to monitor crops. Plant height, color/greenness, and whether plants are diseased or infested with insects can be captured by images. A machine learning algorithm processes those images and blends the data with data about the soil, irrigation, and fertilization to provide in-depth insights into each part of a field. Bayer Crop Science uses TIBCO Data Virtualization software to understand the various data sources and schemas and bring them together without altering the physical source.
“In the past you’d have folks go in and walk the field and take measurements and observations on clipboards,” Lacy says. “They still do that to some extent, but for large data capture, that’s the use case where we use drones.”











 
 
 
Reaping value from drone data
In addition to helping farmers, that data also drives Bayer Crop Science’s research into new plant strains. The images can be used to compare an insect-resistant or disease-resistant strain against control groups. In areas affected by tornados, AI can stitch together drone images to show which crops stood up or fell over during storms.
“It’s hard to know how much damage you have just by eyeballing it because corn plants are really tall,” Lacy says. “So being able to fly over it and assess the damage is another use case for image analytics and our drones. It’s just faster. We can get information either to our labs or our farmers a lot quicker.”
Lacy says one key to Bayer Crop Science’s data-driven transformation has been its adherence to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data principles. FAIR is a sort of data bill of rights that says users should be able to find their data easily, users should be able to access the data they need when making decisions (while still following cyber security policies), data should be interoperable, and data should be reusable.











 
 
 
“It’s extremely important,” Lacy says. “It’s the foundation of our data strategy.”

Ask




Often, data developed by one group can be helpful to work undertaken by other groups. To make efficient use of the data, the various groups need to know the data exists and how to find it, and the data must be compatible.
“If you’re running various assays on a single plant, whether it’s field assays or you’re running different experiments in a lab, you’ve got to be able to bring that data together,” Lacy says. “You can think of it as a jigsaw puzzle and all these different assays you run are pieces of that puzzle. The project lead has to put those pieces back together.”

ECS Federal won a small contract on a big topic: $83 million for prototyping integrated artificial intelligence platforms for the U.S. Army.
The work will take place over the next three years under a cost-plus fixed-fee contract to account for additional costs that may be incurred, according to the award notice. The Army says it is undergoing a “foundational” year for data migration and IT modernization that will form the basis of future deployments of AI. ECS will research and prototype platforms that the service’s future algorithms could be built on.
The Army is exploring AI’s use in the battlefield and in back-office operations. Some systems have run into roadblocks that need stronger data collection or more-mature AI technology, like the platforms ECS might deliver. The notice did not include details on the platforms ECS will be researching and developing.
The service’s leadership continues to highlight the technology’s role in the military. “AI has become the coin of the realm,” Alexander Miller, a senior adviser for science and technology in the Army, said during a NextGov event today.

AWS Announces General Availability of Amazon Augmented Artificial Intelligence (A2I)








Source: Amazon










Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Augmented Artificial Intelligence (A2I), a fully managed service that makes it easy to add human review to machine learning predictions to improve model and application accuracy by continuously identifying and improving low confidence predictions. Amazon A2I helps developers add human review for model predictions to new or existing applications using reviewers from Mechanical Turk, third party vendors, or their own employees. Amazon A2I makes it easier for developers to build the human review system, structure the review process, and manage the human review workforce. For example, developers could use Amazon A2I to quickly spin up and manage a workforce of humans to review and validate the accuracy of machine learning predictions for an application that extracts financial information from scanned mortgage documents or an application that uses image recognition to identify counterfeit items online, so that the quality of results improve over time. There are no upfront commitments to use Amazon A2I, and users pay only for each review needed. To get started with Amazon A2I, visit aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai
Today, machine learning provides highly accurate predictions (known as “inferences”) for a variety of use cases, including identifying objects in images, extracting text from scanned documents, or transcribing and understanding spoken language. In each case, machine learning models provide an inference and a confidence score that expresses how certain the model is in its prediction. The higher the confidence number, the more the result can be trusted. Typically, when developers receive a high confidence result they can trust that the prediction is accurate, and, depending on the use case, they can use it to fully automate a process. For example, developers of a social media application that matches a user’s photos to celebrity faces might rely on an 80% confidence score to generate and return a lot of entertaining matches. However, there are other times when it is strongly recommended to have both high confidence (up to 99%) and human review, such as public safety use cases involving law enforcement. In situations where the confidence score is lower than desired and/or human judgment is required, reviews can be used to validate the prediction. This interplay between machine learning and human reviewers is critical to the success of machine learning systems, but human reviews are challenging and expensive to build and operate at scale, often involving multiple workflow steps, operating custom software to manage human review tasks and results, and recruiting and managing large groups of reviewers. As a result, developers sometimes spend more time managing the human review process than building the intended application, or they have to forego having human reviews, which leads to less confidence in deploying applications that utilize machine learning.
With Amazon A2I, developers can add human review to machine learning applications without the need to build or manage expensive and cumbersome systems for human review. Amazon A2I provides over 60 pre-built human review workflows for common machine learning tasks (e.g. object detection in images, transcription of speech, and content moderation, etc.) that allow machine learning predictions from Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract to be human-reviewed more easily. Developers who build custom machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker (or other on-premises or cloud tools) can set up human review for their specific use case in the Augmented AI console or via its Application Programming Interface (API). After setting a confidence threshold for model predictions, developers can choose to have predictions below that threshold reviewed by Amazon Mechanical Turk and its 500,000 global workforce of independent contractors, third-party organizations who specialize in business process outsourcing (e.g. iVision, CapeStart Inc., and iMerit), or their own private, in-house reviewers. Developers can specify the number of workers per review and Amazon A2I then routes each review to the precise number of reviewers. For example, a company building a system for processing financial loan applications using Amazon Textract can easily configure Amazon A2I to work with Amazon Textract outputs such that forms that have a confidence score less than 99% will be routed to human reviewers from their private workforce. Human-validated results are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and developers can set up Amazon CloudWatch Events notifications to review metadata about inference accuracy and retrieve the results.
“We often hear from our customers that Amazon SageMaker helps speed training, tuning, and deploying custom machine learning models, while fully managed services like Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract make it easy to build applications that incorporate machine learning without requiring any machine learning expertise. But even with these advancements, our customers still say there are critical use cases where human judgment is required like in law enforcement investigations, or times when human review can be used to resolve the ambiguity in predictions when confidence levels fall below a given threshold for less sensitive use cases, and the current human review process involves a lot of custom effort and cost,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Today, we’re excited to help our customers remove another obstacle to building machine learning applications with the launch of Amazon A2I, which makes it significantly easier and faster to incorporate human judgment into machine learning applications in order to ensure higher quality predictions over a sustained period of time.”
Amazon A2I is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), EU West (London), EU West (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai).
National Health Service, Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) is part of the UK National Health Service and provides a range of support services to NHS organizations, NHS contractors, and patients. As part of their business process services, they process 54 million paper prescriptions and other healthcare documents each month. “The NHS is investing in the promise of AI to improve the quality of public healthcare across the UK. Human judgment is critical and in fact is often required for decisions involving medical payments,” said Chris Suter, Head of Cloud Platforms and Innovation, NHS BSA. “Amazon Textract is compelling because it offers AI powered extraction of text and structured data from virtually any document. We are excited about Amazon Augmented AI because it allows us to take advantage of machine learning while still applying human judgment. That’s a game changer for us.”
As America’s Un-carrier, T-Mobile US, Inc. is redefining the way consumers and businesses buy wireless services through leading product and service innovation. “Providing relevant information, such as account details and available discounts, in real time to our customer care agents while they are in live conversations with customers is one of the ways T-Mobile uses machine learning to improve customer experience. Using A2I, we will be able to ensure that our models continuously deliver top-quality insights by having humans validate random samples of model predictions,” said Heather Nollis, Machine Learning Engineer, T-Mobile. “Trust is the hardest thing to build when it comes to machine learning, and A2I will allow us to make sure that our models are making the fewest mistakes.”
Deloitte is helping transform organizations around the globe. The organization continuously evolves how it works and how it looks at marketplace challenges so it can continue to deliver measurable, sustainable results for its clients and communities. “Part of setting our clients up for success is helping them leverage the latest technology. Using machine learning enables us to help improve our clients’ systems and boost their productivity while reducing time to market for products, services, and applications. As part of providing the latest advancements in ML to our clients, we see the benefits of human-in-the-loop systems adding an extra layer of confidence to ML applications,” said Beena Ammanath, Managing Director at Deloitte Consulting LLP. “Our clients in the insurance industry, for example, could use A2I to help verify the accuracy of ML models for automated image-based vehicle damage detection and analysis of text-based insurance claims. We’re excited to see the many ways our clients across industries could benefit from incorporating A2I into their ML workflows.”
Belle Fleur believes the machine learning revolution is altering the way we live, work, and relate to one another, and will transform every business in every industry. “We started using Amazon Textract with one of our financial services clients and quickly realized that coupling that service with Amazon A2I allows them to go through huge quantities of documents and extract relevant data needed for their clients. Adding Amazon A2I helped us incorporate human judgment for documents that require contextual interpretation and validate the data,” said Tia Dubuisson, President at Belle Fleur. “Not only did this decrease the time spent on human validation, but it also pulled all the relevant extracted data into one place in an easy to understand workflow for reviewers so that they are able to quickly and easily review machine learning outputs from Amazon Textract. Amazon A2I not only provides us and our customers peace of mind that the more nuanced data extracted is reviewed by humans, but it also helps train and improve our machine learning models over time through continuous auditing and improvement.”
