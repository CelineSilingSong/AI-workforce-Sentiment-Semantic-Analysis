        Ethical implications of artificial intelligence

            AI presents a new set of ethical challenges for business leaders whose deployment of mechanisation may have profound effects on the workforce and society.

            By Jeff Drew, Ken Tysiac, and Samantha White
1 December 2018
EthicsTechnology and analytics










In the race to adopt rapidly developing technologies, organisations run the risk of overlooking potential ethical implications. And that could produce unwelcome results, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) systems that employ machine learning.
Machine learning is a subset of AI in which computer systems are taught to learn on their own. Algorithms allow the computer to analyse data to detect patterns and gain knowledge or abilities without having to be specifically programmed. It is this type of technology that empowers voice-enabled assistants such as Apple's Siri or the Google Assistant, among myriad other uses. In the accounting space, the many potential applications of AI include real-time auditing and analysis of company financials.
Data is the fuel that powers machine learning. But what happens if the data fed to the machine are flawed or the algorithm that guides the learning isn't properly configured to assess the data it's receiving? Things could go very wrong remarkably quickly.
Microsoft learned this lesson in 2016 when the company designed a chatbot called Tay to interact with Twitter users. A group of those users took advantage of a flaw in Tay's algorithm to corrupt it with racist and otherwise offensive ideas. Within 24 hours of launch, the chatbot had said the Holocaust was ""made up"", expressed support for genocide, and had to be taken offline.
With regulatory and legal frameworks struggling to keep pace with the rapid pace of technological change, public demand is growing for greater transparency as to how these tools and technologies are being used. The UK's Institute of Business Ethics (IBE) recently issued a briefing urging organisations to examine the risks, impacts, and side effects that AI might have for their business and their stakeholders, as well as wider society. Tackling the issues requires these diverse groups to work together. (See ""10 Questions to Ask About Adopting or Using AI"", at bottom of page, for key considerations listed in the IBE report.)
The research identifies a number of challenges facing business leaders. These include:

What degree of control can we (as an organisation) retain over our machines' decision-making processes?
How can we ensure that the systems act in line with the organisation's core values?
Since biased algorithms can lead to a discriminatory impact, how can we ensure fairness and accuracy?

The report also encourages companies to ""improve their communications around AI, so that people feel that they are part of its development and not its passive recipients or even victims"". For this to be achieved, ""[e]mployees and other stakeholders need to be empowered to take personal responsibility for the consequences of their use of AI, and they need to be provided with the skills to do so"".
The report proposes a framework outlining ten core values and principles for the use of AI in business. These are intended to ""minimise the risk of ethical lapses due to an improper use of AI technologies"". The values are:

Accuracy.
Respect of privacy.
Transparency.
Interpretability.
Fairness.
Integrity.
Control.
Impact.
Accountability.
Learning.

Avoiding the 'black box' problem
Companies applying AI to the finance function face the challenge of designing algorithms that produce unbiased results and are not too complex for users to understand how they work and make decisions.
MindBridge Analytics, based in Ottawa, Canada, develops computer-aided audit tech powered by AI. The product uses a hybrid of advanced algorithmic techniques to enhance a human auditor's ability to detect and address unusual financial circumstances.
A key aspect of the MindBridge application is that it explains why certain transactions have been highlighted and then leaves final decision-making authority to a human, said chief technology officer Robin Grosset.
""The algorithms give weighted scores to features of transactions for subsequent human review in order to identify the risk of irregular circumstances,"" he said.
This transparency is essential to avoid the ""black box"" problem, in which a computer or other system produces results but provides little to no explanation for how those results were produced. In the case of machine learning, the greater the complexity of an algorithm, the more difficult it is for users to understand why the machine has made a certain decision.
""Almost all concerns that relate to 'improperly set up AI' can be solved by the AI explaining its thinking,"" Grosset said. ""If the human counterpart of the AI can understand why something is flagged, then they can make better informed decisions. Human judgement is still a key component of a balanced AI system.""
Avoiding bias in the data
Another challenge is to avoid bias in the algorithm and in the dataset the algorithm uses for learning.
One way of mitigating bias is to use combinations of learning types, including unsupervised learning, Grosset said. ""Supervised learning is based on label data, and often the labels themselves create bias,"" he said. ""Humans essentially bring their own biases to machine-learning scenarios. By contrast, unsupervised learning has no labels and essentially will find what is in the data without any bias.
""The key piece of advice here is to curate the data that is used as input to a system to ensure the signals in the data support the training objectives. For example, if you are creating an AI to automate driving a car, you want your AI to learn from good drivers and not from bad drivers,"" Grosset said.
MindBridge's testing process includes validation testing for algorithm intent, with regression testing. The process involves synthetic and real data.
Amy Vetter, CPA/CITP, CGMA, author of the book Integrative Advisory Services: Expanding Your Accounting Services Beyond the Cloud and CEO of The B3 Method Institute, advises organisations to seek alternative perspectives from professionals who do the work today that may be automated in the future.
""It's important to include them in the discussion and decision-making about how to incorporate prospective uses of AI into future workflow of the firm and what skills the staff will need so the appropriate training and goal setting is incorporated into any implementation plan,"" she said.
At MindBridge, the chief information security officer and chief technology officer are responsible for key aspects of technical use of AI and related privacy issues. The staff also includes research scientists who focus on privacy-preserving algorithm design.
Implications for society
AI provides a difficult set of ethical questions for society as well. One question centres on the preservation of the workforce. In the accounting profession, for example, AI can extract data from thousands of lease contracts to enable faster implementation of new lease accounting standards.
This can enable the people who would have handled data extraction to perform more complicated accounting tasks and perhaps even contribute to strategy. This can be a positive development as those people perform more meaningful work.
But if the people whose tasks are replaced by AI lose their jobs rather than being promoted to higher-level work, the implications for society can be ominous. If people who perform repetitive tasks across multiple professions and industries all lose their jobs instead of being promoted, implementation of AI could leave many people without options for work and damage their lives and the economy.
The trucking and haulage industry alone could experience enormous job losses if self-driving vehicles replace human drivers. In 2016, more than 3.3 million drivers were employed in trucking in the US and an additional 318,700 heavy goods vehicle drivers were working in the UK, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the UK Department for Transport.
""That creates an ethical problem without a shadow of a doubt, but also a pragmatic problem because these populations [people who perform tasks that can be automated] were in the heart of the economic system,"" said Jeremy Ghez, affiliate professor of economics and international affairs at HEC Paris — a management sciences teaching and research institute. ""And if they're not there anymore, then the system becomes unstable. There isn't anyone to sell stuff to.""
Ghez said it's understandable that businesses will look at AI as a way to cut costs. But he said it's also imperative for business leaders to be more imaginative with their human resources now, utilising more effectively the things that people can do — and machines can't do. The human skills of using intuition and building relationships with customers might be differentiators for businesses whose competitors may take automation to an extreme and perhaps frustrate customers with chatbots and other applications that remove a personal touch from customer-facing positions.
While businesses attempt to solve their own AI-related ethical issues, the public sector also will have a role to play. Regulators obviously will have a say in whether self-driving vehicles will be permitted on the roads. That will be the easy part. It will be more challenging to consider other issues such as workforce preservation and how to protect segments of the population that may be disadvantaged by biases in algorithms.
The technology may be here now, but the ethical rules for managing AI will take time to develop.
""It opens up a whole wide range of questions that the private sector is not going to feel very comfortable to answer immediately altogether,"" Ghez said. ""I think it's going to require a multidisciplinary effort and bridges to be built to figure out how to go to win-win situations.""

10 questions to ask about adopting or using AI
1. What is the purpose of our job, and what AI do we need to achieve it?
2. Do we understand how these systems work? Are we in control of this technology?
3. What are the risks of its usage? Who benefits and who carries the risks related to the adoption of the new technology?
4. Who bears the costs for it? Would it be considered fair if it became widely known?
5. What are the ethical dimensions, and what values are at stake?
6. What might be the unexpected consequences?
7. Do we have other options that are less risky?
8. What is the governance process for introducing AI?
9. Who is responsible for AI? Because machines are not moral agents, who is responsible for the outcome of the decision-making process of an artificial agent?
10. How is the impact of AI to be monitored?

They have all been dreamed up by a machine. And they provide insights into how our own brains work.DeepMindAdvances in artificial intelligence are allowing algorithms to be trained to not only recognise objects in the world around them, but draw them too (Credit: DeepMind)Advances in artificial intelligence are allowing algorithms to be trained to not only recognise objects in the world around them, but draw them too. Much like a human artist, they can create images based on what they have seen.But rather than building up a picture with brush strokes, they do it pixel by pixel until they produce something of photographic quality. The resulting images look real at first sight, but closer inspection reveals something is very wrong with each big cat in these pictures.DeepMindAlgorithms like BigGan can reproduce textures but don't know that spiders should only have eight legs (Credit: DeepMind)How do we know that spiders have eight legs, or that cars need wheels that all point in the same direction in order to work properly? The answer lies in the information we begin to absorb about the world from an early age. The networks of neurons in our brains are shaped by the information sent to them by our eyes and our other senses as we experience our lives.Machine learning algorithms are trained in a similar way – they are shown many, many examples and slowly, over time, learn to recognise them. The main difference is that while our brains can learn from just a few examples, an AI requires millions before it starts to recognise patterns.DeepMindThe cars dreamed up by BigGan often have wheels in the wrong place and body shapes that seem to defy physics (Credit: DeepMind)These images were generated by an AI algorithm called BigGan, developed by researchers at DeepMind, the Alphabet-owned AI company. It is a type of machine learning approach that uses systems known as Generative Adversarial Networks, or Gans.These are algorithms that work in opposition to each other – one trained to produce images of objects and another that looks at what it has produced to spot the differences between the AI-generated pictures and those of real life objects. This network feeds back on itself, continually improving.“Over time, the model learns what these features are and how these features are composed,” says Andrew Brock, a computer scientist at Heriot-Watt University who helped to develop BigGan during a placement with DeepMind.But as we can see here, while it recognises that cars and school buses should have wheels and certain shapes of bodywork, it doesn’t quite understand how they fit together.DeepMindWould you want to get on board an aircraft or boat that looked like this (Credit: DeepMind)Few people would want to get on board an aircraft or a boat that looks like it defies the laws of physics.DeepMindThe BigGan algorithm often leaves out crucial details like eyes and beaks (Credit: DeepMind)All this training can help the AI to learn what features make an image compared to a square of random pixels. These features can be textures like fur or feathers, structures like a face, or building, or photographic elements like lighting or reflections.“Studying generative image models in isolation helps us tease out what they are currently good at understanding, and what they struggle with,” says Brock. “Two obvious examples with BigGan are that it’s good at generating textures like fur, grass and the sky, but it struggles with counting, hence spiders with too many legs.”This might be why at first glance the images look right, but on closer inspection we can see that something occurs too often, or is missing entirely.DeepMindElephants appear with too many legs, or no trunk (Credit: DeepMind)“There’s nothing in the BigGan algorithm that explicitly learns to count,” says Brock. “So, it doesn’t really have the capacity to say ‘there’s too many legs’ or ‘there’s not enough toes.’”DeepMindThe houses it creates have a dystopian feel to them (Credit: DeepMind)Where Gans appear to fall down is their understanding how things can vary when viewed from different angles, for example. The human brain is very good at this task: We can often imagine what might lie behind a newspaper behind held by someone on a train, for example, or roughly what shape a house might be if we are presented with one view of it.Machines are not so good at this. Instead, they rely upon the data they are trained on and variations in the angle or viewpoint can confuse it. To overcome this, the algorithm needs many more examples to learn. But researchers at DeepMind are already developing systems that can do some of this mental ‘filling in’ to help them produce more realistic images.DeepMindThe dogs look realistic but all have something out of place (Credit: DeepMind)Ask a four-year-old child to draw a dog and she’ll probably give you something that doesn’t look anything like man’s best friend. What it would have is the right number of legs, ears, eyes and a nose.AI algorithms, by comparison, can produce dogs that look very like the real thing, but should their eyes really be that high up on their face (top left) or should they have that many legs (bottom left)? Sometimes it decides to give them none of these things at all and concentrates on what it can do really well – fur.DeepMindThese poor dogs are missing eyes and legs (Credit: DeepMind)DeepMindPictures of Queen's guards and swimmers look terrifying (Credit: DeepMind)When it comes to replicating images of humans, AI can have mixed results. These BigGan images of members of the Queen's Guard look far from the well-polished facade of the real thing while the swimmers look like they have surfaced from some sort of surreal nightmare.According to Jeff Donahue and Karen Simonyan, who worked with Brock on BigGan, this is due to the high variation that exists between people in the first place. We all look different, so the algorithm gets confused about what a typical human should look like.“BigGan needs a lot more images than there are in the dataset we trained it on for the paper,” they say. But there are other Gans that are already producing photo-realistic pictures of entirely fictitious people (see “g is for…” in our recent a-z of AI).DeepMindBigGan can create beautiful looking soap bubbles but as it has never handled a wine glass or coffee cup, it does less well with this (Credit: DeepMind)Capturing something like the beauty of a soap bubble is something most of us would struggle with, but the AI does it almost perfectly here. Yet, never having drunk wine from a glass or a coffee cup, it struggles to know why the designs it comes up with are not ideal.“This model is only trained on still images, so it doesn’t learn anything about how objects move or interact with each other or the environment – it only sees snapshots,” says Brock. “It also doesn’t have any sort of decision making or interaction capabilities, so it can’t reach out and touch something in the image to see how the image would change.""DeepMindHaving never touched or handled objects, the AI does not learn in the same way as we do and has no concept how things work (Credit: DeepMind)""Exploration and observation is a big part of how we learn, but it’s not something that’s incorporated into this particular algorithm,” says Brock.DeepMindThese look like turtles, but on closer examination they are not (Credit: DeepMind)Producing near picture-perfect images is a useful parlour trick (although these turtles are far from perfect), but why train a machine to do this in the first place?“Looking forward, we expect our findings to be useful in the development of more complex intelligent systems,” says Brock. “For example, we would like to create models which understand the rich structure that underlies our complex visual world.”This would enable machines to start making more sense of the baffling, data-rich environment we live in. Our brains have an astonishing ability to make sense of this, picking out what it needs and discarding useless details.“Learning to generate realistic images is one way to do that,” adds Brock. “In order to draw something, one must, on some level, understand it.”DeepMindCats have odd features like their ears or eyes in BigGan's world  (Credit: DeepMind)With ears cocked at strange angles and eyes woefully misplaced, these cats are far from being unrecognisable – but they also look utterly wrong.Humans can almost instantly recognise a picture of a cat or dog. Images of these pets are among the most shared things on the internet. So why do machines seem to see them differently from us? DeepMindShopping trolleys in BigGan's world look a mess while teapots have an air of the improbable (Credit: DeepMind)“The kinds of deep learning neural networks used by today’s engineers operate nothing like the brain,” says Simon Stringer, head of the laboratory for theoretical neuroscience and artificial intelligence at the University of Oxford.The human brain, he explains, is able to understand the relationships between visual features at every scale in a scene. It can tell that an edge, for example, is part of one object, while another edge belongs to something else. An algorithm like BigGan does not understand this, and so it creates shopping trolleys that look like tangled messes and teapots that no-one would be able to drink from.“This obviously underpins the ability of the brain to interpret and make sense of complex visual scenes,” says Stringer.Solving this problem in AI could lead to smarter machines that can think far more like humans do.Artificial intelligence",Why machines dream of spiders with 15 legs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So much so that it can seriously damage brand loyalty – according to research by Mastercard, a third of us have withdrawn our custom from a retailer due to our cards being refused.
Often this is due to the transaction being incorrectly flagged as fraudulent in some way – the algorithms which make the call on whether a payment is valid have erred on the side of caution, and sometimes they get it wrong.

Aside from the inconvenience, it causes us, the cost to businesses and the wider economy of these false declines is around $118 billion – an amount 13 times higher than the cost of actual card fraud.

But fear not because, once again, AI has come to the rescue. Through its Decision Intelligence and AI Express platforms, Mastercard has used predictive analytics powered by machine learning to cut the rate that this happens by 50%.
I had the chance to speak to Ajay Bhalla, the company’s president for global enterprise, risk and security, about how this technology works and how AI is now helping Mastercard achieve more of its strategic objectives.
Real time analytics means more accurate results 
Bhalla tells me that the quantum leap in the ability to both detect fraud and reduce false declines has come about through its acquisition of California-based artificial intelligence specialists Brighterion.

Technology developed with Brighterion has enabled it to move to analysing data in real time. Machine learning algorithms must be incredibly efficient to handle the 75 billion transactions per year happening at 45 million global locations, which are processed by the Mastercard network.
Today, the decisions of whether or not to decline a transaction are based on a constantly flowing stream of data, and self-teaching algorithms, rather than a static sample dataset and fixed rules, which has had impressive results.
Bhalla tells me that the artificial intelligence systems, because they are self-learning, are always current and there is no longer a learning lag happening.
He states: “What it does is goes through billions of transactions and figures out what is the propensity of the transaction being fraudulent, and it gives this advice to the bank in the system, when the transaction goes through for authorisation.
“It’s helped us to catch billions of dollars’ worth of fraud.”
The system uses a real time stream of transactional data, along with external data including anonymised and aggregated customer information, and geographical information.
Geographical information is highly useful because not only does it give an overview of the types of transactions which are “normal” for a particular area, it also reveals what patterns of fraudulent activity are associated with it. Again, all of this information is aggregated in real time as it happens.
This means that patterns of fraud – which is often carried out at large scale by organised gangs, who will target businesses in a particular location, or attempt to “cash out” at ATMs spread across a city - can be detected, tracked and stopped.
“This is really good from a consumer standpoint because it means faster approval for the consumer, and it means more genuine transactions get approved. And merchants love it because for merchants, more approvals mean more business,” says Bhalla.
The challenges of AI
Building smart, automated systems has been a core strategy at Mastercard for many years, Bhalla tells me, but the acquisition of Brighterion and the incorporation of its technology into Mastercard systems has been a move towards “pure” AI. Many areas of its business, from customer service to anti-money-laundering measures, are set to benefit from an AI overhaul.
One key challenge has been ensuring a consistently high quality of data – as errors in transaction records or other data stores will inevitably lead to even the smartest machines making bad decisions.
Bhalla puts his company’s success with this down to the more than 50 years’ experience it has at generating and verifying transactional records – “We have been doing it for many, many years,” he tells me, “but that’s generally the challenge – you have to make sure your data is very, very good.”
A second challenge is determining the priorities when it comes to making decisions on where in the business to deploy potentially costly AI infrastructure.
A decision was made early on that increasing customer satisfaction levels was most likely to bring about the biggest long-term benefits.
“It’s a question of prioritisation – which are the five key things we need to solve?” Bhalla tells me.
“And you know, our biggest thing we wanted to solve is customer experience, making sure that when you’re doing a transaction at the point-of-sale, you’re able to do it seamlessly – that’s our first priority.”
Beating the money launderers
To tackle money laundering, many of the AI principles involved are similar to those used in reducing false declines.
AI algorithms examine patterns in the transaction data, enabling them to see when groups of people or businesses are acting in a co-ordinated way, to set up accounts and push through transactions which may involve dirty money.
Another technology – natural language processing (NLP) is also deployed here, however. NLP uses algorithms designed to interpret natural human language essentially allowing computers to understand what humans are saying. This means they can draw insights from speech and writing, rather than just the numbers and code they traditionally process.
NLP can detect and determine connections between names, and groups of people, and is useful in scenarios where groups of people often use false names and go by aliases, or just subtly alter the spelling of their name, to avoid detection.
The IoT – looking ahead…
As for the future, Bhalla says that he is certain AI is going to become increasingly essential across the entire financial services industry, as transaction numbers grow, more and more commerce is done digitally, and criminals become increasingly sophisticated.
In particular the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) means that payment systems will have to handle an increasing number of automated transactions. This means AI routines will have to get stronger and faster to cope with the demand and increasingly complex use cases.
“The future world is getting more and more complicated – with your fridge making transactions, and your car driving itself to the charging station and making a transaction there.
“These are all going to be autonomous transactions – all the data that’s going to come out of these transactions will be very useful in helping us with our decisioning and also helping consumers manage their day-to-day lives better.”Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",The Amazing Ways How Mastercard Uses Artificial Intelligence To Stop Fraud And Reduce False Declines,,Enterprise & Cloud,The Amazing Ways How Mastercard Uses Artificial Intelligence To Stop Fraud And Reduce False Declines,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IT InfrastructureHow Deep Learning is Improving Artificial Intelligence
Deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence - it isn't always understood how these terms work together. Find out more about how deep learning plays into artificial intelligence.November 26, 2018 Catherine Metcalf 6 Comments  


Most people have a tendency to think of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of science fiction, but it’s become a very real technology that’s having a significant impact on the world. From the chat programs that help us resolve customer service issues to incorporation during on-demand app development to the robots that work on assembly lines, AI is everywhere. Its prevalence is only going to increase as the technology continues to develop.
Deep learning is one of the key factors in the rapid expansion and improvement of AI capabilities. Here are a few ways deep learning is improving AI.
What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. With machine learning, an algorithm is designed to help a machine learn from data. Deep learning performs a similar task, but on a much larger scale. It works with more data and can also learn with a greater degree of independence.
One of the key features behind deep learning is the application of neural networks. Neural networks are computer system modeled after the human brain; they’re made up of nodes that perform a similar function to that of neurons in the brain. When the system is fed data, it creates networks between the nodes as it learns.
The Impact of Deep Learning
Technologies supported by deep learning are now moving into different areas of the lives of consumers. The following are a few examples of the deep learning technologies that are currently available:
Smart Homes
Common household items like thermostats, refrigerators, and lights are now connecting to the internet and using AI to offer increased efficiency and convenience to homeowners. These items can connect to systems that use deep learning to find patterns in human behavior to predict things like the need for heating and lighting. 
Speech Recognition
Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that provides machines with the ability to process, understand, and generate human language. When you interact with something like Amazon Alexa or Siri, you are using a system that applies Natural Language Processing that is supported by deep learning algorithms.
Image Recognition 
Deep learning provides machines with the ability to recognize objects and images in ways that were previously impossible. 
A good example of this is the way Facebook can recognize the people in a photo without being told by the user. To do this, it creates templates of the faces and then uses deep learning to compare the templates and find a match. In the future, this deep learning capability could be used to train machines to analyze medical images and diagnose diseases with greater accuracy.
The Future of Deep Learning
Applications that depend on deep learning are going to become more common, and more businesses are going to experiment with this technology in the future. While this future is essentially inevitable, there are still some hurdles that need to be overcome.
The first is a matter of hardware. Neural networks are massive computer systems that are far more powerful and complex than anything most businesses would have access to. Additionally, these systems require incredible amounts of data in order to learn. For a business that is interested in deep learning, being able to provide the necessary hardware and data will be essential.

Yes, other problems and crises are more likely to cause economic downturns, economic recessions and increased unemployment in the relatively short term than technological progress.

On the other hand, the increasingly negative effects of climate change, including the progressive process of global warming, will be the source of a growing scale of various crises in the future, including food, economic, social, migration, natural, political, etc. crises. There may also be an increasing scale of economic downturns and recessions, which may result in periodic increases in unemployment.

Technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality would allow some crew members to work from shore, operating key sections of ships from thousands of miles away. The result could be semiautonomous warships that sail with smaller crews, putting fewer in harm’s way.The Telegraph reports that the Royal Navy could use A.I. and VR tech in the future to reduce the size of ship’s crews. The principle is similar to that used by unmanned aerial vehicle operators who control drones flying thousands of miles away. Sailors who can do their jobs remotely, such as operating sensors or weapons, could do so from bases on land where they are safe from enemy fire. Even ship captains could remain on shore, commanding their ships from naval bases on land. According to The Telegraph, BAE Systems has been pitching the concept as something useful to the UK Royal Navy. “Unlike on-board control rooms where officers are usually seated, in case the ship is struck by an enemy munition that would knock them off their feet, in an on-land control room officers could be allowed to walk freely around the room,” the newspaper quoted a BAE representative as stating. Aircraft were logically the first weapon systems to be remotely operated. Airplanes typically fly with small crews of two or less, fly short missions that don’t require maintenance, and are relatively disposable. Ships on the other hand are operated by crews numbering in the dozens to manage hundreds of tasks, remain at sea for months on end, require maintenance by trained personnel often while hundreds of miles from shore, and can easily cost a half-billion dollars or more. The complexity involved with operating warships is a tall order for A.I.- and VR-equipped sailors or land.Another problem with some ship personnel working from shore: Navies need to assume that their warships will be jammed or forced to operate without emitting radar and communications signals that enemy forces could use to locate them. Warships could also be jammed by the enemy or sustain damage that knocks out power or communications. If the link between ship and shore goes down, those jobs outsourced to land-based personnel don’t get done, at the worst possible time. In the meantime, BAE Systems is experimenting with augmented reality onboard the ship, allowing an “Officer of the Watch, responsible for the ship’s safety, to work outside of the operations room and still be able to see tactical data and other vital information.” The technology will use Microsoft’s Hololens and will debut at the Royal Navy’s Information Warrior 19 exercises in 2019.

On a bad hair day, though, “I look like a dandelion puff,” said Ms. Bibby, 41, a graphic designer in Tucson. Over the years, Ms. Bibby, who is of mixed race descent and describes her hair as “coarse, but not black hair,” has spent hundreds of dollars trying products to maximize the good days and minimize the bad. Six months ago, she found a winner: a custom-made $25 conditioner from a start-up called Prose. (She does not shampoo her hair.)“The first day I used it, I got out of the shower and the curl was already in my hair,” said Ms. Bibby, who used to have to work to bring the curl back. “It’s probably taken 10 minutes off my routine.”Prose, whose founders include a former L’Oréal vice president, uses a quiz, artificial intelligence algorithms and a 6,000-square-foot production space in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn to create what it hopes is each customer’s ideal product. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe company has shipped 110,000 bottles and will reach $1 million in monthly sales by its first birthday in January, and it is one of the biggest and most successful entrants in what has fast become one of the hottest spaces in the beauty industry: customizable hair care. On Monday the company announced that it had raised $18 million in new funding.Another start-up, the four-year-old Function of Beauty, uses its own quiz and algorithms (along with a Willy Wonka-esque 50,000-square-foot factory of custom-built machines). It has sold a million bottles, according to Zahir Dossa, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained computer scientist and the company’s chief executive. (Prices start at $36 for an eight-ounce set of shampoo and conditioner.)There is more competition coming. Schwarzkopf, a global cosmetics giant, is conducting trials of custom products in Japan (with plans to bring them to the United States). Its system includes a hand-held device with an infrared sensor that can detect the hair’s molecular structure and analyze its moisture levels. An in-salon machine that looks like the world’s fanciest coffee maker whips up products in 50 seconds, along with a label printed with a bar code for reordering.Unlike brands that offer different products for each hair “goal” (say, preserving color or thickening hair), companies that customize say they can combine ingredients that will fulfill all your hair needs in a single shampoo, conditioner or hair mask. Prose also adjusts based on environmental factors, which it gleans from your ZIP code. For example, if it thinks you may be spending a lot of time in indoor heating because it’s cold outside, it adds corn derivatives that smooth and condition to fight static.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We tackle all your problems,” said Arnaud Plas, the chief executive of Prose, sitting in the company’s SoHo conference room, which is decorated with illustrations of coconut, mint and other good-for-hair ingredients. “We’re not going to make you compromise.” (The company says it has tested which ingredients could cancel one another’s benefits.)It’s probably not surprising that there are skeptics. Maryanne Senna, a dermatologist and the director of the Hair Academic Innovative Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is unconvinced that customizable shampoos and conditioners work much better than standard ones.“There are some things we very clearly know can be drying, but then there’s a lot of stuff they use that has no evidence to back it up,” Dr. Senna said. “Whether it’s the hair holy grail comes down to perception.” Unless patients have very oily hair or dandruff or a known sensitivity or allergy, she does not recommend specific products. She tells them that everyone is different, and they have to find one that works for them.Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist and a founder of thebeautybrains.com, a site where scientists examine product ingredients and industry claims, called customization “a marketing gimmick.”“There is nothing measurably different about their formulas in terms of performance,” Mr. Romanowski said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe has run blinded home-use tests of the 10 top-selling shampoos and conditioners. Pantene turned out to make the best performing product. Moreover, he found that expensive shampoos don’t work better than cheap ones, but expensive conditioners work better than really inexpensive ones, like V05 or Suave, he said. That’s because the pricey conditioners have more types of nourishing ingredients, which all work differently, and together are more effective. Still, he said, “super-expensive ones aren’t better than Pantene.”But this is where things get knotty. A major driver of whether a product works — or really, whether a customer thinks it does — is fragrance, which of course has no visible effect (unless you’re allergic to it). In its early days, Function of Beauty had to spend more time tweaking scents than algorithms.“Man, people care a lot more about fragrance than I ever thought they would,” said Mr. Dossa, who, when he started the company, had a shaved head, but now has a man bun so he can test products. “Customers won’t properly assess your product if they’re not happy with the fragrance.”Prose does not offer customers who want a moisturizing shampoo the option of choosing a citrus fragrance. Mr. Plas learned from his time at L’Oréal that customers will insist the product doesn’t work because they associate that smell with grease removal. “Then we give them the exact same formula with a different scent, and they think it’s great,” he said, shaking his head.Another thing customers can’t (yet) choose easily: to ban a particular ingredient because of allergies and sensitivities. (Function of Beauty is vegan and gluten free; Prose allows you to choose those options. Both allow you to avoid fragrance, but you have to contact customer service to ban a specific ingredient.) AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLacey Harris, 35, an athletic trainer in Lemoore, Calif., is allergic to coconut oil, an ingredient contained in her Function of Beauty products. She switched to Prose, which, purely by luck, didn’t add that to her shampoo and conditioner.Ms. Harris said she could really tell how much volume and wave the Prose products added to her hair when she bought Dove, which she once used, to share with her husband on a backpacking trip. “I couldn’t wait to get back to my custom shampoo,” she said.A version of this article appears in print on Nov. 29, 2018, Section D, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Can Artificial Intelligence  Eliminate Bad Hair Days?.

Cooper'}]",N/A,N/A,"This past summer, the Internal Revenue Service issued a request for information to learn more about how artificial intelligence can improve cyber security.The request went beyond just using machine-learning technologies to improve cyber operations. The agency wanted to know how to create a system that continuously learns its environment, triages alerts, identifies previously unknown trends and analyzes data to provide actionable context for officials.Artificial intelligence has been one of the most prominent buzzwords in the federal government over the past year. The federal government has made strides to bring artificial intelligence into agencies, but it has only begun to scratch the surface of its capabilities and use cases.One of the most important potential use cases for artificial intelligence in government is cyber security. Most cyber security solutions use rules-based or signature-based methodology that requires too much human intervention and institutional knowledge. These systems require constant updates to those rules – taking up employee time – and typically forcing analysts to only look at a single part of the enterprise, failing to get a holistic picture of the environment. Artificial intelligence can augment that human element to make the time spent on cyber security more productive.At its core, artificial intelligence is the science of training systems to emulate human intelligence through continuous learning. Although the role of the human will always be an important component for cyber security, the ability for a system to learn about the environment it must protect, automatically handling tasks and searching for anomalies in user behavior, is critical. Artificial intelligence can analyze large volumes of data, recognizing complex patterns of malicious behavior, and drive rapid detection of incidents and automated response.Artificial intelligence can also help eliminate visibility gaps within an enterprise. To date, the federal government has largely pieced together its cyber security systems, resulting in a fragmented approach to protecting systems. Analytics help close those gaps that are a result of this approach, analyzing the data generated in a system to identify malicious activity in areas that human analysts might miss.Artificial intelligence relies on the security analytics lifecycle, which is made up of three pillars: data, discovery and deployment. For artificial intelligence to be successful, it must be able to flow through these three pillars quickly and successfully. This lifecycle provides the ability for agencies to gain insight into their security ecosystem to quickly identify incidents and gain an understanding of their posture. Let’s look at each area:Data - For artificial intelligence to work, it first needs data to analyze, either stored or streaming data. Both types of data sources can be valuable in analyzing a cyber environment. The federal government has long produced large amounts of data and with the right streams, the key will be to identify the right pieces of data to get the best results. Additionally, better information sharing between the private sector and federal government can enhance this data inventory, increasing the data available to get a more comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape, as well as best practices for mitigating those threats.Discovery - This is the process of taking data and using technology to provide insights into security networks. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, agency personnel will build models for supervised and unsupervised purposes. Supervised models take advantage of datasets with known outcomes and build a model to predict or classify the behavior that drove that outcome. Unsupervised models do the same thing, except it works with data where there is no known outcome. It looks for outliers in the data that can show anomalies that are indicative of security incidents and finds areas of concern that human analysts would have a difficult time finding. That said, there is not a lot of labeled data in the cyber domain, so a combination of these approaches – or a semi-supervised learning approach – is often used to bridge the gap.Deployment - This is where the value of analytics is realized. Organizations take the findings from the discovery phase and make changes to their system to combat these issues. This could include patching a commonly attacked area or increasing the monitoring of a specific network. It is important to reemphasize, however, that better data collection, sharing and utilization is needed to adopt more advanced capabilities like artificial intelligence.These three steps work in concert to provide valuable insights across a government enterprise.The IRS and other federal agencies are taking the right steps by first investing in advanced data analytics solutions and looking at artificial intelligence to strengthen their security posture. The technology has proven to help organizations in all industries in a myriad of ways, cyber being chief among them. Federal agencies should look for analytics solutions that help them better understand their environment and drive actionable change. Artificial intelligence enhances an agency’s visibility into its systems, offering a continuously “learned” capability that works to identify and remediate suspicious activity that would otherwise go unnoticed.Jeffrey I.

For most people today, robots and smart systems are servants that work in the background, vacuuming carpets or turning lights on and off. Or they’re machines that have taken over repetitive human jobs from assembly-line workers and bank tellers. But the technologies are getting good enough that machines will be able work alongside people as teammates – much as human-dog teams handle tasks like hunting and bomb detection.
There are already some early examples of robots and people teaming up. For example, soldiers use drones for surveillance and ground robots for bomb disposal as they carry out military missions. But the U.S. Army envisions increased teaming of soldiers, robots and autonomous systems in the next decade. Beyond the military, these human-robot teams will soon start working in fields as diverse as health care, agriculture, transportation, manufacturing and space exploration. 
Researchers and companies are exploring lots of avenues for improving how robots and artificial intelligence systems work – and technical advances are important. As an applied cognitive scientist who has conducted research on human teaming in highly technical settings, I can say human-robot systems won’t be as good as they could be if the designers don’t understand how to engineer technologies that work most effectively with real people. A few basic concepts from the deep body of scholarly research into human teamwork can help develop and manage these new relationships.
1. Different jobs
Teams are necessarily groups of people with separate, though interdependent, roles and responsibilities. A surgical team, for instance, might include a nurse, a surgeon and an anesthesiologist. Similarly, members of a human-robot team should be assembled to take on different elements of a complex task. 
Robots should do things they are best at, or that people don’t want to do – like lifting heavy items, testing chemicals and crunching data. That frees up people to do what they’re best at – like adapting to changing situations and coming up with creative solutions to problems.

A human-robot surgical team might have a human surgeon conducting laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery with assistance from a robot manipulator with cameras that is inserted into the patient and operated externally by the surgeon. The view can be augmented by overlaying medical imaging data on the patient’s internal anatomy on the camera view.
Planning for this sort of division of labor suggests people shouldn’t replicate themselves in machines. In fact, humanoid-shaped robots or robots and AI that mimic human social behavior may mislead their human teammates into having unrealistic expectations of what they can do.
2. Mutual backup
Effective teams’ members know that everyone has a different role – but are available to support each other when necessary. The disastrously fatal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was partly the result of confusion and lack of coordination among government agencies and other groups like the Red Cross.
Teammates need to understand their own roles and those of the rest of the team, and how they fit together. They also need to be able to use this knowledge to avoid stepping on teammates’ toes, while anticipating others’ potential needs. Robots and artificial intelligence need to understand how their parts of the task relate to the parts their teammates are doing, and how they might be able to help as needed.
3. Common understanding
Effective teams share knowledge about the team goals and the current situation and this facilitates their interactions – even when direct communication is not possible.
The benefit of shared knowledge allows all sorts of collaborations and coordinations. For instance, when inflating a hot air balloon, the pilot is at one end, in the basket monitoring the burner. A crew member must be at the far end of the balloon, steadying it by holding a rope attached to its top. They can’t see or hear each other because the balloon blocks the view and the propane burner drowns out any other sound. But if they’re trained well, neither needs to communicate to know what the other is doing, and know what needs to happen next. 



The two people at this end of the balloon also have to trust what their team members at the other end of the balloon are doing.

The connection team members have comes not only from information they all know, but shared knowledge developed through experience working together. Some scholars have suggested that robots can’t build experience and shared knowledge with humans, while other researchers are working on finding ways to actually do that. Machine learning will likely be a key factor in helping robots develop expectations of their coworkers’ behavior. Coupled with human intelligence, each side will learn about the other’s capabilities, limitations and idiosyncrasies.
4. Effective interaction and communication
Team members need to interact; effective teaming depends greatly on the quality of those interactions. In hospital teams for emergency resuscitation of patients, team interaction and communication are crucial. Those teams are often made up of whatever medical personnel are nearest to the patient, and members need to know right away what happened before the patient’s heart stopped – a life is at stake.
Yet even between people, communication isn’t always seamless. Between people and robots there are even more challenges – like making sure they share understandings of how words are used or what appropriate responses are to questions. Artificial intelligence researchers are making great strides in advancing computers’ ability to understand, and even produce, natural language – as many people experience with their smart assistant devices like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home, and mobile and car-based GPS directions systems.
It’s not even clear if typical human communication is the best model for human-robot teams. Human-dog teams do fine without the use of natural language. Navy SEALs can work together at highly effective levels without uttering a word. Bees communicate location of resources with a dance. Communication does not have to involve words; it could include sound signals and visual cues. If a robot was tending the patient when their heart stopped, it could indicate what happened on a monitor that all resuscitation team members could see.
5. Mutual trust
Interpersonal trust is important in human teams. If trust breaks down among a team of firefighters, they’ll be less effective and may cost lives – each other’s or members of the public they’re trying to help. The best robot teammates will be trustworthy and reliable – and any breaches in reliability need to be explained. 
But even with an explanation, technology that is chronically unreliable is likely to be rejected by human teammates. That’s even more vital in safety-critical technology, like autonomous vehicles.
Robots are not automatically capable of teaming with humans. They need to be assigned effective roles on the team, understand other team roles, train with human team members to develop common understanding, develop an effective way to communicate with humans, and be reliable and trustworthy. Most importantly, humans should not be asked to adapt to their nonhuman teammates. Rather, developers should design and create technology to serve as a good team player alongside people.

She previously held various roles at Accenture. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  McKinsey reported that most oil and gas operators have not maximized the production potential of their assets. A typical offshore platform, according to the 2017 report, runs at about 77% of its maximum production potential. Industry-wide, the shortfall comes to about 10 million barrels per day, or $200 billion in annual revenue.  To help optimize production, operators might consider adopting advanced analytics, which combines engineering, data science, and computing power to enable businesses to forecast yields or maximize industry assets. In adopting analytics, it follows that AI would find its way into the oil and gas industry. As of now, numerous companies claim to assist engineers and data scientists in aspects of their roles, such as predictive maintenance on equipment, predicting supply and demand, and streamlining routine processes. We researched the space to better understand where predictive analytics comes into play in the oil and gas industry and to answer the following questions: What types of predictive analytics applications are currently in use in oil and gas? What tangible results have predictive analytics driven in oil and gas? Are there common trends among these innovation efforts? How could these trends affect the future of oil and gas? This report covers vendors offering software across two applications: Predictive Maintenance Business Intelligence This article intends to provide business leaders in the oil and gas space with an idea of what they can currently expect from AI in this industry. We hope that this article allows business leaders in the oil and gas industry to garner insights they can confidently relay to their executive teams so they can make informed decisions when thinking about AI adoption. At the very least, this article intends to reduce the time business leaders spend researching AI companies with whom they may (or may not) be interested in working. Predictive Maintenance GE Digital’s Predix GE Digital, a subsidiary of General Electric, offers Predix, which the company claims can help oil and gas businesses create automated analytics models that could help in the predictive maintenance of its industrial equipment using machine learning. Predix explains that the application’s machine learning algorithms are able to process data that sensors collect, such as equipment or parts performance, environmental data, and weather conditions, among others. The algorithms then compare these against the ideal performance data contained in the database. If the algorithms find discrepancies between the current and ideal state, the application is triggered to send an alert to technicians. who in turn conduct predictive maintenance or part replacement.  For instance, in a wind farm, one turbine is performing below optimum levels. The technician gathers the data collected by sensors about the parts of the turbine, such as the wind blades and turbine axle. The technician might also consider reviewing the wind speed. The turbine’s performance history will then be compared with that of other turbines at the wind farm.  The in-house technician may share the information with the field technician through a connected tablet or smartphone, who is prompted to inspect the underperforming turbine in person. Repairs are then conducted if needed. Below is a short 3-minute video demonstrating how Predix works:  GE Digital claims to have helped the Administracion Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP) of Uruguay. The state-owned company provides the fuel that heats homes and business and fuels cooking equipment, agricultural machines, and transportation. The company was faced with the challenge of managing large amounts of data and needed a solution to make processes more efficient, optimize energy consumption, integrate operational data from various sources, and ensure the sustainability of the company. The company turned to Predix’s human-machine interface and supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI-SCADA) application called iFIX. The project was implemented in five distribution plants, with more than 1,000 screens deployed. Employees at each location learned to use the system to input critical data. With the centralized system, ANCAP was reportedly able to track field data, such as gas and liquid flow rates, composition analyzers, and tank levels and volumes. The system also enabled the company to monitor the performance rates of equipment, daily throughputs from process units, and weather conditions. This data was automatically processed, formatted to a spreadsheet, and uploaded to the government’s website. With this data, ANCAP was able to calculate and project the efficiency of its furnaces using this data. although the case study did not explain how efficiency was defined. The data was recorded in the server to enable the team to study trends related to the furnace’s performance. According to GE Digital, implementing Predix allowed ANCAP to cut the time spent on routine processes by 60% and save 20% more fuel. Management also reportedly stopped asking employees for manual reports GE Digital also lists Exelon, Gerdau, Spomlek, Lek Pharmaceuticals, and the City of San Luis Obispo as some of its clients. Vincent Yates is the Chief Data Scientist at GE Digital. He holds a PhD in Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley. Previously, Yates served as Head of Data Science in Seattle at Uber, Director of Analytics Engineering at Zillow Group, and Office Analytics Team Manager at Microsoft.  Maana  Maana is a California-based company with over 100 employees. The company offers a software called the Knowledge Platform, which they claim can help oil and gas companies predict operational outcomes and help employees make better-informed decisions using machine learning and natural language processing. Maana claims its software can mine, process, and analyze a company’s unstructured data, such as job reports, maintenance records, equipment sensors, weather data, call center records, and other types of media from disparate company sources. Then, Knowledge Platform’s natural language processing algorithms interpret the data from these reports. The machine learning algorithms crawl through the platform’s database to find patterns that are similar to the current problem the company is aiming to solve.  When the algorithms find similarities, the system then provides feedback in the form of graphs to show the trend of, for instance, equipment performance or expenditures. This allows the company’s subject matter experts to interpret the graphs and make recommendations on how to solve the problem. Below is a short 2-minute video demonstrating how the Knowledge Platform works:  Maana claims to have helped an unnamed Fortune 20 oil company make optimal pump selections, increase billable hours and reduce overall costs using the application. The company’s maintenance experts used the platform to collect data related to existing pump operations. The data came in the form of run-and-pull reports, pump failure reports, pump sensor data and high-frequency data flows. Much of the data described past inspections of failed pumps retrieved from wells and was reported by field employees.  Aside from language-based data, the company also collected detailed sensor data during pump operations. The application was able to classify the data and recognize the patterns that could lead to pump failure. According to Maana, this enabled employees to validate their hypotheses and identify the causes of pump failures, predict similar scenarios in the future, and choose the right pump for each kind of well. Overall, this allowed the company to conduct maintenance that would reduce the risk of pump failures and production downtime. Maana also lists Shell, General Electric, Airbus, Maersk, Chevron as some of their clients. Steven Gustafson is Chief Scientist at Maana. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham. Previously, Gustafson served as R&D Leader, Knowledge Discovery Lab at General Electric Global Research. Business Intelligence HortonWorks HortonWorks is a San Francisco-based company with about 1,300 employees. The company offers a software called Hybrid Data Platform (HDP), an open-source application that processes large datasets from multiple sources, which they claim can help oil and gas companies predict well yield do maintenance on equipment. Hortonworks claims that HDP can store and process its structured and unstructured data, such as sensor or seismic data, weather, drilling and completions data, geolocation, text files, video, social media, email, and more. These are stored in a data repository.  For instance, an oil and gas company may want to set standards of yield per well to achieve the highest margins. To set the benchmarks, the engineers might use seismic data, pump rates, fluid temperatures, and other factors that influence yield.  The software’s machine learning model would then take these predefined benchmarks, search the HDP database for similar standards, and compare the corresponding well yields. If the algorithms find that the current yields are lower, based on the influencing factors, the system informs the users through the dashboard. Below is a short 2-minute video demonstrating how HDP works:  Horton claims to have helped Noble Energy predict and prevent downtime in its hydrocarbon infrastructure. The case study reports that HDP was used to look for potential lost opportunity through downtime, but did not provide details. However, we can infer that the application’s machine learning model reviewed the data from sensor streams, drilling reports, location data, engineering notes, and technical manuals, etc.   Then, the algorithms may have matched these with historical data related to factors that could affect production, such as equipment failure and decline in the output of existing oil wells, among others. This would have enabled Noble Energy to take measures to maintain equipment and possibly discover new wells. In the future, Noble Energy intends to use HDP to improve safety and prevent injuries among employees in its locations.  Hortonworks also lists Fuso, Johns Hopkins University, Nissan, Yahoo! Japan, Mayo Clinic, SoftBank, Expedia, and Symantec as some of its clients. Scott Gnau is CTO at Hortonworks. He holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from Drexel University. Previously, Gnau served as President of at Teradata labs for nine years, where he provided direction for research, development, and sales support activities related to Teradata integrated data warehousing and big data analytics. SAS SAS offers a predictive software called Enterprise Miner, which they claim can help oil and gas businesses streamline the data mining process to develop predictive models using deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP). SAS claims that NLP algorithms are capable of extracting business insights and emerging trends from texts, speech and sound, while computer vision algorithms determine the objects inside images and videos. The information extracted by these technologies are then processed and analyzed by deep learning algorithms, which recognize patterns in the data to create predictions and preventive recommendations. Below is a short 3-minute video demonstrating how SAS artificial intelligence-driven applications work:   SAS does not have oil and gas-related case studies but claims to have helped Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC) forecast energy demand and save its utility customers millions in its first year of using SAS Analytics, according to the case study.  ODEC provides wholesale power to 11 distribution cooperatives in Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware that serve 1 million member customers. For energy purchases, the cooperative must contract energy months in advance to ensure affordable supply at wholesale prices. Wrong forecasts might force ODEC to buy energy at higher spot prices In the past, ODEC used traditional spreadsheets to create forecasts. SAS enabled ODEC to forecast more accurately using a variety of industry-specific models that support system analysis, hedging, financial forecasts, and future resources for energy and demand. According to the case study, using SAS allowed ODEC to understand each cooperative’s market while providing a big-picture look. This enabled the client to plan for its markets’ power needs five, 10, or 20 years into the future. The company did not provide further details or specific numbers. SAS also lists Honda, Bank of America, Nestle, Lufthansa, Konica Minolta, and World Wildlife Fund as some of its past clients. Wayne Thompson is Chief Data Scientist at SAS where he has served for 26 years. He holds a PhD in Agronomy and Statistics and another in Plant Sciences; Minor Statistics. Both are from the University of Tennessee. Takeaways for Business Leaders in the Oil and Gas industry Most of the companies covered in this report offer solutions for preventive maintenance and production-related analytics. Worthy of note is that all of the companies’ AI efforts are spearheaded by PhD-level talent except Hortonworks.  That said, only Maana offers solutions exclusively for industrial production and oil and gas companies; the other companies covered in this report service multiple industries. Maana’s specificity could work in its favor, as its machine learning models might be trained exclusively on industrial databases, which could increase its models’ accuracies. This is speculation, however.  Although no company provided hard times on how long their software would take to integrate, based on one case study, we infer that the integration product could be long. Overall, predictive analytics applications for the oil and gas industry seem to legitimately involve AI, unlike other sectors that are more nascent in terms of AI.   Header Image Credit: Oil and Gas People Related Posts AI for Exploration & Production (Upstream) in the Oil and Gas Industry - Current ApplicationsThe oil and gas industry is usually divided into three major operational sectors: upstream, midstream,… Internet of Things in the Oil and Gas Industry - Current ApplicationsAccording to McKinsey, global gas demand is expected to reach 4,503 billion cubic meters (bcm)… Predictive Analytics - 5 Examples of Industry ApplicationsBusinesses today around the world have some portion of their operations being automated, which concurrently… Artificial Intelligence in Oil and Gas - Comparing the Applications of 5 Oil GiantsOil remains one of the most highly valued commodities in the energy sector.

Tom Vander Ark





Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping life and livelihoods. It’s curating every screen; making or influencing decisions about hiring, loans, and jail sentences; and aggregating wealth and opportunity at a staggering pace. 

AI, particularly machine learning (ML), and related exponential technologies (ET) are quickly augmenting many tasks at home and work. They will increasingly displace jobs while creating new entrepreneurial opportunities. They will swamp communities with complex issues and a combination of predictable and unanticipated consequences.  
AI is not just a tech issue, it’s a social studies issue. Teaching youth to code may be part of the response, but even more important is asking them to consider issues of the changing civic and employment landscape.  
PROMOTED
“The aim of social studies is the promotion of civic competence,” says the National Council for the Social Studies. Their standards are built around 10 themes that are being shaped by AI and ET.  

1. Culture: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of culture and cultural diversity.

ML promotes screentime addiction which changing social interaction.

ML has been used to manipulate social media manipulation in an effort to change election outcomes.

2. Time, Continuity and Change: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the past and its legacy.

ET means we’re living on a curve where everyone is experiencing more novelty and complexity as manmade and natural systems collide in unexpected ways. 

3. People, Places and Environments: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of people, places, and environments.

Lots of cameras and facial recognition software makes it possible to track people with accuracy. It’s used to issue jaywalking tickets in China. 
Your stock trades are not as you think. In China, a social credit score increasingly shapes life options. 

4. Individual Development and Identity: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of individual development and identity.

ML is quickly augmenting human capacity in every aspect of life. It will increasingly be combined with biological augmentation. How will this change human identities and interactions?
Advances in gene editing and DNA analysis is beginning to give parents control over the traits their children will inherit.

5. Individuals, Groups and Institutions: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of interactions among individuals, groups, and institutions.

ML is beginning to automate the middle of the job market leading to job dislocation  
“Algorithmic bias is shaping up to be a major societal issue at a critical moment in the evolution of machine learning and AI,” said the MIT Tech Review. 
Chinese algorithms use observed behaviors to create a credit score that defines access to credit. 
ML is increasingly used to allocate police resources, set prison sentences, inform hiring, make loans. Algorithmic bias can disadvantage groups with little transparency. 

6. Power, Authority and Governance: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of how people create, interact with, and change structures of power, authority, and governance.

Some societies are mobilizing and skilling up and using framing legislation to guide the use of ML/ET. The US federal government appears particularly unwilling and unable to respond  
Killer drones and automated warfare 

7. Production, Distribution and Consumption: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of how people organize for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.

ML/ET is accelerating wealth aggregation 
Large sections of the workforce are experiencing anxiety; wages are lagging. 

8. Science, Technology and Society: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of relationships among science, technology, and society.

ML is improving diagnosis and treatment of disease; who will gain access to lifesaving technology?
ML/ET cause new privacy and security concerns 
False news is spreading online farther and faster than the truth

9. Global Connections: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of global connections and interdependence.

ET will, in less than a decade, connect most of the world with mobile devices and 5G connectivity  

10. Civic Ideals and Practices: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the ideals, principles, and practices of citizenship in a democratic republic.

ML/ET is sending waves of issues at communities (e.g., climate change, autonomous vehicles, employment dislocation, privacy) testing civic ideas and practices. 

Artificial intelligence isn’t a tech issue, it’s a social studies issue. Like the Montour School District in Pittsburgh, the ethics of AI should be introduced in middle school. Educational institutions should be leading community conversations about what’s happening, what it means and how to prepare.

Yet the minds behind these innovations are not human.It looks more like a chicken carcass than a drone. Wishbone-thin struts hold together a skeletal scaffold that seems too fragile to fly.But don’t be fooled. It may not look it, but this design is one of the strongest among thousands of alternatives. We know because an artificial intelligence has dreamed up and tested every one of them.The use of massive computing power to conjure radical new designs automatically – a process known as generative design –  is revolutionising the way human designers work, letting us build things we previously couldn’t have imagined.You might also like: • The A-Z of how artificial intelligence is changing the world • Why machines dream of spiders with 15 legs • The goldmine hidden in your pocketThe technology is already designing everyday industrial components from seatbelt brackets in cars and motorbike chassis to cabin partitions in passenger aircraft. Not only are these computer-generated designs stronger and lighter than human-crafted solutions but they’re weird – designs that no human would have come up with in the first place.“The computer can really surprise you,” says Lilli Smith at Autodesk in Boston, a software design company which has several generative designs under its belt, including the unusual drone chassis. 0:25Artificial intelligence designed this drone bodyInstead of waiting for inspiration to hit, computers go looking. Handed a set of design constraints – such as making it lightweight, strong and low-cost – generative design software identifies and assesses hundreds or thousands of candidates that all fit the bill, before selecting the pick of the crop.Humans switch from being creators to curatorsBy trawling through an exhaustive set of options, computers typically find ones that a human would have missed. Designers can simply choose from a handful that the software predicts will do the job better than the rest. Humans switch from being creators to curators.The basic idea is simple: here’s what I want, show me the best. But the software and cloud-based computing power needed to pull it off have only appeared in the last few years. For one of its first generative design projects, in 2015, Autodesk Research teamed up with the Bandito Bros, a US multimedia studio known for its wacky stunts, and asked an AI to design a car.The team wired up a custom-built off-road buggy with hundreds of sensors and raced it around the Mojave Desert. This let them capture a vast amount of data about the stresses that extreme driving placed on different parts of the vehicle. They then fed this to the generative design system with the instruction to produce something that could handle this. The resulting design, dubbed the Hack Rod, gave a glimpse of the future: more strength from less material – and alien-looking.There’s a reason generative designs look weird, as if they were the result of a natural process rather than made, says Erin Bradner at Autodesk Research in San Francisco. “The algorithm will fine tune the structure so that not a single piece of material is added that’s not needed,” she says. “Some people relate it to erosion.”Autodesk, IncGenerative design combined with 3D printing allows structures to be made that were impossible before (Credit: Autodesk, Inc)This process of elimination applies not only to the amount of material in a structure but also the number of parts needed to make it. “That can mean fewer suppliers, faster assembly and fewer points of failure,” says Bradner.The trouble with favouring organic structures is that they can be hard to manufacture with traditional machines. Additive manufacturing – or 3D printing – can be used to make most shapes, but not all industries yet use it. To get around that, you can instruct the design software to generate something that can be made by certain kinds of equipment.“A designer can specify that she wants to make a part on a three-axis mill with a specific diameter cutting tool and the algorithm will only produce parts that can be made by that mill, with that cutter,” says Bradner.Manufacturing limitations become yet another design constraint that the software takes on board. “Designers are faced with a myriad of choices every day that they don’t have the time or mental resources to fully explore,” she says. “If I could make my part in aluminium or steel what would it look like? If I could manufacture by 3D printing or milling, what alternatives could I consider?”AlamyThe cabin partitions in passenger aircraft can be made lighter but stronger when designed by AI (Credit: Alamy)Generative design is still a new technology, with many projects one-off experiments, such as the Hack Rod and drone. But companies like Autodesk and Frustum, based in Colorado, are starting to take the tech mainstream via collaborations with a range of major manufacturers. “We’re doing a lot of work with aerospace companies,” says Frustum’s chief executive Jesse Blankenship.When designing components for aircraft, a small reduction in weight can makes a big differenceWhen designing components for aircraft, a small reduction in weight can makes a big difference. Blankenship says his company’s software has been used to design lighter components like heat exchangers and acoustic baffling. Frustum has clients in the defence industry as well, but they’re tight-lipped about what they’re designing. “I just know they buy the software,” he says.Autodesk has also been helping aircraft lose weight. The Airbus A320 now has lightweight partitions between cabins that were designed by an AI that Autodesk Research co-developed with New York-based software company The Living. The partition’s skeletal design has rods criss-crossing at odd angles.Others have also been looking at AI’s ability to improve aircraft design. Researchers at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) have been investigating its role in helping to tune combat aircraft to specific missions. Aerospace engineers at Delft University in the Netherlands have also been developing a tool that produces conceptual aircraft designs.AirbusAirbus estimates that the new cabin partition design can save up to 465,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year (Credit: Airbus)It’s not only planes that benefit from being lighter. Autodesk has worked with US car maker General Motors to create a seatbelt bracket that is 40 percent lighter and 20 percent stronger than the previous version. At its annual trade show in November this year, Autodesk also showed off an AI-designed suspension system for a Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 racing car and a frame for a BMW motorcycle.Even Nasa is in on it. Next to the car and bike parts was a lander that Nasa is developing for missions to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Autodesk’s generative design for the lander’s legs is 35 percent lighter than previous human-made designs.For David Kirsh, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego and visiting researcher at University College London’s Bartlett School of Architecture, generative design lets us outsource a kind of hands-on problem solving.Kirsh is interested in how human thinking is embedded in our physical environment. Imagine you’re putting together a jigsaw puzzle. You could try to fit all the pieces together in your head, using what we might call the mind’s eye. Or you could build it. For any puzzle with more than a handful of pieces, solving the problem with our hands rather than our head is far easier. “Cognition is a product of the interaction between brains, bodies and the world,” he says.Autodesk, IncThe intritcate legs of Nasa's new interplanetary lander are nearly a third lighter than anything a human could come up with (Credit: Autodesk, Inc)Many problems can’t be solved (just) in our head at all, which is why design typically involves prototyping to see how pieces fit together and work as a whole. Here’s another example. If you have a peg that you need to fit into a tight hole you don’t study the peg and the hole and calculate how it’s going to go in. “The trick is actually to put it part-way in and then jiggle it,” says Kirsh. “There is no counterpart in the mind for jiggling.”Trying out thousands of different ways to meet a set of design constraints &ndash; like different positions for the peg in the hole &ndash; is a form of virtual jigglingBut generative design could be the next best thing. Trying out thousands of different ways to meet a set of design constraints – like different positions for the peg in the hole – is a form of virtual jiggling.In fact, some design problems are a lot like puzzles. When Autodesk Research wanted to set up a new office in Toronto, they worked with The Living again to design the layout. Most offices stick to a standard floor plan, with meeting rooms in the middle or around the edges and the desks grouped together.The design generated for the Toronto office is different. As with the Hack Rod, the designers collected as much data as they could, this time about people’s working preferences – how much natural light, how much social interaction, their working hours and so on. They also noted which groups needed to be close to which other groups.AirbusThe designs often appear similar to shapes and structures found in the natural world (Credit: Airbus)Feeding these constraints to the software produced hundreds of possible layouts for the office’s desks, meeting rooms and social spaces. The one that the designers picked from the few most recommended by the AI has small groups of desks interspersed with communal areas and teams arranged in a way that maximises interaction.Van Wijnen, a construction company based in the Netherlands, is doing the same thing for entire neighbourhoods. The firm has changed its entire construction process to make the most of its generative design tools.Its houses are now made from prefabricated parts, which means working out the best way for them to be built and arranged along a street becomes another puzzle.To design its neighbourhoods, Van Wijnen gives its software a large number of constraints, from the requirement that all apartments should have at least 3,000 square metres of floor space and at least one parking space to the requirement that all roof-mounted solar panels get enough sunlight and that there is a variety of different house designs in a street.For now, arranging these pre-designed pieces of a large puzzle pushes the software as far as it can go. Designing a whole house from scratch would involve many more variables – and regulations – than designing a new part for a vehicle. But eventually we might get computers to come up with new architectural designs. It might possible to teach them to design a building in the style of Le Corbusier, the famous Swiss-French architect, says Smith. Or the load-bearing structure of a skyscraper could be designed in the same way as a car chassis, which could let us build taller buildings than we ever could on our own.AlamyAI-aided design could lead to exciting new buildings that rival those created by architect Le Corbusier like the Notre-Dame-du-Haut chapel in Ronchamp, France (Credit: Alamy)There is certainly an appetite for using AI in design. According to Blankenship, sportswear companies like New Balance and Adidas have started looking at generative design as a way to make personalised trainers, offering customers huge variety in the style and function of their footwear. Add in 3D printing –letting you manufacture unorthodox shapes on the spot – and you could generate your customised design on a website and have it made in the shoe shop down the street.This changes the relationship between product designers and their customers. To paraphrase Maurice Conti, who helped pioneer generative design at Autodesk before moving to experimental tech company Alpha in Barcelona: instead of making people want to buy your stuff, you invite them to make stuff they want to buy.There are of course limitations to the technology. ”It’s not magic,” says Kirsh. Some things will be harder for computers to make. For example, many of our most celebrated objects or buildings give us a particular experience or make us feel a certain way. But that’s hard to put into code. “We might not be able to pin down what causes that feeling,” says Kirsh.What’s clear is that designers have a powerful new tool and the best designs will come from a back and forth between human and machine. “Computers will do what computers are good at, people will do what people are good at,” says Bradner.“It’s a fascinating opportunity to think in new ways,” says Smith. “People think it’s going to take away their jobs but it’s going to make them so much better.”  Blankenship agrees. “We could certainly get to a future where a lot of design work is fully automated,” he says. But you still want people to sign off on it. Is it any good? Is it better than the last one? Is it what we want?These are questions only a human can answer. “Otherwise what are we doing it all for? A machine without people doesn’t make any sense,” he says.  Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

The treatment of these two diseases costs over €80 billion in the US and Europe each. The direct costs make up almost $50.1 billion, and hospital stays are the most significant part of that cost. For adults, asthma is one of the top reason for underperformance at work. Sufferers miss about 14 million workdays each year, and this equals about $2 billion of indirect asthma costs.
Patients first realize that they have a chronic pulmonary disease like asthma or COPD if symptoms like recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty in breathing appear. A pulmonologist would then use a spirometer to formally diagnose the condition. The pulmonologist then managed by a combination of lifestyle choices and medication. Lifestyle choices include avoiding triggers such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin. Medication is generally inhaled using an inhaler and can be quick-relief medications (such as beta2-adrenoceptor agonists or salbutamol) or long-term control medication (such as corticosteroids or Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists).

Given that controlling lifestyle choices are a big part of preventing and managing chronic pulmonary diseases, smart medical devices such as smart inhalers and smart spirometers could have a significant impact on health outcomes. Here are 5 different ways in which AI is redefining respiratory care,

1. AI aided inhaler based medication adherence solutions
Since the delivery of respiratory medication is primarily achieved through inhalers which involves several steps, 50% of all patients fail to take their daily medication as prescribed. Monitoring the correctness of the drug delivery technique, as well as tracking whether the patient is adhering to the prescribed regimen is vital to improving the effectiveness of respiratory care pathways. Amiko's Respiro® Sense technology is a CE Marked smart inhaler that can track both patient adherence and delivery technique and report it back to the physician. The Respiro® Sense technology is available to consumers as either standalone smart inhalers or can be integrated as an add-on device to their current inhalers. Respiro® Sensors have built-in artificial intelligence that can offer individualized guidance to patients such as smart dose reminders and how to improve the quality of the inhalation technique. Adherium's Hailie™ solution is an FDA 510(k) approved and CE Marked devices and software, that provides similar medication reminders and to monitor inhaler usage. Adherium claims that the Hailie™ platform increases adherence to preventative medication by 180% in children and 59% in adults. Propeller Health's smart inhaler platform has eight FDA 510(k) approvals and provides similar medication reminders. Propeller Health has done studies showing 58% improvement in medication adherence. Other smart inhaler platforms such as Inspiro Medical was bought by Opko in 2014, and Gecko Health Innovations was acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2015.

2. AI aided early warning system
The Propeller spirometer and app uses advanced analytics to help patients identify triggers, symptoms, trends and other personalized insights. Also, Propeller's Air is an open API that uses machine learning from Propeller devices and environmental sources and can predict how asthma may be affected by local environmental conditions.

Entrepreneurs and startup companies wishing to work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) would be well-advised to do a little homework prior.
In a presentation at a pitch day for the most recent cohort of federal technology accelerator Fed Tech on Tuesday, DARPA’s senior adviser for commercial strategy, David Henshall, offered this and other tips.
“The key is — be familiar with the opportunities of national security,” Henshall said. “The first thing is what are the problems we’re trying to solve, and become familiar with that.” He suggested that a bit of good old-fashioned internet sleuthing can go a long way. “Read our website and find out what we’re working on. Find out who’s there. And then find out the program manager that’s interested in the technology space you’re dealing with.”
Once you’ve identified a program manager in your area of expertise, Henshall said, contact that person. Most will be very willing to take a short meeting with an entrepreneur or company working in their subject matter area. But don’t waste that time.

“Make sure you’re not asking him questions that you could have read on the website because your 30 minutes is being used up,” he said. “Do your homework beforehand.”
And lastly, be patient. “People say it’s like dating,” Henshall joked. You won’t walk out of a first meeting with research grant money in hand, so that shouldn’t be the goal. Use the first meeting to get to the second meeting, and so on.
Follow these tips, and partnership with DARPA presents the opportunity to work on some big and interesting research challenges. For example, in September the agency announced that it plans to spend $2 billion on research into so-called “third wave” artificial intelligence capacities over the next few years.
The initiative, called “AI Next,” is concerned with moving AI beyond the mode where it needs lots of high-quality training data in myriad situations to develop an algorithm. The goal is to get the technology to a place where machines adapt to changing situations the way human intelligence does.

His interests include but are not limited to whiskey, kimchi, and Catahoulas. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  How many times have you heard tales of automation and job loss? How fervently have these harbingers announced the arrival of robot-run industries? The International Federation of Robotics recently projected that about 1.3 million industrial robots will be put into operation within the next couple years. From experts to laymen, automation is too tempting and unsettling a topic to ignore.  And yet, one of the world’s biggest automobile manufacturers is flipping this trend by replacing robots with human beings. According to Bloomberg, Mercedes-Benz’s move towards vehicle customization has lead them to rethink the role of unmanned machines in their factories. “Robots can’t deal with the degree of individualization and the many variants that we have today,” Markus Schaefer – who heads Mercedes’s production – told Bloomberg. “We’re saving money and safeguarding our future by employing more people.” Schaefer has a tall task ahead of him, with his want to decrease production hours from 61 in 2005 to just 30 moving forward.  Cars like the Mercedes’s S-Class sedan offers buyers options like carbon-fiber trim, temperature controlled cupholders, and various caps for tire valves. The number of options may be overwhelming for some buyers – and they’re also too complex for factory robots to process and install efficiently. Robots may be highly adept at performing programmed tasks but the need for versatile leaves them at a loss. Bloomberg points out how, just in the past 15 years, the number of car models has more than doubled for luxury car makers like Mercedes, BMW, and Audi.  With robots replaced by skilled human workers, Mercedes is able to rearrange their production line to build a new vehicle in just a few days. It would take weeks to accomplish this same task with robots, who’s defined functions would need to be reprogrammed. “The variety is too much to take on for the machines, Schaefer told Bloomberg, “They can’t work with all the different options and keep pace with changes.” To be sure, Mercedes doesn’t intend to sack robots entirely. Instead, they plan on implementing what they call “robot farming” – which is much less malicious than it sounds. Rather than using massive robots to perform a myriad of tasks, the manufacturer will equip their human workers with more mobile, more compact, and more flexible robots. In an immediate example, Mercedes plans to replace two of its larger, immobile robots with one lighter, mobile one or an actual human worker. They hope this degree of flexibility will help streamline installation of their new E-Class’s head-up display, which use be installed directly onto the car’s windshield. “We’re moving away from trying to maximize automation with people taking a bigger part in the industrial processes again,” Schaefer says. “We need to be more flexible.” Image credit: Siemens Related Posts Making Robots More Humane at Brown UniversityBefore we welcome a new technology into our lives, it’s wise to consider what effect… Should the United Nations Play a Role in Guiding Post-Human Artificial Intelligence?This article is the fifth installment in the AI FutureScape series, and in it, we… The Role of Business and Government Leaders in Guiding Post-Human IntelligenceWe've reached the sixth and final installment of the AI FutureScape series.

A study by consultancy firm Accenture showed AI could boost India’s annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage points by 2035. Let us see how AI can transform critical areas of public spending. Despite increased investment, India’s public healthcare system has struggled to cope with the needs of its vast, growing population. Only a third of Indians have any medical insurance and government spending on health is equivalent to just 1.1 percent of GDP. Private healthcare is a steep cost for most Indians.

For instance, an AI-powered digital platform that collates data on symptoms and suggests treatment based on similar cases will make the diagnostic process far more accurate in public hospitals. Also, such a system can be quickly scaled up to cover major urban centers and remote areas, which lack adequate medical infrastructure. The Indian government recently launched, what is possibly the world’s largest public health insurance scheme. A scheme of such scope and scale can benefit from technologies like AI on allocation, geographic spread, checking veracity of health records and applicants, claim patterns and trends, ensuring the scheme reaches those who need it the most. The government’s mid-day meal scheme, among the nation’s better-known federal programs, aims to reduce malnutrition in children and increase enrolment rates in schools. On the flipside, the program diverted attention of teachers and students away from education and toward carrying out tasks such as inspecting the quality and quantity of the food, according to a government report. AI technologies can help overcome this challenge. Machine learning technology and supply chain planning could forecast inventory, while process automation technology would ensure the right amount of high quality food reaches schools on time.Another major focus of the government’s public spending is alleviating water shortages. Despite having over 18 percent of the world's population, India has only 4 percent of the total available water resources. A study by the National Institute for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), the government’s think tank, said that about 100 million people are at risk of losing access to drinking water by 2030. To prevent that, our cities will need to double their existing water availability. Steps such as desalination and rain-water harvesting will help, but won’t be enough to bridge the shortage. AI-powered smart water management systems, such as digital flowmeters that track, measure and optimize water consumption in real time, can be the answer. This has already been implemented in parts of India and Africa. In Surat, such flowmeters have helped the municipality do a more effective job of monitoring water consumption at 500 textile mills and make smarter decisions on distribution. A similar solution in Algeria resulted in fresh drinking water for nearly 160,000 people in water-scare regions.Clearly, AI-powered systems can help make public spending better targeted, and much more efficient than it is today. AI-powered platforms that have a large number of connected devices will provide a strong foundation to integrate devices into services such as cloud storage that reduce dependency on physical systems and strengthen information security. Yet more needs to be done to realize AI’s potential transformative impact. The government and private organizations must work together to overcome existing challenges such as lack of awareness among stakeholders and unclear privacy and security regulations. According to latest reports on India’s AI potential, India needs more robust systems to assimilate, analyze and store high-quality data securely, something that companies like ours can help the government with. It is encouraging to see that the government is moving forward with the intent to tackle these challenges. The budgetary allocation to research, training and skill development in AI, digital manufacturing and robotics – part of “Digital India” program - has been doubled this year. NITI Aayog has started working with major companies, including ours, to work on various aspects of AI, and increase awareness about emerging areas like advanced manufacturing powered by AI and robotics. Over time, such actions will lead to concrete proposals that the government can implement to usher in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will bring people, technology and data together. This will help India close the loop between data and action and pave the way for the nation’s emergence as a global economic and technological superpower.

The Chances of Automation Taking Away Your Livelihood (infographic)

We live in a day and age where everything is becoming increasingly automated. What this means is that robots are going to start doing a lot of things for us. Pretty much everything can be automated. Indeed, you would be surprised at just how many things robots can already do, let alone what they might be able to accomplish in the future.

There are a number of benefits associated with automation. Things will happen more efficiently, a lot of the more dangerous jobs that humans have had to do will be done by robots which means that fewer people will end up getting injured or potentially even killed in the line of duty. All of that being said, while it is definitely a good sign that tasks are going to end up becoming increasingly automated, it is also true that the robots that will be doing these jobs are going to end up putting real human beings out of work.

This is pretty understandable. After all, why would anyone hire and pay a regular salary person to do a job that a robot will end up doing for free. Previous stages of automation meant that humans could be hired to maintain the robots that were taking their jobs, but now automation is getting to a point where it is becoming self sustaining.

What this means is that you might end up losing your job because of automation and not have any other options to look into. You don’t need to panic just yet, though. The infographic below is going to tell you what jobs are going to become fully automated in the near future. This will help you understand if your job is in danger in the first place.



Key Stats from above visual:

Nearly one fifth of the global workforce could feel the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) advancements in their workplace by 2020.

Roles like data entry, accounting and assembly workers are likely to become redundant, after the revolution of automation.

While AI will make some jobs obsolete, experts predict it will make way for job creation in other areas, including, robotics engineers, innovation professionals and solution designers.
