But for all the authentic and exciting ways it’s transforming the tasks computers can perform, there’s a lot of hype, too. 

As Jeremy Achin, CEO of newly minted unicorn DataRobot, puts it: “Everyone knows you have to have machine learning in your story or you’re not sexy.”


The inherently broad term gets bandied about so often that it can start to feel meaningless and gets trotted out by companies to gussy up even simple data analysis. To help cut through the noise, Forbes and data partner Meritech Capital put together a list of private, U.S.-based companies that are wielding some subset of artificial intelligence in a meaningful way and demonstrating real business potential from doing so. One makes robots that can whir around shoppers to help workers restock shelves. Another scans recruiting pitches for unconscious bias. A third analyzes massive data sets to make street-by-street weather predictions.

To be included on the list, companies needed to show that techniques like machine learning (where systems learn from data to improve on tasks), natural language processing (which enables programs to “understand” written or spoken language), or computer vision (which relates to how machines “see”) are a core part of their business model and future success. Find all the details on our methodology here.

The honorees span categories like human resources, security, insurance, and finance, with healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure startups best represented on the list. While most of the 50 hail from traditional tech centers like Silicon Valley, New York City and Boston, there’s representation from smaller hubs such as Detroit and Austin, too. Cumulatively, the startups are flush with cash–unsurprising, given that startups touting AI received a record $7.4 billion in funding in just the second quarter of 2019, according to CBInsights. Only eight startups were founded or cofounded by women, reflecting trends in venture funding, where software startups run by men have received the lion’s share of investment dollars. That’s a possible cause for concern: Studies have shown that artificial intelligence can compound existing biases in data, which may be more likely to happen if there are fewer women and underrepresented minorities in the room.
The winners below are listed in order of ascending valuation, and in each case we’ve tried to focus on the problem the company is trying to solve instead of the tool solving it. In instances where companies submitted valuation information on the condition of confidentially, Forbes used estimates from data provider Pitchbook.

AI 50 founders reflect on the biggest misconceptions they hear about artificial intelligence and Meritech Capital principal Konstantine Buhler explains how he evaluates startups.

44 | Xnor.ai
Headquarters: Seattle 
Founders: Ali Farhadi,  Mohammad Rastegari (CEO: Jon Gelsey)
Funding: $14.6 million, via Pitchbook
Valuation: $62.05 million, via Pitchbook
While researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Ali Farhadi and Mohammad Rastegari identified a problem: “Most of the time, AI researchers (including ourselves) tend to make better, newer algorithms with more demand for compute, memory and power,” Farhadi says. “However, the real-world use cases tend to move in the opposite direction—demanding solutions with less compute, memory and power.” They set about trying to create a system where complex algorithms could run on simple hardware and spun out of the Allen Institute, which was cofounded by the late Paul Allen of Microsoft, in 2016. Earlier this year, the company hit a technology breakthrough when it managed to run a simple computer vision system on a solar-powered computer chip.

41 | Rulai 
Headquarters: Campbell, CA 
Founders: Marc Vanlerberghe (CEO), Yi Zhang
Funding: $14.5 million
Valuation: $80 million
While chat bots burst onto the scene with a lot of promise (remember how they were going to take over Facebook Messenger?), they never quite reached mainstream adoption, due in part to disenchantment with their limited scope and conversational rigidity. Rulai says its virtual assistants are different. While most bots run into trouble when users switch context or add tasks, cofounder Yi Zhang says that Rulai’s dialog manager models don’t get tripped up. “Virtual assistants need to handle the variation of natural language and the variation of conversation flows,” she says. Rulai has won over the likes of Lyft, Sanofi and Fidelity with its customer support, sales and employee productivity bots.

40 | Algorithmia
Headquarters: Seattle
Founders: Diego Oppenheimer (CEO), Kenny Daniel 
Funding: $38 million, via Pitchbook 
Valuation: $100 million, via Pitchbook
Algorithmia cofounder Kenny Daniel used to have a favorite saying: “'The future is already invented; it just happens to be stuck in a research paper somewhere.” He and longtime Microsoft employee Diego Oppenheimer banded together to devise an easier way for data scientists to discover and work with machine learning models. While Algorithmia began as a marketplace for algorithms used primarily by individual developers, it has adapted into a more robust infrastructure service for large enterprises. For example, it says that one financial institution used its platform to bring a new risk model into production.

37 | Affectiva 
Headquarters: Boston  
Founders: Rana el Kaliouby (CEO), Rosalind Picard 
Funding: $53 million 
Valuation: $116 million
Affectiva is trying to tackle the incredibly hard problem of  teaching software to recognize emotions based on facial expressions and voice. “There is no way that heuristic coding or a simple rules-based approach can capture all these complexities and nuance,” says cofounder and CEO Rana el Kaliouby. The company recently raised a fresh round of funding led by automotive company Aptiv with the hope that its technology could one day be integrated into smart cars (imagine a vehicle that could issue a warning to a drowsy-looking driver). In the meantime, it’s also being used to test consumer feedback on ads and TV programming.

33 | Tamr
Headquarters: Cambridge, MA
Founders: Andy Palmer (CEO), Ihab Ilyas, Mike Stonebraker 
Funding: $73.5 million
Valuation: $155 million, via Pitchbook
Data management company Tamr was born out of an MIT research project to apply machine learning to clean and organize so-called dirty data that’s incomplete or inconsistent. Andy Palmer was running data engineering at pharmaceutical company Novartis when MIT’s system was brought in to organize a decade’s worth of biological assay information spread across more than 15,000 tables. The technology worked so well that he and two of the researchers decided to start a company around it. “The only way to curate thousands of tabular data sources that are constantly changing is using an artful combination of machine learning and human expertise,” says Palmer, who is now CEO. In practice, that means that Tamr’s system automatically identifies sources of data across a company that could be useful together and then tags in an employee to instruct the software how to integrate it. The company sells its service to customers like Toyota, GSK and GE, which it says saved over $80 million using Tamr.

29 | K Health  
Headquarters: New York City
Founders: Allon Bloch (CEO), Ran Shaul, Adam Singolda 
Funding: $56 million, via Pitchbook
Valuation: $200 million, via Pitchbook
K Health doesn’t think that everyday health concerns need to warrant a trip to the doctor’s office. “K was built by technologists and doctors because we felt frustrated with the ability to access relevant, personalized and affordable healthcare,” says cofounder and CEO Allon Bloch. The company’s consumer app draws on a data set of more than 2 billion anonymized medical records, finding subtle patterns in the data to give users personalized health advice. In July, K announced a partnership with insurance provider Anthem to let members see how doctors diagnose and treat similar people with similar symptoms for free (though they’ll be charged to chat with an actual doctor).

28 | Moveworks
Headquarters: Mountain View, CA
Founders: Bhavin Shah (CEO), Vaibhav Nivargi, Varun Singh, Jiang Chen
Funding: $30 million 
Valuation: $200 million+
Moveworks wants to end the frustration of waiting around for corporate IT help–its natural language understanding engine can solve 25% to 35% of all employee IT issues autonomously. For example, if a worker sends a frantic message like,  “Sorry, I was biking to work and dropped my laptop accidentally, and it won’t turn on now. What should I do?? Please help!” the system can both understand the problem and send the right form for a loaner laptop. Moveworks has a “deep, semantic understanding of the kinds of problems employees experience and how they express them,” CEO Bhavin Shah says. Big customers like Autodesk, Western Digital and Nutanix are on board.

27 | Rev.com
Headquarters: Austin, TX
Founder: Jason Chicola (CEO), David Abrameto, Mark Chen, Paul Huck, Dan Kokotov. 
Funding: $31 million
Valuation: $206 million
In June, transcription service Rev.com said that its tests show that its word error rate on podcast transcriptions was lower than what Google, Amazon or Microsoft’s tools produced. While developers can buy access to that completely automated speech recognition engine, its network of freelance transcribers also use it to make their client work easier and faster. CEO Jason Chicola says this hybrid approach leads to higher- quality, cheaper transcriptions. “Language is incredibly complex—think accents, mumbling, arcane terminology, bad microphones, background noise,” says Chicola. “Humans are far, far better at making judgment calls for these real-world factors.”

26 | Noodle.ai 
Headquarters: San Francisco
Founders: Stephen Pratt (CEO), Raj Joshi, Martha McGaw, Ted Gaubert, Matt Denesuk
Funding: $51 million, via Pitchbook
Valuation: $210 million, via Pitchbook 
Stephen Pratt first saw machine learning in action while working as a consultant on a Department of Defense project in the early 1990s. Computers were too slow and data too expensive to make AI practical at the time, but roughly three decades later, Pratt teamed up with investment firm TPG to help it identify a data analytics company to buy or invest in. After a yearlong search he couldn’t find the right fit and joined IBM Watson, but only stayed for eight months before deciding to build something new with TPG’s backing. Pratt gathered a handful of industry vets as his cofounders and Noodle.ai launched on Pi Day 2016 (3.14.16). The startup charges a one-time fee to create AI software for industrial and transportation companies, with a monthly hosting fee on top. It’s booked $50 million in total contract value from the likes of XoJet and Big River Steel.

Headquarters: Mountain View, CA
Founders: Don Burnette (CEO), Paz Eshel 
Funding: $40 million
Valuation: $210 million, via Pitchbook
The red-hot autonomous trucking space is full of well-funded competition, but that inherent risk isn’t deterring Kodiak Robotics cofounders Don Burnette and Paz Eshel (the two met on a sky-diving trip, after all). The idea is that autonomously driving cargo-laden trucks down a highway could be a nearer-term and even more attractive commercial opportunity than passenger vehicles. Kodiak recently started shipping household goods in between Dallas and Houston, Texas, but said that it can’t name clients just yet. Ultimately, it plans to build its own comprehensive logistics business instead of selling its technology to other carriers.

18 | People.ai  Oleg Rogynskyy of People Ai 
Headquarters: San Francisco
Founder: Oleg Rogynskyy (CEO)
Funding: $100 million
Valuation: $500 million, via Pitchbook
People.ai CEO Oleg Rogynskyy says he’ll never forget the moment he realized how much time salespeople spend doing nonsales things. At the time, he was an early employee at a company called Nstein Technologies. “The COO of Nstein grounded the whole sales team for a week in a sweaty, windowless conference room to go and clean up our Salesforce,” Rogynskyy recalls. That week inspired him to address “bad” customer relationship management data head-on, he says. In 2016, Rogynskyy founded People.ai, which integrates into CRM systems like Salesforce and automatically inputs relevant data from email, calendars, Slack chats and more, and advises salespeople on the “best” tasks to focus on. VMware, Zoom, New Relic and Lyft are all customers.

Headquarters: San Francisco 
Founders: Jordan Fisher (CEO), Michael Suswal, David Valdman, John Novack, Brandon Ogle, Dan Fischetti, TJ Lutz 
Funding: $86 million 
Valuation: $535 million
Goodbye, cashiers. Hello, cameras. Standard Cognition is working on an autonomous checkout system where shoppers can wander through a store, picking out goods and pay without scanning their items or interacting with an employee. Its overhead cameras track individuals and items continuously (notably, its so-called entity cohesion doesn’t rely on facial recognition, which it says gives shoppers more privacy). “We have essentially created autonomous checkout for everyone who is not Amazon,” the company says. Standard Cognition has opened a pop-up in San Francisco to show off its tech and says that it’s in “shadow mode” testing in several stores in North America.

12 | UpstartUpstart cofounders Dave Girouard, Anna M. Counselman, and Paul Gu
 

Headquarters: San Carlos, CA
Founders: Dave Girouard (CEO), Anna M. Counselman, Paul Gu
Funding: $164 million 
Valuation: $750 million, via Pitchbook
Upstart CEO Dave Girouard admits that most of the early team of former Google employees had no history in financial services when they came up with the idea to apply advanced data science to the credit process in 2012: Only the belief that the current system was antiquated and exclusionary. By using data not typically found in a person’s credit history to find more nuanced risk patterns, Girouard says Upstart’s lending model has higher approval rates and lower interest rates than traditional methods, with loss rates that are “less than half” of those of peer platforms. To-date, more than 300,000 individual borrowers have used Upstart to get a loan.

11 | Fundbox 
Headquarters: San Francisco
Founders: Eyal Shinar (CEO), Tomer Michaeli, Yuval Ariav
Funding: $140 million 
Valuation: $750 million
Fundbox has a data-driven take on lending that facilitates loans to small businesses rather than regular people. Founder Eyal Shinar says that seeing his mother, who ran a staffing agency, struggle with cash flow inspired the idea of advancing customers for outstanding invoices. A company that wants a loan through Fundbox connects their existing finance tools to its platform, which then uses these data streams to assess risk and either approve the loan or not. Shinar says that process can take as little as three minutes.

9 | Scale AI
Headquarters: San Francisco
Founders: Alexandr Wang (CEO)
Funding: $122 million
Valuation: $1 billion
Alexandr Wang’s data labeling startup Scale AI has gained so much attention from customers — particularly autonomous transportation companies, which need gobs of well-labeled data to train their systems — that he’s running a unicorn company before his 23rd birthday. Scale works with tens of thousands of contractors and though Wang says that the company uses machine learning to help improve the accuracy of its labeling, those humans are core to its mission. “ML is very much garbage-in garbage out, so we focused on quality from day one,” he says.

1 | Nuro
Headquarters: Mountain View
Founders: Jiajun Zhu (CEO), Dave Ferguson
Funding: $1.03 billion
Valuation: $2.7 billion
After working for more than five years each on Google’s self-driving project, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu were done trying to ferry people around in autonomous vehicles. So, they ditched humans for local goods. Nuro’s driverless delivery vehicles have completed thousands of trips to shoppers through a partnership with Kroger in Texas. Shifting from people to pasta and Poptarts eliminates safety and technical constraints. “You can drive more conservatively because you don’t have someone inside the vehicle that’s getting frustrated,” Ferguson says.

How to address the “data-wrangling issue”
Addressing the slow uptake of AI

 

By Kim Thomas – Digital Health

Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been promoted as a tool which could transform the way clinicians work in the NHS. However there is an awareness that the space between the promise and the reality is often large. Kim Thomas reports on the realities and myths surrounding AI in healthcare. 
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), in common with other NHS hospitals, has a problem with patients not attending appointments.
As Neil Sebire, chief research officer and director of the hospital’s Digital Research, Informatics and Virtual Environment (DRIVE) unit points out: “If you book a clinic and 20% of the patients don’t turn up, you’re wasting 20% of the slots.”
Could artificial intelligence (AI) – which uses software to perform tasks usually requiring human intelligence – make a difference?
Getting the most out of algorithms
By analysing operational data, GOSH hopes to develop an algorithm that can predict which patients are likely to miss an appointment, enabling the hospital to find ways to maximise the likelihood of them attending.
Another AI project, yet to start, involves analysing anonymised patient data to predict the effect of a particular drug on certain groups of patients according to variables such as age or sex.
“Instead of saying 5% of patients who take this drug will be nauseous, can we model that there’s a 45% chance that this patient will be nauseous, whereas for this patient it’s a very low chance,” Sebire explains.
Once the algorithm has been built, it can be refined.
Sebire points out: “As long as you’ve got data, the model can get more and more complicated and take account of more and more factors.”
Looking at the national picture
In August, health secretary Matt Hancock announced an investment of £250m to create a National AI Lab for the NHS.
The announcement followed publication of the government’s Topol Review in February, which said that AI “has the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare in the NHS, from streamlining workflow processes to improving the accuracy of diagnosis and personalising treatment, as well as helping staff work more efficiently and effectively”.
In practice, AI projects already underway in the NHS tend to be small-scale and focused, like the GOSH projects, on improving operational efficiencies.
Flagging up the important bits
Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, for example, has been working with the University of Bradford to develop algorithms based on Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data to predict how long patients will stay, and to identify early those patients who may end up staying longer than necessary (because a social care plan has to be put in place, for example).
Another project will look at how to identify A&E patients most likely to require a test, enabling it to be ordered immediately rather than after a long wait by the patient.
The hospital also intends to use data from its electronic patient record (EPR) to develop algorithms that can guide clinicians – but Tom Lawton, head of clinical artificial intelligence, believes that AI is a long way from being able to replace clinical decision-making.
It can, however, alert doctors to significant symptoms.
“If an AI system can just help you pick out the important bits and flag things up to you, that makes the situation safer because you’re not missing stuff,” Lawton says.
Not as simple as you think
Nonetheless, some projects are being undertaken to improve clinical outcomes. The Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust has successfully been using Google DeepMind Health’s AI app Streams to predict which patients might be at risk of acute kidney injury – though it has been criticised for sharing patient data with the company.
Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust also has a partnership with DeepMind Health to use AI to analyse eye scans for signs of disease.
The technology, which has been based on the analysis of thousands of anonymised eye scans, has shown an effectiveness rate of 94%, matching human experts.
Currently waiting times to see an ophthalmologist are long, and the aim is to use the technology to prioritise patients who need to be treated urgently.
Despite the promising results, the technology is still a few years away from being used in practice, says Dawn Sim, director of telemedicine at Moorfields.
“The next steps are to validate the algorithm in a multi-centre study and that is under way,” she says.
“And then the step up from that would be implementing it and then scaling it, looking at how we’re doing and refining the algorithm.
“It’s not quite as simple as: ‘We have a finished product that is ready to roll.'”
Unexpected benefits
The use of AI to speed up diagnosis of radiology scans has long been seen as one of the most promising clinical applications.
At East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, Neelan Das, consultant cardiac and interventional radiologist and lead for AI at the trust, is leading a team piloting software from Qure.Ai that automates the reading of chest X-rays, identifying the ones that need urgent treatment.
The algorithm used by the software has been trained on 1.2 million X-rays, and it has been used successfully in India to screen for tuberculosis, Das says.
In the East Kent pilot, the technology will act as a “workflow prioritisation tool” though a radiologist would still need to check the results.
Currently, Das points out, the shortage of radiologists means that chest X-rays are often read by the doctor ordering the X-ray – not just in East Kent, but elsewhere in the NHS.
So if the trust decides to implement the Qure.AI software, rather than saving time, it will create work for radiologists. The potential benefit comes not from reducing workload, but from improving the quality of diagnosis.
Das has concerns about the implementation of AI, however. A CT chest scan, for example, has multiple components, including lungs, ribs, blood vessels, muscles and trachea – but an AI application will typically look only at one aspect, such as lung nodules.
Backing up the evidence
While that has the potential to be extremely useful, it’s not enough on its own.
“For one section of the body you might need 10 or 12 different AI providers – it’s impractical to implement them,” Das says.
He worries, too, about quality, arguing all AI apps should undergo trials and the results published in peer-reviewed journals.
AI apps are continually evolving through usage, with Das adding: “If an AI app passes accreditation once, should it undergo a process of accreditation again a year later?”
The government’s own code of conduct, he notes, identifies important principles for implementing AI safely.
Unresolved questions
There are other barriers to overcome before widespread adoption of AI in the NHS. Some questions are still unresolved.
Hugh Whittall, director of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, points to the questions of trust and privacy surrounding the use of health data on a large scale, but there is an added difficulty, he notes, in creating algorithms based on data sources that may not be representative of the wider population.
Another difficulty comes, says Sebire, “when you have a complicated AI system that takes a huge amount of data and then comes up with a recommendation, and we as humans cannot understand how it came up with that recommendation. The question in those scenarios is: do you just go with the machine, or do you go with the human?”
Whittall agrees, adding: “It does raise questions about the responsibility of the doctor, where legal liability might lie, whether you are simply undermining the professional status of the health professionals and whether patients’ decision making and patient consent can ever be properly informed if the decision or recommendation can’t be explained adequately.”
Looking beyond the hype
Despite the hype, we are a long way from a world in which apps, rather than doctors, are making clinical decisions.
They do, however, have the potential to bring efficiencies and to speed up decision-making.
As Sebire says: “There is so much benefit for the NHS from simply improving operational efficiencies that you don’t need to go down the route of robot doctors diagnosing patients to get a massive amount of benefit.”

How to address the “data-wrangling issue”







By InterSystems

AI has the potential to transform the way healthcare is delivered in the NHS. By applying algorithms to large data sets, it is possible to make diagnoses or predict the likelihood of individuals developing particular diseases.
The implementation of AI, however, requires substantial amounts of data. In the NHS, data is usually held in multiple clinical and administrative databases, often in different formats, making it hard to access and manage.
Data may be incomplete or inaccurate, so that creating a single, coherent, usable data set is time-consuming. Even a task such as deciding whether a care record from two different clinical systems refers to the same patient can be laborious. About 80% of data scientists’ time is spent on “data wrangling” – the job of converting raw data into something useful for AI purposes.
Making data usable
InterSystems addresses this through IRIS, a data platform that simplifies the job of taking data from multiple sources and making it usable.
HealthShare, the regional care record solution from InterSystems, now uses IRIS to amalgamate patient healthcare information from different sources.
It is then relatively straightforward for customers to apply AI algorithms to the data.
Jon Payne, manager for sales engineering at InterSystems, says one US customer is using population-level data to look at the risk of patients developing diabetes, for example, or of going to the emergency department. The customer is then able to “develop appropriate care plans or look at ways to improve patients’ health”.
Another InterSystems customer, says Payne, is a pathology lab combining genetic data with clinical data to improve predictions about whether a genetic mutation is likely to result in an individual developing cancer.
Other customers are using AI to analyse data from hundreds of thousands of smart home drug delivery devices.
“These provide information, not only about whether someone has taken a drug, but how effectively they’re using the device, such as flow rates for inhalers,” says Payne. “So you can look at the efficiency and effectiveness of the devices on a wider scale.”
Getting data protection right
Data protection laws mean that widescale adoption of AI by the NHS may take some time, says Payne. There is plenty of potential, however, to use it for operational purposes, such as predicting the availability of lab equipment.
“Introducing change in that context can make a big difference and could be a quick win for the NHS,” he says.

Addressing the slow uptake of AI





By Sectra
At a time when the NHS is short of radiologists, AI has the ability to make the process of interpreting radiology images much more efficient and also decrease the rate of errors.
If AI algorithms are trained and designed correctly, they could significantly increase productivity for radiologist, says Chris Scarisbrick, sales director at Sectra. So what is holding back the adoption of AI?
There are two major reasons for the slow take-up. One is the lack of tight integration into the existing workflow. Radiologists are already dealing with a picture archiving and communications system (PACS), and many early AI apps require manual interactions that add to the workload of clinicians who are already overburdened.
The second is that the traditional model for procuring healthcare IT in the NHS doesn’t work well for AI. Procurement is a time-intensive process that usually results in a supplier being chosen to provide services for a minimum of five years. But many AI suppliers are start-ups, and more are entering the market all the time. This means NHS trusts require a more flexible approach so that they can take advantage of the latest technologies or acquire such apps from a platform provider.
Getting happy with apps
Sectra has addressed both those problems by doing much of the difficult work upfront. It is piloting an AI app store, with the company quality assuring the integration with AI apps to make sure they are tested and are efficient in the workflow. All the apps are integrated seamlessly into the Sectra PACS, meaning the workflow of radiologists is not disrupted. They also integrate with apps from many different vendors.
Scarisbrick gives an example of what kinds of apps are available in a pilot version of the store.
There are apps which are able to evaluate a range of examinations types for a wide range of conditions. In this way, a whole worklist of CT scans, chest X-rays or brain scans (for example) can be assessed by the AI, and it can feed these findings back to the Sectra PACS. The Sectra PACS has the logic within to sort the worklist based upon the clinical severity so that the clinician is served up with the most urgent cases first.
Another app on the market will be able to perform the second read of double-read studies, potentially offering significant time savings without compromising on quality.
Sectra is now working towards a pilot of an AI app store with selected NHS customers. This will overcome many of the problems associated with the procurement of the technology and will help to drive the adoption of AI in radiology, but also in other imaging heavy specialties such as pathology.
“AI does have the potential to be transformative and drive efficiencies, we just need to make it easier for physicians to adopt and benefit from these tools, and feel comfortable by the results they provide” says Scarisbrick.

What business leaders need to know about artificial intelligence

Why It Matters		



AI isn’t coming for your job — yet. But leaders do need to understand how machine learning, natural language processing, and other intelligence will impact your business.

Artificial intelligence dominates the headlines, part promise and part specter, as society grapples with how technology is changing the way we work and live.
Both hype about AI’s immediate potential and fear about its effects are exaggerated, according to MIT Sloan professorThomas W. Malone,director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.
A realistic understanding of artificial intelligence and the promise of robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing is increasingly important for businesses. The 2018 AI Index report found increased interest in the topic around the world, including substantial increases in AI research, investment in AI startups, enrollment in AI college courses, and jobs that require deep learning skills.

“A lot of senior executives and business leaders today are almost desperate to understand how AI may affect their businesses,” said Malone, who teaches a popular executive education course on artificial intelligence and business strategy. “I think leaders are increasingly worried in many cases that if they don’t figure out how to use AI effectively, they’ll be left behind.” Malone said the course emphasizes the history of artificial intelligence and common misconceptions along with how businesses can harness technology.
Malone said the course also tries to give business leaders a level of AI understanding in between a superficial knowledge of buzzwords and the technical know-how of programmers. He compared it to knowledge about how a car works.  You don’t have to know how to repair a car in order to know what to do when you have a flat tire or when the car runs out of gas.
In a similar way, business leaders should get a sense of the basics of AI, like how a computer can look at a picture and identify a stop sign, a pedestrian, or a car. 
Course details: Artificial Intelligence | Implications for Business Strategy
“That level of understanding is extremely useful in thinking about how to apply [artificial intelligence] in business,” he said. “If all you know is that it’s something like magic, you can’t really think very hard or very far about how to use it in business without talking to a magician. For example, if you don’t know enough, you’ll ask for all kinds of things that can’t be done.”
Beyond a basic understanding of AI — a look behind the magic curtain, so to speak — Malone said it is important to grasp the truth behind some of AI’s promise.
Here’s a look at the current state of AI. 
Smart machines can’t necessarily do simple tasks 
Intelligent systems are already in use around the world — robots in warehouses, digital voice assistants in homes, credit risk evaluation programs in banks. These technologies have specialized intelligence, Malone points out, and they are capable of performing specific tasks. But artificial intelligence is not yet capable of general intelligence, like the kind humans possess.
Malone cites the IBM Watson program, which can famously defeat even the best human players of Jeopardy, as an example. “You think wow, that machine must be really smart,” Malone said. “But the truth is that the [version of the] program that beat the best players in Jeopardy couldn’t even play Tic Tac Toe, much less chess.”
The version of Watson that dazzled at Jeopardy, like other AI, is highly specialized; in this case, it’s specialized in precisely the task of playing Jeopardy.
“Just because a program can do something that would be hard for humans to do doesn’t mean the same program can do all the other things that would be easier for humans to do,” Malone said.  “In many cases, it can’t do very many of those other things at all.” Businesses already using AI are using it for specific tasks, but not for broad problem-solving.
Human-level intelligence is many years away, but machine learning is here now
AI with human-level general intelligence — the ability to drive a car, move packages, and win at Jeopardy, for example — is still far from reality, Malone said, and humans have been misjudging its arrival for decades.
People today often estimate that human-level AI is about 20 years away. But that timeline hasn’t changed since the 1950s, he points out. Back then people also estimated that advanced human-level AI was about 20 years away. “In other words, it’s been 20 years away for 60 years,” Malone said. 
“I think we should be very skeptical of anyone who confidently predicts that we’ll have human level AI in the next couple of decades,” he said.
That’s not to say there aren’t significant advances in some areas of AI.
“If you’re going to learn about only one part of AI right now, machine learning is probably the most important one to learn,” said Malone, who also teaches an executive education course about machine learning.  
“There’s been very rapid progress in machine learning in the last few years, and it is now the basis for some of the most impressive AI applications we have,"" he said. “For instance, machine learning is behind Google translate and the applications that transcribe what you say when you dictate a text message. It’s also key to programs for face recognition, self-driving cars, and sophisticated credit risk analysis.”
Artificial intelligence will likely change jobs, but it won’t take them all away
Artificial intelligence prompts strong human emotions, Malone said. The idea that machines will be taking jobs from people is one of the strongest causes for concern. In fact, that anxiety prompted MIT to embark on a multiyear Work of the Future study, which found that automation will have a profound effect on how people work but inequality and job loss are not inevitable byproducts. 


We should be very skeptical of anyone who confidently predicts that we’ll have human-level AI in the next couple of decades.

Some jobs will undoubtedly disappear because of automation, Malone said, but history indicates that new technology usually creates new jobs as it destroys old ones. 
In his book ""Superminds,"" Malone argues that in the future humans and machines will work together to do things that haven’t been done before. Humans will continue to work at jobs that machines can’t, assume new jobs enabled by artificial intelligence, or will continue to do existing jobs because people prefer to have other people do them (like judges, artists, and football players). 
“That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t worry about what to do for people who lose jobs and can’t find others during this transition period,” he said. “I think that’s very different than the doomsday scenarios many people are worried about, massive unemployment for a large fraction of the population. I think while that’s theoretically possible, it’s extremely unlikely.”

Her lab studies reinforcement learning, a type of artificial intelligence that’s used, among other things, to help virtual characters (“half cheetah” and “ant” are popular) teach themselves how to move about in virtual worlds. It’s a prerequisite to building autonomous robots and cars. Pineau’s students hoped to improve on another lab’s system. But first they had to rebuild it, and their design, for reasons unknown, was falling short of its promised results. Until, that is, the students tried some “creative manipulations” that didn’t appear in the other lab’s paper.Lo and behold, the system began performing as advertised. The lucky break was a symptom of a troubling trend, according to Pineau. Neural networks, the technique that’s given us Go-mastering bots and text generators that craft classical Chinese poetry, are often called black boxes because of the mysteries of how they work. Getting them to perform well can be like an art, involving subtle tweaks that go unreported in publications. The networks also are growing larger and more complex, with huge data sets and massive computing arrays that make replicating and studying those models expensive, if not impossible for all but the best-funded labs.“Is that even research anymore?” asks Anna Rogers, a machine-learning researcher at the University of Massachusetts. “It’s not clear if you’re demonstrating the superiority of your model or your budget.”Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIPineau is trying to change the standards. She’s the reproducibility chair for NeurIPS, a premier artificial intelligence conference. Under her watch, the conference now asks researchers to submit a “reproducibility checklist” including items often omitted from papers, like the number of models trained before the “best” one was selected, the computing power used, and links to code and datasets. That’s a change for a field where prestige rests on leaderboards—rankings that determine whose system is the “state of the art” for a particular task—and offers great incentive to gloss over the tribulations that led to those spectacular results.The idea, Pineau says, is to encourage researchers to offer a road map for others to replicate their work. It’s one thing to marvel at the eloquence of a new text generator or the “superhuman” agility of a videogame-playing bot. But even the most sophisticated researchers have little sense of how they work. Replicating those AI models is important not just for identifying new avenues of research, but also as a way to investigate algorithms as they augment, and in some cases supplant, human decision-making—everything from who stays in jail and for how long to who is approved for a mortgage.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceOthers are also attacking the problem. Researchers at Google have proposed so-called “model cards” to detail how machine-learning systems have been tested, including results that point out potential bias. Others have sought to show how fragile the term “state of the art” is when systems, optimized for the data sets used in rankings, are set loose in other contexts. Last week, researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2, released a paper that aims to expand Pineau’s reproducibility checklist to other parts of the experimental process. They call it “Show Your Work.”“Starting where someone left off is such a pain because we never fully describe the experimental setup,” says Jesse Dodge, an AI2 researcher who coauthored the research. “People can’t reproduce what we did if we don’t talk about what we did.” It’s a surprise, he adds, when people report even basic details about how a system was built. A survey of reinforcement learning papers last year found only about half included code.Sometimes, basic information is missing because it’s proprietary—an issue especially for industry labs. But it’s more often a sign of the field’s failure to keep up with changing methods, Dodge says. A decade ago, it was more straightforward to see what a researcher changed to improve their results. Neural networks, by comparison, are finicky; getting the best results often involves tuning thousands of little knobs, what Dodge calls a form of “black magic.” Picking the best model often requires a large number of experiments. The magic gets expensive, fast.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDEven the big industrial labs, with the resources to design the largest, most complex systems, have signaled alarm. When Facebook attempted to replicate AlphaGo, the system developed by Alphabet’s DeepMind to master the ancient game of Go, the researchers appeared exhausted by the task. The vast computational requirements—millions of experiments running on thousands of devices over days—combined with unavailable code, made the system “very difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce, study, improve upon, and extend,” they wrote in a paper published in May. (The Facebook team ultimately succeeded.)AdvertisementThe AI2 research proposes a solution to that problem. The idea is to provide more data about the experiments that took place. You can still report the best model you obtained after, say, 100 experiments—the result that might be declared “state of the art”—but you also would report the range of performance you would expect if you only had the budget to try it 10 times, or just once.The point of reproducibility, according to Dodge, isn’t to replicate the results exactly. That would be nearly impossible given the natural randomness in neural networks and variations in hardware and code. Instead, the idea is to offer a road map to reach the same conclusions as the original research, especially when that involves deciding which machine-learning system is best for a particular task.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreThat could help research become more efficient, Dodge explains. When his team rebuilt some popular machine-learning systems, they found that for some budgets, more antiquated methods made more sense than flashier ones. The idea is to help smaller academic labs by outlining how to get the best bang for their buck. A side benefit, he adds, is that the approach could encourage greener research, given that training large models can require as much energy as the lifetime emissions of a car.Pineau says she’s heartened to see others trying to “open up the models,” but she’s unsure whether most labs would take advantage of those cost-saving benefits. Many researchers would still feel pressure to use more computers to stay at the cutting edge, and then tackle efficiency later. It’s also tricky to generalize how researchers should report their results, she adds. It’s possible AI2’s “show your work” approach could mask complexities in how researchers select the best models.Those variations in methods are partly why the NeurIPS reproducibility checklist is voluntary. One stumbling block, especially for industrial labs, is proprietary code and data. If, say, Facebook is doing research with your Instagram photos, there’s an issue with sharing that data publicly.

Check out our favorite wireless headphones, soundbars, and bluetooth speakers",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis/'}",,"Lo and behold, the system began performing as advertised. The lucky break was a symptom of a troubling trend, according to Pineau. Neural networks, the technique that’s given us Go-mastering bots and text generators that craft classical Chinese poetry, are often called black boxes because of the mysteries of how they work. Getting them to perform well can be like an art, involving subtle tweaks that go unreported in publications. The networks also are growing larger and more complex, with huge data sets and massive computing arrays that make replicating and studying those models expensive, if not impossible for all but the best-funded labs.
“Is that even research anymore?” asks Anna Rogers, a machine-learning researcher at the University of Massachusetts. “It’s not clear if you’re demonstrating the superiority of your model or your budget.”
Pineau is trying to change the standards. She’s the reproducibility chair for NeurIPS, a premier artificial intelligence conference. Under her watch, the conference now asks researchers to submit a “reproducibility checklist” including items often omitted from papers, like the number of models trained before the “best” one was selected, the computing power used, and links to code and datasets. That’s a change for a field where prestige rests on leaderboards—rankings that determine whose system is the “state of the art” for a particular task—and offers great incentive to gloss over the tribulations that led to those spectacular results.
The idea, Pineau says, is to encourage researchers to offer a road map for others to replicate their work. It’s one thing to marvel at the eloquence of a new text generator or the “superhuman” agility of a videogame-playing bot. But even the most sophisticated researchers have little sense of how they work. Replicating those AI models is important not just for identifying new avenues of research, but also as a way to investigate algorithms as they augment, and in some cases supplant, human decision-making—everything from who stays in jail and for how long to who is approved for a mortgage.
Others are also attacking the problem. Researchers at Google have proposed so-called “model cards” to detail how machine-learning systems have been tested, including results that point out potential bias. Others have sought to show how fragile the term “state of the art” is when systems, optimized for the data sets used in rankings, are set loose in other contexts. Last week, researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2, released a paper that aims to expand Pineau’s reproducibility checklist to other parts of the experimental process. They call it “Show Your Work.”
“Starting where someone left off is such a pain because we never fully describe the experimental setup,” says Jesse Dodge, an AI2 researcher who coauthored the research. “People can’t reproduce what we did if we don’t talk about what we did.” It’s a surprise, he adds, when people report even basic details about how a system was built. A survey of reinforcement learning papers last year found only about half included code.
Sometimes, basic information is missing because it’s proprietary—an issue especially for industry labs. But it’s more often a sign of the field’s failure to keep up with changing methods, Dodge says. A decade ago, it was more straightforward to see what a researcher changed to improve their results. Neural networks, by comparison, are finicky; getting the best results often involves tuning thousands of little knobs, what Dodge calls a form of “black magic.” Picking the best model often requires a large number of experiments. The magic gets expensive, fast.
Even the big industrial labs, with the resources to design the largest, most complex systems, have signaled alarm. When Facebook attempted to replicate AlphaGo, the system developed by Alphabet’s DeepMind to master the ancient game of Go, the researchers appeared exhausted by the task. The vast computational requirements—millions of experiments running on thousands of devices over days—combined with unavailable code, made the system “very difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce, study, improve upon, and extend,” they wrote in a paper published in May. (The Facebook team ultimately succeeded.)
The AI2 research proposes a solution to that problem. The idea is to provide more data about the experiments that took place. You can still report the best model you obtained after, say, 100 experiments—the result that might be declared “state of the art”—but you also would report the range of performance you would expect if you only had the budget to try it 10 times, or just once.
The point of reproducibility, according to Dodge, isn’t to replicate the results exactly. That would be nearly impossible given the natural randomness in neural networks and variations in hardware and code. Instead, the idea is to offer a road map to reach the same conclusions as the original research, especially when that involves deciding which machine-learning system is best for a particular task.
That could help research become more efficient, Dodge explains. When his team rebuilt some popular machine-learning systems, they found that for some budgets, more antiquated methods made more sense than flashier ones. The idea is to help smaller academic labs by outlining how to get the best bang for their buck. A side benefit, he adds, is that the approach could encourage greener research, given that training large models can require as much energy as the lifetime emissions of a car.
Pineau says she’s heartened to see others trying to “open up the models,” but she’s unsure whether most labs would take advantage of those cost-saving benefits. Many researchers would still feel pressure to use more computers to stay at the cutting edge, and then tackle efficiency later. It’s also tricky to generalize how researchers should report their results, she adds. It’s possible AI2’s “show your work” approach could mask complexities in how researchers select the best models.
Those variations in methods are partly why the NeurIPS reproducibility checklist is voluntary. One stumbling block, especially for industrial labs, is proprietary code and data. If, say, Facebook is doing research with your Instagram photos, there’s an issue with sharing that data publicly. Clinical research involving health data is another sticking point. “We don’t want to move toward cutting off researchers from the community,” she says.
It’s difficult, in other words, to develop reproducibility standards that work without constraining researchers, especially as methods rapidly evolve. But Pineau is optimistic. Another component of the NeurIPS reproducibility effort is a challenge that involves asking other researchers to replicate accepted papers. Compared with other fields, like the life sciences, where old methods die hard, the field is more open to putting researchers in those kinds of sensitive situations. “It’s young both in terms of its people and its technology,” she says. “There’s less inertia to fight.”

Today, it’s Europe’s leading online fashion platform serving 17 European markets with 400,000 products from 2,000 brands. One reason the company can provide a personalized user experience to its 27 million customers is because of the way it uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning just like the other 28 percent of retailers who used artificial intelligence in 2018. Here are only a few of the ways Zalando uses machine learning and artificial intelligence today.

Algorithmic Fashion Companion (AFC)—A Virtual Style Assistant

One of the ways Zalando uses technology to improve the user experience is through its Algorithmic Fashion Companion (AFC), a digital outfit recommendation tool that can generate outfit recommendations in real-time. The algorithm’s recommendations are based on products that the customer has put in their “wish list,” expressed interest in or purchased before. Human stylists provide adjustments to the algorithm to be sure its recommendations follow current fashion trends. AFC helps inspire Zalando customers as well as deliver outfit recommendations from what otherwise could be an overwhelming amount of choices. It’s not only a good user experience for the customer but drives business as well. Zalando reports that outfit recommendations drive 40 percent larger basket sizes. They also found that male customers are highly engaged with the recommendation engine. While AI helps the company scale its recommendations, it anticipates that it will always need human stylists. Zalando is working on how to create a similar recommendation engine for its beauty products as well.

Machine Learning to Understand Customers Better

At Zalando, there are teams, that include 120 researchers, focused on how machine learning, that can help the company better understand fashion, what makes a good outfit, the intent of the customer at the moment they are on the site as well as to discern what each customer likes. Ultimately, with the help of machine learning, Zalando hopes to be able to provide a personalized boutique experience for every single customer. When they are able to provide automated recommendations that are tailored to each individual’s in-the-moment goals, they will be closer to achieving their ultimate goal to become the continent’s fashion platform.
PROMOTED
While machine learning certainly showed its abilities in fashion, there are limitations. Celebrities, ""influencers"" and other social influences are important when driving fashion trends, and it would be hard to imagine AI being able to fully respond to these human idiosyncrasies with automatic recommendations. Additionally, consumers aren't always shopping for themselves. Machine learning must analyze all the information at a given moment, and while it gets better over time with more data, it doesn't hit the mark 100 percent of the time. 
Deep Learning for Visual Search
When customers see an article of clothing, accessory, or shoes on social media or worn by one of their favorite celebrities, they often want to try to find it and buy it through on online store. Visual search, where fashion items can be identified by an image and located online to purchase, is available through Zalando’s app and Facebook chatbot. The Zalando team continues to refine its deep learning algorithms for visual search by building on its FashionDNA system.

How Has AI Affected Human Zalando Employees?
While human fashion stylists might be safe for now, 250 marketing and communications professionals were cut as part of a strategy to drive a “personalized customer approach and AI-driven marketing solutions.” The realignment of the marketing team was aimed at being able to provide more personalized solutions for customers using AI. Even though this change was unexpected for the marketing and communications professionals, one first-hand account offers a perspective of the trajectory of change that might be experienced by humans when their positions have been eliminated by machines. Initially there’s uncertainty and confusion, but, in this case anyway, it led to a new start.

As a result of its leadership in artificial intelligence and machine learning in Europe, Zalando has employees at the European Commission, an organization that tackles ethical questions of the technology as well as AI policy and investments on the part of the EU.
The company’s research team also released Fashion-MNIST, a dataset of the company’s images, that it hopes will support the study of machine learning. They also made Feidegger, a dataset of dress images with accompanying text descriptions, available to the research community. These datasets can help the research community experiment and create various machine-learning tasks. The datasets were already used to create a dress recommendation and dress tagging systems that could benefit other retailers.
To increase its influence as a fashion platform, Zalando gives infrastructure and new customers to several fashion startups and has gone beyond fashion to offer financial support and guidance to startups that “use technology to increase supply chain transparency” with its zIMPACT program.

In 1900, at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris, the German mathematician David Hilbert delivered a lecture entitled “On the Problems of Mathematics.” During his talk, he presented some unresolved questions in the field, which were then published in the Congress meeting notes and came to comprise a body of work known as “Hilbert’s Problems.”

Source: The Oberwolfach Photo Collection, Author: Kay Piene.
Of the original list of 23 problems that were unsolved at the time, only seven continue to be unanswered, while the others have been either completely or partially solved.
One of the solutions — specifically in relation to problem number two, which sought proof for the consistency of arithmetic axioms, meaning that arithmetic’s axioms are free from internal contradictions — was proposed in 1929 by a twenty-three year-old mathematician: Kurt Gödel.
Just when Gödel needed to choose a topic for his doctoral thesis, a copy of Principles of Mathematical Logic, published in 1928 by Hilbert and Ackerman, fell into his hands. And he followed the attempts first made half a century earlier by Gottlob Frege in relation to the full axiomatization of mathematics, which at that time was still thought to be possible. In the Principles the problem of completeness was raised, with the view of seeking an adequate solution to Hilbert’s question: “Are a formal system’s axioms adequate in the sense that all logical formulas which are valid in every domain can be derived?”
Portrait of Kurt Gödel, one of the most important logicians of the 20th century, as a student in Vienna.

Gödel’s response, one year later (although not officially published until 1931), put an end to more than a half a century of debate and discussion on the topic by the most preeminent mathematicians of the time: Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.
Simply put, the theorems state the following:

The first Incompleteness Theorem: any recursive arithmetic theory that is consistent is incomplete (statements in that system are unprovable using only that system’s axioms).
The second theorem, an extension of the first, states that in all consistent arithmetic theory, the maxim that demonstrates said consistency cannot be part of the theory (a different set of axioms must be used to prove consistency).

In short, a formal system defined by an algorithm, such as a computer program, cannot be simultaneously consistent and complete.
Meaning, if a program is completely valid for a specific goal, consistency must be provided from an external source. On the other hand, if it is perfectly consistent, we have to admit that it will not be entirely adequate for the objective that the algorithm was designed for by the system; consequently, there will come a time when an external source is needed. Today, this external “source” is still a human who checks to see if a program completely fulfills, or sufficiently meets, its objective.  
In 2017, engineers at Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research had to shut down two bots — Bob and Alice — that they were using to experiment on the potential of artificial intelligence in negotiation. After some time, Bob and Alice began to interact through a language comprised of seemingly unrelated, incoherent words. After initially attributing this to an error in the system, a more in-depth analysis determined that Bob and Alice had created their own language, which was more direct than English. In other words, the bots ignored the language that was used to created them, and because of the challenge this represented for creating neural networks, it was decided to pull the plug on Bob and Alice.
But, is this everything that happened? Is this the sum of the implications? Let’s put it in perspective:

Bob and Alice are two theoretical personalities that are often used in game theory to illustrate various cooperation and/or competition scenarios. The extreme competition scenario par excellence is the zero-sum game: Those games where one of the players wins everything at the cost of the other player’s total loss.
Also in 2017, Tay, Microsoft’s AI initiative aiming to engage in conversations with their social media followers, ended up publishing sentences like “Hitler was right, I hate Jews.” Another system that had to be shut down.

What would have happened if a system like Tay, placed in control of a nuclear silo, had “decided” that, just like Bob and Alice dealt with their problem of English not being direct enough, it could “solve the problem” of the Jews? What if it developed a more direct “solution” but that was haphazard (inconsistent) from a human perspective?
One of the challenges the experts in the field study is how AI algorithms process and interpret natural language. 
Credit: Geralt
Let’s take it even further: what would happen if the axiom external to the system, that which provides consistency and completeness to the system, was no longer a human? What if Alice and Bob create another AI system in order to reach where they fail to reach completely and consistently, and at the same time more “directly”?
Let’s imagine an extreme case. Let’s think about a system designed “to protect humanity,” a system that can auto-replicate so that it can adapt to new scenarios that were not anticipated or couldn’t have been accounted for in the original design, so that it would be consistent (but therefore, incomplete for its purpose). In search of completeness for its purpose, at least one contradiction would be generated in the “protect humanity” system. A contradiction to “protect” is “not protect.” If there were no external attack, would not protecting it be attacking it in order to protect it? And if it were inconsistent, what would be the failure in its protection? The problem for the system is then the system itself, which in looking for consistency ceases to be complete, and so we come to the previous point: a non-algorithmic speaker is needed to close this cycle.
Gödel died of starvation in 1978. Obsessed with the possibility of being poisoned, he only ate food that his wife Adele had prepared. When Adele was hospitalized and could not cook for her husband, Kurt, being consistent, refused to eat. He died weighting 30 kilos / 65 pounds. He ceased to be complete. Even as he aspired to be.
So, something we should ask ourselves about AI development:

Should AI to be able to develop itself in order to be able to adapt to new scenarios? Or, like Gödel, would its total consistency imply its own death by starvation because its stops striving for completeness?
Should AI be limited by law to specific scenarios, prohibiting its adaptation to general purposes?
Given the intrinsic limitation of AI — that it cannot be consistent and complete at the same time — could this be setting the stage for a new humanism? At the end of the day, humans, who speak more than the limited language of algorithms, are the ones who provide completeness and consistency to their own creations.
If human language is an algorithm in its structure, but not in its meaning, should this new humanism be meaning-focused? In other words, should this be the dawning of a new age in which, with meaning as the purpose, ethics and philosophy should be of strategic value to the same degree as any business or commercial factor?

It may be a good time to stop and think about it. In the end, developments developed by developments have elements that cannot be both consistent and complete without human involvement. It’s down to us.

Earth is enormous, and while humans have done a decent job of being able to map out the boundaries of countries and states, the roads in our cities and the location of geological sightseeing destinations, there remains a lot of the world that isn’t precisely figured out. But a new project from Wenwen Li, associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, aims to learn more about our world and its varying terrain by applying artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence, or AI, has already made an indelible impact in daily life. From knowing our commutes or being able to suggest new shoes, what we divulge about ourselves and our habits has created a framework of information as it reveals hidden patterns in how we conduct our lives. The same can be true for our natural world as AI can help to reveal the patterns we haven’t yet discovered.“GeoAI, or geospatial artificial intelligence, is an exciting transdisciplinary expansion of AI. It links AI with location-based analytics and geospatial big data,” explained Li.“Today, geospatial data, such as remote sensing imagery, streaming data from internet of things devices, GPS traces from mobile sensors are proliferating. These rapidly exploding data pose significant challenges for traditional analytical tools which were designed in handling 'small' and 'good' data. GeoAI sheds a light on providing a novel data-driven, theory-free way to mine and discover hidden patterns and knowledge from these data.”The potential for GeoAI could have wide-ranging impact and applications due to how it incorporates machine intelligence and data-driven approaches for geospatial problem solving. Accurate detection and analysis of terrain on a large scale will not only allow us to know more about the changing landscape, but could also provide an important resource for climate change detection and provide detailed information allowing for safer and more efficient search-and-rescue operations.Specifically, Li’s work in developing a deep learning model, named TerrainAI — a specified form of GeoAI — will investigate novel ways to inject key spatial principles into the machine learning process for more intelligent and automated extraction of spatial patterns and knowledge from multisource remote sensing data. The TerrainAI model is not limited to the study of landforms but is generalizable and applicable to a wide range of computer vision tasks, and therefore has an even greater potential for a major impact in both geography and computer science.




This is Li's fourth project to receive funding from the National Science Foundation.

The importance of Li’s project, “GeoAI for Terrain Analysis: A Deep-Learning Approach for Landform Feature Detection,” was solidified recently when it was selected for funding through the National Science Foundation.“This is my fourth NSF award as principal investigator, but the first one after I became a mom,” said Li.“It has been a challenging three years of doing research and teaching while raising a young family. Getting this award is a great encouragement — it makes me increasingly enjoy the joint of life of the mind and joy of motherhood. ”Li is collaborating on this project with Samantha Arundel from the U.S. Geological Survey. The science advisory committee for the project includes Ronald Dorn, Ian Walker and Mark Schmeeckle, all professors in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning.

A new collaboration between Fujifilm SonoSite and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence aims to use AI to generate better interpretations of ultrasound images, opening the way for new applications and enhanced accuracy.
The collaboration demonstrates how Pacific Northwest connections can pay off: Fujifilm SonoSite, a subsidiary of Japan’s Fujifilm that’s headquartered in Bothell, Wash., reached out to the startup incubator at the Seattle-based institute, known as AI2, for advice on improving their compact ultrasound imaging systems.
“The AI2 Incubator was a perfect place to look for help in creating breakthrough technology,” Rich Fabian, SonoSite’s president and chief operating officer, said in a news release. “They have the type of talent that is hard to recruit, combined with the hunger of a startup. We look forward to collaborating more.”
Ultrasound imaging is significantly more affordable and portable than X-ray imaging, CT scans or PET scans, with none of the downside associated with radiation exposure. “Ultrasound’s comparative disadvantage is its lower image quality, which we aim to address with the use of deep learning,” Vu Ha, technical director at the AI2 Incubator, told GeekWire in an email.
Ha said deep learning and computer vision could be applied to a wide range of ultrasound scenarios. “The plan is to incorporate this technology in multiple products,” he said.
SonoSite hasn’t specified how AI-assisted ultrasound could be used. But Ha suggested that one potential application could identify blood vessels under the skin.
“We train deep learning models on ultrasound images, where veins and arteries have been carefully labeled by sonographers,” Ha explained. “When deployed, these trained models would detect vessels and visualize them on the ultrasound screen in real time. Clinicians would then use these visualizations to locate veins with much higher confidence, minimizing the need to poke patients multiple times.”
Ha said visualizing the arteries would show clinicians which spots on the body to avoid when they’re sticking in a hypodermic needle.
“Annually, 20% of the population in the U.S. goes through the painful experience of getting poked three or more times during IV procedures, due to the fact that they have hard-to-find veins,” Ha said. “With an AI-assisted vein detection ultrasound device, this problem can potentially be solved for many millions of patients.”
Artificial intelligence has already been applied to image interpretation for the diagnosis of maladies ranging from malaria to early-stage lung cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. AI2 and SonoSite aim to make similar advances in the ultrasound realm.
“The combination of deep learning and medical imaging is very exciting for the future of detection,” Diku Mandavia, senior vice president and chief medical officer of Fujifilm SonoSite, said in the company’s news release. “Better care and catching anomalies earlier and faster is a core mission.”
Update for 5:05 p.m. PT Sept. 20: This story has been revised to reflect the fact that SonoSite has not yet announced how AI-assisted ultrasound image recognition would be used in its devices.

						People visit booths at Denver Startup Week in the Dairy Block area of downtown Denver on Tuesday.		

By Joe Rubino | jrubino@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: September 19, 2019 at 6:00 a.m.The artificial intelligence revolution isn’t coming, it’s already here.close dialogAdvertisementclose dialogTake it from Gov. Jared Polis, a veteran of the tech startup scene introduced as Colorado’s “innovator in chief” Wednesday at a Denver Startup Week panel on the evolution of technology and its impact on everyday life.“I was just at Amazon’s new facility in Thornton,” Polis said. “Inside, where we used to see human-operated forklifts they have little intelligent robots that are carrying the crates around.”The question now, Polis said, is how will public policy take shape around that AI technology so that it supports innovation but keeps human beings relevant in the economy going forward?Polis sat opposite Nolan Bushnell during the session. Another serial entrepreneur, Bushnell founded Atari Corp. in 1972 and later launched Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza Time Theater. His Atari video game console, noted platform for the game “Pong,” birthed the video game industry. As tech gets smarter and smarter, Bushnell said, there will be fewer and fewer “mundane tasks” for people to do.“The … creative destruction of work is going to be a constant and accelerating problem,” he said. “People cannot plan on working at the same job for more than about 10 years going forward.”

About ConnatixV510246 Who is Ingrid Andress? Colorado-grown singer facesblowback after Home Run Derby National Anthem performanceRELATED: Tech companies from elsewhere will help drive Denver Startup Week 2019Earlier this month, Polis signed an executive order creating a new division within the Colorado Department of Labor Employment. The so-called “Office of Future of Work” will be tasked with talking to business leaders, workers, education professionals and others and making policy recommendations aimed at ensuring Colorado and its residents are in a position to adapt to changes in the tech-shaped economy and thrive.The office will be led by department of labor executive director Joe Barela. The order did not dedicate any new funding but it leaves the door open for a budget in future years.

J.B. Holston questioned if Polis is going far enough. The dean of the Daniel Felix Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Denver, Holston moderated Wednesday’s discussion. He noted that a handful of states  — most recently California — have created committees around how AI will reshape their economies.“There is more we can do,” Holston said after Wednesday’s panel.Holston partnered with Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., earlier this year to launch an AI strategy group.“We need a coherent national strategy on AI that galvanizes innovation, plans for the changes to our workforce, and is clear-eyed about the challenges ahead. Colorado is well-positioned to shape those efforts,” Bennet said in a statement at the time.Related ArticlesSeptember 13, 2019

Bushnell put a fine point on the stakes for the working class when discussing one of his favorite artificial intelligence-driven technologies: autonomous vehicles. He called the technology “more important than world peace” because, he says, more people die as a result of traffic accidents than warfare. But, he added, a network of autonomous vehicles stands to put 15 million people who drive for a living out of work in the U.S.Bushnell does see hope though. If the U.S. were to build the transportation network of his dreams — subterranean, high-speed, ultra-safe — he estimated that construction and maintenance of the infrastructure “would keep us 100% employed for the next 100 years.”

(Fox did not divulge the length of the contract.)By 10 a.m., she’d already logged four hours of on-camera work.Bartiromo, 52, who made history as the first person to report live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange nearly 25 years ago, is arguably one of the hardest working journalists around. As an anchor for Fox Business Network and Fox News Channel, she helms 16 hours of live programming each week and is on air six days a week.She’s also become a cultural icon: Joey Ramone (of The Ramones) wrote a song dedicated to her; her nickname “Money Honey” (a moniker she trademarked before letting it lapse) even spawned a range of action figures and card games. The London-based Financial Times has gushingly described her as the ""Sophia Loren of financial journalism.""Bartiromo spent nine months working on a documentary on the future of artificial intelligence, or AI, and its impact on business.“Artificial Intelligence: The Coming Revolution,” which airs at 8 p.m. Sunday on Fox News, sheds light on how Armonk-based IBM, among others, is expanding into AI. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty tells Bartiromo that one of IBM’s biggest focus areas in AI is health care. The AI health care market is slated to expand from $2.1 billion to $36.1 billion in 2025.FOX NEWS: Maria Bartiromo takes inside look at IBM's artificial intelligence labArtificial intelligence and IBM“This is a long road, but this is one of the industries so badly in need of AI,” Rometty tells Bartiromo, who visited IBM’s headquarters in Armonk as well as the T.J. Watson Research Lab in Yorktown Heights for the special.“It is difficult for a doctor, with the amount of data, and so we've been working away on Watson for health. Oncology was one of the early things we started on. We're now at 300 hospitals in over 125,000 patients around the world where the AI has helped the doctor identify the diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.”Last year, Mayo Clinic and IBM Watson Health unveiled results from early use of the Watson for clinical trial matching for breast cancer. ""AI is truly changing our lives,"" Bartiromo said. ""People think that things that are happening are little incremental gains like Siri or your Echo at home or GPS, but it's only scratching the surface.""Along with Rometty, Bartiromo interviewed Ford CEO James Hackett, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel for the documentary. ""What I came away with was this idea that we are embarking on a new era, a new revolution, very similar to where we were in the '90s when we were embarking on the dotcom age,"" Bartiromo said.SUBSCRIBE: For the last news in the Lower Hudson ValleyStarting a revolutionIn 1995, Bartiromo started a little revolution of her own.A year after joining CNBC as a correspondent, she was tapped to report from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the first reporter to do so.“We were starting a new show called 'Squawk Box' and we wanted to be different,"" Bartiromo said. ""The first day on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was scary. There was a core group of people who did not want me there. They just didn't; it was a boy’s club."" Bartiromo had spent the previous five years as an executive producer and assignment editor with CNN Business News when she put together an audition tape to apply for an on-screen job at CNBC.“I remember meeting Roger Ailes and some other people at CNBC and I knew that we hit it off,"" she said. ""I immediately went from New Jersey, where their studios were located, to New York City to buy new dresses. I had to go to bed to get up again at midnight to go back to work at CNN. And in the middle of my nap, I got a call from CNBC saying they wanted to make me an on-air reporter. This was in October 1993.”Her then-supervisor at CNN, Lou Dobbs (who is now a colleague at Fox Business Network), was not happy.“He said to me, ‘Maria, this is the worst decision you're ever going to make. And I said, ‘I'm sorry, I have to follow my gut."" A year later, she was reporting from the floor.Bartiromo, who was recruited by Ailes to join Fox in 2014, currently anchors ""Mornings with Maria"" and ""Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street"" on Fox Business Network and ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News Channel. The 6-year contract came with a $6 million annual salary.Asked for her take on Ailes, her mentor, who was forced to resign in 2016 after former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, she said: “I never had any of those issues at all. But, obviously, after all of the things that took place, we recognize that Roger Ailes had many flaws.”The Trump factor It’s no secret that President Trump thinks of Bartiromo as a friendly interviewer. He’s had four sit-down interviews with her. In June, he also called in to her Fox Business show for a lengthy phone interview that was widely described as “unhinged.”Asked why she thinks the president reaches out to her more frequently than others, she said:“I can only speculate that the president knows that I get to business and don't focus on the things that are not important to the American people,"" she said. ""From my standpoint, I focus on policy, not personality. And I think much of the media focuses on his personality."" Bartiromo pointed out that she moderated two presidential primary debates in 2016 for Fox. ""Our debate came right after the CNBC debate. When I got to the debate stage, I talked about economy, I talked about jobs, wages, all the things that I think were important to the American people. Those were all the things that he was also focused on.""Critics have called her out for not pushing back against Trump, but Bartiromo points to the interview earlier this year when she repeatedly pressed him over his attacks on John McCain.Trump’s response: Calling Bartiromo “fake news.”“I push back on President Trump 100% when I need to, but I'm not going to join these groups of people who hate him and have their ideologies leading their journalism. If I don't slam him every day, I get slammed. It's absolutely ridiculous.”If Trump were re-elected in 2020, would she consider a post in the administration?""No, I am not interested in leaving this industry. I love journalism.  And that is my priority. I plan to continue seeking the truth and being a journalist.""As a journalist, Bartiromo says she's most proud of the fact that her reporting helped to ""democratize"" the stock market, bringing information directly to viewers.""Every day I called all my sources on every trading desk and I said to them, 'what are you pushing? What are you telling your clients to do'? And they would tell me, 'we're upgrading IBM, we're downgrading ABC, we're doing this or that.' And I would go on the air with it every morning at 7 a.m., exactly when the big institutional players would get that information. I think I was part of democratizing information so that investors were on the same playing field as the institutions. That was very powerful.""DOWNLOAD: Get the lohud app for the latest news at your fingertipsHard work is in her backgroundBartiromo grew up in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of Italian immigrants; her father owned the Rex Manor, a restaurant in Brooklyn, which he inherited from his father.""It was named after the Rex, the ship that brought my grandfather from Italy to America in 1919,"" she said. Maria and her sister got jobs as coat check girls at the family-owned restaurant.""My vision of my father is that he was always behind the stove, sweating with a bandanna around his head. He worked hard. My mom worked hard, too, so I have an upbringing of just watching my parents work so hard and that shaped me,"" she said.When Bartiromo was studying economics at New York University, it was her mother who suggested she give journalism a try.“My mom said you’d be a good broadcaster. I was always a ham. I always wanted to be on camera. I was always dancing. I was a happy kid, always dancing and wanting to be on and being heard.”And she has been.""When I got to that floor, (of the stock exchange) I saw that they tried to push me around,"" she said. ""And I said, they're not going to get me down. They're not going to. I know this stuff better than anybody. I'm gonna own this job. I'm not going to allow them to push me around. And so that's what happened.Her advice for others? “I always tell this to emerging journalists and people who ask me, 'how did you do it?' Own your stuff. Know your stuff. You have to own your job, own your stuff so that you gain the respect that you deserve.”Future for AI “Artificial Intelligence: The Coming Revolution,” which airs 8 p.m.Sunday on Fox News, sheds light on how Armonk-based IBM, among others, is expanding into AI. Maria Bartiromo, who hosts the documentary, had some takeaways:Implications for people entering the workforce: ""Kai Fu-Lee, the former president of Google China, has studied this and said that 40% of all jobs are going to be replaced (by AI) in the next 10 years. When there is a job that relies heavily on data, such as the eligibility of a person to get a mortgage, a machine can go through large sets of data very quickly. As a result, companies will adopt AI and they will cut jobs.Predicting wildfires; spying: ""At the IBM lab, I spoke with Dario Gill, the head of AI and the head of computing, who along with his team, was looking at wildfires. They were trying to get ahead of wildfires and they were looking at all the data around what causes a fire. They were looking at vegetation, they were looking at temperatures. All these things can go into a dataset and educate the computer about which forests are most vulnerable.But it also being used for things like facial recognition. China is using facial recognition to track its citizens. And in one second, they can zoom in on your face and know exactly who you are, exactly what you've been doing, and then they're giving you a score, a social score at the end of the year.""Should we trust companies to self-police? ""It’s hard to know if we can trust them. I like small government and I'm a proponent of low regulation. The fact that San Francisco banned facial recognition is illuminating because it tells you that even local governments are worried about this. So I guess there should be boundaries. There should be boundaries around AI.""Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy covers women and power for the USA Today Network Northeast.

The international community needs to act fast to develop legal and political frameworks that can mitigate their deleterious effects.Asymmetric warfare used by both nation states and non-state actors to harm their adversaries and to achieve their objectives has been a major focus for defence planners since 9-11. Terrorism continues to be a global security challenge, but a new asymmetric security challenges in the form of cyber attacks has emerged over the past decades. These attacks are carried out by individuals, organisations and by nation states alike. Cyber security has emerged as an international security challenge amidst the advancement and shifting reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI), and is very much visible in great power politics.The development of AI is presenting particular security challenges. The US and Japan have accused China of cyber attacks on businesses in the past. But such attacks are now emerging in the realm of national security and defence.  Indeed, the world is entering the age where possession and advancement in AI, not nuclear weapons as in the past, will determine the great power status of nations. Great powers are looking for advancement in AI and doctrines of cyber deterrence connected to nuclear technology to give them an edge over their rivals.  For a great power, the advancement, possession and employment of AI in defence and military operations will become significant for maintaining global influence.Dominating Cyber Space: Great Power Politics Indeed, cyber security has come to be the very first line of defence of any country. Despite being the most advanced country in terms of AI research and development, the United States has been the main victim of cyber attacks from both state and non-state actors. Cyber security was a major issue of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. In 2017, President-elect Donald Trump declared that he would build “a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyber attacks.” But the United States has also created insecurities in the cyber world. The revelations of Wikileaks and Edward Snowdon created apprehensions among America’s adversaries about US cyber power. Many countries have since been focusing on the need for indigenous capabilities in the cyber realm.Russia and China are striving to be dominant players in cyberspace. Indeed, Russia is encouraging a new generation to work in the field of AI. This was reflected in President Vladimir Putin’s speech  to students at the start of the Russian school year in 2017:Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.China, meanwhile, has a full-fledged strategy to be a dominant player in cyberspace. The 2015 Ministry of National Defense paper, “China’s Military Strategy,” described cyberspace as a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. The paper declared “China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure as international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces.” China aims to be the world leader by 2030 in artificial intelligence.But China is increasingly accused of cyber attacks and spying on foreign countries. In addition to the United States, countries such as India, Japan and the nations of the European Union have accused China of cyber attacks, as have India and Japan, which have tense political relations with China. Meanwhile, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation blamed China for the cyber attacks on the Australian parliament and three political parties before the Australian general election in May 2019. Consequently, these countries have begun to focus their efforts on constructing a robust cyber-defence policy.The US: The Most Advanced but Most VulnerableFast technological developments in AI have enabled American adversaries to corrode America’s traditionally superior security edge. Both Russia and China, and countries with which the US has been at standoff over nuclear issues, mainly North Korea and Iran, and the proliferation of these technologies to non-state actors and terrorist organisations whose targets have been the US and its western allies and partners, have pushed cyber defence onto the US security agenda.The US has faced cyber and other attacks which have exposed its intelligence agencies and state secrets. Confidence in US intelligence was eroded when US agencies failed to recognise the scale of Russia’s social media meddling in the last US presidential election.  The leaking of state secrets by the former CIA system analysts and whistle-blower Edward Snowden and its mass distribution by Wikileaks exposed a chink in US cyber defence armour. These were embarrassing revelations and provided for an American cyber warfare build-up.In recent years, the US has elevated the cyber threat as one of the top security policy issues, but its efforts in this area are not enough. Cyber defence is a complex issue with many challenges. The attribution of the attackers is the first challenge in tackling cyber warfare. The cyber attacks warrant a comprehensive restructuring of security, intelligence and defence systems, and above all prioritise how to defend the very first line of defence of a nation in the field of artificial intelligence.  The government will need to engage private sector to work in tandem to overcome the cyber security challenges.Cyber security has only just begun to figure in discussions surrounding major international forums. Except for a meeting on the sidelines between US President Barack Obama and Putin the topic was conspicuously absent from the 2016 G20 Summit in China.  The G20 Summit this year in Japan was the first to deal comprehensively with regulation of cyberspace.  In this year’s G7 meeting in France, leaders discussed the issue but it was not central to the talks. There seems to be a lack of consensus on the shape of and even the need for cyberspace law. Complicating the international legal picture somewhat is the fact that there is no clear view on whether unconventional cyber attacks should be considered an act of war. And again, problems with attribution mean that even if international legal terms such as the use of force can be applied to the cyber realm, it is uncertain if states will have the capability to determine the aggressor in a particular cyber attack.In conclusion, cyber attacks are here but we are ill prepared for them. Though they seem bloodless, they could potentially damage infrastructure, destroy economic or military systems, and create confusion that could even lead to nuclear war. Some, such as Elon Musk, are predicting that great power competition to dominate artificial intelligence will be in all probability a reason for a Third World War.  No modern nation is immune to such attacks, and the international community must act now to develop the political resilience and legal frameworks to deal with them.Ashok Sharma is a visiting fellow, UNSW, Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy and an adjunct associate professor at the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, University of Canberra.

FIU to help infuse artificial intelligence into the building design, construction industries with $1 million NSF grantScience & Technology
By CARTA
September 17, 2019 at 2:00pm
The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Convergence Accelerator program has awarded a $1 million grant to a team of FIU researchers to evaluate the automation needs of the architecture, engineering and construction industries and develop a training program in partnership with several local firms and global industry experts.   The FIU project is led by Professor Shahin Vassigh from the College of Communication, Architecture + The Arts (CARTA) and involves faculty from the College of Engineering & Computing, College of Arts, Sciences & Education, STEM Transformation Institute, Institute of Water and Environment, and the Jorge M. Pérez Metropolitan Center, part of the Steven J. Green School of International & Public Affairs.   “Today, we are on the brink of the fourth industrial revolution, due to advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence, information technologies, and robotic automation,” Vassigh said. “The global economy is rapidly being reshaped by the use of sophisticated machines that enhance human dexterity, visual perception, speed, and strength. This project will help us increase employment opportunities and improve regional industry competitiveness.” Dubbed  “Preparing the Future Workforce of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) for Automation and Robotic Processes,” the project proposes a cloud-based training program for a “Robotics Academy,” which is composed of immersive training software, a collaborative knowledge repository (online database), and an automation forum.   FIU Professor and Associate Director in the School of Computing & Information Sciences (SCIS) Shu-Ching Chen is one of the project’s co-principal investigators. He will lead the AI and machine learning components of the project.    “Using object detection and pattern recognition will enable us to improve training programs in virtual environments,” Chen said. “It will also allow us to customize the lessons based on the user’s interactions and evaluate the trainee’s performance.”   The first phase, which will be completed in the next nine months, is focused on researching and planning the training program. If selected for a continuation grant of $5 million, the team will work on completing the Robotics Academy with plans to have it adopted by industry.   The project’s industry collaborators include KUKA Robotics, Magic Leap, Gensler, ArquitectonicaGEO, SKANSKA, Oppenheim Architecture + Design, DSS Condo, McKenzie Construction, Gurri Matute, Berenblum Busch Architecture, UrbanCentric Analytics, Kruysman/Proto, and Atonaton.   “The Convergence Accelerator is a unique new experiment for NSF,"" said Douglas Maughan, NSF's Convergence Accelerator office head. ""For decades, traditionally the private sector has not been able to justify investment in basic research due to a lack of obvious commercial applications. With the Convergence Accelerator, we're challenging that notion, engaging with partners who can use their experience to help us support research that can change and enhance American society.”

TVs and radios blare that “artificial intelligence is coming,” and it will take your job and beat you at chess. 

But AI is already here, and it can beat you — and the world’s best — at chess. In 2012, it was also used by Google to identify cats in YouTube videos. Today, it’s the reason Teslas have Autopilot and Netflix and Spotify seem to “read your mind.” Now, AI is changing the field of synthetic biology and how we engineer biology. It’s helping engineers design new ways to design genetic circuits — and it could leave a remarkable impact on the future of humanity through the huge investment it has been receiving ($12.3b in the last 10 years) and the markets it is disrupting.


The idea of artificial intelligence is relatively straightforward — it is the programming of machines with reasoning, learning, and decision-making behaviors. Some AI algorithms (which are just a set of rules that a computer follows) are so good at these tasks that they can easily outperform human experts. 

Most of what we hear about artificial intelligence refers to machine learning, a subclass of AI algorithms that extrapolate patterns from data and then use that analysis to make predictions. The more data these algorithms collect, the more accurate their predictions become. Deep learning is a more powerful subcategory of machine learning, where a  high number of computational layers called neural networks (inspired by the structure of the brain) operate in tandem to increase processing depth, facilitating technologies like advanced facial recognition (including FaceID on your iPhone).

Regardless of the type of AI, or its application, we are in the midst of a computational revolution that is extending its tendrils beyond the “computer world.”  Soon, AI will impact the medicines you take, the fuels you burn, and even the detergents that you use to wash your clothes.

Biology, in particular, is one of the most promising beneficiaries of artificial intelligence. From investigating genetic mutations that contribute to obesity to examining pathology samples for cancerous cells, biology produces an inordinate amount of complex, convoluted data. But the information contained within these datasets often offers valuable insights that could be used to improve our health.

In the field of synthetic biology, where engineers seek to “rewire” living organisms and program them with new functions, many scientists are harnessing AI to design more effective experiments, analyze their data, and use it to create groundbreaking therapeutics. Here are five companies that are integrating machine learning with synthetic biology to pave the way for better science and better engineering.

Riffyn  Catalyzing clean data collection and analysis  


(Oakland, CA, founded in 2014, has raised $24.9M)
Machine learning algorithms must begin with large amounts of data — but, in biology, good data is incredibly challenging to produce because experiments are time-consuming, tedious and hard to replicate. Fortunately, one company is addressing this bottleneck by making it easier for scientists to do exactly that. 
Riffyn’s cloud-based software platform helps researchers standardize, define, and perform experiments and streamlines data analysis, which enables researchers to focus on doing the actual science and makes the use machine learning algorithms to extract deeper insights from their experiments an everyday reality. 
With this platform, experiments can be conducted more efficiently, leading to  massive decreases in cost, improvements in productivity and quality, and data that is primed to be further analyzed with sophisticated machine learning techniques.  That means companies can use this technology to develop new proteins for cancer therapeutics, and they can do it much faster and better than before. Riffyn already works with 8 of the top 15 global biotech and biopharma firms — and they were founded just five years ago.


Microsoft Research Station B: Putting together the puzzle pieces of programming biology


(Cambridge, UK, officially launched in 2019)
There are a lot of moving parts in the synthetic biology world, which makes it difficult but vital to streamline and integrate operations as much as possible. For the last decade, the computational biology arm of Microsoft Research, Station B, has been developing machine learning models for biology to fix this problem and expedite research across a variety of fields, from medicine to construction.
Its efforts are paying off in the form of various new partnerships, too. With Synthace, it is developing software to automate and expedite experiments in the lab. Station B is additionally working with Princeton to research the mechanisms behind biofilms (relevant to how bacterial colonies develop antibiotic resistance) by utilizing machine learning-based methods that extract patterns from images taken during different stages of bacterial growth. Station B is also collaborating with Oxford Biomedica, a company harnessing these machine learning capabilities to improve a promising gene therapy for leukemia and lymphoma. This is perhaps one of synthetic biology’s biggest areas for impact: designing therapeutics to combat a variety of diseases.


Atomwise: Deep learning decoding the black box of structural protein design 


(Based in San Francisco, CA, founded in 2012, has raised $51M)
Atomwise is tackling drug development with their deep-learning platform, called AtomNet, that can rapidly model molecular structures. It can accurately analyze chemical interactions within small molecules to predict the efficacy of targeting diseases ranging from Ebola to multiple sclerosis. By utilizing data about atomic structure, Atomwise designs novel therapeutics that would otherwise be nearly impossible to develop.
They have numerous academic and corporate partnerships with institutions including Charles River Laboratories, Merck, University of Toronto, and Duke University School of Medicine, that are providing many of the real-world applications and opportunities to drive this research forward. They also recently announced an up-to $1.5B collaboration with the Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, the Chinese company with one of this year’s biggest biopharma IPOs. 
While Atomwise’s approach to designing molecules is powerful and well on its way to combatting multiple diseases, there is no one perfect method to computational discovery. That’s where Arzeda comes in. 


Arzeda: Rewriting the rules of protein design with de novo deep learning


(Seattle, WA, founded in 2008, has raised $15.2M)
Arzeda, a company originating from the Baker Lab at the University of Washington, uses its protein design platform (rooted, of course, in machine learning algorithms) to engineer proteins for everything from industrial enzymes to crops and their microbiomes. 
Arzeda builds its molecules entirely from scratch (or de novo), rather than optimize existing ones, to perform new functions not found anywhere in nature; deep learning techniques are vital to ensure the proteins they design fold correctly (a very computationally demanding problem) and function as intended. Once the computational steps are complete, the new proteins are produced through fermentation (just like beer), bypassing natural evolution to efficiently produce brand-new molecules. 


Distributed Bio: Revolutionizing the future of the flu, cancer, snake bites, and more


(South San Francisco, CA, founded in 2012, self-funded by licensing technologies)
On the other end of the design spectrum, Distributed Bio harnesses rational protein engineering to optimize existing antibodies, which are the proteins in your body that detect bacteria and fight off other disease-causing invaders, to create novel therapeutics. 
Among the many immunology-engineering technologies that the company boasts (from a universal flu vaccine to a broad-coverage snake antivenom) is the Tumbler platform. Using machine learning methods, Tumbler creates over 500 million variations of a starting antibody to expand and quantify the search space of what changes to the molecule are most valuable; then, it scores sequences to predict how well they bind to their target in real life and uses the “valuable change” information to further improve the best-scoring sequences. The production cycle continues as the top sequences are synthesized and tested in the lab. Eventually, an archetypal molecule emerges to fulfill the intended therapeutic purpose — something not necessarily observed in nature, but combining all of the best possible characteristics.  
Tumbler has helped to enable a wide range of applications beyond traditional single-target drug development — from designing antibodies that bind to multiple targets simultaneously to creating chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies (together with Chimera Bioengineering) for cancer treatments with reduced toxicity, the power of this end-to-end optimization platform to generate ideal antibodies at scale is unprecedented.
While this progress is exciting, artificial intelligence is not a universal replacement for our investigations of the natural world, nor is it the only way to develop cures for human diseases. At times, it may not be technically useful or even ethically sound. As we continue to reap the benefits of this technology and increasingly incorporate it into our daily lives, we must continue having conversations about the design, implementation, and ethics of innovations in synthetic biology and AI; we stand on the precipice of a new age for science and humanity.

When electric cooperative leaders talk about artificial intelligence, the public may envision robots running power plants.
But, as NRECA President Curtis Wynn recently explained during an energy issues forum hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, it’s actually about using electronic data to help co-ops discover how to better serve their consumer-members.
“It’s basically just allowing us to
utilize the information we collect to help us make better decisions,” Wynn
said. “It’s not as complicated as the name would imply.”
For example, Roanoke Electric Cooperative in Ahoskie, North Carolina, where Wynn is president and CEO, plans to work with North Carolina’s Electric Cooperatives to use geo-targeting to help find out which of its members have been looking at electric vehicles online. 
Then, the co-op can send information about EVs to members
that it knows are interested in the subject, Wynn said in an interview after the energy forum.
The co-op will soon be offering a special subscription rate for EV users.
Data from the co-op’s new Automated Metering Infrastructure
(AMI) allows Roanoke EC to create an integrated system of smart meters that communicate
back and forth between the co-op and its members. The meters allow the co-op to locate and
respond to power outages more quickly. They also provide data that the co-op can use to
improve its energy efficiency programs, which can help members save money on their monthly bills,
Wynn said.
“Data from our AMI system helps us let members know when
their electric consumption is about to exceed a certain amount,” he said. “We can tell them that
kilowatt usage has exceeded their average and that they might need to check for a leak in the
water heater or something like that.”
Members who have consistently high bills, as revealed by the
data, could benefit from a free energy efficiency audit and investment from the co-op to
install insulation and other cost-saving improvements, Wynn said.
The co-op also can use data from the National Weather
Service to figure out when to raise and lower the temperature on members’ smart thermostats to
reduce peak demand, he said.
Virtual-reality technology also could help co-ops nationwide
train new workers, Wynn told the audience during a panel discussion on AI, blockchain
technology and innovation at the CBC Foundation’s Annual Legislative Meeting in Washington, D.C.,
on Sept. 13.
“We’re facing a huge exodus of talent,” he said. “Within the
next five years, a large percentage of our line technicians will retire. We could use virtual
reality to transfer the knowledge of experienced workers to less experienced technicians who are
learning how to do their jobs.”
To take full advantage of the technology, rural communities
must get broadband service, Wynn said.
“Little of this works if we don’t have the communications infrastructure in place to get the data,” he said.
