Researchers Are Making More Than $1 Million, Even at a NonprofitShare full articleRead in appArtificial intelligence experts are commanding eye-popping salaries. Including a signing bonus, OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016.By Cade MetzApril 19, 2018SAN FRANCISCO — One of the poorest-kept secrets in Silicon Valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command. Now, a little-noticed tax filing by a research lab called OpenAI has made some of those eye-popping figures public.OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016. It paid another leading researcher, Ian Goodfellow, more than $800,000 — even though he was not hired until March of that year. Both were recruited from Google.A third big name in the field, the roboticist Pieter Abbeel, made $425,000, though he did not join until June 2016, after taking a leave from his job as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Those figures all include signing bonuses.The figures listed on the tax forms, which OpenAI is required to release publicly because it is a nonprofit, provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for A.I. talent. But there is a caveat: The compensation at OpenAI may be underselling what these researchers can make, since as a nonprofit it can’t offer stock options.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSalaries for top A.I. researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it. Element AI, an independent lab in Canada, estimates that 22,000 people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious A.I. research — about double from a year ago.“There is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options — something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,” Mr. Sutskever said. “Others did the same.” He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its “mission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.”OpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.ImageAn old video game used for training an autonomous system at OpenAI, a nonprofit lab in San Francisco.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesPeople who work at major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them have told The New York Times that A.I. specialists with little or no industry experience can make between $300,000 and $500,000 a year in salary and stock. Top names can receive compensation packages that extend into the millions.“The amount of money was borderline crazy,” Wojciech Zaremba, a researcher who joined OpenAI after internships at Google and Facebook, told Wired. While he would not reveal exact numbers, Mr. Zaremba said big tech companies were offering him two or three times what he believed his real market value was.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company’s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.Researchers like Mr. Sutskever specialize in what are called neural networks, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. They are used in everything from digital assistants in smartphones to self-driving cars.Some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.Mr. Sutskever was part of a three-researcher team at the University of Toronto that created key so-called computer vision technology. Mr. Goodfellow invented a technique that allows machines to create fake digital photos that are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.“When you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,” Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. “You are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOther researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab’s first year.In 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field — though still very young — made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.Though the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. “If anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,” Mr. Nicholson said.That means it can be hard for companies to hold on to their talent. Last year, after only 11 months at OpenAI, Mr. Goodfellow returned to Google. Mr. Abbeel and two other researchers left the lab to create a robotics start-up, Embodied Intelligence. (Mr. Abbeel has since signed back on as a part-time adviser to OpenAI.) And another researcher, Andrej Karpathy, left to become the head of A.I. at Tesla, which is also building autonomous driving technology.In essence, Mr. Musk was poaching his own talent. Since then, he has stepped down from the OpenAI board, with the lab saying this would allow him to “eliminate a potential future conflict.”A version of this article appears in print on April 20, 2018, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Soaring Salaries In A.I.

Fortunately, today you don’t have to take years out of your life studying at university to become familiar with this seemingly hugely complex technology. A growing number of online courses have sprung up in recent years covering everything from the basics to advanced implementation.
Some are aimed at people who want to dive straight into coding their own artificial neural networks, and understandably assume a certain level of technical ability. Others are useful for those who want to learn how this technology can be applied by anyone, regardless of prior technical expertise, to solving real-word problems.
PROMOTED
In this post I will give a rundown of some of the best free ones which are available today.
Learn with Google AI

This newly launched resource is part of Google’s plan to broaden the understanding of AI among the general public. Material is slowly being added but it already contains a Machine Learning with TensorFlow (Google’s machine learning library) crash course.
The course covers the ground from a basic introduction to machine learning, to getting started with TensorFlow, to designing and training neural nets.
It is designed so that those with no prior knowledge of machine learning can jump in right at the start, those with some experience can pick or choose modules which interest them, while machine learning experts can use it as an introduction to TensorFlow.

Google – Machine Learning
This is a slightly more in-depth course from Google offered through Udacity. As such, it isn’t aimed at complete novices and assumes some previous experience of machine learning, to the point where you are at least familiar with supervised learning methods.
It focuses on deep learning, and the design of self-teaching systems that can learn from large, complex datasets.
The course is aimed at those looking to put machine learning, neural network technology to work as data analysts, data scientists or machine learning engineers as well as enterprising individuals wanting to make use of the plethora of open source libraries and materials available.
Stanford University – Machine Learning
This course is offered through Coursera and is taught by Andrew Ng, the founder of Google’s deep learning research unit, Google Brain, and head of AI for Baidu.
The entire course can be studied for free, although there is also the option of paying for certification which could certainly be useful if you plan to use your understanding of AI to increase your career prospects.
The course covers the spectrum of real-world machine learning implementations from speech recognition and enhancing web search, while going into technical depth with statistics topics such as linear regression, the backpropagation methods through which neural networks “learn”, and a Matlab tutorial – one of the most widely used programming languages for probability-based AI tools.
Columbia University – Machine Learning
This course is also available in its entirety for free online, with an option to pay for certification should you need it.
It promises to teach models, methods and applications for solving real-world problems using probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods as well as supervised and unsupervised learning.
To get the most out of the course you should expect to spend around eight to ten hours a week on the materials and exercises, over 12 weeks – but this is a free Ivy League-level education so you wouldn’t expect it to be a breeze.
It is offered through the non-profit edX online course provider, where it forms part of the Artificial Intelligence nanodegree.
Nvidia – Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision
Computer vision is the AI sub-discipline of building computers which can “see” by processing visual information in the same way our brains do.
As well as the technical fundamentals, it covers how to identify situations or problems which can benefit from the application of machines capable of object recognition and image classification.
As a manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia unsurprisingly covers the crucial part these high-powered graphical engines, previously primarily aimed at displaying leading-edge images, has played in the widespread emergence of computer vision applications.
The final assessment covers building and deploying a neural net application, and while the entire course can be studied at your own pace, you should expect to spend around eight hours on the material.
MIT – Deep Learning for Self Driving Cars
As with the course above, MIT takes the approach of using one major real-world aspect of AI as a jumping-off point to explore the specific technologies involved.
The self-driving cars which are widely expected to become a part of our everyday lives rely on AI to make sense of all of the data hitting the vehicle’s array of sensors and safely navigate the roads. This involves teaching machines to interpret data from those sensors just as our own brains interpret signals from our eyes, ears and touch.
It covers the use of the MIT DeepTraffic simulator, which challenges students to teach a simulated car to drive as fast as possible along a busy road without colliding with other road users.
This is a course taught at the bricks ‘n’ mortar university for the first time last year, and all of the materials including lecture videos and exercises are available online – however you won’t be able to gain a certification.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Most applications also recommend targeted skincare products that might be suitable for you, cutting out some of the trial and error of searching a crowded beauty hall.Olay have dubbed their web-based platform a ""personal at-home beauty advisor"" and the process is certainly accessible, with most of the online and app-based programs that use AI-technology available completely free and on-the-go. This makes them an effective tool for consumers who are looking to be increasingly information rich without becoming cash poor, by being as informed as possible when spending their money on skincare products.""AI is increasingly playing a greater role in the beauty industry, as consumers seek to navigate the millions of products available and to find the personalised skincare choices which are right for them"", explains Dr Frauke Neuser, principal scientist and associate director for scientific communications at Olay. ""Over 3.8 million women globally have been reached by Olay Skin Advisor since its global launch in September 2016; this tells us that the introduction of a platform which gives an objective assessment of their skin and helps to remove confusion in the skincare aisle was very much needed and welcomed by women.""Of course, AI-technology in the skincare industry is not yet an exact science. As with any selfie, the level of lighting and make-up you are wearing will affect your results and it's not yet possible to scan the whole beauty industry for a completely personalised regime. We also wouldn't recommend using it as a complete replacement for appointments with a professional dermatologist who can provide expert advice about more serious or specific skin concerns.Even so, the technology shows promises, with the way artificial intelligence is used to identify the vague concept of 'skin age' showing continued improvements and further updates to the algorithms that pinpoint product recommendations. The technology is also good news for the skincare brands themselves, as the data collected about skincare habits are powering new product innovations:""Olay Skin Advisor offers a fascinating insight into women’s skincare behaviour and habits which we as a company can learn from. As a result, we are developing the right products for every woman and making sure that they aware of them through the tool's recommendations.""

In turn, she received a call from a business-travel agency highly interested in her talents. Laura accepted the interview and, dressed in a new business suit and with a polished and relevant resume in hand, she showed up 30 minutes early ready to put her best foot forward.After an hour wait, an assistant ushered her into the CEO’s office, where she was drilled on where she came from, if her parents graduated from college, if they suffered from any mental illnesses, what they did for a living (“just to ensure she was professional material”), if she was married or had children, and how she would appeal to potential clients Laura knew weren’t remotely interested in business travel. To close the interview, the CEO awkwardly revealed he didn’t care what happened to the company following his soon-to-be retirement. Politely thanking the CEO, Laura left hoping no one from the agency would ever call her again. Sadly, four months later, she did receive a call back.Yes, this is a true story. And, unfortunately, such interview horror stories are not uncommon.A Broken Hiring Process Means More Time Job HuntingLiz Ryan, Fortune 500 human-resource (HR) senior vice president and Forbes HR writer, confirms that “the hiring process has been breaking down for 20 years, but the pace of its devolution has been picking up lately.”And, even after landing the job, bad hiring processes translate into less-than-favorable employment experiences: 65% of people begin searching for their next job within 3 months of being hired.The good news is job hunters now have an up-and-coming companion ready to fight for their interests: artificial intelligence (AI).Artificial Intelligence Offers Job Hunters Better Long-Term SuccessKen Lazarus, Marlina Kinnersley, WorkFusion, Scout Exchange, Fortay.ai and countless AI firms are in the trenches, researching, building and honing the AI-powered platforms job hunters can lean on for improved experiences. Their expertise and solutions reveal four ways AI is working behind the scenes to offer smoother and more successful job-hunting journeys.AI Helps Job Hunters Get Matched with the Right Role for their Skill SetWhile searching for available positions, researching companies, catering resumes to positions, writing cover letters, networking, and attending several interviews for each job opening, job hunting is often a full-time job. This is especially true when job hunters don’t filter out interviews for positions unlikely to match their skill sets. AI makes seeking relevant employment opportunities more efficient and, as such, more successful.Ken Lazarus, CEO of Scout Exchange, a talent-matching platform serving startup brands and Fortune 10 companies alike, explains how job seekers can lean on AI. He says good recruiters know their industries well, including the skill sets needed to perform their respective jobs and the connections needed to earn an audience before key employers.“If I’m in Virginia and I want a job doing defense research and analysis for the government, there are recruiters who specialize in that and the best way to get the job is to get to know them,” he says.But, not all recruiters are equally good at their jobs. So, he stresses the importance of job hunters forming relationships with the right recruiters. They can use AI-powered Scout Exchange to gauge participating recruiters. To do so, he encourages job seekers to ask recruiters their platform rating.Scout Exchange generates an AI-powered rating that reflects how successful each recruiter matches candidates to jobs. A poor rating alerts job hunters a recruiter is unlikely to recommend them to jobs worth their effort and time to land.AI helps job hunters find the perfect working culture.Organizational cultures have endless variations and quirks. One organization may have casual communication norms but a strong hierarchy while another has formal social norms but stresses team work and a flat-organizational structure.Likewise, job seekers have equally varied work-environment preferences. They may prefer a startup culture, a flat organization, a strong social environment, a team environment, or to work independently.To ensure candidates remain engaged and committed to the jobs they’re offered, talent firms are leaning on AI to match job hunters’ organizational-culture preferences to companies that align with them. Though many talent-matching platforms are meant for employers to use, Fortay offers job hunters a quiz they can take to determine what company cultures they would most likely thrive in.Once a quiz is completed, Fortay’s AI algorithm goes to work compiling a list of relevant companies. Job seekers then receive a list of companies in their inboxes, complete with a button that, once pushed, guides them through applying to available jobs within those companies.AI ensures hiring bias doesn’t create obstacles.Studies show that humans are unconsciously biased even when we don’t meant to be. As a result, hiring bias can create road blocks for job seekers. “If we assume people are bias…then we know that whatever data set we have is going to have bias baked into it because that data set is based on human decision-making that has happened in the past,” explains Ken Lazarus.As a result, he says experienced data scientists program algorithms to eliminate hiring bias and, thereby, prevent algorithm contamination. The good news is that, given a good size data set and when data scientists lean on AI, they can reduce bias’s impact for a better future-of-work.For example, Ken knows there is a 25% higher chance a male or female recruiter will recommend job candidates matching their gender. So, when a male recruiter recommended four male candidates, Scout Exchange’s data scientists removed one of them to eliminate bias from results. They then programmed this formula into their talent-matching algorithm to prevent bias from being baked into their predictions going forward.Once programmed into the AI-powered algorithm, this formula is then scaled to affect millions of talent-matching events. In turn, as employers receive less biased job-candidate lists, job seekers enjoy a fair representation in their industries and before key employers.AI helps to match internal employees to growth opportunities.Thus far, we’ve looked at how AI works behind the scenes to help candidates in job hunting. But, AI continues to work even after candidates are hired to ensure they keep their hard-earned jobs and grow successful careers from them.WorkFusions AI-powered SmartCrowd solution, for example, allows brands to monitor employee performance to pinpoint areas in which employees could develop new skill sets. Then, it devises catered-training programs so employees are set up for success in their current roles and have more opportunities for advancement.In addition, it monitors employees to pinpoint their strengths, then allocate jobs to those with highest performance ratings. This means AI works behind the scenes to single out employees who best match available internal positions, then recommends them to those managers in positions to make promotion decisions.In the End, honesty allows AI to walk alongside job seekers at all stages of their journey.Laura learned the hard way that accepting every interview can be a mistake. Irrelevant skill sets, misaligned cultural preferences, hiring bias, and poor propensity for on-the-job success can lead to horror-story interviews and even worse job experiences.But, AI is clearly making job seekers’ journeys easier. And, there’s more good news: it’s only going to get better from here. Growing data sets and continuous AI learning means AI platforms like WorkFusion’s, Fortay’s, and Scout Exchange’s will only get smarter and more efficient.The trick for job seekers to take advantage of all AI has to offer now and in the future is honesty, says Ken Lazarus. Make sure resumes accurately align with job performance and skill sets. In doing so, you feed AI data sets that power a brighter future for all job seekers at all stages of the employment journey.",,,,,,,2018-04-18T13:01:09.070Z,,,b58a3a247c34,['Alana Rudder'],,,,,,

In 2016 it was the ancient game of Go. Now it seems computers have mastered a task that stretches the human brain to its limit. In a paper just published in Science Robotics, a group of researchers at Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, report having managed to get a pair of ordinary industrial robots to assemble most of a piece of flat-pack IKEA furniture.The chair in question was a model called STEFAN. The robots’ job was to assemble the frame. This requires several pieces of dowelling to be inserted into pre-drilled holes before the parts are pressed together. In total, says Pham Quang Cuong, one of the paper’s authors, 19 components are involved. The robots were off-the-shelf arm-shaped machines of the sort found in factories around the world, combined with a stereoscopic camera that can produce three-dimensional images. A pair of videos released by the researchers show the robot arms making various mistakes, dropping dowelling on the floor or misaligning components, before succeeding at their task after almost nine minutes of slow, careful work.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming many human activities ranging from daily chores to highly sophisticated tasks. But unlike many other industries, the higher education sector has yet to be really influenced by AI. 
Uber has disrupted the taxi sector, Airbnb has disrupted the hotel industry and Amazon disrupted first the bookselling sector, then the whole retail industry. It is only a matter of time then until the higher education sector undergoes a significant transformation.
Within a few short years, universities may well have changed beyond all recognition. Here are five ways that AI will help to change and shape the future of universities and higher education for the better.
1. Personalised learning
Universities are already using AI algorithms to personalise learning and deliver content that is suited to the students needs and pace of learning – and this is only likely to continue. This idea is built on research that shows different people have different aptitudes, skills and orientations to learn when exposed to the same content and learning environments. 
Offering personalised, adaptive learning platforms recognises the diversity that is part of any learning ecosystem. This will be a significant change for universities, as it moves away from the traditional model of “one module guide for all”. 
It will see educators equipped with data sets to analyse and understand the needs of individuals. And work can be automatically adapted to the style and pace of learning for each particular student.

2. Moving beyond the classroom
As educational AI develops, students will be able to study where they want, when they want and using whatever platform they want. This is likely to mean that tablets and mobile phones will become the main delivery methods.
Universities are already using AI-enabled smart building concepts to redesign learning spaces. Modern “smart” classroom spaces are now generally equipped with circular tables, laptops, flat screen monitors, multiple projectors, and whiteboards to encourage and support collaborative and engaged active learning.
This helps educators move away from a traditional classroom set-up, to a more interactive style of working, to encourage deeper learning approaches. And this will start to include more hybrid methods of learning – such as both face-to-face and online interactions.



3. Welcome to the smart campus
The Internet of Things also has the potential to transform universities into smarter places to work and learn. At its core, the technology is simple, it’s all about connecting devices over the internet and letting them talk to us, as well as each other. 
Smart classrooms will also enhance the learning experience of the students. A classroom connected to the Internet of Things equipped can adapt to the personalised settings to prepare the classroom for different faculty members. Monitoring attendance and invigilating exams will also be automated and made much more robust.
This development in technology will also enable smart campuses to adopt advanced systems to automatically monitor and control every facility. Universities will be able to monitor parking spaces, building alarms, room usage, heating and lighting all very easily.



Say goodbye to traditional learning environments.

4. Great customer service
Universities are also using AI to streamline their processes, resulting in cost savings and better service levels – and this is something that is set to continue. A good example of this is Deakin University in Australia, which has partnered with IBM to be the first university worldwide to implement Watson. Watson is a supercomputer developed by IBM that combines AI and sophisticated analytical software to answer users’ questions. 
Watson’s main functionality is to replicate a human’s ability to answer questions. This functionality uses 90 servers with a combined data store of more than 200m pages of information and processed against six million logic rules. 
Deakin’s aim is to create a 24/7 online student advisory service, that will improve the student experience. Integrated with their single interface platform and online personal hub, DeakinSync enables students to ask questions and receive instant online answers.



5. Monitoring performance
Another dimension of using AI innovations in universities will be the use of block chains. This will revolutionise how universities operate, as higher education institutions use this technology to automate recognition and the transfer of credits, potentially opening up learning opportunities across universities.  
Universities can also use block chains to register and record the intellectual property rights arising from scholarly research. Copyright could be notarised at the date of publication and later reuse can be tracked for impact assessments. This will transform the way universities operate and help to demonstrate the true impact that academic research can have.

And that could unintentionally make employers even more discriminatory than before.Thor BensonPublished Apr. 20, 2018 11:01PM EDT GettyTake the horribly complex and difficult task of hiring new employees, make it less transparent, more confusing and remove all accountability. Sound good to you? Of course it does not, but that’s the path many employers are taking by adopting artificial intelligence in the hiring process. Companies across the nation are now using some rudimentary artificial intelligence, or AI, systems to screen out applicants before interviews commence and for the interviews themselves. As a Guardian article from March explained, many of these companies are having people interview in front of a camera that is connected to AI that analyzes their facial expressions, their voice and more. One of the top recruiting companies doing this, Hirevue, has large customers like Hilton and Unilever. Their AI scores people using thousands of data points and compares it to the scores of the best current employees.But that can be unintentionally problematic. As Recode pointed out, because most programmers are white men, these AI are actually often trained using white male faces and male voices. That can lead to misperceptions of black faces or female voices, which can lead to the AI making negative judgments about those people. The results could trend sexist or racist, but the employer who is using this AI would be able to shift the blame to a supposedly neutral technology. Other companies have people do their first interview with an AI chatbot. One popular AI that does this is called Mya, which promises a 70 percent decrease in hiring time. Any number of questions these chatbots could ask could be proxies for race, gender or other factors.   An algorithm that judges resumes or powers a chatbot might factor in how far away someone lives from the office, which may have to do with historically racist housing laws. In that case, the black applicant who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood far away from the office gets rejected. Xerox actually encountered that exact problem years ago.  “You can fire a racist HR person, you might not ever find out your AI has been producing racist or sexist results.” “If you use data that reflects existing and historical bias, and you ask a mathematical tool to make predictions based on that data, the predictions will reflect that bias,” Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney at the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program, told The Daily Beast. It’s nearly impossible to make an algorithm that won’t produce some kind of bias, because almost every data point that can be connected to another factor like someone’s race or gender. We’ve seen this happening when algorithms are used to determine prison sentences and parole in our justice system. “Algorithms, by their very nature, are going to carry some kind of bias,” Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at New America and the Shorenstein Center at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Their designers come from a certain background and have to express their ideas through code—through writing—and whenever you’re expressing an idea on paper or in print or in code, that idea is coming out in a way that is unilaterally defined and necessarily carries some bias in it.” You can fire a racist HR person, you might not ever find out your AI has been producing racist or sexist results.This is not to say programmers are going out there and intentionally making racist hiring robots. Most times, Ghosh explained, the programmer created a biased piece of AI completely on accident. The problem is that companies that create these products do not want to reveal how their algorithms work, because then anyone could recreate the algorithm and profit from it. Ghosh compared it to revealing your “secret sauce.”“You see vendors make these claims that because their tools don’t explicitly incorporate race or gender or other protected class-related factors that they cannot be discriminatory, when the opposite is in fact true,” Goodman said. “Without analyzing the results of an algorithm using data about race or gender to understand the results, it’s extremely likely that proxies for those factors will end up being part of the tool and part of its results.”Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute at Cornell University, told The Daily Beast that one major problem is companies let things like AI make decisions instead of just using them as tools while making a decision. “You don’t have to misuse technology in HR decisions, but employers usually do,” Maltby said. “Nobody in HR wants to hire someone when a test says they shouldn’t. If they turn out to be a bad employee, the HR person’s career is going to be compromised.”Maltby pointed out that employers have been misusing exciting new technology during the hiring process for decades. “Employers have a long history of falling in love with technology that promises easy answers to difficult decisions,” he said. Maltby referenced how employers used to have applicants do polygraph tests while “every scientist in the country said they were junk.” Polygraphs measure stress, not truthfulness, and a pathological liar might feel no stress while lying. An honest person might feel stress simply because they’re nervous. Employers didn’t stop using them until Congress passed a law barring it. He said it’s extremely unlikely Congress will act to stop the same problem with AI.“If stress is something the AI is looking for, it’s going to be the same problem,” Maltby said. “Stress sometimes means there’s a problem, and sometimes it doesn’t.”Rather than removing bias and discrimination from the hiring process, AI could very well bake it in and perpetuate it. We cannot hold machines accountable for their actions, so it’s likely no one would be held accountable for such behavior. Unless the companies making these tools become willing to reveal how they work, which seems unlikely, we’ll never know where bias is or is not being expressed. Technology is supposed to be neutral, but often it’s a reflection of us.   Thor Benson@thor_bensonGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, by Joseph E. Aoun (MIT Press, 2017)
It is not an accident that I’m putting my review of Robot-Proof in ""Inside Digital Learning."" My goal is to drive maximum awareness of this book among anyone thinking about the future of higher education.
Aoun, a linguist who also happens to head Northeastern University, makes the case that our economy is on the cusp of enormous change. He is largely supportive of the argument that accelerating improvements in the bundle of technologies that comprise artificial intelligence (sensors, processing, big data analysis) will drive fundamental changes at every level of our economy. This artificial intelligence driven shift will be as consequential as the two earlier large-scale economic shifts, that of agricultural to manufacturing and then from manufacturing to services.
Our higher education sector, according to Aoun, is not moving fast enough in the face of this large-scale economic change. Just as our colleges and universities are finally getting aligned with today’s service-based labor market, we are doing too little to prepare our students for an age of smart machines.
What is the recipe for higher education to become robot-proof? This answer will be context dependent, as every institution must build on its own strengths and traditions. Aoun does not claim to offer any algorithm for organizational change. He is sensitive to the complexity of our institutions, and is not an advocate of simplistic notions around disruption. What Aoun does forcefully for is an end to the traditional thinking which places a liberal arts education in opposition to preparation for employment. He finds that liberal arts / employment preparation dichotomy no longer accurate, or particularly useful in evolving our institutions.
We should, argues Aoun, seek to align teaching and learning at our colleges and universities with the research on learning. What this scholarship demonstrates is that there are limits to both abstract and applied learning. The two must be married. Active and experiential learning opportunities are critical components of a valuable postsecondary education.
Aoun believes that in an economy where smart robots do much of the work that people do today -- including the information-based service work (accounting, legal services, etc.) that was previously protected from automation -- that the skills prioritized in a liberal arts education will be increasingly in demand. These skills include judgment, collaboration, curiosity, communication, empathy, team work, leadership and many others. These creative, social and leadership qualities represent tasks that can’t be automated.
These classical attributes of a liberal arts education, however, will hold little value, Aoun argues, unless students have the opportunity to apply these skills. The learning cycle between abstraction and action needs to be shortened. What you learn in college and what you do with that learning are not separate things. They reinforce one another.
The approach that each college or university takes to integrate thinking and doing, the abstract and the concrete, will differ by institution. Aoun describes Northeastern’s co-op program in some detail. This is one model for prioritizing experiential learning. There are many others.  
Aoun never says it this directly, but you get the sense after reading Robot-Proof that any school that is not significantly re-orienting all their teaching practices to align with the research on learning -- and in particular is not prioritizing active and experiential learning -- is committing education malpractice.
Robot-Proof is a bold call for change in the business of usual of higher education. There is much else in this book that anyone who is thinking about the future of college will find interesting. The model that Aoun proposes for our institutions being places of lifelong learning is fascinating.
One not have to be a believer that we are bound for a future of technologically driven unemployment to enjoy Robot-Proof. I’m actually quite skeptical that robots will take all the jobs. Mostly, I think that robots will take many of the not so great jobs -- leaving better employment available for humans. Those jobs, however, will increasingly require the qualities and skills that one gets through a liberal arts education.
What would be the one book about the future of higher ed that you would recommend to someone who will only read one book on the subject this year?
Is your school moving aggressively to prioritize active and experiential learning?
Where can digital learning serve as an enabler of active and experiential learning?
What are you reading?

Around 5.7 million jobs in SA will be at risk over the next seven years due to digital automation, having a crippling effect on the economic growth of the country.This is according to a report release by Accenture titled: ""Creating South Africa's Future Workplace."" The report reveals that over a third of current jobs in SA are at risk from technologies like robots, artificial intelligenceARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEGetting started with generative AI?

(AI), machine learning and automation, with both white and blue-collar workers' positions in the firing line.""In general, the more predictable and repetitive a job, the more at risk the employee is from being replaced by automation,"" notes the study.Speaking at a seminar held at the University of Stellenbosch Business School this week, Dr Roze Phillips, MD of Accenture Consulting in Africa, said SA needed to act now to ensure that humans and machines can work together in the future.""Our research shows that if SA can double the pace at which its workforce acquires skills relevant for human-machine collaboration, it can reduce the number of jobs at risk from 3.5 million (20%) in 2025 to just 2.5 million."" See also Chatbots not yet ready to replace humansTech to contribute to job losses in SA""With the threat of automation growing, SA is less prepared than other countries and needs to give its workforce skills to participate in the digital economy. In a country with a staggering 27.7% unemployment and jobless youths making up 75% of unemployment, the future looks bleak,"" she commented.The research found that among the top 10 jobs at risk from automation are those of clerks, tellers, mining and maintenance workers, insurance claim and policy processors, bill and account collectors, moulders, casters, furnace operators and team assemblers. In position one of those whose jobs are most at risk are accountants, auditors and bookkeepers.The research, Phillips continued, showed occupations that allocated more time to human-like activities had a lower probability of automation, while workers involved in occupations such as production, office administration, tellers, cashiers, farming, food preparation, accounting, auditing, insurance claim and policy processing, construction, mining, transportation, installation and maintenance were at the highest risk.""Automation isn't a force that will affect one part of our society only, all fields will be affected.""MethodologyThe process used to collect data, according to Accenture, consists of researching various job categories drawn from Statistics SA to gain insight into human-like and machine-like activities, taking into account the type of work, skills and tasks; the recent skills evolution in jobs; degree of work automation; work supply demographics and productive structure.Furthermore, Accenture's corporate citizenship team interviewed more than 40 practitioners and thought leaders from a wide range of fields spanning neuroscience, workforce development, corporate learning and talent development and so on. The team also analysed over 130 million job postings; reviewed 1 000 workforce development programmes; established a learning circle made up of experts from around the world; and assessed around 25 of the leading frameworks on the future of work and skills.Headcount reducedThe PwC Global CEO Survey released at the start of this year found SA's already strained job market will come under further pressure over the next 12 months, with CEOs planning to reduce headcount as a result of rapid technology advancements.Dion Shango, CEO of PwC South Africa, believes the connection between technology and talent is a critical area that will determine the future sustainability of many enterprises and economies in the coming years. The reduction in headcount that has been forecast is clearly being impacted by this trend as well.A study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that between 400 million and 800 million of today's jobs will be automated by 2030 as digital platforms and other innovations change the fundamental nature of work.However, the research also takes a positive perspective, adding that while tech will replace some jobs, it will also create new positions that will require new skill sets.""Technology adoption can and often does cause significant short-term labour displacement, but history shows that, in the longer run, it creates a multitude of new jobs and unleashes demand for existing ones, more than offsetting the number of jobs it destroys even as it raises labour productivity,"" notes McKinsey Global Institute.A research report from Forrester echoes the results of the McKinsey Global Institute study, saying while automation will displace 24.7 million jobs globally by 2027, new technology will also create 14.9 million new jobs in the next decade, with automation creating jobs equivalent to 10% of the workforce through 2027.Share",,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/j5alrvQgkY1MpYQk', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': '5.7m local jobs at risk due to automation', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/57m-local-jobs-at-risk-due-to-automation/LPp6VMr4J86vDKQz'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only one merits consideration at the constitutional level.Six of the eight are a mishmash blending of issues. For example, amendment 7 blends a ban on oil drilling with vaping in the workplace. Amendment 9 mixes community college governance with death benefits for first responders. Of the remaining two on the ballot, Amendment 13, banning greyhound racing, is clearly not a constitutional issue for voters but a legislative one in a representative government. Only a vote on Amendment 12, addressing ethics issues on elected officials and government employees, provides a clear choice for voters that resembles a constitutional issue. The end product of the CRC serves to clearly demonstrate that we need to have a constitutional amendment to ban any future Constitutional Revision Commissions.Steve Shimp, Fort Myers Lee Health monopoly?  Is our local health system scaring away the best health personnel in the area? The domestic economic situation of health is maintained and supplied by the Lee Health System.  Since Lee Health is the only seller in the market, it can charge higher prices compared to markets where there are multiple sellers as well as restrict consumer sovereignty. The health system has become a price-maker thus causing a potentially fatal problem for the physical health care in the community.The wage rates of a monopolist firm can be lowered past the actual value of its employees hence causing skilled medical personnel to seek employment elsewhere. Lee Health may cause an exodus of needed skilled laborers from hospitals around the county.With the system operating as a monopolist firm, it will have no incentive to be efficient or diminish its dead weight loss. The health system may need to be rethought to ensure proper care for the community and its employees. Jeremy Rosauer, student at FSW   Artificial intelligence possibilities As we progress, the likelihood of your job being replaced by artificial intelligence or “robots” is highly likely.It may seem like a theory straight out of a science fiction novel or movie; however, we are already living in an environment already familiarizing itself with advanced technology. If it's through self-driving cars or your smart speakers we are already living in a high tech era. Many theorist and economist believe in some sort of future not too long from now that will involve a higher concentration on machines in the labor market.But when it comes down to theorizing about the future two major topics appear: “with the rise of artificial intelligence, this would bring new occupations to the job industry or Artificial intelligence with its vast capabilities would control almost the entire labor market.If artificial intelligence comes to fruition, jobs that would most likely exist would be those that require deep thinking or creativity; others would involve nursing or care. If the impact was so served we could see high taxation on companies that use this technology, however, this could prompt companies to move their business overseas increasing the prices of their products.Other solutions would be a wage floor. This would be an attempt to keep those struggling to find a job out of severe poverty. Artificial intelligence would also increase the gap between the poor and wealthy. The reason being is machines have the capability to conduct equality or higher quality of work for a cheaper price. With the adoption of this new technology, this would spell higher profits for companies influencing them more to adopt these new practices. Automation, as we have seen, made a huge impact in the car industry, replacing humans with machines and even today, robots have already replaced hundreds of thousands of jobs.Some benefits that may happen with artificial intelligence could be more jobs and cheaper products. Ashton Frias, Cape Coral  Wealthy benefitsI found it most interesting that Rep.

Commentary by Hon. Powes Parkop, Governor of National Capital District

Yesterday we ended our official trip to the City of Shenzhen. We were guest of the Deputy Mayor of Shenzhen Mr Ai Xuefeng and the China Steel Construction Engineering (CSCE) Ltd. This is the company that the Shenzhen Municipal Government engaged to built our new college, The Butuka Shenzhen Friendship College.

This college symbolizes the Sister city relationship between our two cities. I signed an MOU in 2016 to make Shenzen our sister city. This college will be the first in PNG in that we will have a three in one campus comprising of elementary, primary and secondary school. It will also have indoor and outdoor sporting complex and cafeteria.

We ended the official trip to Shenzhen with a visit to the massive assembly and fabrication plant owned the CSCE in the City of Huizhou which is about an hours drive from Shenzhen.

What impressed me about the visit wasn’t just the massive size of the assembly and fabrication plant but significantly more was the almost lack of workers in this massive plant. In the entire gigantic building comprising of various stages of formulating steel to customer design, we hardly saw any human work force.

In a country of almost 2 billion people, many I believe would love to work in this innovative plant. The absence of workers therefore was a big surprise to me and all of our delegates.

Instead of using human workforce to complete the stages of assembling and fabricating, all of the work was being done by robots, including cutting and welding. It was an astonishing cutting edge technology at its best but it also spoke volumes for the future.

This technological advancement will not just have an impact on production line and quality of products and services, it will completely change the nature of the economy and how we humans relate to the economy in terms of employment and our overall lifestyle.

This is not just a feature or an ad hoc decision by the assembly plant. It was a well thought out plan and vision of this giant company which started in 1985 as part of the State owned mother company called China State Construction Engineering Company.

Their future goal is to develop steel to a level and capacity which can enable them to be part of inter planetary travel and settlement, building space cities as depicted in the Star Wars movies, building floating cities in the ocean of the world and also building undersea cities.

I was totally wowed by this vision when we visited their steel museum on the first day of our official trip. The museum tells a very powerful story of human progress since the discovery of steel. It takes you through the history of how steel was developed, enhanced and used to build industries generally but particularly to build infrastructures and monuments that litters all over the world today including the Eiffel Tower in Paris and other land marks like the Golden Gate Bridge in Los Angeles.

At the end of the tour we were ushered into a 3D cinema where we were given their futuristic vision of how steel will take human civilization and technological advancement to another level. The sky is no longer the limit. It seems, a vision we only see in movies can be a reality soon.

While that might seem like something we all dream of, I can’t begin to imagine what would it mean for us in terms of economic development and lifestyle into the future? Because it is already happening. It’s here now.

We have to start waking up to a reality that employment and the economy as we know now it, would not be the same as it is today. Human doctors, engineers, pilots, factory workers especially in steel fabrication, nurses etc might be a thing of the past. Instead we will have these professions filled by artificial intelligence; robots which are already happening in China as I write this.

Humans in the near future will have a lot of time to spare on their hands because almost all manual work might be out-sourced to robots and even professional jobs. Lifestyle and service industry, arts, music, sports and entertainment etc will be the mainstay of human activities in the coming future.

The physical, mental and the manual aspect of human activity would be and can be outsourced by artificial intelligence.

Where does that leave us humans? We may have to spend more time on holistic and lifestyle industry which would be hard to outsource to artificial intelligence robots.

How we are employed or utilize our time and sustain ourselves will be a big challenge in this robotic future. This is a scenario that is devoid of the reality in PNG but it will happen sooner than later. It’s already making a presence in the most populated country in the world as our visit showed.

This is a company that has K2 trillion worth of contract all over the world and is ranked 24 out of 500 top companies in the world. It is a giant global company that is investing in and already utilizing artificial intelligence on a massive scale. It’s vision is to perfect, improve and out source more so they can be competitive and relevant into the future.

That’s means we in PNG and the world generally must start to wake up from our comfort zone and ignorance!

It has already started  inPNG. Don’t be complacent. We need to dive into the future with a positive outlook and dare to dream the impossible. I ask you to see the world in new perspectives and courageous to be different and futuristic!

SINGAPORE — An artificial intelligence-powered jobs search portal has been launched to better connect jobseekers with career opportunities relevant to their skills.MyCareersFuture.sg, which will eventually replace the National Jobs Bank, seeks to reduce “missed matches” by recommending jobs that are best matched to the job title, skills and minimum salary desired, indicated by the user.Advertisement 











The portal, first announced by Second Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo during the Budget debate last month, was officially launched on Tuesday (April 17) at the inaugural Adapt and Grow roadshow, which showcased a series of Workforce Singapore’s (WSG) career preparation and matching services.Mrs Teo had said in March that four in 10 of 25,000 jobseekers placed via the Adapt and Grow initiatives, which seek to help Singaporeans affected by economic slowdown and restructuring, encountered some form of job mismatch. This proportion has grown significantly from just 25 per cent in 2016, she said.Developed by statutory boards WSG and the Government Technology Agency, the portal uses machine learning technology to scour various job descriptions posted in the Jobs Bank and filter the skills required for each type of job.The user can then check off the skills he or she possesses and view results of the search, where jobs which best correspond with the skills declared will show up at the top, each labelled with a percentage indicating the extent of match.For instance, a user who searches for the keyword “accountant” will be prompted with a list of relevant skills, such as “financial reporting”, “budgets”, “account reconciliation” and “Microsoft Excel”, among others.Advertisement 











A search for jobs related to “journalist” will render skills such as “social media”, “blogging”, “new media” and “online journalism”.The user will also receive recommendations of jobs in other sectors matched to the skills they had provided.On Tuesday, Mrs Teo said that the new jobs portal aims to provide a “smarter and faster way” for jobseekers to find opportunities.“New jobs keep coming up, and skills and profiles of jobs are changing very quickly… (the portal) will indicate to you how much of a skills match you have (to your desired jobs). You can then ask yourself, where are the areas in which you can enhance your skills, and how to find the opportunites that will enable you to do so,“ she said.In the long-term, the authorities aim to link MyCareersFuture.sg closely with MySkillsFuture, an education and career guidance portal aimed at helping Singaporeans chart their learning and plan their career paths.Advertisement 











About 280,000 visitors have used MyCareersFuture.sg since it went live on Jan 2. One of them is 43-year-old Simon Oh, who said it has helped him to narrow down his job search based on his skills.“I think in the past, I used to throw out resumes all over the place, but that was not very focused and I realised it was not working out,” said Mr Oh, who was let go by his previous firm in the oil and gas industry last October amid corporate restructuring.Mr Oh, who was trained in mechanical engineering but is currently taking a part-time course in computer science, now has his eye on the technology industry.Through the portal, jobseekers can also find employers who are open to hiring mature workers, as well as those who are willing to recruit people without relevant experience. They can also filter job opportunities based on location. MyCareersFuture.sg is currently available only for jobseekers’ use, but an interface for employers is in the works. It will be up by the end of the year, and allow employers to update the core skills needed and application status for each role more efficiently, said WSG.Advertisement 











In the meantime, employers will continue to post jobs and search for candidates via the Jobs Bank, which is synced to the portal. More than 300,000 jobseekers and 30,000 employers have used the Jobs Bank since its launch in July 2014. It now receives about 44,000 job postings per month.
