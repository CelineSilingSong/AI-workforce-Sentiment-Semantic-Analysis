Public call for government regulation of generative AI at work

                            1 June 2023                        








New polling by leading tech trade union Prospect has found that workers overwhelmingly believe government should set rules around the use of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) to protect jobs, with 58% of workers supporting regulation.

58% of workers say the Government should set rules around the use of generative AI at work, according to polling in May 2023 by Prospect and Opinium
Just 12% of workers thought that the government should not interfere in the implementation of generative AI, believing that the benefits are likely to outweigh the costs.
Workers also reported a low level of confidence that they would be consulted by their employer on the introduction of new technology at work, with 45% believing they would not be involved in such decisions.
The polling also found workers are deeply uncomfortable with surveillance at work and the use of software to make automated hiring and promotion decisions.
Workers are deeply uncomfortable with surveillance at work and the use of software to make automated hiring and promotion decisions
71% of workers would be uncomfortable with their employer using wearable tracking devices to monitor where they were, with only 15% being comfortable with the use of such technology.
Use of cameras to monitor hybrid and remotes workers in their homes was similarly unpopular, with 69% of those polled being uncomfortable with this kind of surveillance, and just 14% comfortable with it.
Keystroke monitoring – assessing how often and quickly workers were using their keyboard at home – made 59% of workers feel uncomfortable, compared to 22% who would be content with its introduction.
Removing human oversight of crucial HR decisions was also unpopular. Only 17% of workers would be comfortable with decisions about who to hire and who to promote being made by algorithms rather than a person, compared to 62% who would be uncomfortable.
Mike Clancy, General Secretary of Prospect union, said: 
“With AI and tech already transforming how people work, governance and regulation has lagged behind despite strong public support for setting rules to prevent its abuse.
“Advances in technology have the potential to bring huge benefits to both employers and workers, but without government setting out clear rules, sinister surveillance and software supervisors could become the norm.
“As the way we work changes, workers should join a union to ensure they have a strong voice fighting for a future of work that is fair.”

Fears about AI and its impact on jobs have been exacerbated by all of the layoffs. At the precipice of any major industrial shift, fear is always attached to the impact on humans and the workforce. That fear is usually valid for a transitional period, as we recalibrate and as new jobs arise. It is important to be adaptable and learn what the new wave of jobs may look like.


Technological advances are inevitable. We can’t stop the momentum, but we can potentially slow it down with regulations and the thoughtfulness of how we balance technology adoption and job preservation. With the speed of innovation and disruption, we need to pause to make sure we are in control of how tech impacts society. It is important to reflect on what our core values; taking into consideration both how we treat people, as well as how we stay competitive in a global market.

Industry disruption from technical advancements has been happening since the beginning of time. At the precipice of any major shift, there is always a fear attached to the impact on humans and the workforce. In Rania Hoteit’s Future of Work Article, she gave the example that Queen Elisabeth denied a patent for an automated knitting machine because of the fear that automating knitting would reduce employment to the point of starvation. Factories still adopted the machine and by the end of the 19th century, there were four times as many factory weavers as there had been in 1830.

PROMOTED
With the Industrial Revolution, Britain feared that people would be replaced by machines and left permanently jobless. To date, these fears have been mostly wrong. However, in the short-term people were impacted. Those who were adaptable and quick to learn new technologies found themselves in better positions than others during transitional industry revolutions. To give some perspective to how fast the job market can change, A MIT study found that 60% of employment in 2018 was in roles that didn’t exist in 1940. With any industrial change new jobs arise. That is not to say that this wave of change will fit the pattern, but it is certainly worth considering.

Certainly, the integration of AI has not been without its challenges and negative impacts. One of the most significant concerns surrounding AI is the potential for job displacement, particularly in industries that rely heavily on repetitive or routine tasks that can be automated. As AI and machine learning become more sophisticated and capable of performing more complex tasks, there is a risk that more jobs will become obsolete, potentially leading to unemployment and economic disruption. There is no denying that technology is moving faster than ever before and there is the risk if humans can keep up with the technological evolution.

It is predicted by Goldman Sachs that 300 million jobs could be impacted. Although these numbers are alarming, the study showed that most jobs are only partially exposed to automation and have the possibility of being complementary and increasing workplace productivity. The most at-risk industries are “administrative support” estimated at 46% and “legal” estimated at 44%. The least at-risk roles will be within manual labor and hands-on jobs. The timeline of these estimates is unclear, but potentially within ten years.

As AI continues to advance and become more integrated into various industries, there have been many new job opportunities and other benefits resulting from its adoption. We will see that more mundane tasks will be delegated to AI and that humans will be needed for refining, quality checks, and more creative aspects of jobs. Jobs such as machine learning engineer, AI legal and ethics, data scientist, and AI researcher, require specialized skills and knowledge and are in high demand as more companies seek to develop and implement AI-driven solutions.

The question is how fast can people adapt to fill these roles. Having a core understanding of your innate abilities and how you can transfer your skills will be key to quick adaptability. Our society needs a workforce strategy that integrates AI and keeps jobs through modification of the roles. A combination of new job creation, reskilling programs, and AI-human collaboration would ensure a dynamic workforce, with humans and AI working together to maximize productivity and innovation.
Several experts believe that creatives will be less vulnerable to the forces of technology. The nonlinear, messiness of human emotion and thoughts that are conveyed through different artistic mediums very much exhibit uniquely human qualities. The biggest mistakes can at times end up being the best masterpieces. However, AI is also penetrating the creative space with applications such as image generators DALL-E 2. These applications won’t necessarily put talented creatives out of work, but more so will support humans to do the work they already perform with greater efficiency. There is the risk that a smaller group of established artists could dominate the market and leave less well-known artists with a smaller market share. On the other side of possibilities more artists will have access to technology and the global market to enhance their ability to sell and could even the playing field.
Jack Ma thinks that people will only work four hours a day and maybe four days a week, within the next 30 years…but getting there might be painful.
While the potential for job displacement is certainly a cause for concern, there are also potential solutions to address this issue. One such solution is the idea of universal basic income (UBI), which is a guaranteed income provided to every citizen regardless of their employment status. Proponents of UBI argue that it could serve as a safety net for workers who are displaced by automation and AI, allowing them to meet their basic needs while they seek new employment or pursue education and training opportunities. While UBI is still a controversial idea, there is growing interest and support for exploring it as a potential solution to job displacement caused by AI. It's important to note, however, that UBI is not a silver bullet and there are still many questions and challenges that need to be addressed in implementing such a system. One of the important pieces to UBI is making sure that people connect to their passion and purpose to live meaningful and engaged lives.
Legal and governmental policies will be important factors to mediate and integrate AI into many aspects of our society, including the workforce. We will need a much more robust set of policy responses to make sure that workers can adapt, so that the benefits of automation are broadly shared. In a more balanced future, AI technology would coexist with humans, enhancing our capabilities and improving our lives, while carefully managing risks and challenges to ensure a fair and inclusive society.
According to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report, 85 million jobs will be replaced by machines with AI by the year 2025. The same report states that 97 million new jobs will be created by 2025 due to AI. There is not an industry that may not be impacted in beneficial and/or detremential ways. Below is a list of potential replaceable tasks among some industries and a list of new jobs sparked from AI.

This article is part of WorkLife’s artificial intelligence special edition, which breaks through the hype around AI – both traditional and generative – and examines what its role will be in the future of work, for desk-based workers. More from the series →
Whether it’s fake photos of explosions that go viral, endless calls for regulation, or competitive product announcements from big tech companies, artificial intelligence is dominating the headlines on a daily basis. 
The disruptive role AI and automation will have in our future working lives has long been debated. But when the generative AI tool ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, burst into the mainstream at the end of 2022, it accelerated and compounded our deepest underlying fear about the tech: that AI will usurp our jobs. 
But beyond the hype, the reality is very different. It’s true that the generative AI genie is well and truly out of the bottle: it will transform the ways workers interact with each other and their employers or clients. But it won’t decimate all jobs. Rather, it will evolve them, and in some cases could even create more jobs. 
So what’s what? What should we worry about and what is mere hype? We have taken some of the most common AI misconceptions that have created a sense of panic and debunked them in the below myth buster. 
Myth: AI will take over my job. 

AI-driven anxiety is reaching new heights, with a third of workers worried about being replaced by tech in the next three years. Couple this with rapid AI advancements and Goldman Sachs’ claims that the latest wave of AI innovation could affect 300 million jobs, and this anxiety isn’t surprising. 
However, this is a concern experts want to alleviate.
There are some kinds of work – the mundane, repetitive, time-consuming kind – that are crying out for more automation. Determining where and how AI can best be used to free up human employees’ time so they can focus on other tasks that are, for example, more creative and require a human thinker, will give businesses a competitive edge, experts say. 

That’s why leaders are actually encouraging their employees to use AI to boost their productivity. In fact, some employers are even paying for ChatGPT Plus subscriptions for their employees to free up their time to do deeper work instead. 
While some people are worried that using AI will make their role redundant, it’s often not the case. Progressive business leaders see it as an opportunity for their employees to shift the kind of work they do, making them more efficient. 
Plus, the tech itself isn’t ready. Just check out what happened when a New York lawyer over-relied on ChatGPT for background research to help win his case in court. The chatbot actually made up fake legal cases, which the lawyer then used in court, landing himself in major hot water. 
Ultimately, it’s the harmony between humans and AI that matters the most.
“We have a belief that the AI’s job should be a copilot or companion,” said Scott Litman, founder and COO of Lucy, an AI-powered answer engine. “The individual needs to stay on the wheel. If an individual operates alone without the AI, or the AI operates alone without the individual, there is a huge missing piece. But the two together become very powerful.”







            “The individual needs to stay on the wheel. If an individual operates alone without the AI, or the AI operates alone without the individual, there is a huge missing piece. But the two together become very powerful.”        


 

                Scott Litman, founder and COO of Lucy, an AI-powered answer engine.            







Lupe Colangelo, interim head of talent placements at technical and business education and career provider General Assembly, said that she’s seen tech candidates embrace the emergence of AI as they enter the workforce. 
“Like any technology, there can always be a fear of being replaced, but like any other technology that comes into play, it helps automate things but it’s not going to fully replace,” said Colangelo. “There is still so much space for the humans working on these tools to remain there and own the digital transformation.”
She anticipates more jobs emerging in the AI space, beyond prompt engineers, including AI trainers, AI ethicists, and machine managers. 
Myth: Companies are only using AI to cut costs. 
It’s true that using AI can help reduce some costs in the workplace. For example, it can automate routine tasks and allow that employee to work on something else that might have a higher return on investment. However, it’s certainly not the only reason companies are taking advantage of it. Some experts believe that if companies aren’t capitalizing on AI they could fall behind entirely. 
Litman said that the use cases for AI will depend on the business.
“In any given vertical application, there are going to be questions like what is the impact, is someone trying to save time, are they trying to increase capacity, are they trying to decrease wait times or increase customer satisfaction?,” said Litman. “It’s going to vary business to business and use case to use case.”
Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion, an automation solutions company for Fortune 500 enterprises, banks, insurance, and financial services, said that implementing this technology now can help companies set themselves apart from competitors, given it is still on the newer side.
“You’re always looking at keeping a competitive advantage in the marketplace,” said Famularo. “Adopting new technologies has always been a way to help set yourself up to be different in the marketplace and be more efficient and effective.”
Myth: AI and machine learning are the same thing. 
While the spotlight on AI over the past six months has been intensive, what experts refer to as “traditional” AI (focuses on detecting patterns, making decisions, honing analytics, classifying data and detecting fraud) has been rumbling along under the surface for years, with many businesses having adopted it for several years. As has machine learning, which is a type of AI. But the two terms are often used interchangeably, just like traditional AI and generative AI (produces new content, chat responses, designs, synthetic data or deep fakes, like ChatGPT, DALL-E) are. 
It can get confusing fast. (check out WorkLife’s AI glossary to help sort through the new AI lingo.)
Machine learning is a subset of AI which focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and make predictions or decisions based on data. It involves training machines to recognize patterns and make better decisions. For example, ChatGPT uses machine learning techniques to understand and generate human-like language. But the terms should not be used interchangeably. 
“AI is really the broad category of machine intelligence,” said Litman. “Machine learning is a subset of how you train AI.”
Myth: AI won’t impact my sector. 
When it comes to AI, sticking your head in the sand entirely will backfire. Robots have long been associated with automating more manual, repetitive jobs, typically in blue-collar industries like manufacturing and logistics. For example, Amazon uses AI to handle millions of items in its warehouses. 
But it’s now having a significant impact in a wide range of industries, including corporate, desk-based jobs like financial services, where Morgan Stanley has a new OpenAI-powered chatbot. Meanwhile, management consultancy PwC will invest $1 billion to expand AI capabilities within its organization, to automate parts of its tax, audit and consulting services, and upskill its employees. 
“When email was first allowed at our jobs we could only email certain times of the day and then it was shut down because they didn’t want us to lose productivity,” said Famularo. “But if you think about what email and the internet has brought to our lives, it’s huge. It’s the same thing with AI. We’re all going to use it.”







            “Companies do need to take the time to think about ‘what is our AI strategy and direction,’ and make sure they put together what their plan is for adopting the technology.”        


 

                Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.            







Famularo believes the disruption AI causes will be mostly positive and it should be viewed as a technology that can help people do their jobs better.
“It’s where a marketing person will be able to do their job better than they were able to do it before, or a legal executive can write legal documents faster than they were able to do before,” said Famularo. “Each role and function will have their own twist on how they will use AI to make themselves more effective. I don’t see any industry not being impacted by it.”
Myth: Companies using AI don’t care about me. 
This somewhat common sentiment isn’t helped by some senior leaders’ public statements around how they plan to deploy AI. For example, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s comments to Bloomberg that he’ll use AI to slash IBM’s workforce, aren’t going to appease any anxiety around the topic. But they’re the exception rather than the norm. Most CEOs have been circumspect about how they plan to use AI to enhance their workforce’s capabilities, like PwC’s plan to upskill its workers to be proficient users of AI.
And one might argue that a company encouraging you to use AI cares about you even more than a company that doesn’t. For example, using AI allows employees to have more time to focus on deep work that they might not have had time for before if their calendar was filled with time-consuming tasks that could have been automated. Best case scenario, that could leave employees feeling more satisfied with their day-to-day work, free up mental strain and even potentially stave off future burnout.
That’s of course if the employer then doesn’t demand a significantly higher output of work every day from that employee, causing additional stress. 
In short, companies will largely use AI to improve the efficiency and productivity of workforces and the experience of their customers. But that doesn’t mean that the company doesn’t care about their workers. “There is constant disruption in the workplace with new tools,” added Litman. 
Myth: AI can be completely objective. 
If we take ChatGPT for example, there are a number of ways in which it is not totally objective. It can often hallucinate, like other AI-powered language processing tools. That means it can give an output that seems entirely right, but is actually inaccurate. It means that people using these sorts of tools need to be mindful of fact checking and verifying the answers given.
“One of the things we think is really critical is how important it is that it can cite the evidence of where the machine created the answer from so we can verify it’s truthful and accurate,” said Litman. 
AI systems may also hold bias if the training data used to develop the system contained biases or inaccuracies. We’ve already seen the fallout of when this happens, including Amazon’s recruitment system that automatically rejected CVs from women applicants, Google’s photo app which labeled a picture of a Black couple as “gorillas” and the racial disparities in the accuracy of facial detection systems exposed by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru.
These cases have highlighted the importance of responsible, ethical AI that doesn’t include bias or discrimination of any kind.
“People are concerned about the bias with generative AI, but the bias isn’t in the AI, it’s in the underlying data,” said Litman. “If the data is biased, the responses will be biased.”
Myth: My company doesn’t need an AI strategy.
If a company wants to be at the cutting edge of the future of work, experts say that an AI strategy should be a top priority if it’s not already in place. Currently, only 35% of businesses use AI, while 42% are considering implementing it in the near future, according to recent findings. 
“Companies do need to take the time to think about ‘what is our AI strategy and direction,’ and make sure they put together what their plan is for adopting the technology,” said Famularo.
He said that most of the current conversations are around where companies should place guardrails around the usage of AI to ensure that poor decisions aren’t made. It’s helpful for companies to share policies about how they should be using AI at work, he added. 
“You should think about how you’re going to enable your employees to use it without worry of compromise, and you should think about how you’re adopting new technologies to take on certain tasks,” said Famularo.
Colangelo agrees and stressed that being thoughtful about this digital transformation is critical. 
“It’s really important to make sure that we are keeping people first when it comes to your technology strategy,” said Colangelo. “Any company that is adopting AI, you want to make sure that you’re getting feedback from your employees to understand how it can make their roles more efficient, how it can be used to reskill or upskill, and how to invest in talent. My recommendation for organizations is to think long term.”

Share Generative AI to Become a $1.3 Trillion Market by 2032, Research Finds




								June 01, 2023							










Bloomberg Intelligence: New Report Finds That the Emerging Industry Could Grow at a CAGR of 42% Over the Next 10 Years
Rising demand for generative AI products could add about $280 billion of new software revenue
New York, June 01, 2023 — With the influx of consumer generative AI programs like Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the generative AI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022, according to a new report by Bloomberg Intelligence (BI). Growth could expand at a CAGR of 42%, driven by training infrastructure in the near-term and gradually shifting to inference devices for large language models (LLMs), digital ads, specialized software and services in the medium to long term, BI’s research finds.
Moreover, rising demand for generative AI products could add about $280 billion of new software revenue, driven by specialized assistants, new infrastructure products, and copilots that accelerate coding. Companies like Amazon WebServices, Microsoft, Google and Nvidia could be the biggest beneficiaries, as enterprises shift more workloads to the public cloud.
Fig1: Generative AI Revenue

BI estimates that generative AI is poised to expand its impact from less than 1% of total IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming market spending to 10% by 2032. The largest drivers of incremental revenue will be generative AI infrastructure as a service ($247 billion by 2032) used for training LLMs, followed by digital ads driven by the technology ($192 billion) and specialized generative AI assistant software ($89 billion). On the hardware side of this, revenue will be driven by AI servers ($132 billion), AI storage ($93 billion), computer vision AI products ($61 billion) and conversational AI devices ($108 billion).
Fig2: Generative AI Market Opportunity

Of particular note is the potential for generative AI to benefit life sciences and education, with BI’s analysis finding that early use cases of ChatGPT suggest that these are two areas that could see rapid growth from their position as a fraction of larger software segments today. The potential for specialized AI-based software assistants may be particularly transformative for search and other means of summarizing information that drive these two market segments.
Fig3: Generative AI Life Sciences, Education Spending

Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the report said, “The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spending, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.
This technology will not be a solely positive development for all players in the space, as this rapid growth opportunity for generative AI across technology may displace a number of incumbents across that vendors set to benefit from generative AI; including semiconductors, hardware, cloud software, IT services and ad companies.

NewmanChevronPartner at Reed Smith LLPSummaryAI raises questions about IP protectability and enforcementThere are opportunities and limitations of using AI in the workplaceBefore using AI tools, know how data is shared, used, and accessedUnderstand applicable privacy laws and how to minimize riskArticles, blog posts, and discussions about ChatGPT have flooded recent legal news. ChatGPT is a dialogue-based AI technology that provides textual responses to users’ natural language queries through an online chatbot interface. Although the technology is not new and varying degrees of AI have been present in our existing technologies for decades, AI research firm OpenAI made ChatGPT freely available for public use in late 2022 (and in March 2023 released a paid version powered by the improved algorithm GPT-4), showing the world the vast potential of state-of-the-art AI.ChatGPT does not actually understand human conversation. Rather, it is powered by a large language model (LLM). LLMs are trained on enormous quantities of text (many trillions of words), spanning a variety of sources, to assign probabilities to word sequences, enabling the technology to predict text. After the model is equipped with this ability, humans pose questions to the model and rank its responses to teach the model the difference between accurate and acceptable responses and inaccurate and improper responses (such as hate speech).LLMs are only as good as the data and training they receive. While the publicly accessible version of ChatGPT is impressive, its responses are often incorrect and unreliable, particularly when it comes to answering legal questions. However, the model continues to learn. Open AI has other, more powerful commercial offerings, and many competitive products are in development and rapidly emerging. In fact, AI-generated content is not limited to text. Other AI-generative technologies on the market are capable of creating images, music, and even video.The public release of ChatGPT has sparked an inflection point for AI technology, prompting companies and their officers to ask many different legal questions concerning the technology’s use. Unfortunately, the answers are few and far between, because courts are only now being asked to apply existing law to these new technologies.Practical Law The JournalRegister for FREE to continue readingFree and easy registration gives you unlimited access to Practical Law The Journal.RegisterAlready have an account?

Nearly half of people – 48 per cent – believe it is likely that humans will one day lose control of AI systems by surpassing human capabilities and start to act against human interests. Around a third of people think this scenario is unlikely.The poll findings were published ahead of Rishi Sunak’s visit to Washington this week, where he will urge President Biden to back a new system of global regulation to protect against potential threats from advanced AI, including national security and livelihoods.As i revealed last month, the Prime Minister is considering a new body for AI based on the International Atomic Energy Agency, which regulates nuclear material.Last week, more than 350 experts from the sector warned the human race faces an existential threat from the technology if it is not regulated properly.The BMG poll for i shows that 55 per cent think more jobs will be lost to AI than created by it, despite leading figures in the AI sector highlighting the opportunities from the technology.A quarter of people think their current type of work will be performed by robots or  other AI machines in 20 years’ time, while 47 per cent think it will still be conducted mainly by humans.A third of people think that it is likely that AI will be able to replicate human-like consciousness and feel emotions akin to human beings.Nearly a third of people are concerned that advances in AI will lead to a loss of human interaction, and a similar proportion think it will lead to a loss of human control. A quarter think it will fuel hacking and other security breaches, while 19 per cent fear increases in privacy breaches and data misuse.Just 12 per cent are concerned about a lack of proper laws and regulations to govern AI technology, while 10 per cent are worried that increasing reliance on AI will fuel bias and discrimination.The public are equally divided about recent advances in AI, with a net of 33 per cent seeing them as positive, 30 per cent negative and 31 per cent taking a neutral stance.More than half, or 52 per cent, of 18 to 24-year-olds view recent advances as positive, while just 15 per cent are negative about the rapid progress in the technology.Read NextPoliticsRishi Sunak to press Joe Biden for UK lead on international rules for artificial intelligenceRead MoreLess than  a third of people say they have used the ChatGPT chatbot or a similar AI-assisted language application, while 65 per cent have not yet used one. Of those who have tried it, 76 per cent found it useful, while 23 per cent said it was not useful.Robert Struthers, head of polling for BMG, said: “While there is growing public fascination with AI’s capabilities and potential benefits, there is also a lingering sense of unease. “Launched only six months ago, around 3 in 10 Britons already use chat GPT or similar technologies. And for those that did, the experience  has been positive; as many as three-quarters say they found the technology useful.“However, with almost as many feeling negatively about advancements in AI as feeling positive about it, some have reservations. Yes, people recognise AI’s potential to improve efficiency and simplify tasks but also harbour concerns about its consequences.”
AI ‘a major national risk’ says UK terror watchdog
Britain’s terrorism watchdog has warned that artificial intelligence pose a major national security risk.
Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said the technology could be used by extremists to groom vulnerable individuals.
He cited a potential risk around the increasing popularity of chatbots, which he suggested could  be used to persuade vulnerable people to launch terror attacks, and that the technology needed to be designed with this in mind.
Mr Hall told The Observer that AI creators had to abandon their “tech utopian” mindset, adding: “They need to have some horrible little 15-year-old neo-Nazi in the room with them, working out what they might do. You’ve got to hardwire the defences against what you know people will do with it.
“What worries me is the suggestibility of humans when immersed in this world. Use of language, in the context of national security, matters because ultimately language persuades  people to do things.”
He called for greater transparency from AI firms who were operating chat bots. He added: “We need absolute clarity about how many people are working on these things and their moderation.
“How many are actually involved when they say they’ve got guardrails in place? …If you’ve got a two-man company, how much time are they devoting to public safety? Probably little or nothing.”
The security services are also concerned about the misuse of AI chatbots for terrorism purposes, particularly among the young, the newspaper reported.

            Avery Ingram (AI), reportedly the UK's first AI employee and the world's first AI software developer, is now available for hire. 
        

Avery is an autonomous AI tool developed by software company February to assist existing software development teams by making their tasks easier, checking code and clearing any backlogs. 
Avery has been fully personified as an employee with a ChatGPT generated CV, an AI-drawn portrait and even a LinkedIn account.

She is available for hire by software development companies and is able to follow a traditional recruitment process. 
Speaking to HR magazine, February CEO Ash Lewis said: “We have a technical interview process, just like with a regular human employee.  
“Avery currently is completing four of these technical interviews per day and there are 2,000 businesses on our waiting list.” 
The bot’s contract is similar to an employment contract too and includes notice periods. 
She has already been appointed to generative AI software support roles as a senior full-stack developer in the development teams at Graze, Propello Cloud, Fabspot and Encode Health, and is currently working on 180 projects. 
Avery’s efficiency is unmatched by her human counterparts as she can handle more than 20 tickets a day compared with three for humans. 
Companies pay the equivalent of Living Wage to use Avery. 
The speed at which she works means that she can deliver the equivalent of a week’s work of a human for 10% of the cost. 
However, Lewis said that Avery does not create concerns for the job security of human employees. 
He said: “We've created Avery to work alongside a team of humans, and our clients so far are reporting that their work is more satisfying and they're having to deal with fewer repetitive tasks now that they're aided by an AI team member.” 
Lewis argued that AI tools should be viewed as a way to improve current roles by limiting repetitive tasks. 
He added: “Ultimately it's likely that with companies becoming so much more efficient thanks to AI tools and human employees will eventually be able to focus on more creative and less repetitive work.” 
Cassandra Hoermann, head of employer brand and experience at HR software company Personio, said AI will never replace human capabilities entirely. 
Speaking to HR magazine, she said: “It’s clear AI has a role to play in the workplace going forward and it is certainly a topic that’s generating a lot of debate and headlines.  
“But, while AI employees are a novel idea, they’re unlikely to take over the workforce soon. There is simply too much that humans can do that AI still can’t.  
“An organisation’s people are still, and likely always will be, its most important asset.” 
However, Simon Jones, founder of HR consultancy Ariadne Associates, said AI innovation is likely to result in some redundancies. 
In March, investment banking firm Goldman Sachs predicted 300 million jobs will be lost or degraded by AI. 
Speaking to HR magazine, Jones said: “In a sense, it’s not dissimilar to the situation in the 1980s/90s when a lot of factory jobs that could be done faster by robots disappeared. AI might also lead to justifiable and legal redundancies in certain areas. 
“But whether a task is undertaken by AI or a human, businesses will still need to maintain existing standards such as liability for decisions, meeting legal requirements, or expectations of ethical behaviour.” 
According to a survey from trade union Prospect released this week, the majority (58%) of people would like to see the UK government regulate the use of generative AI technologies in the workplace to help safeguard jobs. 
With the stakes around AI so high, Gosia Adamczyk, director of HR at 'advertising technology company Verve Group, said HR should prioritise communication when rolling out new AI systems. 
Speaking to HR magazine, she said: “What HR should continue doing is build an understanding among employees that AI helps them become more efficient, allowing them to focus on more strategic topics.  
“Employees usually value automation and are glad to see investments that take the burden of repetitive tasks.  
“HR professionals must focus the narrative on this approach and ensure communication is concise.”

In April, she was let go without explanation, but when she found managers writing about how using ChatGPT was cheaper than paying a writer, the reason for her layoff seemed clear.“Whenever people brought up ChatGPT, I felt insecure and anxious that it would replace me,” she said. “Now I actually had proof that it was true, that those anxieties were warranted and now I was actually out of a job because of AI.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSkip to end of carouselUnderstanding AIarrow leftarrow rightWhat is artificial intelligence?AI is an umbrella term for any form of technology that can perform “intelligent” tasks. For decades, AI has been mostly used for analysis — trawling huge sets of data to find patterns. But a boom in generative AI, which uses this pattern-matching to create words, images and sounds, has opened up new possibilities.What is generative AI?The technology backs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators, such as Dall-E, which can create words, sounds, images and video, sometimes at a level of sophistication that mimics human creativity. This technology can’t “think” like humans do; it can find patterns and imitate speech, but it can’t interpret meanings.How does AI learn?AI can “learn” without programmer to tell it each step, a process called machine learning. It uses neural networks, mathematical systems modeled after the human brain, to find connections in huge data sets. The poems or images it makes may seem creative, but it’s really pattern matching based on which word is most likely to come next.Is AI dangerous?The boom in generative AI brings many exciting possibilities — but also concerns that it might cause harm. Chatbots can sometimes spread misinformation or “hallucinate” by producing information that sounds plausible, but is irrelevant, nonsensical or entirely false. It can be used to make fake images of real people, called deepfakes.1/4End of carouselSome economists predict artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT could replace hundreds of millions of jobs, in a cataclysmic reorganization of the workforce mirroring the industrial revolution.💻Follow TechnologyFollowFor some workers, this impact is already here. Those who write marketing and social media content are in the first wave of people being replaced with tools such as chatbots, which are seemingly able to produce plausible alternatives to their work.Experts say that even advanced AI doesn’t match the writing skills of a human: It lacks personal voice and style, and it often churns out wrong, nonsensical or biased answers. But for many companies, the cost-cutting is worth a drop in quality.“We’re really in a crisis point,” said Sarah T. Roberts, an associate professor at the University of California in Los Angeles specializing in digital labor. “[AI] is coming for the jobs that were supposed to be automation-proof.”See why AI like ChatGPT has gotten so good, so fastArtificial intelligence has rapidly increased in quality over the past year, giving rise to chatbots that can hold fluid conversations, write songs and produce computer code. In a rush to mainstream the technology, Silicon Valley companies are pushing these products to millions of users and — for now — often offering them free.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAI and algorithms have been a part of the working world for decades. For years, consumer-product companies, grocery stores and warehouse logistics firms have used predictive algorithms and robots with AI-fueled vision systems to help make business decisions, automate some rote tasks and manage inventory. Industrial plants and factories have been dominated by robots for much of the 20th century, and countless office tasks have been replaced by software.But the recent wave of generative artificial intelligence — which uses complex algorithms trained on billions of words and images from the open internet to produce text, images and audio — has the potential for a new stage of disruption. The technology’s ability to churn out human-sounding prose puts highly paid knowledge workers in the crosshairs for replacement, experts said.Reporter Danielle Abril tests columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler to see if he can tell the difference between an email written by her or ChatGPT. (Video: Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)“In every previous automation threat, the automation was about automating the hard, dirty, repetitive jobs,” said Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “This time, the automation threat is aimed squarely at the highest-earning, most creative jobs that … require the most educational background.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn March, Goldman Sachs predicted that 18 percent of work worldwide could be automated by AI, with white-collar workers such as lawyers at more risk than those in trades such as construction or maintenance. “Occupations for which a significant share of workers’ time is spent outdoors or performing physical labor cannot be automated by AI,” the report said.The White House also sounded the alarm, saying in a December report that “AI has the potential to automate ‘nonroutine’ tasks, exposing large new swaths of the workforce to potential disruption.”ChatGPT ""hallucinates."" Some researchers worry it isn’t fixable.But Mollick said it’s too early to gauge how disruptive AI will be to the workforce. He noted that jobs such as copywriting, document translation and transcription, and paralegal work are particularly at risk, because they include tasks that are easily done by chatbots. High-level legal analysis, creative writing or art may not be as easily replaceable, he said, because humans still outperform AI in those areas.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Think of AI as generally acting as a high-end intern,” he said. “Jobs that are mostly designed as entry-level jobs to break you into a field where you do something kind of useful, but it’s also sort of a steppingstone to the next level — those are the kinds of jobs under threat.”Eric Fein ran his content-writing business for 10 years, charging $60 an hour to write everything from 150-word descriptions of bath mats to website copy for cannabis companies. The 34-year-old from Bloomingdale, Ill., built a steady business with 10 ongoing contracts, which made up half of his annual income and provided a comfortable life for his wife and 2-year-old son.But in March, Fein received a note from his largest client: His services would no longer be needed because the company would be transitioning to ChatGPT. One by one, Fein’s nine other contracts were canceled for the same reason. His entire copywriting business was gone nearly overnight.“It wiped me out,” Fein said. He urged his clients to reconsider, warning that ChatGPT couldn’t write content with his level of creativity, technical precision and originality. He said his clients understood that, but they told him it was far cheaper to use ChatGPT than to pay him his hourly wage.Fein was rehired by one of his clients, who wasn’t pleased with ChatGPT’s work. But it isn’t enough to sustain him and his family, who have a little over six months of financial runway before they run out of money.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNow, Fein has decided to pursue a job that AI can’t do, and he has enrolled in courses to become an HVAC technician. Next year, he plans to train to become a plumber.“A trade is more future-proof,” he said.The debate over whether AI will destroy us is dividing Silicon ValleyCompanies that replaced workers with chatbots have faced high-profile stumbles. When the technology news site CNET used artificial intelligence to write articles, the results were riddled with errors and resulted in lengthy corrections. A lawyer who relied on ChatGPT for a legal brief cited numerous fictitious cases. And the National Eating Disorders Association, which laid off people staffing its helpline and reportedly replaced them with a chatbot, suspended its use of the technology after it doled out insensitive and harmful advice.Story continues below advertisementRoberts said that chatbots can produce costly errors and that companies rushing to incorporate ChatGPT into operations are “jumping the gun.” Because they work by predicting the most statistically likely word in a sentence, they churn out average content by design. That provides companies with a tough decision, she said: quality vs. cost.Advertisement“We have to ask: Is a facsimile good enough? Is imitation good enough? Is that all we care about?” she said. “We’re going to lower the measure of quality, and to what end? So the company owners and shareholders can take a bigger piece of the pie?”Lipkin, the copywriter who discovered she’d been replaced by ChatGPT, is reconsidering office work altogether. She initially got into content marketing so that she could support herself while she pursued her own creative writing. But she found the job burned her out and made it hard to write for herself. Now, she’s starting a job as a dog walker.“I’m totally taking a break from the office world,” Lipkin said. “People are looking for the cheapest solution, and that’s not a person — that’s a robot.”Share2483 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
However, even as a majority of marketers see generative AI as transformative to their role, many have also raised concerns about the quality and accuracy of generative AI outputs and the lack of skills needed to get the most out of these tools.
Nearly 75% say ‘yes’ to generative AI
Out of the 1,029 full-time marketers surveyed, 51% said they are already in the process of using or experimenting with generative AI at work, while 22% said they plan to bring it into their workforce very soon. The general benefits, most of them said, would be eliminating gruntwork, allowing more time to focus on strategic work and increasing productivity.
Among those using generative AI at present, the most popular use case is basic content creation and writing marketing copy, with as many as 76% handling those tasks with LLM-driven apps like ChatGPT. The next popular use cases are inspiring creative thinking (71%), analyzing market data (63%) and generating image assets (62%). 
More broadly, the surveyed marketers suggested that generative AI is expected to help with multiple tasks in their job, starting from creating groups for marketing campaigns and producing those campaigns and journey plans, and progressing to personalizing content, conducting copy testing, and building and optimizing SEO strategy.
“Generative AI has the potential to transform how marketers connect with their customers by powering more personalized, automated and effective campaigns — quickly and at scale,” Stephen Hammond, EVP and GM for marketing cloud at Salesforce, said in a statement.
It can also help with analyzing campaign performance data, 58% of the respondents said.
Yet concerns remain
While the general consensus remained that generative AI is or will be transforming marketing hustles, the survey respondents also highlighted certain roadblocks that can easily hinder the technology’s adoption in their field.

The top concernsadvertisement
The biggest challenge, the marketers said, is the accuracy and quality of generative AI tools’ output, with 73% noting that the technology lacks human-specific creativity and contextual knowledge and 66% worrying that its results can be biased. Beyond this, many suggested they feel underprepared to make the most of the technology in their workflows.
Forty-three percent of respondents said they don’t know how to get the most value out of generative AI, while more than a third said they do not know how to use the technology safely (39%) and effectively (34%). This highlights a major gap that can often lead to data leak blunders, much like what happened at Samsung.
To address these problems and successfully use generative AI in their roles, the marketers called for three key improvements: human oversight (66%), the use of trusted customer data for the models (63%), and adequate training (54%) to leverage the said models in the workflow.
The human oversight and trusted data will ensure on-point, use case-specific outputs, while training will ensure marketers are getting maximum value from the tools without compromising on security or efficiency.

Used responsibly, he believes it could free us from drudgery and help businesses of all shapes and sizes raise their game. Thousands of Sage customers are already benefiting from using AI services, and the tech giant aims to become a leader in this fast growing space. “We must see AI as something that can elevate the work of every human,’’ he said.  “Every single customer I speak to tells me how difficult it can be to hire staff, particularly to do repetitive tasks. ""People want to add value right from the start of their careers,’’ he said. “The birth rate is declining and you have an aging population. I see a big opportunity for AI to transform lots of repetitive tasks and make us all more productive. It will allow us to elevate the work of craftsmen who have real skills. What's important is that we retain the ability to question what is presented to us by AI. It's important that we as humans make the final decisions.” Mr Hare believes his grounded approach to corporate life can be traced back to his childhood in Withernsea, the seaside resort in the East Riding of Yorkshire. “I have travelled around the world but I believe my Yorkshire background keeps my feet on the ground,’’ he said. “In Yorkshire, it's important to be humble and knuckle down and get things done."" This fierce work ethic helped Mr Hare become one of the FTSE 100’s youngest ever chief financial officers. He took on leading financial  roles at three other listed UK companies before moving on to  a senior operational role in private equity. He believes his experience as an accountant gives him the edge as Sage's CEO. He  wants technology to be the  servant of accountants and entrepreneurs who must keep their eye on the balance sheet.  The company he leads, Sage, was started by businessman David Goldman, with support from a team of Newcastle University students, in the early 1980s. It now reaches millions of customers across 21 countries. It employs  3,200 staff across the UK and Ireland with around  2,000 of these based in the global HQ in Cobalt in Newcastle. Mr Hare believes businesses must embrace the digital revolution.    ""Digital does remove friction,’’ he said. “ I was chatting to an electrician recently and I explained to him that if, for example, he uses an app on his phone bills could potentially be paid in hours, instead of a paper-based process where it could all go on for weeks. ""The Government is pushing towards getting more and more transactions done digitally. Artificial intelligence could make payment flow seamless, so it frees up SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises)  to run their business. Time is the most precious thing for small businesses and our mission is to knock down barriers and get rid of friction. The Government can help by treating investment in technology like an investment in capital and infrastructure.” There have been long-standing concerns about the need to boost the UK’s productivity. “The best way to tackle this is to make the UK the best place to set up and run a business and technology can play a leading role in this,’’ said Mr Hare.   ""Technology, for example, can help retailers do a much better job of cash flow forecasting. A lot of businesses still do their accounts manually.   With technology, you don't need to write up your books, you can capture each transaction as it happens. ""The same process can apply to payroll. If people have a mobile workforce and expenses all these things can be brought into a digital environment.  "" Instead of handing your accountant a shoebox of invoices, technology can remove friction from the process and people can make much better decisions. It's important to be very thoughtful about all your stakeholders.  Small and medium-sized businesses are integrated into the local community and it's really important to be seen to embrace them.”  Since the launch of its apprenticeship scheme in 2012, Sage has taken on around 400 apprentices and Mr Hare believes the UK needs to be  more supportive of young people from a wide variety of backgrounds who have chosen a different path to going to university. Last year, Sage invested £1.4m in developing the skills of young people across the North of England by  working with the Institute of Engineering and Technology, the Newcastle United Foundation and the National Innovation Centre for Data. Sage’s investment is also focused on rethinking the role of education, particularly around the teaching of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects. Investment in STEM can drive long-term economic growth, while helping young people into sustainable careers, according to Sage.   ""One of the worst problems facing Britain is digital inequality,’’ said Mr Hare. “We should aspire to everyone having access to superfast broadband. Between six and seven per cent of the population don't have access to superfast broadband, that's around 2m people. ""We wouldn't tolerate 2m people not having access to adequate healthcare. Although we are a commercial business, first and foremost, we believe that everyone thrives when we create greater equality and inclusion. It can be easier to set up a business than people think. People often overestimate how much access to capital they need to get started. You can often get a business started for as little as £1,000. You can start start small and experiment initially. People often talk about the lack of UK technology success stories. We are very much a sustainable, global UK success story, with 40 per cent of our revenue in the US. We take great pride in that.""",PT139S,2019-07-16T12:50:37.000Z,https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x7df8zp,https://www.dailymotion.com/crawler/video/x7df8zp,https://schema.org/ItemListOrderDescending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ChatGPT Revolution | CBS Reports
22:38

For those wondering when AI will start replacing human jobs, the answer is it already has.Artificial intelligence contributed to nearly 4,000 job losses last month, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, as interest in the rapidly evolving technology's ability to perform advanced organizational tasks and lighten workloads has intensified. The report released Thursday by the outplacement firm shows that layoff announcements from U.S.-based employers reached more than 80,000 in May — a 20% jump from the prior month and nearly four times the level for the same month last year. Of those cuts, AI was responsible for 3,900, or roughly 5% of all jobs lost, making it the seventh-highest contributor to employment losses in May cited by employers. 






The job cuts come as businesses waste no time adopting advanced AI technology to automate a range of tasks — including creative work, such as writing, as well as administrative and clerical work. The AI industry is expected to grow to more than $1 trillion fueled by major technological advancements that became apparent last fall with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT bot, a report by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts shows. These jobs are most likely to be replaced by chatbots like ChatGPTChatGPT bot passes law school examThis is the first time AI was included on the Challenger report, but not the first time the rapidly advancing technology has made headlines for replacing humans.


ChatGPT enters the newsroomThe Washington Post reported this week on two copywriters who lost their livelihoods because employers (or clients) decided that ChatGPT could perform the job at a cheaper price. Media companies such as CNET have already laid off reporters while using AI to write articles, which later had to be corrected for plagiarism. Earlier this year, an eating disorder helpline used a chatbot to replace human staff members who had unionized. It recently had to pull the plug on the bot after it gave people problematic dieting advice.In March, investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted in a report that AI could eventually replace 300 million full-time jobs globally and affect nearly one-fifth of employment — with a particular hit to white-collar jobs often considered automation-proof, such as administrative and legal professions.AI is also a concern in the TV and entertainment writers' strike that began in May, with writers demanding better pay and job security in addition to a near-total ban on the use of AI to produce written entertainment content.But analysts note that as with previous technology that has replaced human workers, generative AI is already creating new jobs, and the burgeoning industry is just getting started.


""Generative AI is expected to become a monster employment generator because of estimates of a mushrooming $1.3 trillion AI market that will boost sales and ad spending for the Tech industry,"" Ben Emons, a principal at NewEdge Wealth, said Friday in a note.

Transparency in AI refers to the ability to peer into the workings of an AI model and understand how it reaches its decisions. There are many facets of AI transparency, including the set of tools and practices used to understand the model, the data it is trained on, the process of categorizing the types and frequency of errors and biases, and the ways of communicating these issues to developers and users.







The multiple facets of AI transparency have come to the forefront as machine learning models have evolved. A big concern is that more powerful or efficient models are harder -- if not impossible -- to understand since the inner workings are buried in a so-called black box.
""Basically, humans find it hard to trust a black box -- and understandably so,"" said Donncha Carroll, partner and chief data scientist at business transformation advisory firm Lotis Blue Consulting. ""AI has a spotty record on delivering unbiased decisions or outputs.""

What is AI transparency?
Like any data-driven tool, AI algorithms depend on the quality of data used to train the AI model. Therefore, they are subject to bias or have some inherent risk associated with their use. Transparency is therefore essential to securing trust from the user, influencers or those influenced by the decision.

""AI transparency is about clearly explaining the reasoning behind the output, making the decision-making process accessible and comprehensible,"" said Adnan Masood, chief AI architect at UST, a digital transformation consultancy. ""At the end of the day, it's about eliminating the black box mystery of AI and providing insight into the how and why of AI decision-making.""
Trust, auditability, compliance and understanding potential biases are some of the fundamental reasons why transparency is becoming a requirement in the field of AI. ""Without transparency, we risk creating AI systems that could inadvertently perpetuate harmful biases, make inscrutable decisions or even lead to undesirable outcomes in high-risk applications,"" Masood said.


Working with explainability and interpretability
AI transparency works hand in hand with related concepts like AI explainability and interpretability, but they are not the same.
AI transparency helps ensure that all stakeholders can clearly understand the workings of an AI system, including how it makes decisions and processes data. ""Having this clarity is what builds trust in AI, particularly in high-risk applications,"" Masood said.
By contrast, explainability focuses on providing understandable reasons for the decisions made by an AI system. Interpretability refers to the predictability of a model's outputs based on its inputs. So, while explainability and interpretability are crucial in achieving AI transparency, they alone don't wholly encompass it.
AI transparency also involves being open about data handling, the model's limitations, potential biases and the context of its usage.
Ilana Golbin Blumenfeld, responsible AI lead at PwC, noted that process transparency and data and system transparency can complement interpretability and explainability.
Process transparency entails providing documentation and logging of significant decisions made throughout the development and implementation of a system. And it includes the structure of governance and testing practices.
Data and system transparency entails communicating to users or relevant parties that an AI or automated system will use their data. It also alerts users when they directly engage with an AI like a chatbot.








Why is AI transparency needed?
AI transparency, as noted, is vital to fostering trust between AI systems and users. Manojkumar Parmar, CEO and CTO at AIShield, an AI security platform, said some of the top benefits of AI transparency include the following:

Builds trust with customers and employees.
Ensures fair and ethical AI systems.
Detects and addresses potential data biases.
Enhances the accuracy and performance of AI systems.
Ensures compliance with new AI regulations like the EU AI Act.



Tradeoffs of black box AI
AI is typically measured in percentages of accuracy -- i.e., to what degree the system gives correct answers. Depending on the task at hand, the minimum accuracy required might vary, but accuracy, even if it is 99%, cannot be the only measure of AI's value. Organizations must also account for a major shortcoming of AI, especially when applying AI in business: An AI model with near-perfect accuracy can be problematic. As the accuracy of the model goes up, AI's ability to explain why it arrived at a certain answer goes down, raising an issue companies must confront: the lack of AI transparency of the model and, therefore, our human capacity to trust its results.
The black box problem was acceptable to some degree in the early days of AI technology, but lost its merit when algorithmic bias was spotted. For example, AI that was developed to sort resumes disqualified people for certain jobs based on their race, and AI used in banking disqualified loan applicants based on their gender. The data the AI was trained on was not balanced to include sufficient data of all kinds of people, and the historical bias that lived in the human decisions was passed to the models.
A near-perfect AI model can still make alarming mistakes, such as classifying a stop sign as a speed limit sign.
While these are some of the more extreme cases of misclassification -- and include some purposely designed adversarial inputs to fool the AI model -- they still underline the fact that the algorithm has no clue or understanding of what it is doing. AI follows a pattern to arrive at the answer, and the magic is that it does so exceptionally well, beyond human power. For the same reason, unusual alterations in the pattern make the model vulnerable, and that's why AI transparency is needed -- to know how AI reaches a conclusion.
When using AI for critical decisions, understanding the algorithm's reasoning is imperative. An AI model designed to detect cancer, even if it is only 1% wrong, could threaten a life. In cases like these, AI and humans need to work together, and the task becomes much easier when the AI model can explain how it reached a certain decision. Transparency in AI makes it a team player.
Sometimes, transparency is necessary from a legal perspective.
""Some of the regulated industries, like banks, have model explainability as a necessary step to get compliance and legal approval before the model can go into production,"" said Piyanka Jain, president and CEO at data science consultancy Aryng.
Other cases involve GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act, where AI deals with private information. ""An aspect of GDPR is that, when an algorithm using an individual's private data makes a decision, the human has the right to ask for the reasons behind that decision,"" said Carolina Bessega, innovation lead, Office of the CTO at Extreme Networks.


Weaknesses of AI transparency
As it seems evident that AI transparency has many benefits, why aren't all algorithms transparent? Because AI has the following fundamental weaknesses:

Vulnerable to hacking. Transparent AI models are more susceptible to hacks, as threat actors have more information on their inner workings and can locate vulnerabilities. To mitigate these challenges, developers must build their AI models with security top of mind and test their systems.
Can expose proprietary algorithms. Another concern with AI transparency is protection of proprietary algorithms, as researchers have demonstrated that entire algorithms can be stolen simply by looking at their explanations.
Difficult to design. Lastly, transparent algorithms are harder to design, in particular for complex models with millions of parameters. In cases where transparency in AI is a must, it might be necessary to use less sophisticated algorithms.
Governance challenges. Another fundamental weakness is assuming any transparency method out of the box will satisfy all needs from a governance perspective, Blumenfeld cautioned. ""We need to consider what we require for our systems to be trusted, in context, and then design systems with transparency mechanisms to do so,"" she explained. For example, it's tempting to focus on technical methods of transparency to enforce interpretability and explainability. But these models might still rely on users to identify biased and inaccurate information. If an AI chatbot cites a source, it's still up to the human to determine whether the source is valid. This takes time and energy and leaves room for error.
Lack of standardized methods to assess transparency. Another issue is that not all transparency methods are reliable. They may generate different results each time they are performed. This lack of reliability and repeatability might reduce trust in the system and hinder transparency efforts.


As AI models continuously learn and adapt to new data, they must be monitored and evaluated to maintain transparency and ensure that AI systems remain trustworthy and aligned with intended outcomes.



AI transparency can bring companies many benefits, but it is hard to achieve -- and there are tradeoffs.







How to reach a balance
As with any other computer program, AI needs optimization. To do that, we look at the specific needs of a problem and then tune our general model to fit those needs best.
When implementing AI, an organization must pay attention to the following four factors:

Legal needs. If the work requires explainability from a legal and regulatory perspective, there may be no choice but to provide transparency. To reach that, an organization might have to resort to simpler but explainable algorithms.
Severity. If the AI is used in life-critical missions, transparency is a must. It is most likely that such tasks are not dependent on AI alone, so having a reasoning mechanism improves teamwork with human operators. The same applies if AI affects someone's life, such as algorithms used for job applications. On the other hand, if the AI task is not critical, an opaque model would suffice. Consider an algorithm that recommends the next prospect to contact come from a database of thousands of leads -- cross-checking the AI's decision would simply not be worth the time.
Exposure. Depending on who has access to the AI model, an organization might want to protect the algorithm from unwanted reach. Explainability can be good even in the cybersecurity space if it helps experts reach a better conclusion. But if outsiders can gain access to the same source and understand how the algorithm works, it might be better to go with opaque models.
Data set. No matter the circumstances, an organization must always strive to have a diverse and balanced data set, preferably from as many sources as possible. AI is only as smart as the data it is trained on. By cleaning the training data, removing noise and balancing the inputs, we can help to reduce bias and improve the model's accuracy.



Best practices for implementing AI transparency
Implementing AI transparency -- including finding a balance between competing organizational aims -- requires ongoing collaboration and learning between leaders and employees. It calls for a clear understanding of the requirements of a system from a business, user and technical point of view. Blumenfeld said that by providing training to boost AI literacy, organizations can prepare employees to actively contribute to identifying flawed responses or behaviors in AI systems.
The tendency in AI development is to focus on features, utility and novelty, rather than safety, reliability, robustness and potential harm, Masood said. He recommends prioritizing transparency from the inception of the AI project. It's helpful to create datasheets for data sets and model cards for models, implement rigorous auditing mechanisms and continuously study the potential harm of models.


Key use cases for AI transparency
AI transparency has many facets, so teams must identify and examine each of the potential issues standing in the way of transparency. Parmar finds it helpful to consider the following use cases:

Data transparency. This encompasses understanding the data feeding AI systems, a crucial step in identifying potential biases.
Development transparency. This involves illuminating the conditions and processes in AI model creation.
Model transparency. This reveals how AI systems function, possibly by explaining decision-making processes or by making the algorithms open source.
Security transparency. This assesses the AI system's security during development and deployment.
Impact transparency. This evaluates the effect of AI systems, which is achieved by tracking system usage and monitoring results.



The future of AI transparency
AI transparency is a work in progress as the industry discovers new problems and better processes to mitigate them.
""As artificial intelligence adoption and innovation continues its surge, we'll see greater AI transparency, especially in the enterprise,"" Blumenfeld predicted. But the approaches to AI transparency will vary depending on the needs of a given industry or organization.
Carroll predicts that insurance premiums in domains where AI risk is material could also shape the adoption of AI transparency efforts. These will be based on an organization's overall system risk and evidence that best practices have been applied in model deployment.
Masood believes regulatory frameworks likely will play a vital role in the adoption of AI transparency. For example, the EU AI Act highlights transparency as a critical aspect. This is indicative of the shift toward more transparency in AI systems to build trust, facilitate accountability and ensure responsible deployment.
""For professionals like myself, and the overall industry in general, the journey toward full AI transparency is a challenging one, with its share of obstacles and complications,"" Masood said. ""However, through the collective efforts of practitioners, researchers, policymakers and society at large, I'm optimistic that we can overcome these challenges and build AI systems that are not just powerful, but also responsible, accountable and, most importantly, trustworthy.""

‘The last frontier of disruption’: With its new AI chatbot, EY teams seek to take the pain out of payroll questions

An employee in Hungary asked if having twins would impact his parental leave. A worker in Spain wondered whether the bonus of $20,000 euros she received would be taxed. Another employee asked what requirements he would have to abide by if he went to work in a United Arab Emirates country as a foreign national.
Those queries, received by clients of multinational professional services organization EY, underscore the complexity organizations worldwide face in trying to answer employees’ payroll questions. To address that challenge, the EY organization (previously named Ernst & Young) worked with Microsoft to create a generative AI chatbot that will be developed to answer payroll questions from employees across the 159 countries and 49 languages that EY clients encompass.
The chatbot, which leverages the Microsoft Cloud and ChatGPT in Azure OpenAI Service, uses a large language model (LLM) that analyzes information from pay slips, tax regulations and employer policies to provide answers to complex payroll questions — with the goal of increasing employee satisfaction and reducing costs for employers.
Sheri Sullivan.
“Payroll touches employees more than any other function,” says Sheri Sullivan, EY global payroll operate leader. “Employees around the globe currently have a very poor experience when it comes to getting answers to their payroll questions. And employers struggle with that.”
Research has shown that employee attraction and retention are directly proportional to workers’ experiences on the job, Sullivan says. And pay is central to that, she says — not only the amount, but also employees’ perception that they are being paid fairly and understand payroll policies.
Payroll issues are complicated by myriad factors ranging from tax regulations that vary between countries and even local municipalities to employer policies and individual circumstances. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those complexities, Sullivan says, with the growth of remote work and its resulting impacts on payroll. 
Organizations have traditionally handled payroll queries in several ways — through a designated individual, basic chatbots that can usually handle only rudimentary questions, traditional call centers, or in some cases, not at all, Sullivan says. The result is often an inefficient and costly system that leads to frustration for employees, who may simply give up before getting answers to their questions.
“Payroll is really, I like to say, the last frontier of disruption,” Sullivan says. “There’s been lots of investment in human capital management systems and finance systems and other back systems. But with payroll, there’s been limited investment for the past 20 years, because the technology hasn’t had the capabilities to deal with all the deviations and complexities within payroll.”

That’s changing with the emergence of generative AI capabilities. EY teams have been working closely with Microsoft for several years to help EY’s clients implement cloud-based solutions across various sectors. Addressing payroll questions has long been a challenge for EY member firms, Sullivan says, and as Microsoft moved to make ChatGPT available in Azure OpenAI Service in March 2023, EY teams saw an opportunity to address the issue.
EY teams began developing a proof of concept for the organization’s chatbot, uploading data from a range of sources into the bot and asking its payroll consultants in various countries to share questions employees had recently asked, then using that information to train its model.
“That is really at the heart of our IP,” says Ken Priyadarshi, EY global tax prompt engineering leader. “It’s going inside the heads of our practitioners and asking, ‘What are some of the really interesting ways clients might ask payroll questions that require a little bit more reasoning and thinking?’”
Ken Priyadarshi.
Azure OpenAI Service allows customers to run the same models as OpenAI, but with Azure’s security protocols. That will enable EY teams to deploy the chatbot across countries and regulatory environments, Priyadarshi says.
“For us, the differentiator was not only security but also tooling to work in a user-friendly, fast way,” he says. “Our developers were able to use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service capabilities to build what I would call a private ChatGPT for payroll in collaboration with Microsoft very quickly.”
In internal testing, Sullivan says, the chatbot quickly answered questions in over 27 languages. EY teams are currently piloting the chatbot with clients to gauge employee satisfaction, cost to employers and the bot’s ability to accurately address questions in a single interaction. EY teams anticipate that the technology will be able to answer more than 80% of payroll questions and save employers over half the current costs of addressing those queries.
“There is interest from clients in the largest countries to be part of this pilot,” Sullivan says. “The interest is through the roof, because this is such a pain point for them.”
EY professionals and the organization’s clients are also excited when they see what the bot can do, Sullivan says. While some professionals are cautious about the technology or concerned about its possible impact on their jobs, she says the bot won’t replace them but instead free them up to review data, trends and outcomes, and make recommendations, “instead of doing the manual work to compile and process the data.”
Priyadarshi sees the promise of generative AI chatbots in what he terms “intelligent co-sourcing” — merging deep subject matter experience with large language models to provide information in a human, conversational way. 
“We can train an LLM using a practice’s knowledge, and then help surface deep insights, and also support knowledge discovery using bots and copilots,” he says. “And that’s, I think, the future of this capability, not just for payroll, but for all kinds of knowledge worker practices.”

The 15 Biggest Risks Of Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

AI does present some significant dangers — from job displacement to security and privacy concerns — and encouraging awareness of issues helps us engage in conversations about AI's legal, ethical, and societal implications.

Here are the biggest risks of artificial intelligence:

1. Lack of Transparency
PROMOTED
Lack of transparency in AI systems, particularly in deep learning models that can be complex and difficult to interpret, is a pressing issue. This opaqueness obscures the decision-making processes and underlying logic of these technologies.

When people can’t comprehend how an AI system arrives at its conclusions, it can lead to distrust and resistance to adopting these technologies.

2. Bias and Discrimination
AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify societal biases due to biased training data or algorithmic design. To minimize discrimination and ensure fairness, it is crucial to invest in the development of unbiased algorithms and diverse training data sets.

3. Privacy Concerns
AI technologies often collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, raising issues related to data privacy and security. To mitigate privacy risks, we must advocate for strict data protection regulations and safe data handling practices.

4. Ethical Dilemmas
Instilling moral and ethical values in AI systems, especially in decision-making contexts with significant consequences, presents a considerable challenge. Researchers and developers must prioritize the ethical implications of AI technologies to avoid negative societal impacts.
5. Security Risks
As AI technologies become increasingly sophisticated, the security risks associated with their use and the potential for misuse also increase. Hackers and malicious actors can harness the power of AI to develop more advanced cyberattacks, bypass security measures, and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
The rise of AI-driven autonomous weaponry also raises concerns about the dangers of rogue states or non-state actors using this technology — especially when we consider the potential loss of human control in critical decision-making processes. To mitigate these security risks, governments and organizations need to develop best practices for secure AI development and deployment and foster international cooperation to establish global norms and regulations that protect against AI security threats.
6. Concentration of Power
The risk of AI development being dominated by a small number of large corporations and governments could exacerbate inequality and limit diversity in AI applications. Encouraging decentralized and collaborative AI development is key to avoiding a concentration of power.
7. Dependence on AI
Overreliance on AI systems may lead to a loss of creativity, critical thinking skills, and human intuition. Striking a balance between AI-assisted decision-making and human input is vital to preserving our cognitive abilities.
8. Job Displacement
AI-driven automation has the potential to lead to job losses across various industries, particularly for low-skilled workers (although there is evidence that AI and other emerging technologies will create more jobs than it eliminates).
As AI technologies continue to develop and become more efficient, the workforce must adapt and acquire new skills to remain relevant in the changing landscape. This is especially true for lower-skilled workers in the current labor force.
9. Economic Inequality
AI has the potential to contribute to economic inequality by disproportionally benefiting wealthy individuals and corporations. As we talked about above, job losses due to AI-driven automation are more likely to affect low-skilled workers, leading to a growing income gap and reduced opportunities for social mobility.
The concentration of AI development and ownership within a small number of large corporations and governments can exacerbate this inequality as they accumulate wealth and power while smaller businesses struggle to compete. Policies and initiatives that promote economic equity—like reskilling programs, social safety nets, and inclusive AI development that ensures a more balanced distribution of opportunities — can help combat economic inequality.
10. Legal and Regulatory Challenges
It’s crucial to develop new legal frameworks and regulations to address the unique issues arising from AI technologies, including liability and intellectual property rights. Legal systems must evolve to keep pace with technological advancements and protect the rights of everyone.
11. AI Arms Race
The risk of countries engaging in an AI arms race could lead to the rapid development of AI technologies with potentially harmful consequences.
Recently, more than a thousand technology researchers and leaders, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, have urged intelligence labs to pause the development of advanced AI systems. The letter states that AI tools present “profound risks to society and humanity.”
In the letter, the leaders said:
""Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. Having succeeded in creating powerful AI systems, we can now enjoy an 'AI summer' in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt.""
12. Loss of Human Connection
Increasing reliance on AI-driven communication and interactions could lead to diminished empathy, social skills, and human connections. To preserve the essence of our social nature, we must strive to maintain a balance between technology and human interaction.
13. Misinformation and Manipulation
AI-generated content, such as deepfakes, contributes to the spread of false information and the manipulation of public opinion. Efforts to detect and combat AI-generated misinformation are critical in preserving the integrity of information in the digital age.
In a Stanford University study on the most pressing dangers of AI, researchers said:
“AI systems are being used in the service of disinformation on the internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for fascism. From deepfake videos to online bots manipulating public discourse by feigning consensus and spreading fake news, there is the danger of AI systems undermining social trust. The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage.”
14. Unintended Consequences
AI systems, due to their complexity and lack of human oversight, might exhibit unexpected behaviors or make decisions with unforeseen consequences. This unpredictability can result in outcomes that negatively impact individuals, businesses, or society as a whole.
Robust testing, validation, and monitoring processes can help developers and researchers identify and fix these types of issues before they escalate.
15. Existential Risks
The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human intelligence raises long-term concerns for humanity. The prospect of AGI could lead to unintended and potentially catastrophic consequences, as these advanced AI systems may not be aligned with human values or priorities.
To mitigate these risks, the AI research community needs to actively engage in safety research, collaborate on ethical guidelines, and promote transparency in AGI development. Ensuring that AGI serves the best interests of humanity and does not pose a threat to our existence is paramount.

AI and LLM (large language models - such as ChatGPT) will disrupt education in major ways and the educational industry is not prepared. Education systems are slow to adapt and full of bureaucracies. However, text-generating applications will forever shift education and innovation will be needed sooner than later to embrace this new era of learning. A survey of 1,000 U.S. college students found that nearly a third of them had used the AI chatbot ChatGPT to complete written homework assignments, and close to 60 percent use it on more than half of their work. This number will increase exponentially as students learn more about using this loophole for assignments in the coming months (not years) and educational institutes are not ready. There are websites that can check if automated written documents, such as ChatGPT, were used. However, there needs to be at least 1,000 words and the accuracy of detection is not fully reliable.


It is crucial for educational systems to integrate AI into teaching and learning, much like how the calculator was seamlessly incorporated into math classrooms. The calculator, once a revolutionary tool, is now a staple in classrooms, enhancing students' understanding and efficiency in mathematics. Similarly, AI must be viewed as an essential tool, vital for fostering a future-ready workforce, and used in the same way.

This week the U.S. Department of Education released insights and recommendations for Artificial Intelligence. The report spotlights the benefits of AI for education, such as assisting with language barriers in the classroom, as well as cautions such as algorithm discrimination. They also emphasize that AI will not replace teachers, but moreso enhance a teacher's ability to teach. Integrating AI into education can enrich the learning experience for students of all ages and help prepare them for the future job market. Here are some ways AI can be introduced at various age levels:

PROMOTED
Early Childhood Education:



AI-powered educational toys and games can help develop cognitive and motor skills.
AI-driven language learning tools can facilitate early language acquisition and pronunciation.
AI-based adaptive learning systems can provide personalized learning experiences that cater to individual needs and learning styles.


Elementary and Middle School Education:


AI can be used in teaching core subjects like math, science, and language arts through interactive learning platforms that adapt to students' progress and learning styles.
AI-driven virtual tutors can provide personalized feedback, guidance, and support, supplementing the efforts of human teachers.
AI can be employed to facilitate collaborative learning experiences, connecting students with diverse backgrounds and encouraging global citizenship.

High School Education:


AI can be used to develop more advanced learning tools for subjects like programming, data science, and robotics, inspiring students to explore STEM careers.
AI-driven analytics can help teachers identify students' strengths, weaknesses, and learning preferences, enabling targeted interventions and support.
This generation will have to become much more critical thinkers. Given that AI can generate essays, it may be that students should be evaluating the content that was created. This will be a crucial skill as there will be more and more misinformation generated by AI.

Insights from the BfDI on how to navigate Privacy Challenges in the Era of Generative AI 


The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, also known as BfDI (Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit), recently published an opinion on the topic of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a previous article, we discussed Generative AI, which refers to artificial intelligence applications capable of generating new content, rather than simply recognizing patterns. Examples of Generative AI applications include well-known chatbot ChatGPT and the image generator MidJourney, among others. While this technology is fascinating from a technological standpoint, it poses significant challenges in terms of regulation, particularly in the field of personal data protection.
In this article, we will discuss some key points raised by the Commissioner that we believe are most relevant from a data protection perspective.
Use of Generative AI in the workplace
Generative AI is gradually finding its way into everyday work applications such as word processors, code copilots, and search engines. This integration lowers the barrier for the use of Generative AI, making it increasingly commonplace. In this regard, employers have a responsibility to:

Always adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Avoid indiscriminate use of personal data when utilizing Generative AI, even if it simplifies work processes.
Only process personal data through Generative AI applications when there is a legal basis for such processing.

The Commissioner also emphasizes that employers have a duty to ensure that employees are trained and educated on these matters.
Children’s data
Children are particularly vulnerable in terms of their personal data processing since they often lack awareness of the risks and consequences involved and may struggle to exercise their data subject rights effectively. As a general rule, the personal data of minors should not be included as a training base for generative AI systems. It is the responsibility of developers to implement measures to ensure this, for example, by filtering training data to exclude minors‘ personal data.
Regarding the type of content children can access via generative AI applications, it could be beneficial to establish appropriate limits within the AI system, similar to how inappropriate content is handled through features like Safe Search, which is a Google Search feature that filters out potentially pornographic and offensive content. However, the BfDI mentions that imposing strict limits, such as mandatory identification requirements for use, should be avoided as it eliminates the possibility for users to keep their anonymity.
As the use of generative AI becomes the norm via its integration into everyday applications, the priority should be educating and raising awareness among minors about the risks, as well as the opportunities and potentials of the technology. Parents, guardians, and teachers must actively participate in this education process by teaching minors about the critical and responsible use of generative AI systems.
Image generators
Generative AI applications specialized in generating images pose a great risk from a data protection point of view since they can be used to generate deepfakes and spread false information about natural persons. Furthermore, images generated by AI can be very difficult to discern from real images, increasing the difficulty to correct misinformation. Even if the false images are stated as false post-facto, the correction rarely has as much range as the original lie, making it almost impossible to undo the damage.
While marking and recognition tools that signal when an image is an AI product may be implemented to address social problems, they are not a comprehensive solution, particularly in cases where generative AI is intentionally used for propaganda or reputation-damaging purposes and the creators have no intention of disclosing the means. Watermarks or digital signatures are also not an ideal solution since they can lead to privacy concerns. For example, in the case of whistleblowers who wish to maintain their anonymity, a digital signature may come as a hindrance.
The primary focus should be on educating and raising awareness among the population about these issues. Individuals must be motivated to engage with fact-checking mechanisms and always confirm sources of information. Organizational measures should also be considered, such as the labeling of AI-generated media, similar to how copyright attribution is practiced. Additionally, education and awareness initiatives are crucial in promoting the responsible use of AI-generated media and mitigating its negative effects.
Conclusion
The rapid advancement of generative AI technology has prompted public authorities worldwide to take notice and address its implications. The recently published opinion by the BfDI sheds light on the critical data protection considerations surrounding generative AI. As this technology becomes increasingly integrated into everyday applications, it is crucial to strike a balance between its potential benefits and the need to protect personal data. As we navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI, public awareness and comprehensive educational initiatives must remain at the forefront.

5 Workflow Generative AI Tools That Could Soon Help Make Your Job Easier

By Tharindu Dias/June 3, 2023  2:32 pm EST


Generative AI has taken the world by storm, beginning with the boom in popularity sparked by ChatGPT. Since then, every company that could possibly integrate AI functionality into its product offering has done so – from Google to Adobe, generative AI tools have been flourishing.

When used correctly and responsibly, generative AI tools can shave minutes, if not hours, off your workflow, allowing you to devote your energy to refining its output or even working on entirely different projects altogether. It can also be a massive stress reliever, giving you some respite from crushing workloads and tight timelines.
However, with all of these options comes a lot of noise that will clutter your search for time-saving tips with unhelpful advice and pontification, making it that much more important to identify what can actually be useful. The sooner you get to know some of the best tools available and master them, the sooner you will see improvements in your workflow and output. With that in mind, we've identified five generative AI tools that could make your job a little bit easier.





GrammarlyGO






Grammarly



Even if you aren't already a Grammarly user you have likely heard of their service thanks to their ubiquitous YouTube ads. Grammarly goes over whatever you are writing on pretty much any platform, be it Gmail, LinkedIn, or even WhatsApp, and gives you suggestions on how to improve your writing. This can range from fixing spelling and grammar mistakes outright to suggesting changes in wording to improve tone and clarity. Either way, it takes your writing and does what it can to improve it.

However, Grammarly has introduced a new service that uses generative AI to go one step further and complete the most challenging part — the writing — for you. Dubbed GrammarlyGO, this service is available for Grammarly Free users in select countries (including the U.S.) and global users on Premium, Business, and Education accounts.
As an AI tool, GrammarlyGO shouldn't be used to automate all of your writing. Instead, it is more effective in helping to create first drafts, which you then review and rewrite if necessary. GrammarlyGO can also be tweaked to align with your preferences to create drafts, outlines, and email replies that are in the proper context and have the required level of formality. You can further tweak the style to match the platform you are writing for, as GrammarlyGO can be used in a host of platforms, including Gmail, LinkedIn, and Medium.





Canva Pro






Canva



Canva is already an incredibly powerful and well-regarded content creation platform known for democratizing basic graphic design with its easy-to-use templates and surprisingly-powerful image editing tools. The platform has now taken things a few steps further with the integration of several AI-powered tools that make creating compelling, high-quality images easier than ever before.

Accessible to Canva Pro users, all of the AI-powered tools in Canva Create have Magic in their name and provide users with a wide range of functions. Magic Design will take an image you upload and create a series of templates to match it, giving you a good jumping-off point for your next creation. Magic Design can also generate entire presentations, saving you hours that would have otherwise been spent on content and layouts that can now be handled by Canva itself.
However, if you can't get it just right and want to add or remove something from the image, Magic Edit will allow you to simply describe what you want to have added to your image and have it generated with text-to-image technology. In contrast, Magic Eraser will remove distracting elements from your image. Canva's AI tools aren't limited to images, though, with the inclusion of a text generator called Magic Write, which can give you a boost when coming up with image captions, blog outlines, and more.





Microsoft 365 Copilot

While Bing Chat may have gotten a lot of attention, it isn't the only Microsoft product that has had its functionality enhanced by the addition of AI. Microsoft 365 Copilot integrates AI across the Microsoft 365 suite, allowing it to pull information from multiple sources and significantly improve your productivity. 

Copilot can now be used for creative purposes in Word, Powerpoint, Outlook, Teams, and even Viva Engage. It can be used to write, edit and otherwise generate documents, reports, presentations, emails, questions, messages, and more. Furthermore, with its integration into Excel, Copilot can also be used as a powerful data analysis tool, giving you deep insights into your data in response to simply-worded questions, even generating models and visualizations as needed.
These implementations significantly increase the capabilities of each of the Microsoft 365 programs they have been added to. However, what really sets Copilot apart from many other implementations of generative AI is its ability to draw information from across Microsoft 365 and combine it for whatever you may require. This feature is called Business Chat and allows you to pull information from multiple sources, such as your email, calendar, and chats, all at once. You can have it generate updates, overviews, reports, and more so you can stay up to speed while keeping your team similarly informed.





Google Duet AI

Google Duet AI has two broad areas where it can improve workflows and productivity – Google Workspace and Google Cloud. The Google Cloud integration is significantly more specialized, as it mainly provides code assistance, answers technical questions, and helps users implement apps. Acting as another collaborator in your workflow, Duet AI greatly increases your capabilities within Google Cloud, regardless of your level of expertise.

When it comes to Google Workspace, the implementation of generative AI is far more widespread and accessible to a wide variety of users. With its addition to Docs and Gmail, Duet can generate text for whatever purposes you may have, be it drafting an email response or refining a document your team created. It can also be used to create responsive documents with smart chips for location and status information included from the get-go.
Meanwhile, Duet AI has been integrated into Slides with the primary goal of creating images from simple text descriptions, allowing even the least artistic of us put together stunning presentations. Duet serves an image-based purpose in Meet as well, where it can be used to generate unique backgrounds for video calls. Finally, it can be used to analyze, organize and utilize data entered into Sheets. With Duet AI, Sheets can automatically classify data, as well as come up with plans for how best to organize your data for whatever your use case may be.





Chat by Copy.ai






Copy.ai



Copy.ai was already an AI-based copy-generation service built specifically for sales and marketing professionals. So rather than introducing a massive selection of new features and capabilities like other tech companies have, Copy.ai has used the integration of AI to allow users to interact with their platform with greater ease while also adding new functionality.

The biggest benefit Chat by Copy.ai offers users — beyond ease of interaction with existing features — is the ability to generate text, such as emails, using data that exists elsewhere online. For instance, it can be used to write an email to someone using data pulled from their LinkedIn profile to personalize the language therein.
Copy also has the ability to create briefs and outlines for online content based on data pulled from the results pages of search engines in real-time. This allows content created with SEO in mind to be as impactful and up-to-date as possible, as in addition to these briefs and outlines, it can also generate content with current data, unlike certain models provided by ChatGPT, which are limited to data that could be found online in 2021. It will also provide sources and citations for the information it gives you, so you can be confident that it hasn't just made up crucial information.

(ABC News: Chris Taylor)""The area of AI that we're looking at is more on the automation space at this stage,"" Ms Dixon said.The great productivity conPhoto shows a cafe worker serves customersAustralia's industrial relations system is like Catch-22. You can't have a pay rise until productivity improves. And productivity can't improve until you get a pay rise, writes business editor Ian Verrender.""We do have plans in the next six to 12 months to move more into the AI and the machine learning, but for now, we've just been looking at the automation, which has allowed us to save a significant number of hours.""She said the AI work had not led to any job cuts but it had allowed her team to use their time differently.""One of the tasks that we've created was preparing a quarterly report package for our clients,"" she explained.""Previously, that was prepared over two weeks, every quarter, by three or four staff members, that now gets run overnight, so in less than a day.""Then [the staff] are able to start reviewing it pretty much straight away, so it's freed them up quite considerably in that process.""This is the kind of change proponents of AI say will benefit workers, by allowing them to focus on other, more meaningful tasks.Automating simple tasks with AI is one way the technology can benefit workers. (Supplied: Unsplash)Jobs we haven't even heard ofGlobal investment firm Goldman Sachs predicts AI will improve the world's GDP by 7 per cent during the next 10 years, worth about $10 trillion.Goldman Sachs economist Joseph Briggs believes about two-thirds of existing occupations could be partially automated by AI.Goldman Sachs Research indicates a majority of jobs will be partially automated by AI. (Supplied: Goldman Sachs Research)But he also said AI would lead to jobs that had not even been invented yet.""Today, 60 per cent of us are doing jobs that didn't even exist in 1940,"" he said in a recent video presentation.But there are concerns that this technical revolution could lead to job losses.Research by Statista found while AI could lead to the creation of 69 million more jobs worldwide, it could also result in 83 million job losses.Research by Statista suggests nearly a quarter of today's jobs will be affected by AI. (Supplied: Statista)Analysing data from IBM, it found three-quarters of companies worldwide were looking to adopt AI technologies into their workplaces in the next five years.China is world-leading when it comes to deploying AI, with about 60 per cent of IT professionals stating their organisations are actively implementing it.Australia is below the global average rate of adopting or looking into AI, but on par with the US and South Korea.China and India are leading the way for countries already using AI in business. (Supplied: Statista)Could AI lead to widespread job losses?A survey by Microsoft revealed almost half (46 per cent) of Australian workers were concerned AI could take over their jobs.But at the same time, 65 per cent of workers said they would willingly hand over some of their more menial tasks to AI.Microsoft's director of surface and modern work in Australia, Jane Mackarell, said the impact of AI on jobs would not be cut and dried.Jane Mackarell believes there will be a net benefit to using AI in the workplace. (ABC News: John Gunn)""I think it's twofold,"" she argued.""We've all got to acknowledge the fact that there will be roles that shift and morph, but there will be roles where you will be able to focus on what you're supposed to do and really enhance the creativity and innovation component.""The survey of more than 30,000 employers and employees globally, including 1,000 in Australia, found most bosses did not think AI would lead to widespread job cuts.Microsoft research suggests bosses believe AI will increase productivity more than it will reduce the number of employees they have. (Supplied: Microsoft)""Among both employees and employers there is a concern about the restructuring of certain roles, which, you know, let's face it, we see every time there's a major impact of technology, and this is a major impact,"" Ms Mackarell noted.""This is a game changer.""But we also saw that for the most part, employers, for example, in Australia were twice as much interested in AI for productivity gains, rather than reducing headcount.""So that, top of mind for an employer in Australia, is not necessarily how can I use this to sort of automate people's roles.""'We have a productivity problem in our economy'Australia's rate of productivity, what we produce for a given amount of hours worked, fell 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to March this year.A fall in productivity has a direct impact on the economic wellbeing of a country.""Declines in productivity growth result in a rise in unit labour costs, which is inflationary and negative for living standards in the long run,"" explained AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina in a recent note.The lower productivity growth is, the more expensive it is for businesses to pay employees for their work. ""We have a productivity problem in our economy,"" added Amit Singh, a partner at economics research firm, Mandala.""Ninety per cent of people work in the services sector. The Productivity Commission has said that that sector has lagged in productivity performance for over two decades.""Mr Singh's firm has modelled the top jobs it thinks are likely to be impacted by AI in Australia.Amit Singh says productivity in the services sector has been low for years. (ABC News: Sean Warren)""What we found was that those occupations were lawyers and judges, consultants, policymakers, psychologists, counsellors, telemarketers — we find that those particular occupations were the top 10 occupations that were most affected,"" he said.""There are obviously hundreds of occupations that are affected, but those were the key ones.""Top 10 jobs likely to be impacted by generative AI:TelemarketersTertiary educatorsSocial professionals, e.g. interpretersIntelligence and policy analystsJudges and their clerksCounsellorsPurchasing and supply logistics clerksHuman resource professionalsManagement analystsInsurance and betting clerksSource: MandalaAlex Jenkins, a director at the WA Data Science Innovation Hub, told The Business that white-collar workers would be affected.""We're likely to see the jobs change for knowledge workers, people who sit in front of a computer a lot, these jobs are likely to change in a significant manner,"" he said.He believes jobs that require very specialised and niche knowledge are likely to be most affected.""These are the creative workers like writers and graphic designers, but also I think medical researchers, and those practising health, are likely to be impacted by AI in the medium term,"" he said.""AI isn't good at jobs that require a more generalised understanding of the world, or jobs that involve a lot of interaction between people.""Mr Jenkins added that teachers could benefit, with AI becoming an individualised tutor for every student, catering to their specific learning needs.""A massive non-profit in America has developed technology that will be available in Australia soon, that will significantly change how teachers interact with AI,"" he told The Business.""I fully expect that this technology will allow students to learn at their own pace, and that we can accommodate students with different learning needs as well.""Alex Jenkins says while some jobs will be affected by AI, it will also benefit several sectors like education. (ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)You might already be speaking to AIThe typical role of people working in call, also known as contact, centres is set to be revolutionised by AI — and the change has already started.Speaking to a chatbot, instead of long wait times on the phone to speak to someone, is one method already favoured by some businesses and their customers.""Voice for now still remains the most important channel because it's the most natural way for people to communicate with each other,"" said Josh McAdam, the chief product officer at SecureCo, a company working to bridge the gap between chat and audio AI.Josh McAdam says AI is already being used in customer service roles. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)""But there are advantages to being able to move between channels. For example, you might be on the train, you can't talk, so you've started messaging with an organisation, when it's your turn to actually speak to them, you switch over and you start talking to them on the phone.""There are a lot of experiences like that, that start to be enabled, because AI can actually understand and help communicate across all of those different interaction mediums, rather than just being tied to one.""Australian cities are falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to productivity. Here's whyPhoto shows A picture of pedestrians walking over a bridge in MelbourneOne of the world's foremost experts on cities has warned Australia risks ""sleepwalking into a long-term loss of productivity""  but not everyone agrees.He added AI could also answer the phone when customers get in touch with contact centres, before handing customers on to a real person if they can not resolve a caller's query.""Rather than calling up and speaking to one of the old menus, which is press one for this, press two for that, that type of stuff, you're actually starting to interact with a bot that says 'Hey, welcome to X company, what can I help you with today?'"" Mr McAdam said.""That's one of the biggest things we're seeing increased adoption of, because with recent advances in AI, where it can now understand you better, it can sound more natural, when it speaks back to you, you may not even know it's a robot anymore.""Posted Sun 4 Jun 2023 at 3:14pmSunday 4 Jun 2023 at 3:14pmSun 4 Jun 2023 at 3:14pm, updated Sun 4 Jun 2023 at 7:13pmSunday 4 Jun 2023 at 7:13pmSun 4 Jun 2023 at 7:13pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBiden's legacy will extend beyond his one term in office.

OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, and Google and Microsoft launched their own AI tools Bard and Bing in February this year. The three AI tools have been the talk of the tech world ever since their inception and today, more and more companies are using AI to the best of their advantage. And in May, nearly 4,000 people lost their jobs to the emerging tech. 4,000 people lost jobs because of AIA Business Insider report originally attributed to a monthly report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas revealed that in May this year, around 4,000 people lost their jobs to artificial intelligence. The report added that in total, around 80,000 people were laid off of their jobs last month. From these, 3,900 job cuts were because of AI. The reasons behind other job cuts could be economic conditions, cost cutting, restructuring at the company, or mergers and acquisitions. The report also shared insights on total job cuts in 2023 till now. From January to May, around 4 lakh people lost their jobs. A spokesperson also told Insider that this was the first time that job cuts were being attributed to AI. The spokesperson added that all the layoffs were from the tech sector.ChatGPT replacing humans in the workplaceIn February this year, another survey conducted by job advice platform Resumebuilder.com revealed that some US-based companies had started deploying ChatGPT instead of human workers.1,000 business leaders participated in the survey and almost half of the US companies that participated said that they are using ChatGPT and that the chatbot has replaced workers at their companies.Resumebuilder, in a statement back then, said that business leaders were &#039;impressed&#039; by the viral chatbot&#039;s work. The company said, &quot;Overall, most business leaders are impressed by ChatGPT&rsquo;s work. Fifty-five percent say the quality of work produced by ChatGPT is excellent, while 34 percent say it&rsquo;s very good.&quot;A Business Today report quoted Resumebuilder.com&rsquo;s Chief Career Advisor Stacie Haller saying in a statement, &quot;There is a lot of excitement regarding the use of ChatGPT. Since this new technology is just ramping up in the workplace, workers surely need to be thinking of how it may affect the responsibilities of their current job. The results of this survey shows that employers are looking to streamline some job responsibilities using ChatGPT.&quot;Moreover, ChatGPT creator Sam Altman also said in an interview in March that one job that could be replaced by ChatGPT was customer service.

SALT LAKE CITY — Alan Fuller plugged in a request in an AI app.""I just did a simple query: Who are some of the key leaders in the state of Utah legislature?"" the state's head of technology services said in an interview with FOX 13 News. The response he got was certainly interesting.""It first brought up Governor Cox, which, although he is a state leader, he's not in the legislature, correct? Then it brought up Stuart Adams, good,"" he said, referring to the Utah State Senate President. ""Brad Wilson is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, good. But then it said Jennifer Seelig is the Minority Leader in the Utah House of Representatives. No, she's not."" That's when things got even more bizarre.

I can't find anyone named Don Ippolito... and if you take a close look at the picture? It has Bill Clinton in the picture. So a completely fictitious, made up answer.""It was an example Fuller used during a discussion on Friday about the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and opportunities to use it as well as potential risks. As FOX 13 News reported earlier this week, the Utah State Legislature has convened a special work group to look at AI and whether it needs regulation.On Friday, the Utah Policy Innovation Lab hosted a discussion among tech company CEOs and policymakers about AI. Many spoke about the benefits to productivity, education and how it can dramatically change the workforce.""Some people are predicting it cures cancer in the next 5-10 years using AI to help solve different forms of disease,"" said Matthew Poll, the CEO of GTF. ""I think cancer is definitely on the list. I also think from a geopolitical standpoint, this may be our saving grace.""Nick Pelikan, the CEO of Piste.AI, said he is already using it with some of his company's clients.""You can use a chatbot to personalize, especially these chatbots that are very human seeming, you can use that chatbot to personalize the customer experience to a point it’s indistinguishable for the person where it’s a person talking to them or a robot,"" he told the crowd.Pelikan noted a ""hype cycle"" right now surrounding AI, pointing out that the technology has been used for years now but what has changed is the quality of it and responses that are more ""human."" But others warned of risks for misinformation, ""deepfake"" hoaxes and an over-reliance on the technology with a lack of human oversight.""The machines are going to become a lot smarter and people are going to become a lot stupider,"" joked Barclay Burns, the CEO of GenerativeImpact.AI. Margaret Woolley Busse, the executive director of Utah's Department of Commerce, said AI could be helpful with support services. But she expressed concern about being unable to tell what is real and is created by an artificial intelligence.""If you don’t trust anything now because there’s so many things that are fake? It could make our economy closed because now we have to check everything because it seems like it could be fake,"" she said.Lawmakers who serve on the legislature's work group said bills will be run around data privacy and consumer protection. Sen. Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, said he wanted to ensure ""the public will be able to identify what is AI-generated versus what is authentic.""Fuller said the state has already started rolling out proper conduct when using AI systems.""There shouldn’t be any personally identifiable information put into prompts by state employees,"" he said. ""Second, we shouldn’t be using the output of generative AI models without a human reading it and taking responsibility for the output of it.""Even some tech company founders agreed that regulation of AI systems may be necessary. Becki Wright founded Proximity, which aims to help political candidates in their campaigns. She said she uses an AI to assist users.""I'm hopeful we can get ahead of it and say here’s some guardrails you want to use, but also I want us to continue to foster innovation and allow startups to do stuff and innovate in a way that’s not going to be hampered by regulation,"" she told FOX 13 News.Rep. Jefferson Moss, R-Saratoga Springs, agreed.""We don’t want to be an overly burdensome state on regulation, but we want to be able to create some guardrails to make sure we’re keeping certain things in check,"" he said.
