Press ReleaseDecember 23, 2022RELATED TOPICSTECHNOLOGYPHOTOH.E. Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications and Fady Jameel Vice Chairman, Community JameelDubai, United Arab Emirates: The Jameel Clinic, the epicentre of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hosted yesterday a one-day conference titled ‘AI Cures MENASA: Clinical AI and data solutions for health’, in partnership with the UAE Artificial Intelligence Office, Community Jameel,  and Wellcome. Held at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai, the conference was attended by H.E. Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications.
The conference brought together pioneers in AI and health from the Jameel Clinic, including MacArthur ‘genius grant’ Fellows Professor Regina Barzilay and Professor Dina Katabi, Dr Adam Yala and Dr Shrooq Alsenan, a Jameel Clinic research fellow from Saudi Arabia, together with representatives from major hospitals and public health agencies across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) region. The conference marks the first international venture of ‘AI Cures’, the Jameel Clinic’s platform for collaboration that launched in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fady Jameel, vice chairman of Community Jameel, said: “We are excited to be able to help bring together such an inspiring gathering of scientists, policymakers, public health officials and hospital leaders at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai. The work of the Jameel Clinic has the potential to transform healthcare for millions of people around the world, and we are excited to see the Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network expanding in the MENASA region and rolling out clinical AI tools around the world for equitable impact for all.”
Professor Regina Barzilay, AI faculty lead at the Jameel Clinic, said: “Ensuring that the cutting-edge clinical AI research being done at MIT can be utilised in diverse clinical settings is critical to our mission at the Jameel Clinic. We look forward to combining the expertise of Jameel Clinic researchers with the expertise of local clinicians and public health officials in the MENASA region to maximise the impact of clinical AI tools on patient lives.”
Tariq Khokhar, head of data for science & health at Wellcome, said: “AI tools have an exciting role to play in transforming healthcare for patients around the world and advancing health research. But first, researchers, policymakers, clinicians and healthcare managers must work together to test them in diverse settings rigorously, so we know they work for different people and under different circumstances. This will ensure they’re safe for everyone and maximise their potentially life-saving potential.”

That in itself isn’t very unusual. What set these selfies apart, however, were that they were more like portraits commissioned from artists. Lots of artists.Artist Kim Leutwyler.Credit: Steven SiewertAlbums would be filled with pictures of the same person in an array of styles. Some looked like oil paintings, others like scenes from anime. With every swipe, my friends appeared through a different lens, as though they had been reimagined by a team of different artists. As it turns out, this was the truth – kind of. They’d used the app Lensa, which for a fee allows users to upload a series of selfies and in return get an album full of “avatars” created by AI.For Kim Leutwyler, an artist and six-time Archibald Prize finalist, this raised a red flag. “I was very sceptical about where the source of all of this imagery was coming from,” they tell me from their Sydney studio. After some digging they discovered “there were hundreds, if not thousands of artists saying that their work had been completely ripped off – their exact colour, composition, style; these things that they’ve been working for years to develop.” Leutwyler, it turned out, was one of them.After being directed to a website that allows users to search the databases being used to train Lensa and other AI art-generating apps, “I uploaded my own work and saw that almost every painting, every portrait I’ve ever shared on the internet was on there.” They were far from alone. “I found Blak Douglas, Vincent Namatjira, Yvette Coppersmith, Del Kathryn Barton, my friends, and really prominent Australian artists whose work is being used without their knowledge, without their consent, and without any compensation.”With AI becoming more prominent, not just across art but across all areas of life, what does a situation like this mean for artists and the future of the creative industries?Are artists at risk of becoming obsolete?“A year or two back if you’d asked me whether graphic design was a safe job, I’d have said, yes, it was pretty safe job – anything in the creative industries is a pretty safe job from racing against the machines. But now, actually, I would be somewhat worried if I was a graphic designer,” says Toby Walsh, professor of AI at the University of NSW.Toby Walsh: ""People think of Australia as the land of the fair go, and that should be true of the technologies we build too.""Credit: Jeremy PiperWith artists like Leutwyler’s work being used to train apps, Walsh says, “they’re right to be angry because there’s great value being generated here, and it’s not being shared with the people whose art from which it was derived.” He questions whether or not this is sustainable, both for artists and these programs. If AI-generated work takes money, recognition and opportunities away from artists, many of them will stop producing art. “We have to work out ways to ensure that the people on whose work the systems depend do get some sort of reward, so that they continue to produce art that will continue to be used to train future systems”.AdvertisementAt present, AI is directed by humans, so “in training AI generally there’s a moral responsibility on the people who are doing the training to think about where they’re directing this capability,” says Ewan McEoin, senior curator of contemporary art, design and architecture at the National Gallery of Victoria.Can AI and the art world happily coexist?As AI rapidly evolves, it’s difficult for protections to keep pace – this opens up conversations about how to protect existing work while also looking at the creative potential of AI. McEoin is riding his bike to the gallery when he pulls over to speak to me, our conversation soundtracked by birdsong and gentle breeze. “We need to remember that AI is a tool – and it’s a tool that’s not specifically developed to make art,” he reflects. “It’s a tool that’s capable of dealing with huge quantities of data.”Quantum Memories by Refik Anadol is a work of art created by harnessing a dataset drawn from over two hundred million images linked to nature from publicly available internet resources and processed using quantum computing with machine learning algorithms.Credit: Refik Anadol StudioHe highlights how the world is incredibly data-rich, across business, finance, health, education, and how all the information pulsing through society is becoming increasingly connected. “We’re looking at a future where, across lots of different aspects of society, AI will be increasingly used to process huge quantities of data,” says McEoin. As an institution, he says, the gallery plays a role in recording these changes as they progress and asking questions about what it all means. “How do we help the public understand what some of the implications of these things will be?”He points to Quantum Memories by Refik Anadol, which was displayed in the NGV as part of the Triennial.Artist Refik Anadol has been working with AI for seven years.Credit: Efsun ErkilicThe mesmerising work, displayed on a giant LED screen was created by directing a quantum computer to process around 200 million images of nature and landscapes in a database owned by Google then asking it to look for patterns and commonalities. “What Refik asked it to do was to learn from that and recreate landscapes, imagined landscapes,” says McEoin. The result is a constantly changing series of moving images that are at once familiar and alien. “The work is a never-ending generative exploration of this information.”AI has actually been part of art for a whileAnadol’s artwork has been inextricably linked with technology since almost the beginning. “I’ve been programming computers to make art since 14 years”, he tells me. Seven years ago he started working with AI at Google as an artist in residence. “So we are a pioneer studio, because seven years with AI is like 70 years,” he adds with a laugh.AI being used to increase the potential of art, to broaden what is possible is an idea that Walsh raised. “I think the best way to envisage artificial intelligence is something that augments us. We’ve always picked up and used tools, and here’s a new tool that will allow many of us to make much more beautiful art than we could without the tool.”The work Refik Anadol Studio creates is diverse and displayed all over the world, using technology to probe ideas in unexpected ways – in one work, Melting Memories, Anadol uses EEG data as a way to try and present the concept of memory visually.Insight into the creation process behind Melting Memories.Credit: Refik Anadol Studio.All of the studio’s work requires drawing on huge amounts of data and pools of information, but they make sure to put a fence around it. “In our work, we always try to emphasise where the AI comes from, where data comes from, what kind of tools we use. I’m extremely open about our approach,” he tells me.Anadol is an optimist – the joy he feels in his work is clear in every sentence he utters. When asked how he came to AI in the first place, he tells me he loves to learn. “Some people call it nerd some people call it curious,” he says with a laugh.He also mentions he is a fan of sci-fi. But isn’t AI – autonomous AI anyway – often portrayed in a negative light in sci-fi I ask. “I highly believe that these technologies can create a problem for humanity for sure,” he replies, highlighting privacy and free will in particular. “What we read, what we watch, what we buy, eat … wherever we go is all defined by machines”. Artists, he reflects, have a role in bringing awareness, and he is interested in subverting the negatives and seeing how they can be made positive. “What else can we do with the same technologies and the systems imposed on us? How can we turn them into creative outputs? How can we use them to enhance our cognitive capacity? How can we use AI as a means of extension of the human mind?” A look at the creation process behind the artwork Melting Memories, which draws on EEG data.Credit: Refik Anadol StudioAnadol’s work opens up many questions and possibilities. Quantum Memories gives viewers an indication of what AI sees when it looks at the natural world. “It will be able to see not only the beauty of nature, but also the damage caused to nature by human beings,” says McEoin. “If AI was asked to do something about this situation, what would it do?“This is just the beginningMcEoin underscores the fact that these are early days for AI and art, and that it will be interesting to see where things go. “This is like a baby learning to paint, these images that we’re seeing at the moment.” Currently, AI-created images and artwork are still human-led. He’s curious though. “What kind of art would AI make if you matched up a quantum computer, and AI and the internet?“Although at the moment, it’s an aesthetic thing that we’re looking at, I would be very interested to understand the topics, the subject matter, the discourses that AI wants to have with us, because we’re not at that point yet.”So, what happens to artists now?Whether AI poses a direct risk to artists – that they could simply be replaced by machines learning from all that humans have created before them – is a tricky thing to answer.Across the academics, artists and curators I speak to, all of them point to something indefinable that forms a layer of protection, though not all of them are referring to the same thing. There’s the fact that what art actually is can’t be nailed down, even between people.“We also have to remember that just making an image with AI is not necessarily making art,” says McEoin. “There’s a big difference between taking a photograph and taking a photograph that is considered as part of an artistic movement or art form.”Related ArticleVisual artDestination art: The best exhibitions to see around Australia while on holidayAnadol agrees. “Just prompting an image isn’t art at all,” he tells me. “The question is really what we do with that, and how we use it for the artistic context.”Walsh draws my attention to the fact that photography didn’t destroy painting. “Art is more than just making images that are realistic. It’s about asking questions, and addressing aspects of the human condition, whether that’s about falling in love and losing loved ones and human mortality and all of the troubling questions that art helps us to think about,” he tells me. “Machines aren’t going to speak to us in the same way that artists speak to us because they don’t share our humanity.”We reached out to the Art Gallery of New South Wales to ask about whether works created in part by AI would be eligible for the Archibald Prize but were told no one was available to comment.Leutwyler is positive about AI and advancements in technology. Their concern lies with the issues of trust and consent when work is used without permission or compensation.Related ArticleExplainerRobots‘Die as a human or live forever as a cyborg’: Will robots rule the world?“I think that technology can be used in many ways to transform your artwork, take you in a direction that you didn’t expect. But the artificial intelligence, specifically the ones that are pulling from sources without people’s consent, just feels like forgery and theft to me,” they explain. “I think there’s certainly merit and value to artificial intelligence in general. It can be used for really wonderful great good things in the world. But this is an example where it’s been used for bad.”A cultural guide to going out and loving your city.

The Jameel Clinic, the epicenter of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in partnership with the UAE Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications Office, Community Jameel, and Wellcome hosted on Tuesday a one-day conference titled ‘AI Cures MENASA: Clinical AI and data solutions for health.’


Held at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai with Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, in attendance, the conference brought together pioneers in AI and health from the Jameel Clinic, including MacArthur's genius grant’ Fellows Professor Regina Barzilay and Professor Dina Katabi, Dr Adam Yala, and Dr Shrooq Alsenan, a Jameel Clinic research fellow from Saudi Arabia, together with representatives from major hospitals and public health agencies across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) region.AdChoicesADVERTISING

Climate change, lengthening life expectancy, and sedentary lifestyles are impacting hospitals and public health sectors across the MENASA region due to a rise in non-communicable diseases like cancer, obesity, and diabetes as well as neurodegenerative diseases. The rise of AI in healthcare presents a powerful opportunity to tackle these challenges and enable better patient outcomes, yet the gap between research in the field and real-world implementation across hospitals continues to grow. Building a robust coalition of researchers, clinicians, hospitals, and public health actors is vital to realizing the benefits of major advances in AI in the detection and treatment of diseases — not just in the MENASA region, but around the world.

The Jameel Clinic, co-founded by MIT and Community Jameel in 2018, brings together computer scientists, biologist,s and clinicians to develop new tools to tackle health challenges. Since its launch, the Jameel Clinic team has used deep learning techniques to discover Halicin, the first new antibiotic in three decades, which is capable of killing around 35 deadly bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant tuberculosis and the superbug C. difficile.


The Jameel Clinic also developed Mirai, a machine learning algorithm that predicts breast cancer more than three years earlier than current approaches and is equally effective across different races and ethnicities, a major advance for health equity.


Consistent with the Jameel Clinic’s mission to ensure these new tools are rolled out around the world, especially to countries with more fragile public health systems and to at-risk communities, the ‘AI Cures’ MENASA conference will serve as a launch pad for the international expansion of the Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network, a new initiative supported by the Jameel Clinic and Wellcome that is building partnerships with hospitals to deploy and develop new AI tools in clinical settings, with the aim of saving lives.


Fady Jameel, vice chairman of Community Jameel, said: “We are excited to be able to help bring together such an inspiring gathering of scientists, policymakers, public health officials and hospital leaders at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai. The work of the Jameel Clinic has the potential to transform healthcare for millions of people around the world, and we are excited to see the Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network expanding in the MENASA region and rolling out clinical AI tools around the world for equitable impact for all.”


Professor Regina Barzilay, AI faculty lead at the Jameel Clinic, said: “Ensuring that the cutting-edge clinical AI research being done at MIT can be utilized in diverse clinical settings is critical to our mission at the Jameel Clinic. We look forward to combining the expertise of Jameel Clinic researchers with the expertise of local clinicians and public health officials in the MENASA region to maximize the impact of clinical AI tools on patient lives.”

In comments to Al Arabiya English, those attending made further comments.Professor Barzilay said: With machine learning, we have the capacity to bring about truly transformative change in healthcare and that can only happen if we effectively deploy machine learning models in real-world settings, into hospitals and medical centers with clinicians and patients. Building a robust coalition of researchers, clinicians, hospitals, and public health actors is critical to realizing the benefits of major advances in machine learning in the detection and treatment of diseases.”Tariq Khokhar, head of data for science & health at Wellcome, said: “AI tools have an exciting role to play in transforming healthcare for patients around the world and advancing health research. But first, researchers, policymakers, clinicians, and healthcare managers must work together to rigorously test them in diverse settings, so we know they work for different people and under different circumstances. This will ensure they are safe for everyone and maximize their potentially life-saving potential.”Professor Dina Katabi, principal investigator at the MIT Jameel Clinic, said: “At the conference, we spoke about how we can use artificial intelligence in the future of the healthcare sector and improve it. We researched that AI assessment of Parkinson's can be done every night at home while the person is asleep and without touching their body. To do so, the team developed a device that has the appearance of a home Wi-Fi router, but instead of providing internet access, the device emits radio signals to analyse their reflections off the surrounding environment, and extract the subject’s breathing patterns without any bodily contact. The breathing signal is then fed to the neural network to assess Parkinson’s passively, and there is zero effort needed from the patient and caregiver.”“A relationship between Parkinson’s and breathing was noted as early as 1817, in the work of Dr. James Parkinson. This motivated us to consider the potential of detecting the disease from one’s breathing without looking at movements,” Katabi says. “Some medical studies have shown that respiratory symptoms manifest years before motor symptoms, meaning that breathing attributes could be promising for risk assessment before the diagnosis of Parkinson’s.”“The fastest-growing neurological disease in the world, Parkinson’s is the second-most common neurological disorder, after Alzheimer's. In the United States alone, it afflicts over 1 million people and has an annual economic burden of $51.9 billion. The research team’s algorithm was tested on 7,687 individuals, including 757 Parkinson’s patients.”This research was performed in collaboration with the University of Rochester, Mayo Clinic, and Massachusetts General Hospital, and is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, with partial support by the National Science Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.Dr. Mohammad AlHamid, Director of the Centre for Healthcare Intelligence (CHI) at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSH&RC), said: It’s great to be here at this seminar, we created the intelligence center back in 2019 , and we work with clinical and operational leaders to build and deploy high-quality applied Healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for enhancing quality of care, streamlining workflow operations, and improving patient experience using best practice operational and responsible AI pipelines.”The Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network aims to roll out clinical AI tools at 35 hospitals across eight countries, including Saudi Arabia, India, and Taiwan. With the significant breakthroughs in clinical AI technologies we have witnessed in the past decade across all areas of clinical care, the networks seeks to ensure that new healthcare technologies are deployed equitably, particularly across low and middle-income countries, in order to improve the quality of care and save lives.Read more: Breakthrough in detecting Parkinson’s using AI and breathing pattern by Jameel Clinic
