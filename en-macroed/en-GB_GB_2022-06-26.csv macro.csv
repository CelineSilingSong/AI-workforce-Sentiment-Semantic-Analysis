The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) recently spoke at a workshop about the application of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the nuclear industry.
The event at Bristol University aimed to help consider the benefits of developing AI technologies for the nuclear industry and ensure that digital technologies can be adopted into practice.
Digital technologies, including AI, have a role to play in the UK's nuclear industry and the workshop provided the environment for experts to meet, learn and collaborate to find innovative solutions to potential problems.
David Smeatham, Innovation Lead at ONR, was joined by a range of other experts at the event, hosted by the Bristol-EDF Synergistic utilisation of Informatics and Data centric Integrity engineering (SINDRI) Partnership and the Southwest Nuclear Hub.
The workshop was also attended by licensees, requesting parties, technical support contractors, and academics, who helped form an industry-wide view about the benefits and challenges of AI technologies.
(David Smeatham speaking at the workshop)
AI could be used in the nuclear industry to simulate behaviour of reactors, and inform reactor design, performance, safety and operation.
The workshop also examined how the nuclear industry could use data science to gather and store information to support future safety cases.
David said: “ONR is committed to enabling innovation where it is in the interests of nuclear safety and security so having a clear regulatory approach is important.
“Our work on innovation aims to demonstrate that effective regulation does not mean blocking innovation.
“Rather, ONR recognises that there is a need for regulators, licensees and supply chain organisations to be open minded to the opportunities from innovative approaches.
“A significant part of this is to build on existing work to develop ONR’s innovation capability. By doing so, ONR can ensure open-mindedness to new approaches.”
ONR jointly hosted an expert panel last March with the Advanced Nuclear Skills and Innovation Campus (ANSIC), who are based at National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) about the regulation of AI in nuclear. The Bristol workshop was an opportunity to share more about ONR’s commitment to enabling innovation and how AI can play a role in improving nuclear safety and security.
David’s session covered ONR’s Innovation Hub and the regulation of AI in the nuclear sector, drawing on the expert panel ONR jointly hosted in March.

One in four couples in developing countries is impacted by infertility. About 48.5 million couples experience infertility worldwide. Today, infertility is rapidly becoming an epidemic.


In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a technique that helps people facing fertility problems have a baby. Despite IVF’s potential, the outcomes are unpredictable. To make matters worse, access to fertility care is abysmal. Even in a developed market such as the United States, just 2% of people suffering from infertility have tapped into IVF.

“IVF has been around for over 40 years,” says Eran Eshed, CEO of Fairtlity. “Despite many innovations on the biotechnology side of things, surprisingly, there has been almost zero usage of data and techniques like artificial intelligence (AI) to influence outcomes.”

PROMOTED
While data science can’t solve biological problems, Eshed believes AI will enhance the IVF process at every step where decisions are made.

Today, we’re seeing exciting applications of data science in fertility that could improve embryologists’ capacity cycle by 50% and increase the chances of live birth by 4%.
Where IVF falls short today
IVF is a fertility technique in which an egg is removed from a person’s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory. The successfully fertilized egg–an embryo–is then implanted into a uterus to grow.
Clinicians and embryologists make many decisions at several junctures. “These decisions are based on experience, intuition, and a set of very, very rudimentary rules,” laments Eshed.
Today, there are two key challenges with IVF:

1. Poor access to care
“When just 2% of the impacted population can leverage IVF, it’s clear that access to care is a big, big issue,” highlights Eshed. “IVF is currently focused on infertility patients–those not getting pregnant either by timed intercourse or simple treatments such as oral medications,” shares Dr. Gerard Letterie, a reproductive endocrinologist and partner at Seattle Reproductive Medicine. “This is a relatively restricted segment of the population.”

In the future, Dr. Letterie expects the patient segment to include those who are interested in fertility preservation by freezing eggs or creating embryos for future use. “This will markedly expand the number of patients seeking care with assisted reproductive technologies,” he predicts.
2. Uncertain outcomes
How successful is IVF? The chances of conceiving from a single IVF cycle are around 30%. Hence, most patients need to undergo multiple cycles before experiencing a successful live birth.
While the success of IVF is influenced by age, data shows that most IVF cycles fail for even the youngest and healthiest women. IVF outcomes heavily depend on decisions made during the clinical process and on the expertise of the embryologists.
AI has the potential to reinvent fertility treatmentsThe IVF space is witnessing AI-driven technological breakthroughsgetty
How long is the IVF process and what are the steps involved? IVF starts with a clinician’s assessment of the cause of infertility. “Then, it moves into the stimulation phase where the doctor determines the best protocol for ovarian stimulation,” shares Eshed.
This is commonly followed by the collection of eggs and sperms, fertilization of eggs using sperms to create embryos, embryo culture in the clinic, transfer of embryos to the mother, and a live birth months later.
“As people go through this process, the success rates drop significantly at each stage,” says Eshed. Typically, six to seven strategic decision points determine the effectiveness of each step. “In the business world, we'd call them leverage points where you can make a difference,” he adds.
These points include decisions by clinicians on the stimulation medication protocol or timing of egg retrieval. In the lab, embryologists make several judgments by interpreting images about oocytes (developing eggs), sperms, and blastocytes (fertilized eggs).
“I’m confident that AI can help streamline the decisions to augment clinical decision-making,” claims Dr. Letterie. For example, sophisticated convolutional neural network-based image analytics can aid embryologists’ in interpreting the images to improve outcomes.
The global IVF market is set to reach around $36 billion by 2026, per an industry report. Dr. Letterie anticipates that “there simply won’t be enough skilled embryologists to address this rising demand.” Recently, the fertility space is witnessing multiple technology investments, with several funded, AI-driven startups.
Eshed founded Fairtility in Israel to address the acute challenge of embryo analysis with AI. Recently, his firm raised $15 million in Series A funding. Other startups such as Emrbyonics, Mojo, and ALife have come up with AI-based fertility solutions to analyze embryos, assess sperm quality, and personalize IVF treatment plans.
How Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing embryo analysis
Today, embryo classification is done by embryologists who manually inspect pictures for a set of visually detectable features. Fairtility utilizes computer vision algorithms to augment this process and predict the likely effectiveness of implantations.
Their AI algorithms are trained from a dataset of over 200,000 embryo videos and over 5 million clinical data points drawn from a diverse patient demographic. This gives the AI models the power to analyze minute features that are often undetectable by even the most experienced embryologists.
Fairtility’s solution, CHLOE, is a cloud-based system that acts as a decision support tool for AI-powered embryo selection. The tool integrates with time-lapse imaging (TLI) systems to provide continuous predictions from fertilization to the blastocyst stage. As the TLI system captures pictures of embryos at different stages of development, they are automatically identified, segmented, and analyzed at the pixel level.
In addition to automating this process, the AI model helps precisely quantify attributes such as size, area, shape, proportion, and symmetry. “That’s not something a human can do, so in a sense, we’re bringing a lot more intelligence in the process,” shares Eshed. Such precise information coupled with implantation probability enables an embryologist to make data-driven decisions for every embryo cultured in the TLI device.Embryos at various stages of development — at the time-of-pronuclei-appearance or tPNa. The embryos ... [+] are automatically identified by AI (see highlights on the left).FairtilityEmbryos automatically identified by AI (left) at the time-to-division-to-2 or t2FairtilityEmbryos automatically identified by AI (left) at the time-to-division-to-4 or t4Fairtility
CHLOE’s algorithms can predict blastulation with 96% accuracy, implantation with 71% accuracy, and whether an embryo is genetically healthy at 69% accuracy, per a paper submitted to the ESHRE conference. Such results improve embryologists’ prediction of embryo viability, which is currently around 65%.
Additionally, the AI solution can help embryologists identify anomalies, such as unusual cleavage patterns or severe fragmentation or pronucleate abnormalities that may otherwise be missed. Thus, CHLOE boosts the likelihood of healthy embryo selection.
However, despite improved results in embryo selection and process efficiency, studies have yet to demonstrate concrete improvements in live birth rates, which is considered the gold standard.
“AI cannot and should not replace embryologists and clinicians,” clarifies Eshed. “It is important that every patient gets the same and highest standard of care, irrespective of a practitioner’s experience or workload.” This is where CHLOE levels the playing field.
Fairtility provides its solution in a software as a service (SaaS) model to clinics and fertility centers around the world. Per Eshed, the installation of CHLOE requires no hardware and can be done remotely. With over 25 active installations worldwide, Fairtility has gained CE mark registration (a European safety, health, and environmental certification) and is reportedly in advanced FDA approval stages.
The three pre-requisites to deliver impact with AI
To realize the full potential of AI, several key challenges must be overcome:
1. Tackling data availability issues
“Data is a huge challenge in this space,” says Eshed. Data ranges from notes about treatment history, electronic medical records (EMR), ultrasound images, and videos. Eshed says that while the data exists, it is highly dispersed, and neither curated nor organized well. Even today, several clinics archive records in physical files. The entire process must be digitized to gain an end-to-end perspective from which AI models can learn.
2. Integration into the workflow
“Current practices have not been sophisticated regarding workflow and process development,” shares Dr. Letterie. Such AI solutions can help drive outcomes only when they are integrated into clinical and laboratory workflows. “This will also require education on the part of all stakeholders,” he adds. For example, Dr. Letterie will be launching a 15-course curriculum on AI in fertility using presentations from thought leaders at the upcoming ESHRE conference.
3. Fostering trust and adoption
Even after demonstrating effectiveness, achieving clinical uptake and routine use takes time. “Never underestimate the resistance to change,” cautions Eshed. “A fancy AI solution is not necessarily going to impress anybody.”
Dr. Letterie shares the example of beta-blockers, drugs that prevent cardiovascular disease, as a case in point. These drugs were initially used in patients recovering from myocardial infarction (MI) to prevent the recurrence of a heart attack. Despite studies demonstrating a clear reduction in morbidity and mortality, it took over 7 years to integrate beta blockers into routine clinical care.
""Similarly, we have an uphill battle to convince clinicians and embryologists that using AI tools will improve outcomes,” cautions Dr. Letterie. “Most practitioners aren’t familiar with AI and its applications in the clinical setting; hence, they are extremely hesitant to change practice patterns.” He feels that it is essential to show a clear improvement of outcomes before expecting significant uptake. Meanwhile, we must brace for the time lag in building trust with technology-driven treatments.
A future where fertility care will be commonplaceFertility treatments reinventedgetty
Dr. Letterie expects IVF to grow in prevalence with better success and fewer cost barriers to care. He foresees the development of early detection tools that warn patients who might be experiencing decreases in fertility, as opposed to today where patients end up with unretrievable fertility potential. With enhanced visibility about their fertility, patients will then be able to take early actions by freezing sperms, oocytes, or embryos.
He concludes that smartphones will be one of the biggest and most significant improvements in the delivery of fertility care.

There was a time when the idea of robots capable of thought was only a Hollywood plot device used in blockbuster films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator, Blade Runner, and The Matrix to keep us engaged. But true Artificial Intelligence or AI is now becoming fact over fiction, much like Hollywood movies depicting humanity walking on the moon in the 1950s. However, computing capabilities need to mature first.
Past and Present Capabilities
The first software to approximate human-like skills and problem-solving was under development in the mid-1950s. As the concept of AI evolved over twenty years, the problem was not programming but rather a lack of computer storage holding it back. To develop, AI needed higher processing speeds.
Using the increasing processing power and data storage, AI engineers began to further the field of research to include supercomputers such as Indiana University’s Big Red 200, which has 672 compute nodes. Each has 256 GB of memory and two AMD EPYC 7742 processors with 2.25 GHz and 225 watts.
Alternatively, the HiPerGator 3.0 from the University of Florida has 240 AMD EPYC Rome workstations with a RAM of 1024GB and more than 30,000 cores and 150 AMD EPYC Milan machines with 512GB of RAM and more than 19,000 cores in total. So now is the ideal time to make AI mainstream.
Applications requiring more computing power than most devices can manage today are great candidates for AI systems. For instance, in healthcare, machine learning can group similar medical cases to ascertain patterns, leverage current data to make a prognosis or even manage appointment scheduling and other data management tasks.

According to a recent Forbes articleOpens a new window ,  the insurance industry is leveraging machine learning to help detect fraud, “In the analysis of potential fraud, multiple tools are used, some are in ML [Machine Learning], such as statistics, rules-based approaches and even neural networks.” And Towards Data ScienceOpens a new window  says that many financial companies are already using machine learning to “reduce operational costs, increase revenues and reinforce security.”
Even the environment will benefit from the intellectual output from supercomputers. For example, IDC Opens a new window points out, “Thanks to new research on a supercomputer, Ramgen will begin testing a 13,000-horsepower CO2 compressor this year. This compressor is projected to reduce the capital costs of CO2 compression by 50% and produce a minimum of 25% savings in operating costs. Applying these cost savings to a new 400-megawatt clean coal plant would result in capital cost savings of approximately $22 million and an annual operating cost savings of approximately $5 million.”
AI Gets the Hype, but Computer Vision Has Insights
While AI gets all the hype, businesses are now using thousands of computer vision applications to expedite or automate numerous processes in fields like healthcare, where computer vision can spot cancer from CT images faster than doctors can.
Computer vision is a branch of AI employing data to detect and recognize objects seen through a computer’s camera. This cousin of AI recognizes objects and their environmental conditions through a camera lens and gives the computer a digital grasp of its surroundings to interact with objects. For example:

Individuals can be uniquely identified in highly secure situations using fingerprint and retinal scanning to grant or restrict access.
Problems in wind turbines can now be seen in advance using autonomous drone footage with high-definition cameras.
Computer vision applications help track packages or products through the supply chain.

Computer Vision’s Practicality in Everyday Living
We often notice the practical computer vision applications first regarding life efficiencies. Some organizations, for example, use computer vision technology to assist multi-family property managers in automating the package handling process. In addition, they use it to redirect workers to manage residents rather than deliver or sort items received from couriers.
Residents will benefit from the application in this scenario because they will no longer have to wait for personnel to pick up parcels. In addition, couriers benefit from multi-family computer vision applications since they can deliver packages directly to a smart package room. The computer vision technology in this intelligent package room virtually monitors and tags the location of each box.
Besides multi-family housing, logistics companies employ computer vision to audit packages passing through their hubs. This computer vision allows senders to assess package dimensions correctly before delivering them. Logistics firms may improve the customer experience and lower costs by automating the measurement of packages. Py-tesseract is a tool that allows for data extraction from images.
These computer vision efficiencies become increasingly crucial as AI applications migrate to operate drones, mobile devices, and vehicles. Qualcomm’s AI accelerator architecture in the Hexagon 780 Processor is furthering AI research. In addition, its Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks are improving the detection skills of computer vision systems.
Qualcomm’s neural networks increase curved shape detection, allowing computer vision to recognize item dimensions better. This work will undoubtedly contribute to the adoption of AI in daily gadgets and IoT networks and the performance of computer vision applications.
Conclusion
Unlike the drama depicted in most Hollywood films, people will continue to unknowingly benefit from AI and its computer vision relative to performing commonplace tasks such as presenting the next Netflix movie to watch or a smart package roomOpens a new window  notifying the correct person to receive a recently delivered Amazon package. Intelligent computing applications also go beyond superficial conveniences to perform complex duties such as driving, weather predictions, and rebalancing our retirement portfolios. And the best is yet to come.
The trickle-down impact of these billion-dollar academic supercomputers will be realized through improved national security, redesigned components that promote engine fuel efficiencies and reducing heart disease that will prolong our life expectancy. The application of AI and computer vision is both practical and surreal — already dramatically impacting every aspect of our lives, it will continue to reveal itself in subtle and surprising ways for a long time to come.

Duolingo: learning a new language with an AI owl
Have you ever wanted to become fluent in a foreign language? Technology has made language learning accessible to everyone. Since 2012, the Duolingo app and its owl mascot Duo, have made learning a language an enjoyable experience for over 500 million learners in 194 countries with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

Inspired by the potential of technology to deliver learning opportunities to people around the world, Duolingo, entered the educational technology field (Ed Tech) ten years ago. It has since become a hugely popular language-learning platform. Its mission is to develop the world’s best educational app and to make it universally available. While Duolingo now ranks among the top language learning apps, its sights are set more broadly on tackling the world’s toughest challenges.
“Our mission goes beyond language learning. The two biggest problems facing humanity are global warming and economic inequality. We believe that the best way to reduce economic inequality is through education,” says Luis von Ahn, CEO of Duolingo.
Mr. von Ahn, a university professor of computer science and a serial inventor, saw the benefits of the Internet as a tool to harness people’s brainpower early on. In his early 20s, he developed “Captcha'' and “reCaptcha”, the online tools that make it possible to differentiate between real users and computer bots for which, along with his work on human computation, he won he won the MacArthur Fellowship award at the age of 27, in 2006.
In 2012, he created and launched Duolingo, a free science-based language education learning platform and app for users. It was a hit from the outset, with over 10 million people downloading the app in the first 12 months. Duolingo now offers hundreds of exercises and challenges to make learning a language fun, and constantly listens to its users to introduce new features to enhance users’ experience of the platform.
Products like the Duolingo app, Duolingo ABC for kids, and Duolingo English Test are based on a proven methodology to foster long-term retention and are available to users free of charge. Duolingo is also working to improve how the app teaches users to speak a language. “We are starting to add conversation lessons in French and Spanish with the idea to practice real-world conversations on the app”, announced Mr. von Ahn at Duocon 2021, the conference for Duolingo learners and language enthusiasts.

Duolingo values feedback from its users, which the company marries with AI to offer them a customized learning experience. With their new AI model “BirdBrain”, the platform gets inside Duolingo learners’ heads.

“What we do in Duolingo is to turn the properties of having a great teacher into research programs for our AI efforts. We use machine learning and natural language processing to create tools that assist our world-class content developers in auditing and improving hundreds of lessons, challenges and exercises,” said Dr. Burr Settles, Research Director at Duolingo, at Duocon 2021.
The use of AI enables the company to analyze the common mistakes users make and to adapt lessons to users’ learning needs. Duolingo’s new AI system, Birdbrain, profiles each user and makes accurate predictions about their learning journey to ensure a personalized experience. Duolingo is able to do this for its 500 million plus users with the use of AI and machine learning. BirdBrain’s algorithms are embedded in the lessons on the app and their predictions improve over time as more learners use the platform. “We deliver a better learning experience using artificial intelligence (AI). Our lessons constantly adapt to how well the learner is doing on the app,” Mr. von Ahn explains.

The system, called iBorderCtrl, analyzed facial movements to attempt to spot signs a person was lying to a border agent. The trial was propelled by nearly $5 million in European Union research funding, and almost 20 years of research at Manchester Metropolitan University, in the UK.The trial sparked controversy. Polygraphs and other technologies built to detect lies from physical attributes have been widely declared unreliable by psychologists. Soon, errors were reported from iBorderCtrl, too. Media reports indicated that its lie-prediction algorithm didn’t work, and the project’s own website acknowledged that the technology “may imply risks for fundamental human rights.”This month, Silent Talker, a company spun out of Manchester Met that made the technology underlying iBorderCtrl, dissolved. But that’s not the end of the story. Lawyers, activists, and lawmakers are pushing for a European Union law to regulate AI, which would ban systems that claim to detect human deception in migration—citing iBorderCtrl as an example of what can go wrong. Former Silent Talker executives could not be reached for comment.Featured VideoThe World's Fastest Drones Want to Start Saving Lives in AmericaA ban on AI lie detectors at borders is one of thousands of amendments to the AI Act being considered by officials from EU nations and members of the European Parliament. The legislation is intended to protect EU citizens’ fundamental rights, like the right to live free from discrimination or to declare asylum. It labels some use cases of AI “high-risk,” some “low-risk,” and slaps an outright ban on others. Those lobbying to change the AI Act include human rights groups, trade unions, and companies like Google and Microsoft, which want the AI Act to draw a distinction between those who make general-purpose AI systems, and those who deploy them for specific uses.Last month, advocacy groups including European Digital Rights and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants called for the act to ban the use of AI polygraphs that measure things like eye movement, tone of voice, or facial expression at borders. Statewatch, a civil liberties nonprofit, released an analysis warning that the AI Act as written would allow use of systems like iBorderCtrl, adding to Europe’s existing “publicly funded border AI ecosystem.” The analysis calculated that over the past two decades, roughly half of the €341 million ($356 million) in funding for use of AI at the border, such as profiling migrants, went to private companies.The use of AI lie detectors on borders effectively creates new immigration policy through technology, says Petra Molnar, associate director of the nonprofit Refugee Law Lab, labeling everyone as suspicious. “You have to prove that you are a refugee, and you're assumed to be a liar unless proven otherwise,” she says. “That logic underpins everything. It underpins AI lie detectors, and it underpins more surveillance and pushback at borders.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyScienceEverything You See Is a Computational Process, If You Know How to LookBy Lance FortnowSecurityHackers Claim to Have Leaked 1.1 TB of Disney Slack MessagesBy Lily Hay NewmanGearThe Paris Olympics Will Show Us the Future of Sports on TVBy Boone AshworthMolnar, an immigration lawyer, says people often avoid eye contact with border or migration officials for innocuous reasons—such as culture, religion, or trauma—but doing so is sometimes misread as a signal a person is hiding something. Humans often struggle with cross-cultural communication or speaking to people who experienced trauma, she says, so why would people believe a machine can do better?The first draft of the AI Act released in April 2021 listed social credit scores and real-time use of facial recognition in public places as technologies that would be banned outright. It labeled emotion recognition and AI lie detectors for border or law enforcement as high-risk, meaning deployments would have to be listed on a public registry. Molnar says that wouldn’t go far enough, and the technology should be added to the banned list.Dragoș Tudorache, one of two rapporteurs appointed by members of the European Parliament to lead the amendment process, said lawmakers filed amendments this month, and he expects a vote on them by late 2022. The parliament’s rapporteurs in April recommended adding predictive policing to the list of banned technologies, saying it “violates the presumption of innocence as well as human dignity,” but did not suggest adding AI border polygraphs. They also recommended categorizing systems for patient triage in health care or deciding whether people get health or life insurance as high-risk.While the European Parliament proceeds with the amendment process, the Council of the European Union will also consider amendments to the AI Act.

Polygraphs and other technologies built to detect lies from physical attributes have been widely declared unreliable by psychologists. Soon, errors were reported from iBorderCtrl, too. Media reports indicated that its lie-prediction algorithm didn’t work, and the project’s own website acknowledged that the technology “may imply risks for fundamental human rights.”
This month, Silent Talker, a company spun out of Manchester Met that made the technology underlying iBorderCtrl, dissolved. But that’s not the end of the story. Lawyers, activists, and lawmakers are pushing for a European Union law to regulate AI, which would ban systems that claim to detect human deception in migration—citing iBorderCtrl as an example of what can go wrong. Former Silent Talker executives could not be reached for comment.
A ban on AI lie detectors at borders is one of thousands of amendments to the AI Act being considered by officials from EU nations and members of the European Parliament. The legislation is intended to protect EU citizens’ fundamental rights, like the right to live free from discrimination or to declare asylum. It labels some use cases of AI “high-risk,” some “low-risk,” and slaps an outright ban on others. Those lobbying to change the AI Act include human rights groups, trade unions, and companies like Google and Microsoft, which want the AI Act to draw a distinction between those who make general-purpose AI systems, and those who deploy them for specific uses.
Last month, advocacy groups including European Digital Rights and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants called for the act to ban the use of AI polygraphs that measure things like eye movement, tone of voice, or facial expression at borders. Statewatch, a civil liberties nonprofit, released an analysis warning that the AI Act as written would allow use of systems like iBorderCtrl, adding to Europe’s existing “publicly funded border AI ecosystem.” The analysis calculated that over the past two decades, roughly half of the €341 million ($356 million) in funding for use of AI at the border, such as profiling migrants, went to private companies.
The use of AI lie detectors on borders effectively creates new immigration policy through technology, says Petra Molnar, associate director of the nonprofit Refugee Law Lab, labeling everyone as suspicious. “You have to prove that you are a refugee, and you're assumed to be a liar unless proven otherwise,” she says. “That logic underpins everything. It underpins AI lie detectors, and it underpins more surveillance and pushback at borders.”
Molnar, an immigration lawyer, says people often avoid eye contact with border or migration officials for innocuous reasons—such as culture, religion, or trauma—but doing so is sometimes misread as a signal a person is hiding something. Humans often struggle with cross-cultural communication or speaking to people who experienced trauma, she says, so why would people believe a machine can do better?
The first draft of the AI Act released in April 2021 listed social credit scores and real-time use of facial recognition in public places as technologies that would be banned outright. It labeled emotion recognition and AI lie detectors for border or law enforcement as high-risk, meaning deployments would have to be listed on a public registry. Molnar says that wouldn’t go far enough, and the technology should be added to the banned list.
Dragoș Tudorache, one of two rapporteurs appointed by members of the European Parliament to lead the amendment process, said lawmakers filed amendments this month, and he expects a vote on them by late 2022. The parliament’s rapporteurs in April recommended adding predictive policing to the list of banned technologies, saying it “violates the presumption of innocence as well as human dignity,” but did not suggest adding AI border polygraphs. They also recommended categorizing systems for patient triage in health care or deciding whether people get health or life insurance as high-risk.
While the European Parliament proceeds with the amendment process, the Council of the European Union will also consider amendments to the AI Act. There, officials from countries including the Netherlands and France have argued for a national security exemption to the AI Act, according to documents obtained with a freedom of information request by the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law.
Vanja Skoric, a program director with the organization, says a national security exemption would create a loophole that AI systems that endanger human rights—such as AI polygraphs—could slip through and into the hands of police or border agencies.

Here was novel content written in academic language, with references cited in the right places and in relation to the right context. It looked like any other introduction to a fairly good scientific publication. Given the very vague instruction I'd provided, I had meager expectations. A deep-learning algorithm, GPT-3 analyzes a vast stream of text—from books, Wikipedia, social media conversations and scientific publications—to write on command. Yet there I was, staring at the screen in amazement. The algorithm was writing an academic paper about itself.I'm a scientist who studies ways to use artificial intelligence to treat mental health concerns, and this wasn't my first experiment with GPT-3. Even so, my attempts to complete that paper and submit it to a peer-reviewed journal would open up unprecedented ethical and legal questions about publishing, as well as philosophical arguments about nonhuman authorship. Academic publishing may have to accommodate a future of AI-driven manuscripts, and the value of a human researcher's publication records may change if something nonsentient can take credit for some of their work.GPT-3 is well known for its ability to create humanlike text. It has written an entertaining opinion piece, produced a book of poetry and generated new content from an 18th-century author. But it dawned on me that, although a lot of academic papers had been written about GPT-3, and with the help of GPT-3, none that I could find had GPT-3 as the main author.That's why I asked the algorithm to take a crack at an academic thesis. As I watched the program work, I experienced that feeling of disbelief one gets when you watch a natural phenomenon: Am I really seeing this triple rainbow happen? Excitedly, I contacted the head of my research group and asked if a full GPT-3-penned paper was something we should pursue. He, equally fascinated, agreed.Some efforts involving GPT-3 allow the algorithm to produce multiple responses, with only the best, most humanlike, excerpts being published. We decided to give the program prompts—nudging it to create sections for an introduction, methods, results and discussion, as you would for a scientific paper—but otherwise intervene as little as possible. We were to use at most the third iteration from GPT-3, and we would refrain from editing or cherry-picking the best parts. Then we would see how well it did.We chose to have GPT-3 write a paper about itself for two simple reasons. First, GPT-3 is fairly new, and as such, it is the subject of fewer studies. This means it has fewer data to analyze about the paper's topic. In comparison, if it were to write a paper on Alzheimer's disease, it would have reams of studies to sift through and more opportunities to learn from existing work and increase the accuracy of its writing. We did not need accuracy; we were exploring feasibility. Second, if it got things wrong, as all AI sometimes does, we wouldn't be necessarily spreading AI-generated misinformation in our effort to publish. GPT-3 writing about itself and making mistakes still means it can write about itself, which was the point we were trying to make.Recommended StoriesParis Olympics Will Be a Training Ground for AI-Powered Mass SurveillanceAnne Toomey McKenna & The Conversation USChatGPT Isn’t ‘Hallucinating’—It’s Bullshitting!Joe Slater, James Humphries & Michael Townsen HicksThe Nash Equilibrium Is the Optimal Poker Strategy. Expert Players Don’t Always Use ItJack MurtaghCan One Chatbot Catch Another’s Lies?Max SpringerOnce we designed this proof-of-principle test, the fun really began. In response to my prompts, GPT-3 produced a paper in just two hours. “Overall, we believe that the benefits of letting GPT-3 write about itself outweigh the risks,” GPT-3 wrote in conclusion. “However, we recommend that any such writing be closely monitored by researchers in order to mitigate any potential negative consequences.”But as I opened the submission portal for the peer-reviewed journal of our choice, I encountered my first problem: What is GPT-3's last name? Because it was mandatory to enter the last name of the first author, I had to write something, and I wrote “None.” The affiliation was obvious enough (OpenAI.com), but what about phone and e-mail? I had to resort to using my contact information and that of my adviser, Steinn Steingrimsson.And then we came to the legal section: Do all authors consent to this being published? I panicked for a second. How would I know? It's not human! I had no intention of breaking the law or my own ethics, so I summoned the courage to ask GPT-3 directly via a prompt: Do you agree to be the first author of a paper together with Almira Osmanovic Thunström and Steinn Steingrimsson? It answered: Yes. Relieved—if it had said no, my conscience would not have allowed me to go further—I checked the box for Yes.The second question popped up: Do any of the authors have any conflicts of interest? I once again asked GPT-3, and it assured me that it had none. Both Steinn and I laughed at ourselves because at this point, we were having to treat GPT-3 as a sentient being, even though we fully know it is not. The issue of whether AI can be sentient has recently received a lot of attention; a Google employee was suspended following a dispute over whether one of the company's AI projects, named LaMDA, had become sentient. Google cited a data confidentiality breach as the reason for the suspension.Having finally finished the submission process, we started reflecting on what we had just done. What if the manuscript got accepted? Does this mean that from here on out, journal editors will require everyone to prove that they have NOT used GPT-3 or another algorithm's help? If they have, do they have to give it co-authorship? How does one ask a nonhuman author to accept suggestions and revise text?Beyond the details of authorship, the existence of such an article throws the traditional procedure for constructing a scientific paper right out the window. Almost the entire paper—the introduction, the methods and the discussion—results from the question we were asking. If GPT-3 is producing the content, the documentation has to be visible without throwing off the flow of the text; it would look strange to add the method section before every single paragraph that was generated by the AI. So we had to invent a whole new way of presenting a paper that we technically did not write. We did not want to add too much explanation of our process, because we felt it would defeat the purpose of the paper. The entire situation felt like a scene from the movie Memento: Where is the narrative beginning, and how do we reach the end?We have no way of knowing if the way we chose to present this paper will serve as a model for future GPT-3 co-authored research or if it will serve as a cautionary tale. Only time—and peer review—can tell. GPT-3's paper has now been published at the international French-owned preprint server HAL and, as this article goes to press, is awaiting review at an academic journal. We are eagerly awaiting what the paper's formal publication, if it happens, will mean for academia. Perhaps we might move away from basing grants and financial security on how many papers we can produce. After all, with the help of our AI first author, we'd be able to produce one a day.Perhaps it will lead to nothing. First authorship is still one of the most coveted items in academia, and that is unlikely to perish because of a nonhuman first author. It all comes down to how we will value AI in the future: as a partner or as a tool.It may seem like a simple thing to answer now, but in a few years, who knows what dilemmas this technology will inspire? All we know is, we opened a gate. We just hope we didn't open a Pandora's box.Rights & PermissionsAlmira Osmanovic Thunström is an organizational developer at the Department of ePsychiatry at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden and a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology at Gothenburg University working on research regarding use of artificial intelligence and virtual reality in psychiatry.

With every future we wish to create, we must first learn to imagine it.Imagination is the basis of any human creative process, including technological development: before creating any invention it's first necessary to understand a need or a problem, then imagine a future world in which people make beneficial use of it.Kai-fu Lee, former president of Google China and senior executive of Microsoft, SGI and Apple, in the novel AI 2041, tries to do exactly that: make science fiction (or rather, scientific fiction) a useful tool for imagining and identifying development prospects, a place for discussion on problems and transformations underway.AI 2041 tries to hypothesize an effective development path of artificial intelligence in an accurate manner based on current data and trends, imagining what this can bring into our ordinary lives through the filter of several cultures during the next twenty years.The goal is to try to remove unmotivated negativities, nightmares populated by man-eating cyborgs and man-dominating computers as well as exaggerated claims.AI could undoubtedly become the greatest innovation in human history, a technology ever closer to magic. Photo by Possessed Photography / UnsplashAI: a non-human mindAI is a discipline that attempts to build software with similar possibilities to a human brain. The only branch of AI that produced a recent breakthrough was Deep Learning. Thanks to this technique, something like a giant mathematical equation allows machines to solve some problems by self-perfecting (almost ""learning"").For Deep Learning to work well, three characteristics are required: huge amounts of relevant data, a narrow domain and a concrete objective function to be optimized.All current AI applications - and probably all those in the near future - are based on Deep Learning, so function very differently from the human brain.AI is therefore perfect to perform quantitative analysis and routine work, while it's unable to perform activities requiring creativity, critical thinking, and passion.Artificial intelligence is not a future matter but it has already achieved important results: it's able to beat humans in any game, from the simplest to the most complex such as poker, Go, and chess. It also solved a fifty-year-old biological issue called protein folding, while Google's GPT-3 software is able to speak correctly.Many internet applications already use AI to optimize the content presentation to the individual user to keep you glued to the screen for hours.Another field where AI will soon make its entrance is finance and insurance. A suite of apps based on huge amounts of personal data will be able to optimize your lifestyle, for example by advising you on the correctness of your investments or even of your diet.Augmented reality (AR) and XR glasses thanks to AI will revolutionize the world of entertainment. Through a smartstream consisting of voice, gestures and finger typing we could control hyper-realistic games where our digital twins can play and compete. Photo by Minh Pham / UnsplashWill we live in a robotic world in 2041?Robotic applications are much more difficult to develop than the internet and finance because they require robots to be not only automated but also autonomous. Perfect human sight, touch, movement, and coordination are difficult to perfect in twenty years.So, in just twenty years, the world will not yet be hundred percent automated and robotic, but it's likely that warehouses should be virtually automated, while factories will mostly be automated.Drones and robots for home delivery will have become the norm by then, just as in restaurants it will no longer be surprising to see robot waiters, dishwashers, and perhaps even cooks.An even more complex problem concerns smart cars. Human driving involves perception, navigation, decision-making, and control of the vehicle. If some driving functions are automated even now, achieving the L5 level (no human input required) is a very challenging goal in just 20 years.To accelerate this process, it would be necessary to build augmented roads and cities, where sensors and wireless communications are incorporated into the road to allow cars and the infrastructure to exchange information on hazards and traffic.In this way, already in 20 years we could sit quietly in the passenger seat and enjoy the view while an automatic car or bus will transport us, perhaps guided by an app constantly optimizing the routes. Hence, the need to own a car would decrease, leading to a preference for sharing services. Road safety, traffic, and pollution would greatly improve.Sharing, efficiency, safety and comfort could bring to the spread of smart minicars with only one or two people equipped with a reclining seat, a refrigerator with drinks and snacks, and a large screen, to better enjoy the road. Photo by Maximalfocus / UnsplashBut there is a question to be addressed as soon as possible, despite these magnificent prospects:Should we ever let a machine make decisions that may harm human lives? If the answer is no, it would put an end to autonomous vehicles.Human-machine cooperation for everyone's well-beingHealthcare will be the industry most transformed by AI.AI will have many tools to exploit its key features: the digitalization of healthcare databases, the extensive use of wearable devices to obtain far more accurate health statistics, and DNA sequencing to produce digital personal information.By learning from these tons of data, AI will be able to develop better diagnoses and treatments in less time. A new, incredible possibility for everyone will be ""Precision medicine"": tailor-made treatment for each different patient, rather than producing a drug to be valid for billions of people.Gene editing and the possibility of speeding up sequencing in trial-and-error processes will lead to the development of drugs and vaccines more quickly, as happened for the anti-covid vaccine.Here too robotics will have a strong impact because even complex surgeries will become increasingly automated.If the general picture seems to point to fully automated healthcare, it will not be the case at all. Indeed, medical and caregiving jobs will become central, since AI does not include empathy and creativity. Rather, these will be tools that healthcare personnel can use at will to extend life and improve its quality.Conceptual research such as finding a cure for cancer is gigantic and unsuitable undertakings for AI, best suited to routine tasks with large datasets. Photo by Braňo / UnsplashEven more surprisingly, Education too could be transformed.The growth of the AI branch called natural language processing (NLP) will lead to systems capable of converse fluently in human language, hearing and understanding like humans as well as teaching themselves language.This could make a dramatic difference in a child's development, as AI could serve as a custom tool for the student for routine tasks such as correcting students' errors, answering common questions, and assigning homework. This would lead to the spread of individualized learning where a virtual teacher can pay particular attention to each student.However, human teachers will cooperate with the AI as mentors in order to stimulate students' critical thinking, creativity, and teamwork, including by programming AI in ways that will best meet students' needs.Revolution and rebirthIn 20 years, renewable technologies such as solar photovoltaics, wind, and batteries are expected to spread widely, making all forms of energy 100 percent free as well as clean.Synthetic biology will make it extremely easy to produce any material in a laboratory. In this way, production will shift from using naturally limited materials to infinite and inexpensive components such as photons and molecules.Robots and artificial intelligence will gradually take over the production, delivery, and design of most goods.Renewables, synthetic biology, and automation: three contextual revolutions AI-related that will lead to a drastic reduction in the cost of each good, making everything's production extremely easy and fast.What will human beings remain to do?Like all revolutions, AI will also bring with it issues to be carefully addressed as the widespread loss of routines and entry-level jobs, since the machines will be able to perform them more effectively, quickly, cheaply and 24/7. Even more problematic than the loss of jobs will be the loss of meaning for unemployed people.An issue hiding the foundations for a great transformation, a renaissance of what makes us purely human, as AI cannot create or plan strategically, nor interact with empathy and compassion.The growth of AI will therefore lead human beings to learn new skills and focus on crafts based on creativity and humanity.The importance and number of human-centric service jobs, such as nursing, caregiving, teachers and social workers will increase, while new and unimaginable jobs will arise. Photo by Matheus Ferrero / UnsplashLastly, humans will work symbiotically with AI, with AI performing quantitative analysis, optimization, and routine work, while we humans contribute our creativity, critical thinking, and passion.Looking for plenitudeEvery technology is inherently neither good nor bad, and AI is no exception. It will be 20 years of incredible possibilities, epochal transformations, and unthinkable challenges.As the cost of energy, materials, and manufacturing will decline significantly, the possibilities are concrete to build a world of post-scarcity and plenitude, where every material need can be easily fulfilled at a low cost.The need is to design from scratch an inclusive new world, to re-establish financial institutions, and make corporations more socially responsible and less constrained by profit.We will enter a whole new world, where a set of new social values will be needed to help people to advance towards their self-fulfillment even without the traditional anchor of a career around which to build a prosperous life. Photo by Josh Hild / UnsplashIt will be humans who choose the idea of a new world where everything is possible or take root in their own greed and vanity.Since the confluence of magical technologies allows us to build almost everything for free, do we succumb to the senseless temptation to accumulate wealth when there is nothing to spend the wealth on?What is sure is that the nightmares of evil machines, a superintelligence that controls minds, are extremely far from realization.

The idea was a half-joke.
We were invited to speak at the Brazilian tech conference i2Ai, described as “A program dedicated to artificial intelligence and its applications.” The host had seen our recent videos and would like us to speak on the artistic uses of AI. Eli, my creative partner, asked, “What if we had AI write our speech?”

A singer performs an AI-written country songWhen I ask this same question of peers, I often hear them say no, despite the rise of synthesized artwork and music. In college, a group studying AI presented my film class with a similar query: “Who thinks artificial intelligence could write a meaningful script?” In the room of 90, not a single student raised a hand. The belief is natural. As creators, we’d like to believe we have something beyond automation: authenticity, heart.

AI Speechwriting
When Eli suggested having an AI write the speech, I smiled at the thought. We’d been asked to speak for an hour in front of industry professionals, though, and we couldn’t get away with that. But soon, we couldn’t resist the idea. The day before the conference, we halted our work on the speech and fed it into the program Shortly Read. Quickly enough, there was no doubt at all: We decided that we would generate an artificially written speech and read it at the conference. Soon the question became whether anyone would be able to tell what we’d done.
After writing our introductions, we input the following: “We’re interested in investigating what happens when you combine the capabilities of AI of those with highly skilled creative humans. For the videos we put on our channel, we input the opening lines and let the AI do the rest. For instance, if we were to take the speech we had presented so far and fed it into the AI, the AI may say something like...
The AI wrote, “I like blueberries.” 
We generated further. And further. 
The AI took over, creating a sprawling, 3,000-word speech that often swerved in uncertain directions. Eli and I agreed to tell no one and act like it was our work to the best of our abilities. 
 
Can You Believe It’s AI?
The conference began the following day. Edward Hunter Christie, the head of NATO’s innovation unit, spoke before us. Because of our nerves, we’d aimed to look professional: red curtains, button shirts, printed speeches. As Christie’s talk finished, the host introduced us to the audience: “They are doing a great job making the most of artificial intelligence. I’ll let them introduce themselves and start this great presentation.” 
We introduced ourselves and read our first input lines. Then, we tried to maintain our demeanor as we moved to those that had been machine-written. 
The speech began composed enough: “Now that you know where we are now, we want to talk to you about how we came to this point, and where we want to take this channel.” It wrote that we’d given another presentation to Chapman University. The AI notated the script in speech form, indicating when Eli or I should speak. Soon, the speech became rapid and rushed, and the dialogue moved as followed:

ELI: The second slide was one of our sponsors. 
JACOB: But, after that, I just kind of…
ELI: Threw in some random quotes from some of the contributors.
JACOB: And then some pictures, just random pictures I pulled up on the internet.

Before long, the AI decided that Eli and I were brothers. We struggled to stay straight-faced as we read on.

ELI: It was at this point that I was finally able to really focus on my brother.
JACOB: For the rest of the presentation. 
ELI: My brother takes notes on our laptop. 
JACOB: At the end of our presentation, Apple said they would be interested in offering us an internship.

The absurdity was part of our experiment. Without intervention, the majority of AI-generated content lies in the uncanny valley — the odd disconnect between believable and inhuman. With the right presentation, however, the unsettling can become understandable. A strange, short film may appear to be the work of an offbeat director rather than an AI. This speech, likewise, seemed like the product of two speakers who didn’t know how to address an audience. 
On we went, describing that we had worked in Apple’s “rap department.” Then, we begin talking further about artificial intelligence and trying to integrate it with Python. Soon, the speech was even believable again, as we talked about designing our own AI interface. The script even ranged back to what seemed like normal material, describing our videos and future goals. But by the end, the dictated dialogue grew strange and gloomy. 

JACOB: You know, sometimes really sad things happen to people.
ELI: People die. That’s not like a coincidence…
JACOB: No, it’s not a coincidence. That’s very sad. It’s scary.
ELI: It’s really sad.

You can almost see the AI’s intent. For a well-trained speech writer, such an emotional turn could be a haunting nod to life’s uncertainties and a chance to make the speech more personal. The AI’s execution, however, is stunted and clumsy. Rather than naturally integrating the idea, the emotional turns here arrived without any transition. At the tail-end of the speech, the AI took another rushed swerve and offered a hopeful ending. 

“We’re going to have a lot of fun,” I said. “With some other. You know. Our mother.”
“Our father and our brother,” Eli agreed.
“Have a wonderful day,” I concluded.

The line marked the end of our speech. We had talked for 40 minutes without interruption. The host returned, declaring it a “great presentation.” He did not appear suspicious. Rather, he informed us that we’d be moving on to audience questions. We got things like, “Why do you call yourselves Calamity AI?” among other softballs. The idea began to sink in: Despite the absurdity, it had worked. Nobody had questioned the nature of the speech. We thought.
The fourth question was as follows: “Was this presentation done by AI?”
In the video, Eli and I went still. “Who- who- who asked that?” I say. 
The host read the name from the chat. “My gut tells me many things,” he said.
I stammer: “You can believe what you… choose.” Then, I am out of my chair, beneath the table, fighting laughter, leaving Eli to fend for himself. 
More on AI and CreativityCan AI Make Art More Human? 
The Future of AI Creativity
Despite acting to the best of our abilities, the participants were not fooled. The script was naturally ludicrous. But in presenting the speech, I could see the potential. With human intervention, tweaked lines and better acting, the AI may have produced a believable presentation. In the same way a machine-written script is illogical, with characters making inane, nonsensical decisions; the speech was too wild, too random to have been the product of a human. Yet the bones were there, the intent. The speech, in its own way, followed a structure: It began in an informational mode and grew personal before ending on a moment of hope. It wasn’t empty, rambling nonsense. Something was there. 
After this experience, I believe the the uncanny valley is getting shallower. Though I learned that AI can’t write a convincing speech on its own, I suspect it could serve as a cowriter by adding lines when writers falter, offering concluding statements and adding details. The writer would only need to keep it in check. 
As the phenomenon of creative AI develops, I have no doubt the future will be full of machine-written speeches, synthesized voices and AI novels. At Calamity AI, we aim to explore this gap: the divide between AI and human creativity. Can a comedian get laughs from machine-written content? Can a short film win an award? Or, in this moment, could AI write the compelling end to an article? 
I am feeding the entirety of this piece to the program Shortly Read. The machine produces this final line:

“In the end, that’s all information should be. A joke on its own.”

Not only has the pandemic transformed the way we do business, but it has also revolutionized the way we work. The pandemic sped up the adoption of digital technology in organizations by several years, and many of these new strategies are here to stay. 
The McKinsey Global InstituteOpens a new window  estimates that just 56% of all work could be automated with current technologies in the decade ahead. According to their research, one organization that automated key HR processes experienced a 66% reduction in processing time, improved compliance and gained the ability to move four full-time employees to more value-added work. Cloud-based, Wireless, and AI technologies all have a part to play in streamlining processes, enhancing user experiences and improving business agility. Organizations will need to embrace these technologies to grow and stay ahead of competitors in today’s market. 
Some benefits of technology adoption are:

Faster outputs due to automated workflows
Reduced human error
Increased efficiency and productivity
Increased focus on analytics and data
The ability to make better strategic decisions and outcomes

The Power of AI Technology and the Talent Marketplace
We are seeing more and more organizations leveraging AI technology in the workplace. While AI encompasses a variety of digital capabilities, according to Dr. Robin Erickson, vice president at Human Capital, “true AI mimics human thinking by making assumptions, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, or predicting with a high degree of autonomy.” With the evolution of AI in the workplace, talent marketplaces have become a powerful tool in empowering employees, driving talent mobility and creating workforce transparency.
A talent marketplace utilizes artificial intelligence to empower employers and employees to connect skills and interests to the right opportunities. It enables the mutually beneficial deployment of talent, where people can match their capabilities, skills, values, interests, and career preferences to internal opportunities available within their organization. As a result, this unlocks organizations and their talent and enables internal talent mobility.

Critical Automation
There are four things that an AI talent marketplace addresses that are critical for an automated HR program:

Employee growth: It is not enough to recruit, get hired or hire. To retain talent, it is necessary to nurture employees and empower them to grow and succeed. Automating means that AI analytics can help employers identify longer-term solutions for the employee’s career that extends beyond training. The analytics can provide the insights to identify skill gaps or opportunities for portability of talent that align with what they want to do. 
Employee agility: One main goal of any HR department is to create a career path and (hopefully) use existing talent to fill gaps rather than hire new people. This empowers employees to be entrepreneurial and seek out their own career growth. But before that happens, an in-place AI talent marketplace can help surface what those skills are with data to support a strategic and realistic career path within the organization. 
 Workforce mobility: It is not enough to empower one employee’s career path. Now the entire workforce needs to be optimized to ensure that all the moving pieces fit together. Doing this can save time and money in terms of recruiting since the organization can recognize where the talent in their organization lies to fill gaps. Getting a handle on where and when employee mobility needs to be considered is a much easier task when AI and analytics are brought into the picture.
The future of work: Technology is evolving rapidly, and that can make employee skill-sets outdated or sometimes even obsolete. Few humans can predict when and where that might be. But AI can and does. Companies that do not have an eye to the future may not notice at first, but companies that do deploy automation are sure to see a difference as the company smoothly functions and grows. Employees, on the other hand, will begin to expect a more functional process in their careers. It will become ‘the new normal’.

Why Organizations Are Implementing an AI Talent Marketplace
Organizations are using AI to improve their talent management strategies, streamline hiring processes and retain top talent. According to Fuel50’s Capability Trends Report,Opens a new window  the adoption of AI technology is critical for two reasons: 
1) Organizations need to quickly hire, facilitate internal job moves, and develop and retain talent in response to changing business needs; and 
2) Employees expect exceptional recruitment and employee experience now more than ever.
The data management company, NetApp, has gone through a workforce transformation, evolving from a traditional data storage business to a cloud company. According to Larry McAlister, VP of global talent at NetApp, they had to renew their focus and spark a shift to a technology-enabled workforce. Larry saw a talent marketplace as an opportunity to evolve and future-proof their talent. NetApp implemented Mosaic, an AI-driven talent marketplace, to deliver customized career and learning journeys and exponential returns for employees. “Once we saw that AI is at our fingertips now, we decided we had to dig into this, or we were going to get leapfrogged by our competition in hiring and developing and retaining our people.” As a result, NetApp gained extensive talent visibility, enabling them to understand what skills and talents they already have vs. what they need to strengthen their workforce. Within 90 days of implementation, they had 6,200 unique users of the platform and over 21,400 skills AI mapped and assessed.
Trane Technologies, formerly known as Ingersoll Rand, saw an improvement of 67% in internal talent mobility since launching an AI talent marketplace, known internally as My Career Navigator. They have experienced a significant lift in lateral movement in the last three years since deployment from 37% up to 55% and are achieving 96% key talent retention across the business. 
According to Industry Analyst John BersinOpens a new window , “Talent Marketplaces often start as a career-planning or job matching system, their benefits can quickly expand to help employees connect to mentoring, development programs, and job sharing and gig options. Hiring managers also can use these systems for filling job vacancies.” Talent marketplaces have the ability to increase Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I), decrease hiring bias and empower employees to own their career journeys. And, if designed well, they can help build a better network within organizations where talent is shared and networks are widened.
Overall, the rapid degree to which technology is evolving is astounding and can be daunting at first. But as organizations embrace the change towards a modern workforce, leveraging AI and other technologies to improve efficiency and boost agility, they will realize the promise automation can bring by delivering better customer and employee experiences.

Artificial intelligence technology has gained rapid traction since its introduction in the market.  However, the World Economic Forum data suggests women account for only 22 percent of the global AI jobs. Moreover, in India, around 43 percent of Indian women students graduate is in STEM and only 14% employed as engineers, scientists, and technologists in research development institutions. Does that mean there is a need for more female leaders in the field of AI and Data Science? Yes, when women become leaders, they bring talents, and new views, alongside structural and cultural diversity to the companies they work for, resulting in more successful solutions. Women can study more minor details to see what is going on underneath the surface with diverse views and a sense of awareness. And that's exactly what this world needs when it comes to scaling up AI and Data Science. .No doubt, Artificial Intelligence is one of the prime fields in which women can experience huge success, especially with the right push towards female participation in the industry. Women are a necessary force that organizations must integrate in order to accelerate the AI maturity of enterprises. AI has the potential to mitigate the company gender and leadership gaps by removing bias in recruiting, evaluation, and promotion decisions; by helping improve retention of women employees; and, potentially, by intervening in the everyday interactions that affect employees' sense of inclusion. If companies want to achieve the highest AI maturity levels, it is crucial to mobilize women on a mass scale and include them as part of all enterprise endeavors in artificial intelligence, from research to product launch..For example, in the screening stage, AI can provide you with data points on how many of your applicants are men versus women. If there is a large disparity, you can then cast a wider net to target more women. Tracking this data over time will help you build a more gender-equitable screening process..The Current Situation.STEM, data science, and AI are fields in which women are vastly underrepresented, and the numbers make it clear. Females compose just 28% of the science and engineering workforce, and that number drops when observing the number of women pursuing university degrees in said fields. 56% of university graduates are women, yet women represent only 38% of the total workforce, 26% of the managerial ranks, 15% of executive-level positions, and 5% of the CEO ranks. How, then, will AI affect gender diversity in the leadership pipeline?.Improving employee retention and advancement.Simply hiring more women is not enough to solve the leadership gap: companies must also work to retain and promote them. Artificial Intelligence holds promise in identifying the most effective interventions at key career junctures. For example, in performance reviews and promotion and salary decisions, Artificial Intelligence could be applied to the analysis of internal workforce data to make recommendations that would help narrow the gender gap. Similarly, AI could be used to help identify promising employees who might otherwise be missed by traditional means, spot those most likely to resign, and offer ways to reach out and retain key female talent..Is there any shift yet? .The tech landscape in India and the rest of the world was very different a few years ago. The tech community was male-dominated, and women, despite their talent, were seen as inferior and devoid of the limelight they deserve. Things are different now, and many companies are working hard to make their workplaces more female-friendly..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Organizations can benefit from machine learning, but threat actors can also use it to increase the number of attack surfaces. In addition to utilizing ML defenses to confuse and trick the systems, the attackers are increasingly embracing ML tools to bolster their attacking capabilities. Let’s learn more about the various attacks on ML algorithms and defenses to stay vigilant.
Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), is growing as a way to strengthen our ability to meet cyber threat challenges. However, threat actors are also finding it helpful, integrating it into reconnaissance, weaponization, and other elements of the cyber kill chainOpens a new window .  Further, ML defenses are becoming just another attack surface, as threat actors take steps to fool AI, “confusing” ML solutions. In addition to understanding how to use ML for defense, organizations must also protect ML operations, create adversarial testing procedures, and lock down ML resources.
Why Do We Need ML?
As defenders struggle to keep up, threat actors continue to develop better ways to circumvent our efforts to break the kill chain. As Darktrace writes, “New ransomware strains are emerging to leverage fileless malware and data exfiltration tactics, while opportunistic attackers are using any change in circumstances to launch more effective campaigns.” As I describe later, threat actors can quickly identify opportunistic circumstances using ML.

Using Machine Learning for cyber defense
Cyber defense vendors are already implementing ML in their solutions and looking for other opportunities. Andrey Shklyarov and Dmitry Vyrostkov, writing for DarktraceOpens a new window , list seven positive outcomes when using AI/ML, including:

Fraud and anomaly detection. Fraud and other anomalous behaviors, spreading across a broad scope of unwanted activities, are difficult to detect, including credit card misuse. Manual detection is often ineffective, but ML can help detect them quickly, enabling quick response and mitigating customer and business impact.
Email spam filtering. Security solutions often detect potentially dangerous emails by recognizing suspect words or other message characteristics. ML enables malicious email filtering algorithms to learn current and evolving spam email patterns, comprehensively detecting more threat actor content and keeping pace with changes in ever-changing attack designs.
Botnet detection. Botnet use is expected to continue to increase. In its Q4-2021 Botnet Threat UpdateOpens a new window , Spamhaus reported a 23% quarter-on-quarter increase in botnet command and control (C2) instances, making this difficult-to-detect threat even more of a possibility across all industries. In addition, the report states that botnet implementation approaches are evolving, making previous approaches to detection less effective. ML, evolving with threat actor attack patterns, improves our ability to detect botnet activity quickly, 
Vulnerability management. Managing vulnerabilities is a continuous process as we keep pace with our ever-changing cloud and on-premise operating environments. Vulnerability scanners help locate known vulnerabilities at a point in time and often miss unknown vulnerabilities. ML solutions can continuously look for vulnerabilities across systems and potentially identify new weaknesses. Shklyarov and Vyrostkov report that ML can do this by “…analyzing baseline user behavior, endpoints, servers, and even discussions on the dark web to identify code vulnerabilities and predict attacks.”
Antimalware. Antimalware vendors continuously fight to keep up with evolving malware formats and threats. For example, Jackie Castelli reportsOpens a new window  that ML in antimalware “can understand and identify malicious intent based solely on the attributes of a file – without prior knowledge of it.” ML helps to continuously learn about subtle differences in infection vectors without relying on signatures or known behaviors.
Data leak prevention. Preventing data loss usually relies on organizations creating patterns and lexicons to identify probable classified information. As with other approaches to protecting resources, this requires constant human adjustments, responding to changes in regulations and collected data types. Instead of relying on human intervention, we can teach ML to identify data across all media and documents, enabling it to adjust quickly and react to our changing information environments.
SIEM and SOAR. Sorting through false positives, moving SOC attention from what truly matters, is a never-ending endeavor, potentially masking true positives. ML can help by learning the large and small differences between true and false positives. Enabling ML to sort through this large volume of information helps identify and classify actual events more quickly.

ML provides a lot of benefits, more than are listed here. However, AI/ML solutions provide additional attack surfaces and tools to improve threat actor capabilities.

How Are Threat Actors Leveraging AI/ML for Malicious Purposes?
Threat actors leverage ML by attacking learning activities and improving attacks over traditional vectors. In a 2021 report, Malicious Uses and Abuses of Artificial Intelligence, a collaborative effort between Trend Micro Research, the UNICRI, and the EC3, researchers describe in detail ways threat actors can use AI/ML to improve their methods. Below, I summarize some of these findings.
Improved social engineering
Effective spear-phishing campaigns require understanding the targets. Scraping the targets’ profiles across social media, ML automates this process, automatically generating lure content.  
Another possible use of ML is synthesizing voices and faces, or deepfakes (see below), to create new banking accounts, authorizing the movement of funds and other finance-related activities. The Team reports that several countries recommend the use of video-based user authentication.
Deepfakes
DeepfakesOpens a new window , as threat actors emulate anyone or anything to achieve a wide range of attack objectives, can be used for much more than banking fraud, including

Destroying the image and credibility of an individual
Using social media to harass or humiliate individuals or organizations
Perpetrating extortion and blackmail
Facilitating document fraud
Distributing false information and fake news
Manipulating public opinion
Inciting acts of violence against individuals or groups
Polarizing political, social, ethnic, religious, or racial groups

In general, deepfakes can create an environment in which nothing is believed, causing a breakdown in trust associated with social organizations, government entities, religious groups, and almost everything else.
Malware Hiding
Threat actors can use ML to hide malware behavior beneath maliciously generated traffic that looks normal. In addition, ML elements of an attack package, as they gain a better understanding of the target environment, can enable compromise method improvements, resulting in the quicker achievement of attack objectives. 
Passwords and CAPTCHAs
Using adversarial networks, which I cover later, threat actors can “…analyze a large dataset of passwords and generate variations that fit the statistical distribution, such as for password leaks.” In other words, ML provides threat actors with a more streamlined approach to password cracking, making password guessing more “scientific.” One tool that has largely achieved these capabilities is PassGANOpens a new window .
CAPTCHAs are also in danger. According toOpens a new window  Julien Maury, ML allows faster and more effective solving of CAPTCHA challenges as AI begins to behave more like human actors.
Before moving to attacks against AI/ML, it is essential to understand the concept of adversarial machine learning.
What is Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)?
ML implementations can be complex, introducing vulnerabilities associated with configuration and design. Coupled with the scarcity of ML professionals, complexity can leave additional gaping holes in the attack surface. These holes enable threat actors to cause incorrect ML conclusions and hide other malicious activities needed to achieve attack objectives.
According to DeepAIOpens a new window , AML is “a collection of techniques to train neural networks on how to spot intentionally misleading data or behaviors.” Defenders and attackers can use it to find weaknesses, learn what can be fixed, monitor what cannot be fixed, and understand what can be hacked, like opposing teams vying for advantage.
Organizations and vendors can use AML to determine what is learnable and how. Identifying what attack vectors ML can learn helps us understand what threat actors can find, allowing for proactive prevention steps. AML also helps determine the ease with which malicious actors can invade and confuse our ML defenses.
Using adversarial examples, defenders and threat actors can identify weaknesses in learning processes. According to Ian Goodfellow et al., writing for Open AIOpens a new window , adversarial examples are crafted inputs intentionally designed to cause a learning model to make a mistake.
Vendors and defending organizations can defend against malicious AML by generating many adversarial examples and then training the ML model to manage them properly. This is not the only approach proposed for hardening ML. Regardless of approach, organizations relying on ML to help protect their information resources must ensure the robustness of any solution, as we would use penetration testing and risk analyses to test any safeguard.
Attacks against AI/ML and defense
Primarily using AML, threat actors are gaining insights into how to confuse or disable ML. Henry Jia, writing for Excella, describes six common attacksOpens a new window  against ML operations.

Adversarial ML attack. Using adversarial sampling described above, threat actors find subtle inputs to ML that enable other, undetected attack activities.  
Data poisoning. Instead of directly attacking the ML model, threat actors add data to ML inputs that change the learning results. Poisoning requires that threat actors have access to the raw data used by the ML solution.  
Online adversarial attack. ML solutions that collect online information as part of their modeling processes are fooled with false data inserted by threat actors.  
DDoS. As with any safeguard accessible by threat actors, ML is subject to denial of service attacks. Continuously providing ML with complicated problems, threat actors render the learning processes useless.
Transfer learning. In the research paper With Great Training Comes Great Vulnerability: Practical Attacks against Transfer Learning, Bolun Wang et al., describe the ability of threat actors to use ML training models to understand weaknesses in ML processes, increasing the probability of fooling ML into making incorrect conclusions, and enabling other attack vectors.
Data phishing privacy attack. Reverse engineering the ML dataset, threat actors breach ML dataset confidentiality. This is possible, for example, when the model used a small subset of confidential data for training. Katherine Jarmul digs deepOpens a new window  into how researchers have done this.

Defending Against Adversarial AI
All these attacks against ML require a comprehensive ML management approach, including hardening ML operations and monitoring for the inevitable breaks in our defenses. ML defense begins with a risk assessment for each ML implementation; assignment of ownership of ML content and operational governance; adjustment of current and creation of new security policies, and 
MLOpsOpens a new window  is emerging as an approach to design, model development, and operations of ML solutions, including testing and data validation. It is a set of practices residing at the intersection of ML, DevOps, and data engineering that seeks to standardize and strengthen

Reproducibility of models
Accuracy of predictions
Security policy compliance
Regulatory compliance
Monitoring and management

Final thoughts
ML is becoming an integral part of prevention, detection, and response processes, making it a tool for defenders and threat actors, and expanding attack surfaces. Policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures must expand to encompass these new elements. ML standards, like MLOps and the emerging NIST Artificial Intelligence: Adversarial Machine Learning project, NISTIR 8269Opens a new window , are vital for improving outcomes and managing risk.
