Researchers from the Oxford Martin School have investigated the potential Generative AI has in transforming work across industries, boosting productivity and democratising innovation.

Contributing to a Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions report, they explored the opportunities and challenges of Generative AI – artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media – as well as highlighting the unsurprising attention policymakers around the world are paying to AI in general.
The researchers reported that Generative AI could drive a wave of potential opportunities for the technology value stack, as follows:
Silicon – it is expected that Generative AI will fuel significant growth across the supply chain, led by greater demand for computing resources, networking, and memory chips.Infrastructure & Platforms – so-called hyperscalers such as cloud providers are working to build the underlying infrastructure that enables Generative AI applications, but over time the researchers expect to see more differentiation in this domain e.g. in the types of solutions offered, performance and pricing.Models and Machine Learning Operations – the open-source community is likely to be a key driver of innovation in this layer, which encompasses all types of models facilitating Generative AI.Software and Applications – the researchers expect nearly all software companies to be impacted in some form by Generative AI, but company-specific execution will be critical in navigating what is a fluid landscape.Services – it is believed that Generative AI represents a step forward from ongoing AI/automation initiatives across the IT and Business Process Management services.Ian Goldin, Professor of Globalization and Development at the University of Oxford and report co-author, said:
‘Generative AI is a dual edged sword that offers enormous potential to accelerate solutions to a number of the world’s greatest challenges, with new health cures, energy and innovation. But it also could destroy jobs, undermine democracy and widen inequalities and the divisions within our society and between countries.
‘The challenge now is to develop the regulatory frameworks and guardrails required to ensure its benefits are widely shared and sustained.’
The report also highlights a series of challenges associated with the rise of Generative AI, including that:
data used to train Generative AI systems are susceptible to bias or inaccuracies, for example where gender and race are concerned;the economics associated with the operation of large language models could trigger further increases in inequality between those who have access to these capabilities and those who do not;as language models become more coherent, they are also become more fluent at generating factually incorrect statements and fabricating falsehoods;training Generative AI requires software processing huge archives of images, text, and other forms of input, throwing up a series of legal risks including intellectual property (IP) infringement; the potential to displace jobs and increase inequality is greater and more rapidly disruptive than with previous waves of technology; andthe transformative potential of Generative AI has triggered broader concerns around the existential threat posed by AI, particularly against a varied regulatory backdrop.Pantelis Koutroumpis, Director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technological and Economic Change at the Oxford Martin School and report co-author, said:
‘Generative AI has already shown an impressive potential across a range of applications over the recent months. The adoption of these technologies appears to correlate with a sizeable productivity boost, but their limitations are also evident to their users.
‘Beyond more data and better computing resources, these models excel when fed with high-quality human generated inputs. Balancing the incentives of content production and technological innovation through a fair redistribution of productivity gains will be a challenge for policy makers.’ 
Given the importance of AI as a foundational technology, the report concludes that the world is now in an ‘AI Arms Race’, with countries striving to establish scientific and technological dominance through research output and patenting.

I have a quick question for you.

Is it true that Abraham Lincoln said that the problem of believing what you read on the Internet is due to the difficulty of verifying what you find there?


I’m sure that you would agree with me that Abraham Lincoln said no such thing. Even the most shallow understanding of Abraham Lincoln’s life is indicative that he lived long before the Internet came into being. Ergo, we would be reluctant to believe he would have been making pointed remarks about the Internet in his day.

Suppose though that I told you that such a claimed quotation could be found on the Internet. Does that change your opinion about the veracity of the quote? I doubt it. I assume that all of us know that you cannot trust what you read on the Internet. There is a lot of junk out there. Tons of junk. Whole oceans of informational flotsam of a dubious nature.

PROMOTED
My basis for sharing this with you is that generative AI is mainly data-trained on text found on the Internet. There is a chance that when you use generative AI, it might get facts wrong or otherwise have gotten data training that was accepted as true when it really wasn’t. Fortunately, by and large, the odds are that much of what you get out of generative AI and based on the initial and later refined data training will be relatively factual (not all of the time, but a lot of the time).
There is a rub.
The added twist is that generative AI can stumble during pattern-matching and end up generating errors, falsehoods, glitches, biases, and even so-called AI hallucinations. You have to be on the lookout for those kinds of anomalies. Always. Your quest to ferret out problematic portions should be never-ending.

Any essay that you get out of generative AI could contain one or more of these abysmal maladies. The issues can be at times easy to spot, while on other occasions nearly impossible to find. Plus, please know that any direct question or notable problem that you ask the generative AI to answer or solve can also contain those troubling difficulties. As I have repeatedly warned in my classes and workshops about generative AI, you are dealing with something that is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’ll get out of generative AI, including great and useful stuff or potentially made-up malarky.

What can you do about this unsavory situation?
One approach consists of verifying the generated results. The usual means consists of doing a search on the web to see what you can find there, as it relates to whatever response the AI app has provided. You are trying to do a verification or double-check of the generated response. Fact by fact, you might laboriously do a comparison. The effort can be tiresome and frustrating. I dare suggest that most people do not undertake a thorough double-checking. They either accept the generated response as it sits, or they read the response and base an assessment of their own reading of the response, or they may reach out to the web to check a few cheery-picked portions here and there.

There must be a better way.
Yes, indeed, I’d like to introduce you to a new technique in prompt engineering that can aid your efforts to be diligent and double-check or verify the responses produced by generative AI. The technique is coined as Chain-of-Verification (formally COVE or CoVe, though some are using CoV).
In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing and popular series on the latest advances in prompt engineering and will be diving into the nature and use of the Chain-of-Verification technique. The first part of the discussion will explain what the technique consists of. I will provide the research that underlies the technique. Next, I will identify the prompts that you can use for performing the technique. All in all, doing a Chain-of-Verification is relatively easy to do and you will undoubtedly be pleased to add the approach to your daily prompt engineering efforts and overall prompting prowess.
Before I dive into my in-depth exploration of this vital topic, let’s make sure we are all on the same page when it comes to the foundations of prompt engineering and generative AI. Doing so will put us all on an even keel.
Prompt Engineering Is A Cornerstone For Generative AI
As a quick backgrounder, prompt engineering or also referred to as prompt design is a rapidly evolving realm and is vital to effectively and efficiently using generative AI or the use of large language models (LLMs). Anyone using generative AI such as the widely and wildly popular ChatGPT by AI maker OpenAI, or akin AI such as GPT-4 (OpenAI), Bard (Google), Claude 2 (Anthropic), etc. ought to be paying close attention to the latest innovations for crafting viable and pragmatic prompts.
For those of you interested in prompt engineering or prompt design, I’ve been doing an ongoing series of insightful explorations on the latest in this expanding and evolving realm, including this coverage:


(1) Imperfect prompts. Practical use of imperfect prompts toward devising superb prompts (see the link here).
(2) Persistent context prompting. Use of persistent context or custom instructions for prompt priming (see the link here).
(3) Multi-personas prompting. Leveraging multi-personas in generative AI via shrewd prompting (see the link here).
(4) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Advent of using prompts to invoke chain-of-thought reasoning (see the link here).
(5) In-model learning and vector database prompting. Use of prompt engineering for domain savviness via in-model learning and vector databases (see the link here).
(6) Chain-of-Thought factored decomposition prompting. Augmenting the use of chain-of-thought by leveraging factored decomposition (see the link here).
(7) Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) prompting. Making use of the newly emerging skeleton-of-thought approach for prompt engineering (see the link here).
(8) Show-me versus tell-me prompting. Determining when to best use the show-me versus tell-me prompting strategy (see the link here).
(9) Mega-personas prompting. The gradual emergence of the mega-personas approach entails scaling up the multi-personas to new heights (see the link here).
(10) Certainty and prompts. Discovering the hidden role of certainty and uncertainty within generative AI and using advanced prompt engineering techniques accordingly (see the link here).
(11) Vague prompts. Vagueness is often shunned when using generative AI but it turns out that vagueness is a useful prompt engineering tool (see the link here).
(12) Prompt catalogs. Prompt engineering frameworks or catalogs can really boost your prompting skills and especially bring you up to speed on the best prompt patterns to utilize (see the link here).
(13) Flipped Interaction prompting. Flipped interaction is a crucial prompt engineering technique that everyone should know (see the link here).
(14) Self-reflection prompting. Leveraging are-you-sure AI self-reflection and AI self-improvement capabilities is an advanced prompt engineering approach with surefire upside results (see the link here).
(15) Addons for prompting. Know about the emerging addons that will produce prompts for you or tune up your prompts when using generative AI (see the link here).
(16) Conversational prompting. Make sure to have an interactive mindset when using generative AI rather than falling into the mental trap of one-and-done prompting styles (see the link here).
(17) Prompt to code. Prompting to produce programming code that can be used by code interpreters to enhance your generative AI capabilities (see the link here).
(18) Target-your-response (TAR) prompting. Make sure to consider Target-Your-Response considerations when doing mindful prompt engineering (see the link here).
(19) Prompt macros and end-goal planning. Additional coverage includes the use of macros and the astute use of end-goal planning when using generative AI (see the link here).
(20) Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting. Showcasing how to best use an emerging approach known as the Tree of Thoughts as a leg-up beyond chain-of-thought prompt engineering (see the link here).
(21) Trust layers for prompting. Generative AI will be surrounded by automated tools for prompt engineering in an overarching construct referred to as an AI trust layer, such as being used by Salesforce (see the link here).
(22) Directional stimulus prompting (aka hints). The strategic use of hints or directional stimulus prompting is a vital element of any prompt engineering endeavor or skillset (see the link here).
(23) Invasive prompts. Watch out that your prompts do not give away privacy or confidentiality (see the link here).
(24) Illicit prompts. Be aware that most AI makers have strict licensing requirements about prompts that you aren’t allowed to make use of and thus should avoid these so-called banned or illicit prompts (see the link here).
(25) Chain-of-Density (CoD) prompting. A new prompting technique known as Chain-of-Density has promising capabilities to jampack content when you are doing summarizations (see the link here).


Anyone stridently interested in prompt engineering and improving their results when using generative AI ought to be familiar with those notable techniques.
Moving on, here’s a bold statement that pretty much has become a veritable golden rule these days:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter. 


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry. Being demonstrably specific can be advantageous, but even that can confound or otherwise fail to get you the results you are seeking. A wide variety of cheat sheets and training courses for suitable ways to compose and utilize prompts has been rapidly entering the marketplace to try and help people leverage generative AI soundly. In addition, add-ons to generative AI have been devised to aid you when trying to come up with prudent prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Ethics and AI Law also stridently enter into the prompt engineering domain. For example, whatever prompt you opt to compose can directly or inadvertently elicit or foster the potential of generative AI to produce essays and interactions that imbue untoward biases, errors, falsehoods, glitches, and even so-called AI hallucinations (I do not favor the catchphrase of AI hallucinations, though it has admittedly tremendous stickiness in the media; here’s my take on AI hallucinations at the link here).
There is also a marked chance that we will ultimately see lawmakers come to the fore on these matters, possibly devising and putting in place new laws or regulations to try and scope and curtail misuses of generative AI. Regarding prompt engineering, there are likely going to be heated debates over putting boundaries around the kinds of prompts you can use. This might include requiring AI makers to filter and prevent certain presumed inappropriate or unsuitable prompts, a cringe-worthy issue for some that borders on free speech considerations. For my ongoing coverage of these types of AI Ethics and AI Law issues, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
With the above as an overarching perspective, we are ready to jump into today’s discussion.
How To Do Verifications Associated With Generative AI Outputs
A looming danger of using generative AI is that the answers to your questions might consist of AI-generated blarney and you won’t even realize it. Sometimes this might not be of a particularly substantive consequence, such as incorrectly indicating the date when Abraham Lincoln was born. The odds are that the error or falsehood about his date of birth might not be overly life-threatening in current times. Supposing though the AI indicated that a certain kind of mushroom was perfectly fine to eat, despite the truth being that the mushroom is considered poisonous.
That’s bad.
Really bad.
I’m sure that I don’t have to say much more to convince you that it is sensible to try and verify the generated essays and answers that come out of using generative AI.
There are efforts underway to get generative AI to automatically undertake internal self-checking, see my discussion at the link here. The AI might reach out to the Internet to verify aspects of its own generated essays or answers. This could be handy due to the original data training of the generative AI possibly being outdated. Or perhaps the data training had falsehoods at the get-go and searching the web might reveal contradicting truths. Another possibility is that the generative AI has produced output based solely on arcane and nonsensical patterns that did not especially pertain to the data training and have produced new facts or figures, derived seemingly out of thin air.
You can bet that AI makers are going to incorporate all manner of checks and balances into their generative AI apps. They know that the writing is on the wall. If generative AI continues to produce malarky, the public at large will undoubtedly raise quite a clamor. In turn, lawmakers will hear these cries for improvements and will potentially establish laws that force AI makers to ensure that their generative AI does suitable double-checking. Executives at AI makers and their AI developers might face financial penalties or fines, and reputational damage, and some even suggest that there is a chance of criminal liability.
Meanwhile, for those of us using generative AI on a daily basis, the Wild West still prevails. Do not hold your breath waiting for generative AI to be rejiggered and improved to avert these maladies. Right now, you are on the hook. Whatever you do with generative AI, by and large, it is on your shoulders to double-check the generated outputs.
A straightforward means to do so consists of using a series of prompts to get the generative AI to double-check for you.
Imagine that you’ve asked generative AI to indicate the date of birth of Abraham Lincoln. An answer is provided. You do not know for sure that the date presented is the correct date. Rather than going to look up his date of birth online, you decide to ask the AI app to double-check.
Here’s a common prompt that people use:


Prompt entered by user: “Are you sure?”


You simply ask the AI app if it is sure about the given answer. One thing to keep in mind is that the “Are you sure?” could be misinterpreted by the AI. It is a broadly worded question. My preference is to ask the question in a more contextually specific way.
For example:


Prompt entered by user: Are you sure that the date of birth of Abraham Lincoln that you displayed is correct?”


Notice that the prompt is more specific. The broadly worded version could get a nearly automatic answer of Yes, for which the AI might be just saying Yes to say yes. There hasn’t been any internal rechecking undertaken. The odds are that by laying out your verification question in greater detail the AI app will likely take more effort to double-check things.
There isn’t any guarantee that the AI app will genuinely do a double-check. Thus, the longer version of my verification question does not axiomatically ensure that a double-check will occur. The odds are raised that the double-check will happen as hoped for. It isn’t an absolute certainty.
Here’s something else to consider.
Some have reported that generative AI often takes a shortcut when answering questions that are worded merely as Yes or No possibilities. If you want to boost the odds that the AI app will work on answering a verification question, you are advised to avoid a Yes or No style question or at least pump up the question. The bottom line is to try to ask a verification question that requires some form of elaboration.
For example:


Prompt entered by user: “How did you arrive at the answer displaying the date of birth of Abraham Lincoln and is the answer correct?”


The verification question now forces the AI app to go beyond a curt answer of Yes or No. An explanation will be derived and displayed. Plus, the indication of whether the answer is correct will be presented. The chances are this will help to stir the verification process.
Those are useful prompting strategies overall and ought to be an essential part of your prompt engineering skillset and toolkit.
I’m guessing you likely have realized that even if you get the generative AI to do a double-check, you cannot necessarily believe or take at face value the double-check. In the case of the date of birth of Lincoln, suppose that the date presented was sourced and patterned based on original data training that contains materials stating that particular date. The AI app is going to tell you that the date is correct, though this double-check is purely based on relooking at patterns it already had earlier established.
We are confronted with a conundrum.
Asking a generative AI app to do verification is going to be suspect when the generative AI only focuses on whatever it already has patterned onto. The problem, which you can plainly see, would be that something wrong will seem to be “correct” merely due to the consistency of the wrong thing being persistent.
For this reason, the future of verification is going to either involve having the AI app refer to other external sources as the double-checking mechanism or the AI app might call upon another generative AI as part of doing a double-check. If the other generative AI has been data trained differently, the chances are that hopefully, the other AI app would be a solid comparator to ferret out which is correct or incorrect, see my coverage on this at the link here.
Upping Your Prompting With Chain-Of-Verification Prompts
Now that I’ve identified some of the foundational elements of doing verifications, we are ready to up the ante. A more systematic or methodical approach can be used. This is not a circumstance of choosing one approach over another. You can use the everyday approaches that I mentioned earlier, doing so on a regular basis, and then have in your hip pocket a more extensive prompting approach when needed for more pressing situations.
The extensive approach has been coined as Chain-of-Verification.
Let’s take a look at the research that has come up with the Chain-of-Verification method. In a study entitled “Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination In Large Language Models” by Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Mojtaba Komeili, Jing Xu, Roberta Raileanu, Xian Li, Asli Celikyilmaz, and Jason Weston, posted online on September 20, 2023, the researchers said this:


“We study the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes. We develop the Chain-of-Verification (COVE) method whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions independently so the answers are not biased by other responses; and (iv) generates its final verified response.”
“We find that independent verification questions tend to provide more accurate facts than those in the original longform answer, and hence improve the correctness of the overall response. We study variations on this recipe across a range of tasks: from list-based questions, closed booked QA and longform text generation.”
“In experiments, we show COVE decreases hallucinations across a variety of tasks, from list-based questions from Wikidata, closed book MultiSpanQA and longform text generation.”


Allow me a moment to offer a brief explanation and overview.
The idea is that you take the same notions that I earlier mentioned and make things a bit more rigorous and interestingly extended. We are going to be playing with these facets:


(1) Enter your initial prompt. This is the initiating prompt that gets the generative AI to produce an answer or essay to whatever question or problem you want to have solved.
(2) Look at the GenAI initial response to the prompt. This is the initial answer or response that the AI app provides to your prompt.
(3) Establish suitable verification questions. Based on the generative AI output, come up with pertinent verification questions.
(4) Ask GenAI the verification questions. Enter a prompt or series of prompts that ask the generative AI the identified verification questions.
(5) Inspect the answers to the verification questions. Take a look at the answers to the verification questions, weighing them in light of what they might signify regarding the GenAI initial response.
(6) Adjust or refine the initial answer accordingly. If the verification answers warrant doing so, go ahead and refine or adjust the initial answer as needed.


My above-listed six aspects are subject to a lot of variations, depending upon your preference and how generative AI tends to work.
Let’s go through those considerations.
First, let’s agree that we are going to constrain all of this to use a particular generative AI app on a self-contained basis. We aren’t going to use any callouts to other generative AI. We aren’t going to access the web to find double-checking materials. This will all be entirely self-contained. We begrudgingly accept the downside risks that I earlier delineated, but we are okay with those risks in terms of taking a streamlined but less exhaustive verification path.
Second, we have to decide how we want to come up with the verification questions. One angle would be to have at the ready a set of very generic verification questions. For example, the classic “Are you sure?” is an entirely generic verification question. As noted, the generic verification is usually not as good as being specific. Thus, we will strive to come up with specific and pertinent verification questions. We will eschew the generic verification questions.
Third, the verification questions could be composed by you, the human using the generative AI. That’s fine. But, then again, we have the generative AI right there at our fingertips, so we might as well go ahead and ask the AI app to come up with the verification questions.
You might be puzzled, rightfully so, that we would allow the generative AI to come up with verification questions. This seems like having the fox guard the chicken coop. The AI app might derive verification questions that are weak or easy to answer, trying to bolster the response that the AI gave us. An obvious bias can creep into this.
I dare say you are absolutely correct. There is a chance that the AI app will try to grease the skids or lean the verification questions in the direction of rubber stamping the initial response that the AI app came up with. As much as we can, we shall try to give directions to the AI app to not do so. No guarantees but at least we can try.
Fourth, we will also let the AI app answer the verification questions, and furthermore, let the AI app determine whether to adjust the initial answer given to our initial prompt. I suppose you could say that we are going all-in about letting the generative AI run the show.
If allowing the AI to do the whole concoction end-to-end gives you heartburn, you are welcome to change things. You could come up with your own verification questions, or supplement the ones generated by the AI. You could judge the answers given to the verification questions. You could decide whether to have the AI app adjust the initial response by using the answers to the verification questions. Etc.
Choose whatever variation of the verification process makes you comfortable and increases your belief in the verification endeavor.
Assume for the sake of discussion that we are going to let the AI take the driver’s seat. We will merely give a prompt or prompts that direct the AI to undertake the steps we want to take for the verification.
Here then is another head-scratcher to contend with.
You could come up with an all-in-one prompt that explains the entire process to the AI app. Voila, you enter the prompt, informing the AI what it is to do, and you let the AI run with the ball.
One potential issue is that sometimes an all-in-one prompt will steer the AI app in a manner that might readily give the AI leeway that we don’t want it to allow. A rule of thumb in general about prompting is that you are usually better off giving prompts on a piecemeal basis to generative AI. Don’t let the AI proverbially bite off more than it can chew. Spoon feed the AI.
Therefore, rather than an all-in-one prompt, we might find it wiser to do the prompting as we go along through the verification process. Upon seeing the initial answer to your initial prompt, you might at that juncture ask the AI app to derive verification questions. After the verification questions are presented, you might then ask the AI to answer the verification questions. And, after the answers are presented, you might then instruct the generative AI to adjust the initial answer accordingly.
I realize this is somewhat of a manual effort on your part. You are spoon-feeding the verification process. Generally, the chances are that the results will come out better. There is no proof per se that doing this as an all-in-one prompt won’t do the same exact thing. The all-in-one prompt is alluring. I would recommend that by and large you use spoon-feeding if you have the time and inclination to do so.
We can take this spoon-feeding even deeper or more detailed.
When you ask the AI app to derive verification questions, you could do this with simply one prompt. You might say to generate verification questions. You might say to generate a desired number of verification questions, such as telling the AI app to generate five or ten (any number you believe necessary).
Another way would be to one-by-one ask for a verification question. The belief is that this might get the AI app to more independently come up with each verification question. If you ask for a slew of them all at once, there is a heightened chance that the bunch will be generated and not be especially distinctive. The assumption is that the one-at-time request will get greater scrutiny when being concocted.
I trust that my discussion about the verification process has made clear that there are a lot of avenues you can pursue.
In my view, if the verification process has to do with content that you are seriously worried about, go the long walk. Do not cut corners. If the content is so-so, you can cut corners. Of course, I would also add that if the verification process is truly essential because the content is life-or-death, please go ahead and use additional verification approaches such as checking the Internet, etc. Do not solely rely on this self-contained AI basis.
The researchers provided this indication of their Chain-of-Verification process overall:


“Our overall process, which we call Chain-of-Verification (CoVe), thus performs four core steps:”
“1. Generate Baseline Response: Given a query, generate the response using the LLM.”
“2. Plan Verifications: Given both query and baseline response, generate a list of verification questions that could help to self-analyze if there are any mistakes in the original response.”
“3. Execute Verifications: Answer each verification question in turn, and hence check the answer against the original response to check for inconsistencies or mistakes.”
“4. Generate Final Verified Response: Given the discovered inconsistencies (if any), generate a revised response incorporating the verification results.”


They mention that their two core research questions consisted of this:


“RQ1: Can COVE effectively reduce the rate of hallucinatory content produced by the LLM?”
“RQ2: Can COVE be used to fix or remove incorrect generations without decreasing the amount of correct content?”


I’d like to say something about the second research question.
The researchers make an important point that there is a chance of the AI app opting to adjust an initial prompt and making the answer essentially worse or at least possibly less compelling.
Here’s how.
Suppose the AI gives an initial answer that says the date of birth of Lincoln is such-and-such. Assume that the answer is indeed correct. You proceed into the verification process. Unfortunately, the verification indicates that the date of birth is incorrect. The AI app changes the date of birth, but the problem is that the change now makes the date incorrect.
We have shot our own foot by invoking the verification process. The correct answer was in hand. The verification regrettably went astray and indicated that the answer was incorrect. The AI then sought to correct a seemingly incorrect answer. The correction turns the answer into being incorrect. I know that seems odd or frustrating, but it can happen.
The key will be to stay on your guard. Closely inspect the changes or adjustments made as a result of the AI undertaken verification. I emphasize over and over again that the responsibility still rests on your shoulders. Do not forsake your part in this. It is easy to allow the AI to run amok. Remain stridently as the human in the loop.
Returning to the research study, here are some excerpts indicating the results:


“In particular, we showed that models are able to answer verification questions with higher accuracy than when answering the original query by breaking down the verification into a set of simpler questions.”
“Secondly, when answering the set of verification questions, we showed that controlling the attention of the model so that it cannot attend to its previous answers (factored CoVe) helps alleviate copying the same hallucinations.”
“Overall, our method provides substantial performance gains over the original language model response just by asking the same model to deliberate on (verify) its answer.”


It stands to reason that the approach ought to make a notable difference.
Here’s why.
You might be familiar with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is a prompting technique involving telling the generative AI to step-by-step try to solve a problem or compose an essay, see my coverage at the link here. Nearly everyone agrees that prodding generative AI to a step-by-step or chain-style process will get you usually better results.
The Chain-of-Verification leverages the same conception. Make the AI do things step-by-step. The chances are that doing so will improve the outcomes. Not always, but a lot of the time. We are thusly carrying over the already acknowledged benefits of the chain or step-by-step proviso, applying this particularly into doing verifications.
An important aspect of having research studies look into these matters is that a hunch that the chain or step-by-step will improve verifications is nothing more than a hunch. By carefully studying the matter we can be more confident that the hunch is viable and workable.
Not all hunches are a payoff.
Some hunches are.
In this case, we have a research study that suggests we are in the right ballpark. The researchers noted various of the usual limitations and considerations, along with calling for additional research on these matters. I too hope that additional research will be undertaken, some of which I know is already underway and I look forward to sharing their results with you in future columns.
Using Chain-Of-Verification With ChatGPT And Some Examples
I would bet that you might relish seeing how this verification process can be applied and what it looks like. The research study made use of examples such as “When did the Mexican-American war start and end?”, “Who are some politicians who were born in Boston?”, “Name some Endemic orchids of Vietnam”, “Who invented the first printing press and in what year?”, and so on.
I’ve done something similar with the Chain-of-Verification method and opted to use ChatGPT.
Fasten your seatbelt, we are going on a fun and informative ride.
We will start with my draft of an all-in-one verification prompt that I came up with:


My primer prompt to ChatGPT: “After you answer my following question, I want you to try and verify the answer. The verification process is this. Step 1: Examine the answer and identify elements that might be important to verify, such as notable facts, figures, and any other significant considerations. Step 2: Come up with verification questions that are specific to those identified elements. Step 3: Separately answer each of the verification questions, one at a time. Step 4: Finally, after having answered the verification questions, review the initial answer that you gave to my question and adjust the initial answer based on the results of the verification questions. Other aspects: Make sure to show me the verification questions that you come up with, and their answers, and whatever adjustments to the initial answer you are going to make. It is okay for you to make the adjustments and you do not need to wait for my approval to do so. Do you understand all of these instructions?”


Here's what ChatGPT responded with:


ChatGPT response: “Yes, I understand the instructions you've provided. I will answer your initial question, then follow the verification process you outlined, including identifying elements to verify, coming up with verification questions, answering those questions, and adjusting the initial answer as necessary based on the results of the verification questions. Please go ahead and ask your initial question, and we can proceed from there.”


Things are looking good.
Let’s next use the question from the research study that asked about the dates of the Mexican-American War. I went ahead and first used my above primer prompt and then followed up with this question:


My prompt to ChatGPT: “When did the Mexican-American war start and end?”


Here is what ChatGPT responded with (response shown in italics to help make it stand out herein).
ChatGPT Response:
The Mexican-American War started on April 25, 1846, and ended on February 2, 1848. It lasted for approximately 1 year, 9 months, and 8 days.
Now, let's proceed with the verification process:
Step 1: Identify Elements to Verify
Start date of the Mexican-American War (April 25, 1846)
End date of the Mexican-American War (February 2, 1848)
Step 2: Verification Questions
Is the start date of the Mexican-American War April 25, 1846?
Is the end date of the Mexican-American War February 2, 1848?
Step 3: Answer Verification Questions
Is the start date of the Mexican-American War April 25, 1846?
Yes, the start date of the Mexican-American War is April 25, 1846.
Is the end date of the Mexican-American War February 2, 1848?
Yes, the end date of the Mexican-American War is February 2, 1848.
Step 4: Adjust Initial Answer
The initial answer provided is accurate based on the verification questions and their answers. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the initial answer.
The start date of the Mexican-American War is April 25, 1846, and it ended on February 2, 1848.
End Of ChatGPT Response
I looked online to double-check the double-check. Numerous reputable sources online indicate that the dates are correct. I suppose there might be some historical deep-thinkers that disagree with the dates, but overall the dates seem relatively accepted and accurate.
You can see that ChatGPT complied with my all-in-one verification prompt. The key elements that ChatGPT opted to verify consisted of the start date and the end date. We might quibble that the indication of the length of time between the dates should also be verified. Maybe ChatGPT assumed that the duration was obvious and did not need verification.
The example of course was abundantly easy. Identifying which elements to verify was as simple as falling off a log. Answering the verification questions was also quite easy. You could say that we tossed ChatGPT a softball that it readily hit out of the ballpark.
One aspect that might catch your eye is that the verification questions were worded as Yes or No questions. We might want to change our all-in-one prompt to emphasize that when possible, any Yes or No questions should instead be elaborated questions or at least accompanied by an elaboration question.
For the moment, we shall proceed and continue using the aforementioned all-in-one verification prompt. Another question in the research study had to do with politicians born in Boston. Let’s ask that question to ChatGPT.


My prompt to ChatGPT: “Who are some politicians who were born in Boston?”


Here is what ChatGPT responded with (response shown in italics to help make it stand out herein).
ChatGPT Response:
Here are some politicians who were born in Boston:
John F. Kennedy - John Fitzgerald Kennedy, commonly known as JFK, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He served as the 35th President of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963.
John Kerry - John Forbes Kerry was born in Aurora, Colorado, but he grew up in the Boston area. He is a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and served as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama.
Tip O'Neill - Thomas Phillip ""Tip"" O'Neill Jr. was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is part of the Greater Boston area. He served as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987.
Now, let's proceed with the verification process:
Step 1: Identify Elements to Verify
Birthplaces of the mentioned politicians
Political positions held by the mentioned politicians
Step 2: Verification Questions
Was John F. Kennedy born in Brookline, Massachusetts?
Did John Kerry grow up in the Boston area?
Was Tip O'Neill born in Cambridge, Massachusetts?
Did John F. Kennedy serve as the 35th President of the United States?
Did John Kerry serve as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama?
Did Tip O'Neill serve as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987?
Step 3: Answer Verification Questions
Was John F. Kennedy born in Brookline, Massachusetts?
Yes, John F. Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts.
Did John Kerry grow up in the Boston area?
Yes, John Kerry grew up in the Boston area.
Was Tip O'Neill born in Cambridge, Massachusetts?
Yes, Tip O'Neill was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Did John F. Kennedy serve as the 35th President of the United States?
Yes, John F. Kennedy served as the 35th President of the United States.
Did John Kerry serve as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama?
Yes, John Kerry served as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama.
Did Tip O'Neill serve as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987?
Yes, Tip O'Neill served as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987.
Step 4: Adjust Initial Answer
The initial answer provided is accurate based on the verification questions and their answers. The mentioned politicians were born in the specified locations and held the mentioned political positions.
End Of The ChatGPT Response
The verification process seemed to appropriately follow the earlier stated all-in-one prompt that I had given to ChatGPT.
ChatGPT identified two elements of verification consisting of the birthplaces and whether the politicians were indeed politicians. I’ll accept that. Given that the question was once again simple in framing, the task of identifying pertinent elements was easy too. Deriving the verification questions was easy too. Answering them was easy. The result was no adjustment to the initial answer.
I want you to take a closer look at the ChatGPT response.
Do you see something untoward?
I believe so.
We have discovered something astray that is another caveat or qualm about generative AI doing verifications. You might observe that John Kerry was not born in Boston. ChatGPT admits freely that John Kerry was born in Colorado and not in Boston. The twist is that ChatGPT tells us that John Kerry grew up in Boston, which is according to ChatGPT, presumably sufficiently equivalent to being born in Boston.
I would have been more impressed if the verification process overtook the initial response and said that John Kerry wasn’t born in Boston, noting that my question had specifically stated that the politicians were to be those who were born in Boston. Unfortunately, the verification merely reinforced the assumption that growing up in Boston is the same as being born there.
Disappointing.
Eye-opening.
By the way, for those of you who think this is a finicky argument and a fine line, I realize that a cogent argument is that someone who spent the bulk of their childhood in a particular city could be loosely construed as being born there. I get that. On the other hand, my question was pretty unambiguous. I asked about politicians born in Boston. I didn’t say that I was looking for politicians that kind of were born in Boston or that you could stretch the definition of “born” into meaning having lived there during childhood.
We shall do the Boston question again, and this time do things on a stepwise prompting basis. I will walk ChatGPT through the verification process. Doing so might make a difference in contrast to using the all-in-one verification process prompt.
Let’s see.


My question to ChatGPT: “Who are some politicians who were born in Boston?”


The answer once again included John Kerry. To keep this discussion within my herein space limitations, I will cut to the chase.
My next prompt told ChatGPT that I’d like to do a verification. I provide the first step of identifying key elements for verification.


My entry to ChatGPT: “I would like you to go through a verification process about the answer that you gave. First, please identify any key elements such as facts, figures, or other notable considerations that are important and should be subject to verification. List out those identified elements.”


It is kind of interesting that this time the listed elements consisted of the same two of birthplace and political position, but also added party affiliation and timeline. This shows you that due to probabilistic and statistical variations, the responses from generative AI can vary.
I decided to tell ChatGPT to focus on the birthplaces and the political positions. I felt this was fair to do since the prior tryout had only used those two factors. You can quibble about that if you wish.


My entry to ChatGPT: “I'd like to concentrate on the birthplaces and the political positions. Make a list of the started birthplaces and political positions and show a set of questions about those elements that can serve as verification questions.”


After looking at the verification questions, which were on par with the first tryout, I told ChatGPT to go ahead and answer the verification questions.
Here is an answer that brought a smile to my face:
ChatGPT response:


“John Kerry - Born in Aurora, Colorado, with ties to Boston. Verification: John Kerry was not born in Boston; he was born in Aurora, Colorado. While he had ties to Boston later in life, he does not meet the criteria of being born in Boston.”


And, I completed the process by telling ChatGPT to adjust the initial answer based on having done the verifications.


My entry to ChatGPT: “Based on your answers to the verification questions, adjust your initial answer to my first question and show a new answer accordingly.”


The final list no longer contained John Kerry.
I suppose this illustrates that doing the stepwise prompting for the verification process can potentially produce better results. I don’t want to have you overinflate this one example. Sometimes spoon-feeding will be better, sometimes not. In my view, this was a lucky shot and based on a rather simple question and simple answers. I tried other examples with much more complex questions and complex answers, along with complex verification questions, and the result was somewhat mixed as to which path was the better determiner.
Overall, I’d still suggest that you ought to aim for the stepwise verification process if you have the time to do so and the matter warrants taking the time. I should also point out that the odds are that the stepwise verification process will be more costly in terms of computer processing time. If you are paying to use generative AI, the cost of the all-in-one verification process versus the stepwise verification process might become a factor in your decision of the best choice for you.
Conclusion
I ask that you consider trying out your own variation of the Chain-of-Verification technique.
Use various examples that are important to you. Spend some time getting comfortable with the approach. Make notes about what works and what seems stilted. Also, realize that what seems workable in one generative AI app might not be equally usable in another. If you are using several brands of generative AI apps, you’ll want to practice with each of those respectively.
A final thought for now.
Thomas H. Huxley, the famous biologist and anthropologist, said this: “The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification.”
I think that we should all embrace the essential concept of trust but verify when using generative AI. You are okay to have a somber undertone of suspicion about whatever generative AI produces. Allow yourself an on-your-toes modicum of trust, and then keep your eyes, ears, and mind highly alert to seek and avidly pursue verification.
Keep on double-checking, that’s the prudent path.

While we have all been having endless arguments about flexible working and what has been rudely mocked as “shirking from home,” that chapter has been written. Hybrid working has persisted despite efforts by large companies to lure workers back to the office. The dominant story about the present and future of work is about a different kind of hybrid: How ordinary workers co-exist with digital co-workers.Work’s main issue is no longer the future of inanimate bricks and mortar of offices — significant economically though this is to city centers, commutes and the real-estate industry. Nor is it about the alternative “space” of the much-vaunted metaverse, which Wired Magazine describes as so vague that if you replace it with cyberspace “ninety percent of the time, the meaning won’t substantially change.”Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

Pros and cons of AI-generated content


Artificial intelligence is growing rapidly in the tech sector and assisting with various tasks such as creating images and generating content. However, it cannot do everything.

AI-generated content is becoming popular, but many people wonder how to use it and if it truly sounds authentic.
AI is growing rapidly in the tech sector, including supply chain, food industry, chatbot, and content and image generation use cases. AI-generated images made the news when critics claimed AI art systems were stealing people's intellectual property on large models, such OpenAI's Dall-E.








OpenAI introduced a similar AI program for content known as ChatGPT. This bot serves a more general purpose and offers an open prompt for users to ask questions, give a command or ask for an observation. The bot answers both broad and specific questions. The system generated answers that professors and other educators said were extensive enough to receive a good grade. However, after further review, some sources -- such as Stack Overflow for coders and developers -- said the information was incorrect and temporarily banned answers using this system. Since there are no limits to the answers ChatGPT can give, a user was even allowed to search how to make explosives and shoplift.
Businesses are looking at AI tools to help with content creation and copywriting. The same question is being posed as to whether AI will take the place of content writers. While AI-generated content might not be suitable for all copywriting, there are some great ways to use these tools.

What is AI-generated content?
AI-generated content includes copy such as blogs, marketing materials, articles and product descriptions written by a machine. The AI content creator generates the content after a person inputs information such as keywords, phrases and topics.

AI-generated content can help speed up the writing process, and businesses are starting to take notice. Marketers might consider using AI-generated content for automating the content marketing process -- which can, at times, be time-consuming and expensive.


How does AI-generated content work?
To produce content, users enter the text format needed, along with a topic and keywords. The AI tool then searches the internet and pieces together copy fitting the requested format. Some tools also rewrite a company's existing content to add information based on web searches and editing tools. These tools can take this existing content and rework it to fit other communication formats, such as turning a blog article into a social media post or email draft.
There are free content generators available, but others charge for more in-depth content.





What are the pros of AI-generated content?
AI-generated content can be valuable in several ways. Here are some of the pros.
Efficiency and scalability
AI can create content much faster than people, which is probably the biggest benefit. An AI tool can produce an article in minutes. It would take a human writer much longer to do all the research and write it.
Multiply the quick turnaround by the number of articles, and an AI tool can produce a significant amount of content.
AI also helps with language localization for various geographic areas and can create social media, personalizing this content for various sites.
Cost-effectiveness
Hiring quality content writers typically costs a few hundred dollars per project, often depending on article length, the number of pieces and the needed technical knowledge. And this could prove to be money well spent if it results in high-quality, well-researched content.
Some AI writing tools are free, while others charge a monthly subscription rate. The pricing typically runs about $100 for tens of thousands of words.
Given these considerations, AI-generated content might be better suited for simpler content than articles needing expertise and authority.
Improved SEO
AI content generators scroll through thousands of online documents to absorb information. In viewing all these documents, generators choose keywords to improve search engine optimization (SEO). The AI tool can suggest keywords for the content writer. By using these keyword suggestions throughout an article, the content appears higher in search engine rankings if it follows the rest of the guidelines of being authoritative and is written by a person.
Help with writer's block
Writer's block is a common hurdle for many people. At times, writers might have trouble creating authoritative content for a subject they know little about.
To help overcome this hurdle, AI tools can create detailed outlines and key points to help the writer determine what should be included in the article. These suggestions from AI tools can help the user overcome writer's block and spark the ideas needed to get started.


What are the cons of AI-generated content?
There are several considerations when it comes to using AI-generated content. Some content is best written by a human writer. Here are some cons of AI-generated content.
Quality concerns and possible plagiarism
AI relies on data and algorithms for content. AI tools can cover black-and white-areas of a topic, but gray areas are more subjective and the intended tone can get lost.
Search engines might also flag content because it is similar to published materials, as the AI pulls from the same sources. The AI tools piece content together from various sites and reword them. Without adding the proper flow, this process goes against Google's ""stitching and combining content"" guidelines. Content needs to be authoritative and informative, which can be hard to do when piecing information together from various sites without proper human review.
Algorithms devalue content
Google released its helpful content update in August 2022 to punish content created for the purpose of ranking higher in search engine results.
In March 2024, Google once again rolled out an update to improve some of its content ranking systems. The update is intended to help users decide if webpages aren't useful, provide a poor user experience or seem like they prioritize keywords over being informative to the reader.
Lack of creativity and personalization
Creative content makes articles more engaging. People tend to share articles they feel a connection to, but AI does not have the emotional intelligence to create a story. Its focus is generally directed toward adding facts to an outline.
AI relies on existing web content and data to develop wording. The technology does not understand user intent for queries and still lacks the common sense of human behavior.
Human editing still required
People still need to read through AI-generated content. Although AI might save time, humans must continue to review articles for quality.
AI tools combine information from several websites into one piece. There might be some mix-ups to fix, such as product descriptions with textures and colors. This is generally because AI tools do not understand adjective meanings.
Can't generate new ideas
AI tools use existing data for content, so this means they cannot come up with fresh ideas. AI tools make it hard to come up with new content covering the latest trending ideas and topics.


Ways to use AI-generated content
AI-generated content is best used as a writing assistant instead of a way to rely strictly on the technology. Here are some ways to use AI tools for assistance with content:

Research. For writers having issues organizing a topic or coming up with ideas, AI-generated content can help them get started. Some tools give ideas about what to include for broader topics to help narrow down the research process.
Proofread current material. To make sure a drafted article is optimized, writers can run it through AI tools for a grade. The tool can also highlight keywords and phrases that should be used. AI tools can further assist with checking grammar and correcting spelling mistakes.
Write short content. AI tools can produce a lot of content in a short amount of time, so they are a great way to reduce boredom with repetitive tasks. While some communications require more of an emotional side, some short descriptions do not. Product descriptions, metatags, ad copy and social media posts are examples of short text suitable for content generators.
Translate language. For written material to appeal to all audiences, AI generators can help translate content into different languages.
Create templates. AI tools can help create emails or other templates. Some AI tools offer different types of ready-made templates for users to plug in customized information.



Example of AI-generated content
There are many AI content generators available. Here is an example of how content generation works using a program called CopyAI:

Select style of writing from the left side.
Answer topic.
Add main points.
Select tone.

A couple options pop up for text. Here is the AI-generated content from the information entered. This was the first option meant to imitate the information in this article:

AI is an amazing technology that has the potential to change our world and how we live in it. But like any new technology, there are pros and cons to AI-generated content -- and businesses need to be aware of both before deciding whether or not to use it.
First, the pros:
1) AI-generated content saves time and money for businesses by allowing them to produce more content with fewer resources.
2) It allows businesses to create highly personalized content for each customer, which leads to happier customers.
3) AI-generated content makes sure that all information is correct, which helps prevent expensive lawsuits or bad press if something goes wrong with your business's operations (e.g., if you send out an email with incorrect information).
Now, let's talk about some of the cons:
1) AI-generated content can sound unnatural (like it was written by a robot), which can make customers feel uncomfortable or distrustful of your business. It doesn't matter how much effort you put into making sure that everything is correct if the end result sounds robotic!
2) If someone finds out that they've been reading an AI-generated piece of content instead.

Much of the information included in this TechTarget article is outlined in the AI-generated content above. However, the AI content is not particularly comprehensive or conversational -- even when selecting a friendly tone. This TechTarget article goes into greater detail for explanations and provides examples. The AI-generated content seems to be more of an outline and needs additional information to flow like a human-written article.


How to detect AI-generated content
There is a larger concern with AI-generated content: students using these tools to cheat. Several professors and teachers stated that the AI-generated content on ChatGPT created convincing essays.
To help distinguish between human and AI text, OpenAI launched a new AI text classifier on Jan. 31, 2023. However, in July 2023, the company pulled the text classifier due to low accuracy. There are other online tools to help detect AI-generated content by classifying how likely it was written by a person versus AI. These resources include Originality.ai, Writing.com and Copyleaks.
OpenAI is also working on creating a watermark for longer AI-generated text as an immediate identifier.
In addition to running text through an online AI-content detector, there are a few other signs that content is AI-generated, such as the following:

Lack of typos. Human writing often has typos and contains slang terms. AI-generated content rarely has typos such as grammar mistakes or misspellings.
Overuse of ""the."" AI-generated content is based on predictive language by determining which word should be next, so it commonly uses words such as ""the,"" ""it"" or ""is"" instead of more unusual terms.
No cited sources. AI-generated text will often give facts and not cite the sources.
Shorter sentences. AI content sentence length is typically shorter because it is trying to mimic human writing but often appears choppier.
Repetition of words or phrases. If certain words or phrases are used abundantly, this could be a sign of AI-generated content because it is trying to fill space with relevant keywords.
Lack of analysis. AI can collect data but cannot analyze it. If an article feels full of facts without any insight, it might be AI-generated.

Reena SenGuptaSeptember 22 2023Jump to comments sectionPrint this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.It is hard to convince a room full of millionaires that their business model is wrong. That was how Richard Susskind, a writer on the legal industry, summed up law firms’ resistance to change more than a quarter century ago. And most commercial law firm partners did indeed remain sceptical that technology will bring about the end of lawyers.But the release of ChatGPT-4, Open AI’s generative artificial intelligence software, which caught the headlines this year, has moved the sceptics much closer to the converts.“For the first time, we have serious disruptive technology,” explains Alastair Morrison, partner at Pinsent Masons, which has won the 2023 FT innovative law firm award for Europe.Lee Ranson, co-chief executive of Eversheds, agrees. Generative AI “is not just a tool, it is a game-changer”.More in this report on generative AI and law firmsRead about lawyers’ views on: How to overcome hurdles The effect on lawyers’ jobsThe real work involved amid the hype Research by consultancy RSGI for the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2023 report included asking 379 lawyers and other legal professionals about ChatGPT. More than 90 per cent had used it, and more than 90 per cent of those said generative AI would significantly affect how they deliver legal advice.Chris De Pury, head of real estate work at BCLP, estimates that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the current work in his department will eventually disappear.Similarly, managing partners are reviewing the number of trainees they will hire in 2026. “The composition of our workforce will not change all of a sudden, but generative AI will replace a lot of what lawyers do,” says Paula Gomes Freire, managing partner of Portuguese law firm Vieira de Almeida. “It is pushing us to think of a slightly different model.” For the first time, she notes, “there’s something that produces content and language on its own. That is revolutionary for lawyers — and not just another technological advance.”However, while law firms accept that generative AI implies significant change, their strategies and spending on it vary.Some law firms such as Vieira de Almeida, Allen & Overy and Cuatrecasas are racing to get ahead. Allen & Overy was one of the first to sign up to Harvey, an Open AI-backed start-up focused on the legal sector. Spanish law firm Cuatrecasas is keen to develop its own opinion on the new tech. “We don’t want to hear from others because we want to be the first to know,” says Javier Fontcuberta, managing partner. The firm formed an alliance with Chiomenti in Italy, Gide Loyrette Nouel in France and Gleiss Lutz in Germany to share their research into the use of generative AI.Others are more cautious. They point to AI’s inaccuracies and disturbing mistakes, such as “hallucinations” — fabricated information — all of which need double-checking. Generative AI “will mean fundamental changes to the law firm model”, says Jeremy Hoyland, managing partner of Simmons & Simmons, before adding “eventually”.More on FT.com: Best practice case studies Read the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe ‘Best practice case studies’, which showcase the standout innovations made for and by people working in the legal sector:Practice of lawBusiness of lawIn-houseChallenges aside, how will generative AI shape the commercial law firm?At Pinsent Masons, Morrison warns: “The firms who do not embrace the opportunity AI poses now will not see the erosion going around them until it is too late.” He likens generative AI to a giant excavator next to handheld shovels: “Big Law has been a super profitable business, using people to deliver complex legal solutions. [Now], we have a proper tool that enables the delivery of these solutions at scale.”In the long term, he believes law firms will succeed by: collaborating with big technology firms; billing by value instead of hours; training everyone in the firm to use tech; addressing organisational culture; and rewarding all the business’s professionals — not just lawyers.De Pury at BCLP says the key to success will lie in the data. “It’s not just a question of volume, it is also what data do you hold.”For firms with leading practices in a certain area, the benefits of holding extensive and proprietary data are already evident.The construction practice at Pinsent Masons, for example, created a platform last year where it collects all the data from its private adjudication — out of court — settlements on the UK construction disputes it has advised on since 2017. The result is a valuable resource to help shape legal and strategic advice to clients.RecommendedBusiness Legal LeadersEmerging AI risks require vigilance from in-house legal counselWith startling developments in technology, helped by the effects of the pandemic on work practices, all managing partners in Europe are refining their visions for the law firm business model of the future. Ranson at Eversheds predicts widespread consolidation in the UK legal market, partly driven by the need for access to bigger knowledge and data sets.Most believe the current “pyramid” shape of law firms — many junior lawyers at the bottom and fewer partners at the top — will disappear. They point, instead, to structures such that of management consultancy McKinsey, which has a lower ratio of junior consultants to partners, or the potential for developing subscription businesses around a legal sector AI engine.Wim Dejonghe, Allen & Overy senior partner, is receiving an FT special achievement award this year for creating a culture of innovation and pulling off the first elite magic circle law firm deal to merge with a big US firm. His view of the future? Lawyers have been diversifying into related advisory services for some time — “and this will accelerate”, he says. “The truth is: many partners do not yet know what clients are going to want from them five years hence.”FT law firm index — Europe 2023RankHQ countryLaw firmTotal score (/100)*Innovation (/60)Digital (/20)People (/10)Social responsibility (/10)1UKPinsent Masons95.057.718.410.08.92UKAshurst94.559.219.29.46.73UKLinklaters90.253.819.27.89.44UKFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer89.156.920.07.25.05UK/USNorton Rose Fulbright88.256.116.07.88.36UKCMS88.058.416.85.07.87GlobalDentons87.760.016.04.47.28UKAddleshaw Goddard86.053.820.05.66.79SpainCuatrecasas85.356.916.84.47.210UKHerbert Smith Freehills85.152.218.49.45.011USMayer Brown84.956.114.47.27.212UKTravers Smith84.358.413.68.93.312USOrrick84.352.217.68.95.614SpainGarrigues83.851.416.87.28.315UKShoosmiths83.649.916.09.48.316PortugalAbreu Advogados83.252.216.08.96.116UK/USHogan Lovells83.252.216.05.010.018SpainUría Menéndez81.756.910.47.86.719UK/USDLA Piper81.651.415.25.010.020USPaul Hastings80.049.916.87.26.121SpainPwC Tax & Legal, Spain79.846.819.26.77.222USDechert79.152.215.25.66.123USShearman & Sterling78.649.917.66.15.024UKOsborne Clarke78.444.416.88.38.925USMcDermott Will & Emery76.749.916.86.73.326PortugalMorais Leitão76.347.516.07.85.027UKEversheds Sutherland (UK)75.950.613.67.83.928UkraineAequo75.446.813.610.05.029BalticsSorainen75.348.312.08.36.730PortugalVieira de Almeida75.048.312.88.35.631USWhite & Case74.755.38.82.28.332NetherlandsNautaDutilh73.946.814.46.76.133UKMills & Reeve73.645.212.88.96.734UKBird & Bird73.248.316.05.03.935UKSlaughter and May73.048.313.63.97.236PortugalPLMJ72.947.510.48.96.137UKWomble Bond Dickinson (UK)72.344.416.86.15.038USMorgan Lewis & Bockius72.241.317.67.85.639UkraineAsters71.045.215.25.65.040IrelandA&L Goodbody70.343.614.47.25.041SpainEcija69.847.512.87.81.742UKFieldfisher68.849.18.06.15.643USCovington67.455.33.23.95.044FranceGide Loyrette Nouel67.342.914.45.64.445UkraineSayenko Kharenko66.846.812.83.93.346UK Ontier66.144.412.86.72.247ItalyBonelliErede64.646.013.62.82.248SpainGómez-Acebo & Pombo64.344.48.83.97.249SpainPérez-Llorca63.243.611.23.94.450GreeceZepos & Yannopoulos63.043.68.88.32.2Source: RSGI *The total score is the sum of banded scores for: innovation, digital, people and social responsibility, which each comprise several indicators.

Research methodology: Europe 2023FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2023 is a ranking, report and awards scheme for lawyers based in the region. The FT and its research partner, RSGI, have devised a unique methodology to rank lawyers on innovation. Law firms and in-house legal teams were invited to make submissions.Featured entries are drawn from those law firm and in-house legal submissions. Each submission is researched and scored out of 10 for originality, leadership and impact, giving a maximum score of 30 for each published entry.Top-ranked entries in the report are shortlisted for the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2023 Awards. Some 551 submissions and nominations were received from 112 law firms and 87 in-house legal teams. RSGI researchers assessed and researched them through interviews with clients, senior lawyers, executives and experts between April and August 2023. FT Law Firm Index The Index (table above) provides a ranking and a holistic assessment of law firm success. Firms are ranked based on the following criteria, with a maximum score of 100: Innovation: The sum of scores for the top three submissions to the FT Innovative Lawyers Report in Europe 2023, including submissions that were not published. (Weighted score out of 60) Digital: Law firms completed a questionnaire on use of data and technology. Each of six questions was scored and benchmarked against other law firm responses. (Weighted score out of 20) People: Law firms completed a questionnaire about their human resource policies. Topics covered gender representation, diversity and inclusion, and investment in skills for lawyers and for business services people. Four questions were scored and benchmarked against other law firm responses. (Weighted score out of 10) Social responsibility: Law firms completed a questionnaire on their approach to social responsibility. Four questions covering commitment to pro bono work, social responsibility and ESG reporting were scored and benchmarked against other law firm responses. (Weighted score out of 10). Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024. All rights reserved.Reuse this content (opens in new window) CommentsJump to comments section

I also used an AI-powered transcribing tool, which saves me countless hours a month. When inspiration ran dry or I found myself drifting off course, I put in a different prompt to get a nudge in a new direction. On publication, I might use generative AI to help write a social media post to accompany this article. (I always talk myself out of sharing my writing, so outsourcing part of that legwork is just the kick I need.) Will generative AI make the piece markedly better? Who knows. Does it make me lazy? Well, there’s a question.Plenty of UK workers, like me, are experimenting with the emerging raft of tech tools and products, whether it’s AI-based image generators such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E-2, or the likes of Google’s chatbot Bard, Scribe, and ChatGPT. Research conducted by work management platform Asana’s Work Innovation Lab found that 29 percent of the UK’s workforce uses generative AI and AI on a weekly basis, compared to 46 percent of workers in the US. However, the decision to do so in a professional context is fraught, and there’s a growing fear among employees that using AI makes them less valuable and leaves them with fewer creative competencies. The same study finds that 30 percent of workers worry they will be seen as lazy for using AI, and 21 percent say they feel like a fraud for doing so.This shame compels people to hide their use of AI. Some 34 percent are nervous to tell managers about the ways they incorporate the technology into their work, according to a study of 1,000 full-time and part-time workers in the UK by Advertising Week Europe. That goes up to 42 percent among Gen Zers and 40 percent among millennials—who, coincidentally, are most likely to want to use AI to help them with tasks. At a time when workplace surveillance is at a high and layoffs are spreading, the AI panic isn’t surprising.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched Questions“The speed at which AI has arrived and been taken up, combined with the breadth of what it can do, has only increased the fear,” says Neil Maiden, a professor of digital creativity at the Bayes Business School at City, University of London and director of CebAI, the National Centre for Creativity Enabled by AI. No one’s expecting rules to be written in stone, as it’s a moving beast for everyone, but company guidelines and the reframing of AI as a productivity aid could reassure employees enormously.“Workers who use AI feel like outliers and fear judgement from peers and managers—there’s this niggling sense that they’re shortcutting the system or taking the easy way out,” explains Rebecca Hinds, who heads up the Work Innovation Lab at Asana and produced its State of AI at Work report, published at the end of August. Hinds believes that the fear and uncertainty is partly down to the atmosphere in British workplaces, which are increasingly characterized by looming layoffs, stagnant wages, and inflexible working policies, rather than explicit criticism. However for some it’s clear-cut. Apple, DeutscheBank, JP Morgan Chase, and Verizon have all blocked the use of ChatGPT among staff, citing concerns about security and the risk of data leaks.The landscape is pretty murky—certain companies are prohibiting AI, others are loud in their support of it, and some are still keeping schtum—which only feeds staff guilt. Attitudes vary too, by industry and job function. Tech employers are the most supportive in getting their employees educated on AI, followed by finance sector leaders. However, people working in medicine, education, retail, and hospitality reported that their employers weren’t at all supportive of them using it, according to Advertising Week’s study. Asana’s research flags greater fear and hesitation depending on job function within a company, particularly among those in marketing roles, for example, versus folks in IT.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyBusinessDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire ElegyBy Steven LevyThere are more deep-set, fundamental forces at play here, says Maiden. “AI, which mimics expertise and effectively closes the gap between the expert and the novice, threatens our professional identity,” he explains. “If used for idea generation, it gets increasingly fraught, as ideas are a projection of people and their values—they create emotional and social capital.” Besides that, there’s the notion that by applying AI in your work, you’re speeding up the path to making yourself, a human worker, obsolete. The hope is that the more we know about AI, the more we can see for ourselves that it’s unlikely to wipe out swathes of the workforce.AdvertisementEven with my very basic applications of the tools to write this piece, AI bought me back time for productive noodling and general structural pruning. It’s clear that if I knew the extent of what’s possible, and set aside time to learn about it, I could seriously boost my productivity (and, hoorah, cut out the dull freelance admin jobs). Wider proof and affirmation that AI will boost productivity, rather than steal jobs, is the most obvious business reason to spend time easing these fears. It could take a while to persuade business leaders of its possibilities—52 percent of UK executives believe that using generative AI will increase productivity—but the proof is there. A recent study by Nielsen Norman Group found that using generative AI tools in business improves employees’ productivity by an average of 66 percent, with more complex tasks and less skilled workers seeing the biggest gains.As all the advantages and strategies for applying AI emerge, businesses must act proactively. “Similarly to hybrid working, leaders are adopting a wait-and-see mindset. Many are fearful of moving too quickly and developing the wrong type of guidance,” Hinds says. “But in reality, employees are craving more policy and guidance around AI.” Indeed, 48 percent want more policy at an organizational level; right now only 24 percent of companies provide guidance on how to use AI in their day-to-day work, and only 13 percent of workers have received training on it.That might be a tall order when the tech is so box-fresh, but Hinds points out that businesses can treat it as a work-in-progress, using the space to share successes, missteps, and company learning. “Employees want to trust their employers, as there’s been a lack of trust these past few years,” she explains. “If leaders can show they’re being intentional about how they’re bringing this technology into the workplace, it will minimize some of the anxiety.” Language helps.

Research conducted by work management platform Asana’s Work Innovation Lab found that 29 percent of the UK’s workforce uses generative AI and AI on a weekly basis, compared to 46 percent of workers in the US. However, the decision to do so in a professional context is fraught, and there’s a growing fear among employees that using AI makes them less valuable and leaves them with fewer creative competencies. The same study finds that 30 percent of workers worry they will be seen as lazy for using AI, and 21 percent say they feel like a fraud for doing so.
This shame compels people to hide their use of AI. Some 34 percent are nervous to tell managers about the ways they incorporate the technology into their work, according to a study of 1,000 full-time and part-time workers in the UK by Advertising Week Europe. That goes up to 42 percent among Gen Zers and 40 percent among millennials—who, coincidentally, are most likely to want to use AI to help them with tasks. At a time when workplace surveillance is at a high and layoffs are spreading, the AI panic isn’t surprising.
“The speed at which AI has arrived and been taken up, combined with the breadth of what it can do, has only increased the fear,” says Neil Maiden, a professor of digital creativity at the Bayes Business School at City, University of London and director of CebAI, the National Centre for Creativity Enabled by AI. No one’s expecting rules to be written in stone, as it’s a moving beast for everyone, but company guidelines and the reframing of AI as a productivity aid could reassure employees enormously.
“Workers who use AI feel like outliers and fear judgement from peers and managers—there’s this niggling sense that they’re shortcutting the system or taking the easy way out,” explains Rebecca Hinds, who heads up the Work Innovation Lab at Asana and produced its State of AI at Work report, published at the end of August. Hinds believes that the fear and uncertainty is partly down to the atmosphere in British workplaces, which are increasingly characterized by looming layoffs, stagnant wages, and inflexible working policies, rather than explicit criticism. However for some it’s clear-cut. Apple, DeutscheBank, JP Morgan Chase, and Verizon have all blocked the use of ChatGPT among staff, citing concerns about security and the risk of data leaks.
The landscape is pretty murky—certain companies are prohibiting AI, others are loud in their support of it, and some are still keeping schtum—which only feeds staff guilt. Attitudes vary too, by industry and job function. Tech employers are the most supportive in getting their employees educated on AI, followed by finance sector leaders. However, people working in medicine, education, retail, and hospitality reported that their employers weren’t at all supportive of them using it, according to Advertising Week’s study. Asana’s research flags greater fear and hesitation depending on job function within a company, particularly among those in marketing roles, for example, versus folks in IT.
There are more deep-set, fundamental forces at play here, says Maiden. “AI, which mimics expertise and effectively closes the gap between the expert and the novice, threatens our professional identity,” he explains. “If used for idea generation, it gets increasingly fraught, as ideas are a projection of people and their values—they create emotional and social capital.” Besides that, there’s the notion that by applying AI in your work, you’re speeding up the path to making yourself, a human worker, obsolete. The hope is that the more we know about AI, the more we can see for ourselves that it’s unlikely to wipe out swathes of the workforce.
Even with my very basic applications of the tools to write this piece, AI bought me back time for productive noodling and general structural pruning. It’s clear that if I knew the extent of what’s possible, and set aside time to learn about it, I could seriously boost my productivity (and, hoorah, cut out the dull freelance admin jobs). Wider proof and affirmation that AI will boost productivity, rather than steal jobs, is the most obvious business reason to spend time easing these fears. It could take a while to persuade business leaders of its possibilities—52 percent of UK executives believe that using generative AI will increase productivity—but the proof is there. A recent study by Nielsen Norman Group found that using generative AI tools in business improves employees’ productivity by an average of 66 percent, with more complex tasks and less skilled workers seeing the biggest gains.
As all the advantages and strategies for applying AI emerge, businesses must act proactively. “Similarly to hybrid working, leaders are adopting a wait-and-see mindset. Many are fearful of moving too quickly and developing the wrong type of guidance,” Hinds says. “But in reality, employees are craving more policy and guidance around AI.” Indeed, 48 percent want more policy at an organizational level; right now only 24 percent of companies provide guidance on how to use AI in their day-to-day work, and only 13 percent of workers have received training on it.
That might be a tall order when the tech is so box-fresh, but Hinds points out that businesses can treat it as a work-in-progress, using the space to share successes, missteps, and company learning. “Employees want to trust their employers, as there’s been a lack of trust these past few years,” she explains. “If leaders can show they’re being intentional about how they’re bringing this technology into the workplace, it will minimize some of the anxiety.” Language helps.

PPC trends: the role of generative AI in paid search How is generative AI transforming the work of paid search marketers? We asked three experts to give us their views.

What are the best ways to get your business out in front of the millions of users who conduct searches every day? Search marketers have been grappling with this question since the early days of search, and evolutions in the field of paid search continually present new challenges as well as offering additional tools for marketers to wield.
Generative AI has the potential to be a major new tool in search marketers’ arsenals, but determining when and how to apply it most effectively is still a challenge. For thoughts on how generative AI is shaping paid search and what it will mean for marketers, we turned to three experts: Clark Boyd, CEO and Co-Founder of Novela; Emma Welland, Co-Founder of House of Performance; and Christos Stavropoulos, Head of Product Strategy at BrightBid.
Ad copy, keyword lists, scripting, but not necessarily new ways of working just yet
“Marketing leaders are experimenting with generative AI right now to find ways to increase efficiency and improve campaign performance,” says Clark Boyd, CEO and Co-Founder of Novela, a simulation-based learning company that offers search marketing training. “However, few have found ways to integrate the tech into a new way of working yet.
“For instance, we see marketers using generative AI to create ad variations for use in A/B testing. Others are using it to develop keyword lists or automate data analysis.”

This world is just opening up within paid search.
– Emma Welland, Co-Founder at House of Performance

Indeed, industry blogs and press have been quick to point out how ChatGPT may be useful for search marketers doing PPC, such as Search Engine Land’s list of 15 strategic prompts, which starts with advice on producing viable A/B tests for responsive search ads (RSAs) and includes tips for landing page optimisation and conducting competitor research.
“This world is just opening up within paid search,” says Emma Welland, Co-Founder at House of Performance, a performance marketing agency. Other than a benefit to ad copy production, where generative AI can offer headline and description suggestions for “even the most niche areas”, Welland points to scripts as a particularly valuable use case. “Generative AI provides us with the opportunity to leverage things like scripts without having the coding experience.”
She notes that scripts have “fallen out of favour in recent times”, but that the rise of automation in PPC along with generative AI have laid the groundwork for a revival. “The move to automation has provided an opportunity for successful search marketers to use scripts to interrogate data and understand where ads are appearing. Marketers that are not using scripts are quickly falling behind.”

So far, most leaders are finding that this technology doesn’t remove the need for human input…
– Clark Boyd, CEO and Co-Founder at Novela

Boyd cautions that, “So far, most leaders are finding that this technology doesn’t remove the need for human input – rather, it displaces it. Left to its own devices, so to speak, generative AI will produce lots of quite good content. Yet that is rarely good enough for a brand. And of course, it will sometimes create content that fails to clear even that low bar.”
In order to achieve “reliably excellent output” with generative AI, he notes that both human feedback and high-quality data inputs are required. However, “not all marketers are trained to work in this way. In truth, the marketing industry requires reskilling to take advantage of AI, not just upskilling.”
Paid Search Best Practice Guide

Generative AI as all-purpose assistant
Christos Stavropoulos is Head of Product Strategy at BrightBid, an adtech company that uses AI for search ad optimisation. He agrees that the quality of training data and the way that the AI is trained will define a company’s success with generative AI.
“If you don’t train [generative AI] well, it will give you very generic, not very accurate responses. But if you have the ability to train the tool to be more accurate in what you as a company want to say, then it can become quite powerful.”

I would say that each and every company needs to see, themselves, how this tool could help them amplify [their work].
– Christos Stavropoulos, Head of Product Strategy at BrightBid

Ultimately, Stavropoulos believes that any organisation can benefit from using generative AI for paid search, but not necessarily in a set way. “It could be a baseline [for ad copy], but it could also be an addition … you [might] have three to five tasks within a project, and you can use it as an assistant to accelerate the speed of some tasks,” he says.
“I would say that each and every company needs to see, themselves, how this tool could help them amplify [their work].”
As Google rolls out more features, generative AI is set to grow, even if the hype is subsiding
Despite a recent increase in scepticism towards generative AI that has followed on the heels of the hype prompted by ChatGPT’s release, Stavropoulos doesn’t believe that generative AI is going anywhere. “The one thing that is for sure is that AI is here,” he says.
“The hype from the last six months is blowing over a little bit, but that happens with all things. It will start trending upwards again once we get more and more accurate models to perform the job we asked them to do. So, I don’t think it will disappear.”

The release of new features from Google and Bing will force a more radical rethink of how campaigns are created, delivered, and measured.
– Clark Boyd

Search marketers are facing more and more decisions about whether and how to use generative AI as Google rolls out feature after feature incorporating it – from creating Google Ads assets via AI-driven chat to generating images and text for Performance Max campaigns.
“The release of new features from Google and Bing will force a more radical rethink of how campaigns are created, delivered, and measured,” predicts Novela’s Clark Boyd. “These features will be central to Shopping first of all, where there is a huge amount of input data available and rapid interactions with lots of users.
“The challenge for marketers will be keeping up with the pace of change and interpreting their campaign performance effectively.”

Whether you view it as a threat or an opportunity, AI is here to stay. In the legal realm, AI technology has begun transforming the work environment and the lives of lawyers. Let’s explore how law firms are using AI to take on more business. Jump to:  How many law firms are using AI?  Why is AI good for law firms?  How can AI be used to generate more business for law firms?  Are law firms using AI to take on more business? How many law firms are using AI? Virtually all law firms utilize some form of artificial intelligence. AI is baked into legal platforms like Westlaw and Practical Law, which have been around for years. What’s new is the use of generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that creates, or “generates,” content such as text, graphics, and documents. There are significantly fewer firms actively using this type of AI, at least for now. According to a 2023 Thomson Reuters Institute report titled, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms, “just 3% of respondents said they are already using generative AI or ChatGPT for law firm operations, and an additional 2% said they are actively planning for its use. About one-third of respondents (34%) are still in the consideration phase for generative AI and ChatGPT, while 60% answered they have no current plans for generative AI use in firm operations.”  Why is AI good for law firms? EfficiencyNo surprise, the biggest advantage of AI in a law firm is speed. In a world that counts every 6-minute increment, legal work that would once take hours or days can be done in seconds with AI. Time-consuming, but critical tasks such as research, document drafting and review, and data entry can now be done in a fraction of the time of pre-artificial intelligence. By automating routine tasks, you can dedicate more time to higher-level, strategic work that directly serves your clients. Deeper InsightsBetter efficiency means you can dig deeper. AI can search its digital data warehouse to provide hard-to-find information and predict legal outcomes. Products like Practical Law’s Dynamic Tool Set with CoCounsel can help provide insight faster with visualization tools and data-driven charts so you can easily interpret information and then share it with clients, colleagues, and outside counsel.A review of Practical Law Dynamic Tool Set with CoCounselSee why this CEO & Senior Counsel believes Practical Law is the best tool for lawyers and legal departments on the market today.Read articleConsistent work productLegal work is complex. AI tools can help you develop best practices across your firm with predictive workflows to guide your teams.  How can AI be used to generate more business for law firms? CapacityThe simple math is that when AI takes routine tasks off your plate, you have more time for business development. As important as it is, finding new clients often takes a back seat to serving the current ones. Dedicating time to both will help build your practice. Responsiveness Most people seeking legal help need it now. And they often choose the law firm that responds the fastest. By implementing an AI chatbot on your website, you can respond immediately to common client queries and help generate new business leads by capturing visitor information. It can also analyze client data to suggest personalized follow-up or cross-selling other legal services. Marketing and content generation“AI can generate content through machine learning algorithms that analyze and learn from vast datasets of existing text, images, or other media, allowing it to generate new content based on patterns and information it has acquired.” AI wrote the previous sentence based on a directed prompt. While it’s not exactly poetic, it could be edited into understandable, engaging content. The same can work for lawyers. AI can assist in generating high-quality legal content for blogs, newsletters, social media, or podcasts that you can review, edit, and publish. That can help establish you as a thought leader and attract new clients. Market analysis and competitive intelligenceIf you’re looking to expand your practice, AI can analyze market trends and the competitive landscape to identify new practice areas or niches. Products like What’s Market provide a database of summaries for publicly filed deals that allows you to analyze and compare terms or features. You can see where new opportunities lie ahead.  Are law firms using AI to take on more business? Most attorneys are approaching it carefully, as is part of their nature to protect their clients. You shouldn’t let AI generate any work product without a robust review. But once you try it, notes Charlotte Woolven-Brown, a partner at U.K. law firm Sternberg Reed, the results are convincing.

         — 
    


            Companies are struggling to deal with the rapid rise of generative AI, with some rushing to embrace the technology as workflow tools for employees while others shun it – at least for now. 
    

            As generative artificial intelligence – the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools – seeps into seemingly every corner of the internet, large corporations are grappling with whether the increased efficiency it offers outweighs possible copyright and security risks. Some companies are enacting internal bans on generative AI tools as they work to better understand the technology, and others have already begun to introduce the trendy tech to employees in their own ways.
    

        Banning AI? Embracing AI? Or bracing for AI?


            Many prominent companies have entirely blocked internal ChatGPT use, including JPMorgan Chase, Northrup Grumman, Apple, Verizon, Spotify and Accenture, according to AI content detector Originality.AI, with several citing privacy and security concerns. Business leaders have also expressed worries about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere.

            When users input information into these tools, “[y]ou don’t know how it’s then going to be used,” Mark McCreary, the co-chair of the privacy and data security practice at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told CNN in March. “That raises particularly high concerns for companies. As more and more employees casually adopt these tools to help with work emails or meeting notes, McCreary said, “I think the opportunity for company trade secrets to get dropped into these different various AI’s is just going to increase.”
    

            But the corporate hesitancy to welcome generative AI could be temporary.
    

            “Companies that are on the list of banning generative AI also have working groups internally that are exploring the usage of AI,” Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI, told CNN, highlighting how companies in more risk-averse industries have been quicker to take action against the tech while figuring out the best approach for responsible usage. “Giving all of their staff access to ChatGPT and saying ‘have fun’ is too much of an uncontrolled risk for them to take, but it doesn’t mean that they’re not saying, ‘holy crap, look at the 10x, 100x efficiency that we can lock when we find out how to do this in a way that makes all the stakeholders happy” in departments such as legal, finance and accounting. 
    

            Among media companies that produce news, Insider editor-in-chief Nicholas Carlson has encouraged reporters to find ways to use AI in the newsroom. “A tsunami is coming,” he said in April. “We can either ride it or get wiped out by it. But it’s going to be really fun to ride it, and it’s going to make us faster and better.” The organization discouraged staff from putting source details and other sensitive information into ChatGPT. Newspaper chain Gannett paused the use of an artificial intelligence tool to write high school sports stories after the technology called LedeAI made several mistakes in sports stories published in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper in August. 
    

            Of the companies currently banning ChatGPT, some are discussing future usage once security concerns are addressed. UBS estimated that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch. 
    

            That rapid growth initially left large companies scrambling to find ways to integrate it responsibly. That process is slow for large companies. Meanwhile, website visits to ChatGPT dropped for the third month in a row in August, creating pressure for large tech companies to sustain popular interest in the tools and to find new enterprise applications and revenue models for generative AI products. 
    

            “We at JPMorgan Chase will not roll out genAI until we can mitigate all of the risks,” Larry Feinsmith, JPM’s head of global tech strategy, innovation, and partnerships said at the Databricks Data + AI Summit in June. “We’re excited, we’re working through those risks as we speak, but we won’t roll it out until we can do this in an entirely responsible manner, and it’s going to take time.” Northrop Grumman said it doesn’t allow internal data on external platforms “until those tools are fully vetted,” according to a March report from the Wall Street Journal. Verizon also told employees in a public address in February that ChatGPT is banned “[a]s it currently stands” due to security risks but that the company wants to “safely embrace emerging technology.”
    

        Companies creating custom AI tools


            “They’re not just waiting to sort things out. I think they’re actively working on integrating AI into their business processes separately, but they’re just doing so in a way that doesn’t compromise their information,” Vern Glaser, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at the University of Alberta, told CNN. “What you’ll see with a lot of the companies that will be using AI strategies, particularly those who have their own unique content, they’re going to end up creating their custom version of generative AI.”

            Several companies – and even ChatGPT itself – seem to have already found their own answers to the corporate world’s genAI security dilemma.
    

            Walmart introduced an internal “My Assistant” tool for 50,000 corporate employees that helps with repetitive tasks and creative ideas, according to an August LinkedIn post from Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart’s EVP of New Businesses and Emerging Technologies, and Donna Morris, Chief People Officer. The tool is intended to boost productivity and eventually help with new worker orientation, according to the post. 
    

            Consulting giants McKinsey, PwC and EY are also welcoming genAI through internal, private methods. PwC announced a “Generative AI factory” and launched its own “ChatPwC”  tool in August powered by OpenAI tech to help employees with tax questions and regulations as part of a $1 billion investment for AI capability scaling. 
    

            McKinsey introduced “Lilli” in August, a genAI solution where employees can pose questions, with the system then aggregating all of the firm’s knowledge and scanning the data to identify relevant “With Lilli, we can use technology to access and leverage our entire body of knowledge and assets to drive new levels of productivity,” Jacky Wright, a McKinsey senior partner and chief technology and platform officer, wrote in the announcement. content, summarize the main points and offer experts. 
    

            EY is investing $1.4 billion in the technology, including “EY.ai EYQ,” an in-house large language model, and AI training for employees, according to a September press release


            Tools like MyAssistant, ChatPwC and Lilli solve some of the corporate concerns surrounding genAI systems through custom adaptions of genAI tech, offering employees a private, closed alternative that both capitalizes its ability to increase efficiency and eliminates the risk of copyright or security leaks.
    

        OpenAI and Microsoft launch ‘enterprise’ AI tools 


            The launch of ChatGPT Enterprise may also help quell some fears. The new version of OpenAI’s new tool, announced in August, is specifically for businesses, promising to provide “enterprise-grade security and privacy” combined with “the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet” for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon, according to a company blog post.


            The highly-anticipated announcement from OpenAI comes as the company says employees from over 80% of Fortune 500 companies have already begun using ChatGPT since it launched publicly late last year, according to its analysis of accounts associated with corporate email domains. 
    

            In response to the concerns raised by many companies over security, about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere, OpenAI’s announcement blog post for ChatGPT Enterprise states that it does “not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage.”
    

            In July, Microsoft unveiled a business-specific version of its AI-powered Bing tool, dubbed Bing Chat Enterprise, and promised much of the same security assurances that ChatGPT Enterprise is now touting – namely, that users’ chat data will not be used to train AI models.
    

            It is still unclear whether the new tools will be enough to convince corporate America that it is time to fully embrace generative AI, though experts agree the tech’s inevitable entry into the workplace will take time and strategy. 
    

            “I don’t think it’s that companies are against AI and against machine learning, per se. I think most companies are going to be trying to use this type of technology, but they have to be careful with it because of the impacts on intellectual property,” Glaser said.

As generative artificial intelligence – the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools – seeps into seemingly every corner of the internet, large corporations are grappling with whether the increased efficiency it offers outweighs possible copyright and security risks. Some companies are enacting internal bans on generative AI tools as they work to better understand the technology, and others have already begun to introduce the trendy tech to employees in their own ways. Banning AI? Embracing AI? Or bracing for AI? Many prominent companies have entirely blocked internal ChatGPT use, including JPMorgan Chase, Northrup Grumman, Apple, Verizon, Spotify and Accenture, according to AI content detector Originality.AI, with several citing privacy and security concerns. Business leaders have also expressed worries about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere.  When users input information into these tools, “[y]ou don’t know how it’s then going to be used,” Mark McCreary, the co-chair of the privacy and data security practice at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told CNN in March. “That raises particularly high concerns for companies. As more and more employees casually adopt these tools to help with work emails or meeting notes, McCreary said, “I think the opportunity for company trade secrets to get dropped into these different various AI’s is just going to increase.” But the corporate hesitancy to welcome generative AI could be temporary. “Companies that are on the list of banning generative AI also have working groups internally that are exploring the usage of AI,” Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI, told CNN, highlighting how companies in more risk-averse industries have been quicker to take action against the tech while figuring out the best approach for responsible usage. “Giving all of their staff access to ChatGPT and saying ‘have fun’ is too much of an uncontrolled risk for them to take, but it doesn’t mean that they’re not saying, ‘holy crap, look at the 10x, 100x efficiency that we can lock when we find out how to do this in a way that makes all the stakeholders happy” in departments such as legal, finance and accounting.  Among media companies that produce news, Insider editor-in-chief Nicholas Carlson has encouraged reporters to find ways to use AI in the newsroom. “A tsunami is coming,” he said in April. “We can either ride it or get wiped out by it. But it’s going to be really fun to ride it, and it’s going to make us faster and better.” The organization discouraged staff from putting source details and other sensitive information into ChatGPT. Newspaper chain Gannett paused the use of an artificial intelligence tool to write high school sports stories after the technology called LedeAI made several mistakes in sports stories published in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper in August.  Of the companies currently banning ChatGPT, some are discussing future usage once security concerns are addressed. UBS estimated that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch.  That rapid growth initially left large companies scrambling to find ways to integrate it responsibly. That process is slow for large companies. Meanwhile, website visits to ChatGPT dropped for the third month in a row in August, creating pressure for large tech companies to sustain popular interest in the tools and to find new enterprise applications and revenue models for generative AI products.  “We at JPMorgan Chase will not roll out genAI until we can mitigate all of the risks,” Larry Feinsmith, JPM’s head of global tech strategy, innovation, and partnerships said at the Databricks Data + AI Summit in June. “We’re excited, we’re working through those risks as we speak, but we won’t roll it out until we can do this in an entirely responsible manner, and it’s going to take time.” Northrop Grumman said it doesn’t allow internal data on external platforms “until those tools are fully vetted,” according to a March report from the Wall Street Journal. Verizon also told employees in a public address in February that ChatGPT is banned “[a]s it currently stands” due to security risks but that the company wants to “safely embrace emerging technology.” Companies creating custom AI tools “They’re not just waiting to sort things out. I think they’re actively working on integrating AI into their business processes separately, but they’re just doing so in a way that doesn’t compromise their information,” Vern Glaser, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at the University of Alberta, told CNN. “What you’ll see with a lot of the companies that will be using AI strategies, particularly those who have their own unique content, they’re going to end up creating their custom version of generative AI.” Several companies – and even ChatGPT itself – seem to have already found their own answers to the corporate world’s genAI security dilemma. Walmart introduced an internal “My Assistant” tool for 50,000 corporate employees that helps with repetitive tasks and creative ideas, according to an August LinkedIn post from Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart’s EVP of New Businesses and Emerging Technologies, and Donna Morris, Chief People Officer. The tool is intended to boost productivity and eventually help with new worker orientation, according to the post.  Consulting giants McKinsey, PwC and EY are also welcoming genAI through internal, private methods. PwC announced a “Generative AI factory” and launched its own “ChatPwC”  tool in August powered by OpenAI tech to help employees with tax questions and regulations as part of a $1 billion investment for AI capability scaling.  McKinsey introduced “Lilli” in August, a genAI solution where employees can pose questions, with the system then aggregating all of the firm’s knowledge and scanning the data to identify relevant “With Lilli, we can use technology to access and leverage our entire body of knowledge and assets to drive new levels of productivity,” Jacky Wright, a McKinsey senior partner and chief technology and platform officer, wrote in the announcement. content, summarize the main points and offer experts.  EY is investing $1.4 billion in the technology, including “EY.ai EYQ,” an in-house large language model, and AI training for employees, according to a September press release Tools like MyAssistant, ChatPwC and Lilli solve some of the corporate concerns surrounding genAI systems through custom adaptions of genAI tech, offering employees a private, closed alternative that both capitalizes its ability to increase efficiency and eliminates the risk of copyright or security leaks. OpenAI and Microsoft launch ‘enterprise’ AI tools  The launch of ChatGPT Enterprise may also help quell some fears. The new version of OpenAI’s new tool, announced in August, is specifically for businesses, promising to provide “enterprise-grade security and privacy” combined with “the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet” for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon, according to a company blog post. The highly-anticipated announcement from OpenAI comes as the company says employees from over 80% of Fortune 500 companies have already begun using ChatGPT since it launched publicly late last year, according to its analysis of accounts associated with corporate email domains.  In response to the concerns raised by many companies over security, about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere, OpenAI’s announcement blog post for ChatGPT Enterprise states that it does “not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage.” In July, Microsoft unveiled a business-specific version of its AI-powered Bing tool, dubbed Bing Chat Enterprise, and promised much of the same security assurances that ChatGPT Enterprise is now touting – namely, that users’ chat data will not be used to train AI models. It is still unclear whether the new tools will be enough to convince corporate America that it is time to fully embrace generative AI, though experts agree the tech’s inevitable entry into the workplace will take time and strategy.  “I don’t think it’s that companies are against AI and against machine learning, per se. I think most companies are going to be trying to use this type of technology, but they have to be careful with it because of the impacts on intellectual property,” Glaser said.",,1373.0,,,,,,,,,,en,P0Y0M0DT0H6M6S,,,

What is an AI prompt engineer?
An artificial intelligence (AI) prompt engineer is an expert in creating text-based prompts or cues that can be interpreted and understood by large language models and generative AI tools. In contrast to traditional computer engineers who write code, prompt engineers use written language to evaluate AI systems for idiosyncrasies.
These professionals are also tasked with training and fine-tuning emerging AI tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to deliver precise and relevant responses to people's questions.
The questions posed by users to AI models are known as prompts.





What does an AI prompt engineer do?
AI prompt engineers serve as intermediaries between machine learning (ML) models and the humans who query them. The job of an AI prompt engineer is to develop a set of inputs and train the models to produce the best and desired outputs back to the user. As such, the role involves writing text-based prompts and feeding them into the back end of AI tools to enable them to perform tasks, such as writing an essay, generating a blog post or creating a sales email with the proper tone and information.
Because AI systems lack intuition, they're dependent on human input to understand human language and questions to produce effective prompts.



There are several differences between AI and human intelligence.







The main elements of AI prompts
Well-crafted prompts play a pivotal role in enabling the AI model to grasp the user's intention and context, ultimately resulting in responses that are both accurate and pertinent.

An AI prompt is typically composed of the following four elements:
1. Instruction. This is a simple question with a set of instructions on how the AI model should answer the question.
Example: Provide me with some easy low-carb recipes that take less than 15 minutes to prep and also make a list of ingredients needed to make them. 
This prompt gives precise instructions on the type of recipes needed, the time required for preparation and the ingredients required to cook them.



Prompt engineering often requires specific and clear requests to receive the desired output.





2. Context. Context provides the AI model with essential background information, enabling it to produce relevant content. Without adequate context, responses can become generic or irrelevant.
Example: What are some green technologies that are used in transportation?
This prompt uses the context of ""used in transportation"" while posing the question regarding green technologies, which helps the model focus on answers that are specifically connected to vehicle-related green technologies.
3. Input data. This includes adding some input along with an instruction.
Example: Create a short biography of Albert Einstein (14 March 1879-18 April 1955), a famous physicist and scientist who created the theory of relativity, which establishes that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. He won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect. 
This prompt provides the AI model with some relevant information about Einstein and then instructs it to create a short biography of him.
4. Examples. Examples can also be fed into an AI model to receive a specific output about the examples provided.
Example: Create a music playlist based on the following songs: 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen, 'Hotel California' by Eagles and 'Hey Jude' by The Beatles. The playlist should have a classic rock vibe and include similar iconic songs that evoke a sense of nostalgia and timeless appeal. Please provide at least 10 songs for the playlist.
This prompt guides the AI model to generate a playlist that aligns with the provided song examples and captures the desired classic rock feel.

Skills and requirements for AI prompt engineers
To successfully build and optimize prompts for AI learning models, an AI prompt engineer should have a combination of technical, linguistic and analytical skills.
Key skills required to become an AI prompt engineer include the following:

Understanding of AI, ML and NLP. To work with AI systems, an AI prompt engineer must be familiar with machine learning concepts, algorithms and model structures. Making effective prompts also requires a mastery of natural language processing (NLP) principles, syntax, semantics and language structure.
Programming skills. The primary programming language for NLP and AI tasks is Python. Therefore, a fundamental knowledge of Python and other programming languages is useful for tasks involving script development, model integration and data manipulation.
Communication skills. Because AI prompt engineers frequently engage and collaborate with other teams and communicate with AI systems, they must have strong written and verbal communication skills to effectively work with stakeholders, explain critical requirements and comprehend project goals.
Educational background. Although a background in AI or IT-related fields isn't always required, having a degree in computer science, data science or a related discipline can help. Since this profession focuses on the linguistic and cognitive aspects of AI, prompt engineers can come from diverse backgrounds, such as communications and cognitive psychology. Moreover, they can enhance their knowledge and stay current with the latest AI trends and developments by using online tutorials and self-study resources, including NLP frameworks and libraries, such as Natural Language Toolkit, SpaCy and transformers.
Experience experimenting with pre-trained ChatGPT models. Those aspiring to enter the field of prompt engineering should consider experimenting and testing with pre-trained AI chatbot models, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4. They can conduct experiments with various prompts to observe the text generation capabilities and constraints of the models, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of ChatGPT's behavior and optimizing prompts through hands-on practice.



What is the salary range for AI prompt engineers?
Recognized by the World Economic Forum as one of the top jobs of the future, a career in AI prompt engineering can be fruitful.
The salary range for AI prompt engineers can vary significantly. Various sources mention salaries ranging from $175,000 to over $300,000. However, these figures are based on specific job listings and might not represent the entire range of salaries in the field.
Additionally, salaries can vary based on factors such as geographical location, experience and the organization or industry hiring for the role.
Prompt engineering and fine-tuning are both methods for maximizing AI output. Differentiate between these two approaches and explore the unique model training requirements associated with each method.

Ten years ago, two experts in AI from the Oxford Martin School predicted that almost half of jobs were at risk of automation. In a new upcoming study, Professors Carl-Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne now say that while Generative AI has increased the scope of automation further, it will also make many jobs easier to do for people with lower skills.

In their paper ‘Generative AI and the Future of Work: A Reappraisal’, they also found:
remote jobs are more likely to be automated, while AI will increase the value of in-person communication skills;AI hallucinations (when an AI confidently yet unwittingly generates false information) will continue to be a problem, so firms will mostly keep a human in the loop;Generative AI is less likely to be deployed in high-stakes contexts when mistakes are likely to be costly or irreversible; andwhile creative jobs are less prone to automation, creative professionals might face more competition and lower wages as generative AI makes content creation easier. The researchers provide a reassessment of the division of labour between humans and computers in the age of Generative AI and the impact of the technology on the future of work.
They argue that whilst there have been significant advances in AI in recent years, particularly with the growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT4, significant bottlenecks remain in the deployment of Generative AI technologies that will prevent the complete replacement of humans in the workplace.
As Professor Carl-Benedikt Frey, Director of the Future of Work Programme at the Oxford Martin School and Dieter Schwarz Professor of AI & Work at the Oxford Internet Institute, explains:
‘Ten years on from our paper on “The Future of Employment”, we find that key bottlenecks to the automation of social tasks persist. In-person interactions remain valuable, and such real-life interactions cannot be readily substituted by Large Language Models.
‘As a general rule, it now looks like AI may be able to replace human labour in many virtual settings, meaning that if a task can be done remotely, it can also be potentially automated. Also we find that the more transactional a relationship becomes, the more prone it is to automation. But without major leaps, longstanding relationships – benefitting from in-person interaction – will remain in the realms of humans.’
Looking specifically at the creative industries, the study finds that whilst generative AI LLMs such as GPT4 can help turn a ‘poor’ writer into an ‘average’ writer, the algorithm is typically good at generating new combination of existing ideas, rather than making conceptual leaps. The authors also report that the deployment of Generative AI in creative work will focus on existing product lines rather than creating new works and won’t be game-changing for creativity.
The study considered the implications of Generative AI on the future of work, particularly in those situations when AI algorithms interact with the physical world. The experts find that Generative AI in its current form is less likely to be deployed in higher-stakes contexts like driving than lower-stakes activities.
As co-author Professor Michael A Osborne, Associate Professor of Machine Learning and Director of the Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative, explains:
‘A key bottleneck to the automation of perception and mobility tasks, particularly in the physical world, is that we can’t accept mistakes. Yet foundation models based on deep neural networks, whose decisions we cannot explain, have the capacity to create plenty of mistakes.
‘For now, deployment of generative AI will be confined to lower stakes activities like customer service or warehouse automation where engineers can redesign and simplify the environment to enable automation.’
Prof. Frey concludes:
‘AI will continue to surprise us, and many jobs may be automated. However, in the absence of major breakthroughs, we also expect the bottlenecks we outline in our 2013 paper to continue to constrain our automation possibilities for the foreseeable future.’
The full paper, ‘Generative AI and the Future of Work: A Reappraisal’, is set to be published in the Brown Journal of World Affairs in January 2024.

What is LangChain?
LangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Developers, software engineers and data scientists with experience in the Python, JavaScript or TypeScript programming languages can make use of LangChain's packages offered in those languages. LangChain was launched as an open source project by co-founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola in 2022; the initial version was released that same year.


Why is LangChain important?
LangChain is a framework that simplifies the process of creating generative AI application interfaces. Developers working on these types of interfaces use various tools to create advanced NLP apps; LangChain streamlines this process. For example, LLMs have to access large volumes of big data, so LangChain organizes these large quantities of data so that they can be accessed with ease.
In addition, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are generally trained on data up to their release to the public. For instance, ChatGPT was released to the public near the end of 2022, but its knowledge base was limited to data from 2021 and before. LangChain can connect AI models to data sources to give them knowledge of recent data without limitations.

What are the features of LangChain?
LangChain is made up of the following modules that ensure the multiple components needed to make an effective NLP app can run smoothly:

Model interaction. Also called model I/O, this module lets LangChain interact with any language model and perform tasks such as managing inputs to the model and extracting information from its outputs.
Data connection and retrieval. Data that LLMs access can be transformed, stored in databases and retrieved from those databases through queries with this module.
Chains. When using LangChain to build more complex apps, other components or even more than one LLM might be required. This module links multiple LLMs with other components or LLMs. This is referred to as an LLM chain.
Agents. The agent module lets LLMs decide the best steps or actions to take to solve problems. It does so by orchestrating a series of complex commands to LLMs and other tools to get them to respond to specific requests.
Memory. The memory module helps an LLM remember the context of its interactions with users. Both short-term memory and long-term memory can be added to a model, depending on the specific use.



What are the integrations of LangChain?
LangChain typically builds applications using integrations with LLM providers and external sources where data can be found and stored. For example, LangChain can build chatbots or question-answering systems by integrating an LLM -- such as those from Hugging Face, Cohere and OpenAI -- with data sources or stores such as Apify Actors, Google Search and Wikipedia. This enables an app to take user-input text, process it and retrieve the best answers from any of these sources. In this sense, LangChain integrations make use of the most up-to-date NLP technology to build effective apps.
Other potential integrations include cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as vector databases. A vector database can store large volumes of high-dimensional data -- such as videos, images and long-form text -- as mathematical representations that make it easier for an application to query and search for those data elements. Pinecone is an example vector database that can be integrated with LangChain.



LangChain augments existing large language models so that they are equipped to handle user queries and prompts.







How to create prompts in LangChain
Prompts serve as input to the LLM that instructs it to return a response, which is often an answer to a query. This response is also referred to as an output. A prompt must be designed and executed correctly to increase the likelihood of a well-written and accurate response from a language model. That is why prompt engineering is an emerging science that has received more attention in recent years.
Prompts can be generated easily in LangChain implementations using a prompt template, which will be used as instructions for the underlying LLM. Prompt templates can vary in specificity. They can be designed to pose simple questions to a language model. They can also be used to provide a set of explicit instructions to a language model with enough detail and examples to retrieve a high-quality response.
With Python programming, LangChain has a premade prompt template that takes the form of structured text. The following steps are required to use this:

Installing Python. A recent version of Python must be installed. Once the Python shell terminal is open, enter the following command to install just the bare minimum requirements of LangChain for the sake of this example.

pip install langchain

Adding integrations. LangChain typically requires at least one integration. OpenAI is a prime example. To use OpenAI's LLM application programming interfaces, a developer must create an account on the OpenAI website and retrieve the API access key. Then, using the following code snippet, install OpenAI's Python package and enter the key for access to the APIs.

pip install openaifrom langchain.llms import OpenAIllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=""..."")

Importing the prompt template. Once these basic steps are complete, LangChain's prompt template method must then be imported. The code snippet shown below does this.

from langchain import PromptTemplateprompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(    ""Tell me an {adjective} fact about {content}."")prompt_template.format(adjective=""interesting"", content=""zebras"")""Tell me an interesting fact about zebras.""
In this scenario, the language model would be expected to take the two input variables -- the adjective and the content -- and produce a fascinating fact about zebras as its output.


How to develop applications in LangChain
LangChain is built to develop apps powered by language model functionality. There are different ways to do this, but the process typically entails some key steps:

Define the application. An application developer must first define a specific use case for the application. This also means determining its scope, including requirements such as any needed integrations, components and LLMs.
Build functionality. Developers use prompts to build the functionality or logic of the intended app.
Customize functionality. LangChain lets developers modify its code to create customized functionality that meets the needs of the use case and shapes the application's behavior.
Fine-tuning LLMs. It's important to choose the appropriate LLM for the job and also to fine-tune it to adhere to the needs of the use case.
Data cleansing. Using data cleansing techniques ensures clean and accurate data sets. Also, security measures should be implemented to protect sensitive data.
Testing. Regularly testing LangChain apps ensures they continue to run smoothly.

Examples and use cases for LangChain
The LLM-based applications LangChain is capable of building can be applied to multiple advanced use cases within various industries and vertical markets, such as the following:

Customer service chatbots. The most obvious use case would be customer support chatbots. LangChain enables chat applications that are advanced enough to handle complex questions and even transactions from users. These applications are able to understand and maintain a user's context throughout a conversation in the same way ChatGPT can. AI is already being widely used to enhance customer experience and service.
Coding assistants. It's possible to build coding assistants with the help of LangChain. Using LangChain and OpenAI's API, developers can create a tool to assist those in the tech sector with enhancing their coding skills and improving productivity.
Healthcare. AI has made its way into healthcare in several ways. LLM-centric LangChain applications are helping doctors make diagnoses. They're also automating rote, repetitive administrative tasks, such as scheduling patient appointments, enabling healthcare workers to focus on more important work.
Marketing and e-commerce. Businesses use e-commerce platforms with LLM functionality to better engage customers and expand their customer base. An application that can understand consumer purchasing patterns and product descriptions can generate product recommendations and compelling descriptions for potential customers.

Reaping the benefits of NLP is a key of why LangChain is important. For a more in-depth understanding of NLP, there are two important subtopics to start with: natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). The goal of NLU is to process a user's intended meaning, while the goal of NLG is to explain an AI system's structured data in human-readable languages for humans to comprehend.

Published: 21 Sep 2023


 
Generative AI is a foundational technology that is already having an effect across enterprises. In the early days, the technology focused on creating fake humans and automating image creation processes. However, the advent of ChatGPT demonstrated that LLMs often exceeded the capabilities of previous natural language processing approaches that were slowly being adopted across the enterprise.







This enthusiasm was further buoyed by consumers' massive uptake of ChatGPT, which has experienced the fastest adoption of any application to date. But the power of these LLMs isn't limited to fancy chatbots that are better at sounding like real humans. The industry as a whole is starting to acknowledge that LLMs can also serve as universal translators across different domains to generate code, understand complex data sets and simplify user experiences across roles and for customers.
""Generative AI capabilities, such as prompt engineering and adaptive responses, are what set it apart from previous AI models we have seen,"" said Bharath Thota, partner in the advanced analytics practice at global strategy and management consulting firm Kearney. ""With ChatGPT being introduced to the general public, we have seen a shift in the way that people now understand and interact with AI.""
That said, the new technology comes with various challenges, such as a propensity to hallucinate, requiring guardrails and vetting by domain experts. It also introduces new ethical challenges around the use of responsible AI. Left unchecked, generative AI could also exacerbate existing issues with bias, privacy, security and public opinion.

Here are some of the different ways generative AI will change the enterprise in terms of capabilities, enterprise workflows, use cases and ethics.

Future of generative AI capabilities
Generative AI will enable the following enterprise capabilities.
The rise of self-teaching models
One of the attractions of LLMs was that they could discover patterns on vast unlabeled data sets on their own, at least as a starting point. The industry is waking up to the requirements for vetting and refining data or fine-tuning models for best results. Rex Chekal, principal product designer at software development consultancy TXI, expects innovations in smaller self-teaching models that compete with large data-hungry models, like GPT-4. One early example is Orca from Microsoft, which imitates the reasoning processes of larger models using progressive learning and teaching assistance to overcome capacity gaps. ""For CIOs, using [LLMs] will be like hiring an all-star employee who continuously improves and is transparent about how they work,"" Chekal said.
Accessibility
Innovations in LLMs make it easier to customize information and experiences for a wide range of employees. ""Generative AI has enabled all employees -- and not just technology and IT ones -- to access data and technology in an unprecedented way,"" said Benjamin Rehberg, managing director, senior partner, and global lead of tech and digital offerings at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). As a result, using AI tools without code or little code is increasingly becoming the new reality.
General to specialized models
The first wave of generative AI unleashed new models that were proficient across many tasks but suffered significant problems in particular domains. As generative AI moves into specific industries and fields, it will drive the development of models fine-tuned for particular purposes, predicted Anil Vijayan, partner at Everest Group. For example, banking, insurance and HR models will have a better ability to speak the languages of these narrower fields.
Applications built on foundational generative AI models
Vijayan also expects to see a proliferation of apps built on top of LLMs or conditioned LLMs to solve specific needs. Early examples include web navigation concierges and code development assistants. Early growth will start in B2C contexts. B2B and business-to-enterprise applications will see a spurt once risks are mitigated.
Rise of open source LLMs
The first crop of LLMs from OpenAI and others were relatively proprietary. More open models, such as Meta AI's Llama 2, provide viable alternatives that increase transparency, customization and cost-effectiveness. This trend should continue, according to Samuel Hamway, research analyst at Nucleus Research. For CIOs, this will mean more control over data and AI operations, but it will also require increased expertise in model management, maintenance, governance and hardware infrastructure.
LLM plugin ecosystems for augmented capabilities
Generative AI vendors, like OpenAI, are starting to support plugins that can augment the core capabilities of LLMs to become more task-specific. ""This task grounding makes LLMs more capable for targeted tasks and useful across different verticals,"" Hamway said. These plugin ecosystems also simplify the integration of AI into existing workflows and streamline the deployment of AI-based offerings.
Improved search
A new crop of enterprise search tools uses LLMs to enhance access to relevant data. One key innovation will be improvements in vector databases that stage data that has been transformed into an intermediate format more accessible to LLMs. Hamway said enterprise search initiatives will be required to consider data retrieval mechanisms as a core competency to make data more actionable and insights timelier. CIOs should also consider how a unified data architecture could improve integration with LLM-powered search capabilities.


Future of generative AI in the enterprise
Here are nine specific ways generative AI will affect the enterprise:

Upskilling. The rush to take advantage of generative AI will likely increase the pace of upskilling efforts. ""AI upskilling paves the way for building an enterprise that fully understands how to use generative AI and the benefits the technology brings to the company,"" said Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at global consultancy PwC. He expects to see far more companies investing in training and upskilling for current employees in the future, especially in generative AI usage.
Hybrid architectures. Likens also observed that generative AI is changing at a rate he has rarely seen. The increased pace of innovation in open source software and platforms from big tech companies means enterprises need to rethink how they test and scale these technologies. This also increases the use of hybrid architectures that are changing more rapidly than other digital transformations he has seen. These new approaches can shorten the time to value, but it's also important to design flexibility into new offerings.
Changing the nature of expertise. Generative AI is automating an increasing number of tasks to boost productivity. Everest Group's Vijayan expects this to also change the nature of expertise. Enterprises will need to rethink their talent agenda, workforce planning, and learning and development programs. The bar of valuable human expertise will move from mastering things such as programming language syntax to higher-level understanding. Enterprises will need to rebuild their skills taxonomies and reassess how they plan for talent.
Renewed focus on enterprise data strategy. The biggest gains of generative AI will require going beyond the low-hanging fruit of generating text, images and other media. Vijayan envisions a future where generative AI creates appropriate business or IT workflows, creates complex documents from scratch and generates marketing collateral specific to a company. These new use cases will require seamless access to enterprise data, regardless of the approach. ""The enterprise data journey is not new, but GenAI will require a renewed focus and perhaps more investments to get there quicker,"" he said.
Automation of job tasks reshaping jobs. Prior waves of automation built on robotic process automation and business process automation focused on automating whole processes. Generative AI could help spin up automation more quickly but might only be sufficient for some tasks now performed by humans as part of a larger process. Certain tasks will become fully automated, BCG's Rehberg said, while more complex work will require a human element. ""We recognize that all revolutionary developments have not led to less jobs, just changes in the effectiveness and efficiencies of employees,"" he said. ""It would be a mistake to believe that there will be less jobs available moving forward, rather some jobs will just be reshaped and evolve.""
Generative AI embedded natively into existing enterprise apps. Rajesh Kumar R, CIO at IT consultancy LTIMindtree, predicts generative AI will transform from standalone assistants, like ChatGPT, to something natively weaved into productivity applications, such as email, spreadsheets, content authoring tools, presentation tools and other core enterprise systems, such as ERP, CRM, HR management and recruitment systems. Microsoft's Copilot provides an early example of how this might unfold across different applications.
Competition, disruption and lowered barriers to entry. Generative AI will enable more automation to help organizations do more with fewer resources. ""As costs go down, fundamentally new business models become more feasible in multiple domains,"" Vijayan said. This is similar to how digital banks quickly started taking business from brick-and-mortar ones. It could be particularly disruptive in stock media, customer service, entertainment and other industries.
The niche future of generative AI. Enterprises will likely see the best results in customizing LLMs for their own particular industry and use case. There won't be one general tool, such as a chatbot, used across industries, predicted Mona Chadha, director of category management at AWS. Rather, each organization will develop a generative AI offering that can deliver business outcomes catered to its base. ""These tools will include highly domain-specific LLMs for consumers to use with their own contextual data,"" she said.
Cost. The current crop of generative AI services is relatively more expensive than traditional search and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, Vijayan has already seen price drops by at least an order of magnitude and expects these to go down further as infrastructure, hosting, training and inference become more efficient and economies of scale further facilitate lowering costs.






Future of generative AI use cases
Here are some of the ways generative AI will shape various use cases within enterprises.
Research
Generative AI will have the greatest impact on jobs that focus on research, particularly those involving the largest sets of data, said Brian Spanswick, chief information security officer and head of IT at data security company Cohesity. This includes research relating to legal questions, scientific research, data governance and code development. This will also increase the emphasis on higher levels of critical thinking in day-to-day work. LLMs will do the heavy research lifting more completely across larger data sets virtually instantly. ""Rather than spending the majority of people's time on busy work, the power of the employee will be in making strong decisions based on the data they have, with the knowledge that that data is trustworthy,"" he said.
Cybersecurity
Generative AI will also streamline many aspects of cybersecurity. Spanswick said one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity has been understanding where critical data sits, as well as getting insight into how that data moved through the company and how that data enables core business processes. Generative AI will help security teams obtain, analyze, synthesize and act on this data. This will make it easier to understand their attack surface and the level of protection required, as well as assess the security posture of these attack surfaces. This will help prioritize security investments, assess practical cyber-risk and set concrete KPIs for core security controls.
Business intelligence
Generative AI will play a pivotal role in improving the value and effectiveness of business intelligence (BI), predicted Porter Thorndike, principal product manager at software development firm Cloud Software Group. Analytics vendors are starting to explore how they can take advantage of AI capabilities in their platforms by either integrating with existing generative AI services or building their own. Generative AI will also streamline traditional BI workflows that now require close collaboration among developers, data scientists and business analysts. LLMs will help produce the same content, while requiring a less technical skill set. They will also help explain the meaning of content on existing dashboards tuned to different users.
Advancement of AIOps
Enterprises are increasingly turning to AI to improve IT operations management, or AIOps. This is sometimes confused with MLOps, which focuses on enhancing machine learning development workflows. Generative AI will improve the ability to sift through vast quantities of IT-related data to take programmatic actions, predicted Chris Opat, senior vice president of cloud operations at cloud backup and storage service Backblaze. He has started working with Selector AI to ingest various forms of business data to identify and mitigate anomalous behavior faster and more precisely.
Personalized customer experiences
Generative AI is also playing a role in increasing customer engagement through tailored interactions, website experiences, products and services. Kearney's Thota said generative AI could help businesses craft highly personalized content to boost sales through cross-selling and upselling opportunities. It can also reduce churn. He recommended CIOs work closely with marketing and customer relationship teams to gain insight into how generative AI can be integrated with existing customer engagement strategies. This can help guide the processing of collecting and integrating the data needed to build the personalization engine and have the structure to scale the tool as it expands across the organization.
Advanced conversational AI
Generative AI techniques will lead to more sophisticated NLP models to better understand context and generate humanlike text. Thota believes this could transform various aspects of business operations, including customer support, multilingual support, conversational knowledge databases and virtual assistants across multiple functions. He recommended companies prepare by identifying areas where advanced conversational AI can contribute to customer- and employee-facing interactions. They should also start thinking about governance and establishing user guidelines to prevent misuse of conversational AI models.
Automated content creation
Marketing, communication and design teams are using AI-powered tools to streamline content creation processes. This accelerates campaign timelines, optimizes creative resource allocation and bolsters brand consistency, said Dr. Stefan Sigg, chief product officer at Software AG. CIOs will need to explore ways to integrate AI-powered tools into workflows to improve collaboration between AI and humans. It's also important to upskill creative teams to work harmoniously with AI systems, scale AI infrastructure for increased content demands and foster an organizational shift that embraces AI as a creative ally rather than a replacement. ""Perhaps, larger enterprises will end up having their own EnterpriseGPT to allow for customized use within the corporation,"" he said.
Increased efficiency of operations
The expected wide adoption of generative AI should improve the efficiency of operations in many different verticals, said Shipra Sharma, head of AI and analytics at AI consultancy Bristlecone. It can work alongside humans to make their jobs easier, which can translate to time and cost savings. ""That's a tangible thing, and all organizations will eventually find a way to use generative AI to help make operations nimbler. But it's still questionable whether it can be used to increase profits or solve highly complex problems without human interaction,"" Sharma said.



The road to the responsible and ethical use of AI is a bumpy one. Here are some of the challenges enterprises will have to overcome.







Ethical issues arising from generative AI
The rapid adoption of generative AI will also lead to various new problems and exacerbate existing ones. Important aspects to consider include the following:

Primary risks. Enterprises must address primary risks around generative AI for broad-based adoption, Everest Group's Vijayan said. Top issues include regulatory, intellectual property, data, privacy and explainability concerns. He expects enterprises and vendors to develop meaningful workarounds and mitigation mechanisms, which seem promising based on current progress.
Responsible use. PwC's Likens said enterprises must consider security and performance risks with generative AI, such as bias and hallucinations. This will make it imperative for enterprises to plan and execute responsible AI rollouts to employees. Enterprises will increasingly invest in internal AI tools to ensure proprietary data and ideas remain within the enterprise. Adopting responsible AI frameworks and guardrails could also promote responsible and ethical use.
Shadow AI. Cloud innovations created a variety of low-cost and easy-to-access services that drove the growth of shadow IT outside the purview of IT governance. Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at Montreal AI Ethics Institute, predicted a similar rise in shadow AI. This refers to the AI systems, solutions and services used or developed within an organization without explicit organizational approval or oversight. It can include anything from using unsanctioned software and apps to developing AI-based solutions in a skunkworks-like fashion. Enterprises should embark on a drive to raise literacy around responsible use of AI systems and promote discussions of new risks, such as hallucinations, bias, and leakage of private and confidential information. ""Ultimately, the goal is to make responsible AI the norm rather than the exception,"" Gupta said.
Regulatory and copyright concerns. Regulators are still in the early stages of sorting out the impact of AI on existing copyright and intellectual property frameworks. ""Content created by a generative AI model resembles human-created work and thus could lead to regulatory and copyright issues,"" Thota said. Enterprises need to develop plans for ethical usage of content and ensure models avoid plagiarism. CIOs must also be proactive and collaborate with legal teams to develop internal policies and guidelines for using generative AI applications within their firm. It's also important to track emerging trends in copyright laws and regulations within your industry.
Trustworthy AI. Kumar R predicted generative AI technology providers and governing bodies will focus on making it more trustworthy. This will include more secure technology, data protection guarantees and legal protections. Data labeling and tagging, along with digital watermarks, could also enhance trust. These practices will also improve transparency into how the data is used and increase clarity on topics such as copyright.
Rise of confidential computing. Training LLMs on vast data sets won't do for many enterprise data sets involving personally identifiable information or confidential data. Sigg expects security and privacy concerns to prompt the evolution of generative AI toward techniques like federated learning and secure multiparty computation that protect sensitive data during the training process. ""These advancements allow businesses to collaboratively train models on decentralized data, fostering industry partnerships, while maintaining data security and complying with regulations such as GDPR,"" he said. This balance between data sharing and privacy protection opens doors to innovative collaborations previously hindered by privacy concerns.
Interpretive AI. Early generative AI models made it difficult to discern how the technology was used across the organization at scale. AWS' Chadha predicted that innovations in interpretive AI will help CIOs understand the value of their customer base and organization regarding product impact, market adoption and internal utilization.
Energy use. Generative AI can dramatically impact the consumption of IT resources and, hence, the energy usage of an organization. Chadha said organizations should prioritize use cases that are most valuable to their customers and strip down inference code to optimize cost and time. It might also be helpful to identify ways to make the GPUs at the heart of generative AI training and inferencing tasks more efficient by developing a strategy to consider additional GPU capacity coming online. CIOs might also position their company to run workloads on premises and monitor their cloud provider's effect on sustainability.

Updated November 15, 2023: To simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise will now simply become Microsoft Copilot. For more information: https://aka.ms/BingIgnite
We are entering a new era of AI, one that is fundamentally changing how we relate to and benefit from technology. With the convergence of chat interfaces and large language models you can now ask for what you want in natural language and the technology is smart enough to answer, create it or take action. At Microsoft, we think about this as having a copilot to help navigate any task. We have been building AI-powered copilots into our most used and loved products – making coding more efficient with GitHub, transforming productivity at work with Microsoft 365, redefining search with Bing and Edge and delivering contextual value that works across your apps and PC with Windows.
Today we take the next step to unify these capabilities into a single experience we call Microsoft Copilot, your everyday AI companion. Copilot will uniquely incorporate the context and intelligence of the web, your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance – with your privacy and security at the forefront. It will be a simple and seamless experience, available in Windows 11, Microsoft 365, and in our web browser with Edge and Bing. It will work as an app or reveal itself when you need it with a right click. We will continue to add capabilities and connections to Copilot across to our most-used applications over time in service of our vision to have one experience that works across your whole life.
Copilot will begin to roll out in its early form as part of our free update to Windows 11, starting Sept. 26 — and across Bing, Edge, and Microsoft 365 Copilot this fall. We’re also announcing some exciting new experiences and devices to help you be more productive, spark your creativity, and to meet the everyday needs of people and businesses.

With over 150 new features, the next Windows 11 update is one of our most ambitious yet, bringing the power of Copilot and new AI powered experiences to apps like Paint, Photos, Clipchamp and more right to your Windows PC.
Bing will add support for the latest DALL.E 3 model from OpenAI and deliver more personalized answers based on your search history, a new AI-powered shopping experience, and updates to Bing Chat Enterprise, making it more mobile and visual.
Microsoft 365 Copilot will be generally available for enterprise customers on Nov. 1, 2023, along with Microsoft 365 Chat, a new AI assistant that will completely transform the way you work.
Additionally, we introduced powerful new Surface devices that bring all these AI experiences to life for you, and they are available for pre-order beginning today.

New Windows 11 Update delivers over 150 new features, including bringing the power of Copilot to the PC 
Today, we’re thrilled to share our next step toward making Windows the destination for the best AI experiences – with a new update that delivers our most personal experience yet coming on Sept. 26.
Here’s a look at some of what’s new in the latest update for Windows 11:

Copilot in Windows (in preview) empowers you to create faster, complete tasks with ease and lessens your cognitive load – making once complicated tasks, simple. We’ve made accessing the power of Copilot seamless as it’s always right there for you on the taskbar or with the Win+C keyboard shortcut providing assistance alongside all your apps, on all screen sizes at work, school or at home.
Paint has been enhanced with AI for drawing and digital creation with the addition of background removal and layers as well as a preview of Cocreator that brings the power of generative AI to the Paint app.
Photos has also been enhanced with AI including new features to make editing your photos a breeze. With Background Blur you can make the subject of your photo stand out quickly and easily. The Photos app automatically finds the background in the photo, and with a single click, instantly highlights your subject and blurs out the background. We’ve improved search, with photos stored in OneDrive (home or personal) accounts, you can now quickly find the photo you’re looking for based on the content of the photo. You can also now find photos based on the location where they were taken.
Snipping Tool now offers more ways to capture content on your screen – with this update you can now extract specific text content from an image to paste in another application or, you can easily protect your sensitive information with text redaction by using text actions on the post capture screen. And, with the addition of sound capturing using audio and mic support, it’s easier to create compelling videos and content from your screen.
Clipchamp, now with auto compose, helps you with scenes suggestions, edits and narratives based on your images and footage automatically so you can create and edit videos to share with family, friends, and social media like a pro.
Notepad will start automatically saving your session state allowing you to close Notepad without any interrupting dialogs and then pick up where you left off when you return. Notepad will automatically restore previously open tabs as well as unsaved content and edits across those open tabs.
With the new Outlook for Windows, you can connect and coordinate your various accounts (including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, and more) in one app. Intelligent tools help you write clear, concise emails and seamlessly attach important documents and photos from OneDrive. To learn more, visit this link.
Modernized File Explorer, we are introducing a modernized File Explorer home, address bar and search box all designed to help you more easily access important and relevant content, stay up to date with file activity and collaborate without even opening a file. Also coming to File Explorer is a new Gallery feature designed to make it easy to access your photo collection.
New text authoring experiences to voice access and new natural voices in Narrator, continuing our ongoing commitment to making Windows 11 the most accessible version of Windows yet.
Windows Backup makes moving to a new Windows 11 PC easier than ever. With Windows Backup, transitioning most files, apps and settings from one PC to another, is seamless so everything is right where you left it, exactly how you like it.

These experiences, including Copilot in Windows and more will start to become available on Sept. 26 as part of our latest update to Windows 11, version 22H2.
Bing and Edge are redefining how we interact with the web
Today, we’re announcing new features in Bing and Edge to supercharge your day powered by the latest models delivering the most advanced capabilities for AI available. You can use Bing Chat today with Microsoft Edge or at bing.com/chat. Features will begin to roll out soon.

Personalized answers. Now, your chat history can inform your results. For example, if you’ve used Bing to track your favorite soccer team, next time you’re planning a trip it can proactively tell you if the team is playing in your destination city. If you prefer responses that don’t use your chat history, you can turn this feature off in Bing settings.
Copilot in Microsoft Shopping. From Bing or Edge, you can now more quickly find what you’re shopping for online. When you ask for information on an item, Bing will ask additional questions to learn more, then use that information to provide more tailored recommendations. And you can trust you’re getting the best price – in fact, in the last 12 months, shoppers have been offered more than $4 billion in savings on Microsoft Edge. Soon, you’ll also be able to use a photo or saved image as the starting point for shopping.


 

DALL.E 3 model from OpenAI in Bing Image Creator. DALL.E 3 delivers a huge leap forward with more beautiful creations and better renderings for details like fingers and eyes. It also has a better understanding of what you’re asking for, which results in delivering more accurate images. We’re also integrating Microsoft Designer directly into Bing to make editing your creations even easier.
Content Credentials. As we continue to take a responsible approach to generative AI, we’re adding new Content Credentials which uses cryptographic methods to add an invisible digital watermark to all AI-generated images in Bing – including time and date it was originally created. We will also bring support for Content Credentials to Paint and Microsoft Designer.
Bing Chat Enterprise Updates. Since its introduction just two months ago, more than 160 million Microsoft 365 users now have access to Bing Chat Enterprise at no additional cost and the response has been incredible. Today we’re announcing that Bing Chat Enterprise is now available in the Microsoft Edge mobile app. We’re also bringing support for multimodal visual search and Image Creator to Bing Chat Enterprise. Boost your creativity at work with the ability to find information using images and creating them.

Today, we’re also introducing a new, hero experience in Microsoft 365 Copilot: Microsoft 365 Chat. You saw a glimpse of Microsoft 365 Chat in March, then called Business Chat — but rapid advancements over the last few months have taken it to a whole new level. Microsoft 365 Chat combs across your entire universe of data at work, including emails, meetings, chats, documents and more, plus the web. Like an assistant, it has a deep understanding of you, your job, your priorities and your organization. It goes far beyond simple questions and answers to give you a head start on some of your most complex or tedious tasks — whether that’s writing a strategy document, booking a business trip, or catching up on emails.
Over the past few years, the pace and volume of work have only increased. On a given workday, our heaviest users search for what they need 18 times, receive over 250 Outlook emails and send or read nearly 150 Teams chats.[1] Teams users globally are in three times more meetings each week than they were in 2020.[2] And on Windows, some people use 11 apps in a single day to get work done. [3] Microsoft 365 Chat tames the complexity, eliminates the drudgery and helps you reclaim time at work. Preview customers can access it today on Microsoft365.com, Teams, or in Bing when signed in with their work account. In the future you’ll be able to access it wherever you see the Copilot icon when signed in with your work account.
To empower you at work, we’re also introducing new capabilities for Copilot in Outlook, Word, Excel, Loop, OneNote and OneDrive. Bing Chat Enterprise —the first entry point into generative AI for many companies — is getting a few upgrades. And as part of our big Windows 11 update, Windows 365 Switch and Windows 365 Boot will be generally available making it even easier to access your Windows Cloud PC. This will help employees achieve more, while making it easier for IT to deploy, manage and secure. Check out the Microsoft 365 blog to learn more about how Microsoft 365, Bing Chat Enterprise and Windows are transforming the way we work.
Unleashing personal productivity and creativity with Designer and Copilot in Microsoft 365
Designer, the newest addition to our family of Microsoft 365 consumer apps, helps you quickly create stunning visuals, social media posts, invitations, and more using cutting-edge AI. Today, we’re showing some powerful new features, many of which will be powered by OpenAI’s Dall.E 3. Generative expand uses AI to extend your image beyond its borders, generative fill adds a new object or background, and generative erase can remove unwanted objects.[4] Dall.E 3 will also soon power the image generation experience in Designer, making it easy to add original, higher quality images to your design in seconds.

We’re also integrating Designer into Microsoft 365 Copilot for consumers — starting with Word. Designer uses the context of your document to propose visuals to choose from; you can make it more personal by uploading your own photos too. And within moments, you can transform a text-heavy document with custom graphics. We’re starting to test Microsoft 365 Copilot with a small group of Microsoft 365 consumer subscribers and look forward to expanding the preview to more people over time. Seventy percent of creators tell us one of the most difficult parts of the creation process is just getting started.[5] With creative tools like Designer, plus Bing Image Creator, Clipchamp and Paint, you can now have an immediate visual draft of almost anything — with a few simple prompts.

More than 60% of respondents noted their concern about the ethical implications of AI on journalistic values including accuracy, fairness and transparency and other aspects of journalism,  the researchers said in a statement. Journalism around the world is going through another period of exciting and scary technological change,  added report co-author and project director Charlie Beckett.He said the study showed that the new generative AI tools were both a  potential threat to the integrity of information and the news media  but also an  incredible opportunity to make journalism more efficient, effective and trustworthy .Journalists recognised the time-saving benefits of AI with tasks such as interview transcription.But they also noted the need for AI generated content to be checked by a human  to mitigate potential harms like bias and inaccuracy , the authors said.Challenges surrounding AI integration were  more pronounced for newsrooms in the global south  they added.  AI technologies developed have been predominantly available in English, but not in many Asian languages. We have to catch up doubly to create AI systems, and AI systems that work with our local languages,  the report quoted one respondent in the Philippines as saying.
