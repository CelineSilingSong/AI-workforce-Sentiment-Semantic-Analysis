Approaching AI with curiosity




In today’s fast-paced business world, ignoring technology is not an option, and the field of accounting is no exception. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a game-changer, helping accounting firms streamline processes, improve accuracy, and deliver more value to their clients. However, firms are still cautious about adopting GenAI technology into their workflows. The 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from the Thomson Reuters Institute found that 30% of tax and accounting firms are in the consideration phase of whether to use GenAI tools, while 49% have no current plans to use.  
How are industry leading firms implementing GenAI technology? This article explores how different accounting firms use AI in their operations to drive efficiency and excellence in their services.
How many accounting firms use AI?
According to survey respondents, 8% of tax firms identified as using GenAI technology, with 13% of firms planning to use the tech soon.

The adoption of AI in the accounting industry in recent years has been on the rise. Accounting firms of all sizes from global giants to local boutiques are increasingly turning to AI solutions to enhance their services. This shift is driven by the realization that AI can automate mundane tasks, reduce errors, and free up accountants to focus on higher-value advisory work. 
Interestingly, accountants seem to be implementing GenAI tech through personal, open-source tools for their work over industry-specific tools. 27% of tax firm survey respondents who already use a GenAI tool are using open-source technology (i.e. ChatGPT) over 8% using an industry-specific tool.

This trend could soon shift as more industry-specific technology providers introduce their own GenAI solutions within the coming years. 
How do the Big 4 use artificial intelligence?
The “Big 4” accounting firms—Deloitte, Ernst & Young (EY), PwC, and KPMG—have led the way with AI adoption. They have heavily invested in AI-powered tools and solutions to provide clients with more advanced and insightful services. Here’s a glimpse of how they use AI: 

Document review: Deloitte has internally developed an automated document review platform. The tool uses cognitive technologies and fits into their practitioners’ existing workflows, allowing them to evaluate an entire population of contracts to find key information. 
Auditing: EY is embedding AI technology into their audit process. They are using AI to analyze and extract data from unstructured data, such as contracts, and analyze large data sets to help respond to the risks of material misstatement due to fraud. 
IT: In-house teams at PwC have developed customized software applications for employees that synthesize data, complete and review code, generate documentation, and more. They have seen 20% to 50% productivity gains in their development processes because of GenAI. Additionally, PwC professionals have access to an enterprise version of ChatGPT-4o for themselves and their clients.
Client solutions: KPMG’s Trusted AI framework helps their member firms’ clients design, build, deploy, and use AI tech solutions in a responsible and ethical manner, building loyalty and partnerships.

How do smaller accounting firms use AI?
Smaller accounting firms might not have the same resources as the Big 4, but they are also embracing AI to stay competitive and offer better services. According to the GenAI report, the top five use cases for tax firms using or planning to use GenAI were: 

Accounting/bookkeeping automation: Firms are using AI-powered software to automatically categorize expenses, reconcile accounts, and generate financial reports. This saves time and reduces the risk of manual errors for firms.
Tax research: Firms use AI-powered algorithms in tax research tools to return data from human-edited, tax-specific content. This provides authoritative answers from trusted sources quickly and accurately.
Tax return preparation: Firms are using AI to automate the extraction and analysis of data from various financial documents, significantly reducing the time and effort required to prepare accurate tax returns. GenAI also assists in identifying applicable deductions and credits tailored to individual or corporate financial scenarios, ensuring compliance and optimization of tax liabilities.
Tax advisory: Firms are using AI tools to generate predictive insights, helping clients plan for future tax implications based on their financial decisions. This provides a more strategic role to tax professionals, allowing them to offer value-added services.
Document review: Firms use AI to summarize key points from contracts, invoices, and receipts and can quickly identify anomalies that require further investigation. This capability not only speeds up the review process but also enhances the accuracy and reliability of financial audits and compliance checks.


Among the firms actively using or planning to use GenAI, 42% said they use the technology daily, if not multiple times a day. An additional 31% said they are using it weekly.
Approaching AI with curiosity
In the accounting world, AI is not a threat but an opportunity. It can empower firms of all sizes to offer better services, improve efficiency, and thrive in an ever-changing industry. As AI continues to advance, those who approach it with curiosity and a willingness to embrace new technology will likely stay ahead of this trend.

Why banning generative AI at work won’t work

IT leader Jamie Moles advises companies to embrace AI by developing tools and processes to use it securely, because this tech phenomenon isn’t going anywhere.
Those who have been in the IT industry for any period of time know the truth: banning tools in the workplace doesn’t work. Consider that back in the day, we used to monitor how long users were on the internet or block access to the internet altogether. Now businesses are operated entirely through internet-based tools and restrictions are minimal. This is the reality under which generative AI operates.
The explosion of generative AI tools – and subsequent use in the workplace – have many IT leaders concerned about the security risks to their businesses. But if history tells us anything, the mass proliferation of this technology means that bans won’t work. In fact, a recent survey from ExtraHop found that 32pc of organisations have banned generative AI tools, but only 5pc say employees never use these tools at work.
So, what should IT leaders do?
The reality of generative AI
Organisations might be able to block certain generative AI services at the domain level, but there are so many tools out there and so many more coming. It is important to understand that the maintenance effort to keep blocking emerging tools will become unmanageable very quickly. Though ChatGPT will no longer allow users to create security threats, it is far from the only generative AI or large language model (LLM) tool out there.
The only option is to accept that these tools are a new, permanent extension of the modern workplace, and recognise the strong value they offer employees in boosting productivity. This potential to change the workplace and enhance the employee experience is evidence enough that banning this technology is not appropriate for future success. As with any new technology, generative AI still needs to have guardrails in place, and that means leaders need to focus on people, processes and tooling.
Improving company processes
Setting up good policies around the use of generative AI is a critical first step to governing their use in the workplace. The good news is that there are already several solid models on how to safely store and transmit sensitive data – think GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS. Implementing general data security best practices when developing policies is a good starting point.
ExtraHop’s research found that 90pc of respondents want the government involved in regulating AI. While we have seen some initial movement, from the US AI executive order to the EU AI Act, it’s essential to remember that governments are slow-moving beasts. They will provide recommendations and guidance when they can, but the ultimate responsibility for securing corporate data lies with a corporation itself.
Training people
All company AI policies should include strong security training which requires cooperation between non-technical leadership and the more technical leaders who oversee security. It’s equally important to involve employees who are actually using these tools so leaders can understand the benefits of specific use cases and how restrictions could potentially limit their workflow, as well as ensuring they understand the risks of leaking sensitive corporate data.
AI training should be clear and straightforward. For example, users shouldn’t share anything with these tools that is marked as sensitive or internal information. The ultimate goal of training should be to teach users to assess risk themselves in an intuitive way – and if they don’t know, to ask. A good rule of thumb: anything you would not send in an email to external organisations should never be shared with or uploaded to a generative AI service.
Investing in the right tools
The right security tools are a necessary backstop to security training. Though more than 80pc of IT and security leaders said that they were confident that their organisation’s current security stack could protect them from generative AI threats, 74pc are planning to invest in generative AI security measures.
The most valuable way to protect against data leakage with generative AI is to audit the use of the tools. Visibility measures that can help with monitoring data transfers are key.
Most organisations already have the basic tools for monitoring who is accessing certain sites and how often: firewalls and proxies. Both have the ability to monitor every site users connect to on the internet.
Certain security appliances can offer even more insight through measuring bytes in and bytes out. If IT leaders have broad network visibility and see users are sending more bytes out than they should – in the form of data they’re uploading to LLMs – they can assess risk quickly and address the problem easily.
Leaning into innovation
Though it’s been more than a year since ChatGPT made its debut, generative AI technology has made massive strides in the industry. As we see it used more on personal devices for messages, searches and more, we’ll quickly hit a stage where users expect to use these tools on their corporate devices, and they won’t necessarily wait for approval – nor will they know they’re doing something wrong without the right guardrails.
Fortunately, we live in a technology-first society, and many have been quick to raise concerns and create awareness around the risks of generative AI.
To a large extent, this loud and early alarm will encourage AI companies to improve safety in the generative AI products and self-regulate to meet market expectations.
That being said, relying on AI companies’ or government guidance is not an answer, nor is implementing a ban and hoping users will adhere to it. Generative AI is already bringing massive benefits to the workplace, and it’s poised to do so much more. To take advantage of these benefits in the safest way possible, leaders need to integrate generative AI planning into their people, processes and tooling. Generative AI is here to stay.

Facts, it has been said, are stubborn things. For generative AI, a stubborn fact is that it  consumes very large quantities of compute cycles, data storage, network bandwidth, electrical power, and air conditioning. As CIOs respond to corporate mandates to “just do something” with genAI, many are launching cloud-based or on-premises initiatives. But while the payback promised by many genAI projects is nebulous, the costs of the infrastructure to run them is finite, and too often, unacceptably high.
Infrastructure-intensive or not, generative AI is on the march. According to IDC, genAI workloads are increasing from 7.8% of the overall AI server market in 2022 to 36% in 2027. In storage, the curve is similar, with growth from 5.7% of AI storage in 2022 to 30.5% in 2027. IDC research finds roughly half of worldwide genAI expenditures in 2024 will go toward digital infrastructure. IDC projects the worldwide infrastructure market (server and storage) for all kinds of AI will double from $28.1 billion in 2022 to $57 billion in 2027.
But the sheer quantity of infrastructure needed to process genAI’s large language models (LLMs), along with power and cooling requirements, is fast becoming unsustainable.
 
 
 













 
 

“You will spend on clusters with high-bandwidth networks to build almost HPC [high-performance computing]-like environments,” warns Peter Rutten, research vice president for performance-intensive computing at IDC. “Every organization should think hard about investing in a large cluster of GPU nodes,” says Rutten, asking, “What is your use case? Do you have the data center and data science skill sets?”

Shifting to small language models, hybrid infrastructure
Savvy IT leaders are aware of the risk of overspending on genAI infrastructure, whether on-premises or in the cloud. After taking a hard look at their physical operations and staff capabilities as well as the fine print of cloud contracts, some are coming up with strategies that are delivering positive return on investment.  
Seeking to increase the productivity of chronically understaffed radiology teams, Mozziyar Etemadi, medical director of advanced technologies at Northwestern Medicine undertook a genAI project designed to speed the interpretation of X-ray images. But instead of piling on compute, storage, and networking infrastructure to handle massive LLMs, Northwestern Medicine shrank the infrastructure requirements by working with small language models (SLMs).
 
 
 













 
 

Etemadi began by experimenting with cloud-based services but found them unwieldy and expensive. “I tried them, but we couldn’t get [generative AI] to work in a favorable cost envelope.” That led Etemadi to the realization that he would have to spearhead a dedicated engineering effort.
Heading a team of a dozen medical technologists, Etemadi built a four-node cluster of Dell PowerEdge XE9680 servers with eight Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs, connected with Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. Running in a colocation facility, the cluster ingests multimodal data, including images, text, and video, which trains the SLM on how to interpret X-ray images. The resulting application, which was recently patented, generates highly accurate interpretations of the pictures, feeding them to a human-in-the-loop (HITL) for final judgement.
“It’s multimodal, but tiny. The number of parameters is approximately 300 million. That compares to ChatGPT, which is at least a trillion,” says Etemadi, who envisions building on the initial X-ray application to interpret CT scans, MRI images, and colonoscopies.
 
 
 













 
 

He estimates that using a cloud-based service for the same work would cost about twice as much as it costs to run the Dell cluster. “On the cloud, you’re paying by the hour and you’re paying a premium.” In contrast, he asserts, “Pretty much any hospital in the US can buy four computers. It’s well within the budget.”

Ask




When it comes to data storage, Northwestern Medicine uses both the cloud and on-premises infrastructure for both temporary and permanent storage. “It’s about choosing the right tool for the job. With storage, there is really no one-size-fits-all,” says Etemadi, adding, “As a general rule, storage is where cloud has the highest premium fee.”
On premises, Northwestern Medicine is using a mix of Dell NAS, SAN, secure, and hyperconverged infrastructure equipment. “We looked at how much data we needed and for how long. Most of the time, the cloud is definitely not cheaper,” asserts Etemadi. 
 
 
 













 
 

The cost calculus of GPU clusters
Faced with similar challenges, a different approach was taken by Papercup Technologies, a UK company that has developed genAI-based language translation and dubbing services. Papercup clients seeking to globalize the appeal of their products use the company’s service to generate convincing voice-overs in many languages for use in commercial videos. Before a job is complete, an HITL examines output for accuracy and cultural relevance. The LLM work started in a London office building, which was soon outgrown by the infrastructure demands of generative AI.
“It was quite cost-effective at first to buy our own hardware, which was a four-GPU cluster,” says Doniyor Ulmasov, head of engineering at Papercup. He estimates initial savings between 60% and 70% compared with cloud-based services. “But when we added another six machines, the power and cooling requirements were such that the building could not accommodate them. We had to pay for machines we could not use because we couldn’t cool them,” he recounts.
And electricity and air conditioning weren’t the only obstacles. “Server-grade equipment requires know-how for things like networking setup and remote management. We expended a lot of human resources to maintain the systems, so the savings weren’t really there,” he adds.
 
 
 













 
 

At that point, Papercup decided the cloud was needed. The company now uses Amazon Web Services, where translation and dubbing workloads for customers are handled, to be reviewed by an HITL. Simpler training workloads are still run on premises on a mixture of servers powered by Nvidia A100 Tensor Core, GeForce RTX 4090, and GeForce RTX 2080Ti hardware. More resource-intensive training is handled on a cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Building on its current services, Papercup is exploring language translation and dubbing for live sports events and movies, says Ulmasov.
For Papercup, infrastructure decisions are driven as much by geography as by technology requirements. “If we had a massive warehouse outside the [London] metro area, you could make the case [for keeping work on-premises]. But we are in the city center. I would still consider on-premises if space, power, and cooling were not issues,” says Ulmasov.
Beyond GPUs
For now, GPU-based clusters are simply faster than CPU-based configurations, and that matters. Both Etemadi and Ulmasov say using CPU-based systems would cause unacceptable delays that would keep their HITL experts waiting. But the high energy demands of the current generation of GPUs will only increase, according to IDC’s Rutten.
 
 
 













 
 

“Nvidia’s current GPU has a 700-watt power envelope, then the next one doubles that. It’s like a space heater. I don’t see how that problem gets resolved easily,” says the analyst.  
The reign of GPUs in genAI and other forms of AI could be challenged by an emerging host of AI co-processors, and eventually perhaps, by quantum computing.
“The GPU was invented for graphics processing so it’s not AI-optimized. Increasingly, we’ll see AI-specialized hardware,” predicts Claus Torp Jensen, former CIO and CTO and currently a technology advisor. Although he does not anticipate the disappearance of GPUs, he says future AI algorithms will be handled by a mix of CPUs, GPUs, and AI co-processors, both on-premises and in the cloud.
 
 
 













 
 

Another factor working against unmitigated power consumption is sustainability. Many organizations have adopted sustainability goals, which power-hungry AI algorithms make it difficult to achieve. Rutten says using SLMs, ARM-based CPUs, and cloud providers that maintain zero-emissions policies, or that run on electricity produced by renewable sources, are all worth exploring where sustainability is a priority.

For implementations that require large-scale workloads, using microprocessors built with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are a choice worth considering.
“They are much more efficient and can be more powerful. You have to hardware-code them up front and that takes time and work, but you could save significantly compared to GPUs,” says Rutten.
 
 
 













 
 

Until processors that run significantly faster while using less power and generating less heat emerge, the GPU is a stubborn fact of life for generative AI, and implementing cost-effective genAI implementations will require ingenuity and perseverance. But as Etemadi and Ulmasov demonstrate, the challenge is not beyond the reach of strategies utilizing small language models and a skillful mix of on-premises and cloud-based services.

What Is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. Learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language comprehension are all examples of cognitive abilities.
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

Weak AI vs. Strong AI
When discussing artificial intelligence (AI), it is common to distinguish between two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI. Let's explore the characteristics of each type:

Weak AI (Narrow AI)

Weak AI refers to AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks and are limited to those tasks only. These AI systems excel at their designated functions but lack general intelligence. Examples of weak AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation algorithms, and image recognition systems. Weak AI operates within predefined boundaries and cannot generalize beyond their specialized domain.

Strong AI (General AI)

Strong AI, also known as general AI, refers to AI systems that possess human-level intelligence or even surpass human intelligence across a wide range of tasks. Strong AI would be capable of understanding, reasoning, learning, and applying knowledge to solve complex problems in a manner similar to human cognition. However, the development of strong AI is still largely theoretical and has not been achieved to date.
Master Tools You Need For Becoming an AI EngineerAI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramTypes of Artificial Intelligence 
Below are the various types of AI:
1. Purely Reactive
These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work. For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win. 
2. Limited Memory
These machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant based on the location data that has been gathered.
3. Theory of Mind
This kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on this type is yet to be built. 
4. Self-Aware
Self-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies. They will be intelligent, sentient, and conscious.
Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning
Let's explore the contrast between deep learning and machine learning:
Machine Learning: 
Machine Learning focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Here are key characteristics of machine learning:
Feature Engineering: In machine learning, experts manually engineer or select relevant features from the input data to aid the algorithm in making accurate predictions.
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning: Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data with known outcomes, and unsupervised learning, where algorithms discover patterns and structures in unlabeled data.
Broad Applicability: Machine learning techniques find application across various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

Deep Learning: 
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. Here are key characteristics of deep learning:
Automatic Feature Extraction: Deep learning algorithms have the ability to automatically extract relevant features from raw data, eliminating the need for explicit feature engineering.
Deep Neural Networks: Deep learning employs neural networks with multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), enabling the learning of complex hierarchical representations of data.
High Performance: Deep learning has demonstrated exceptional performance in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, often surpassing traditional machine learning approaches.

How Does Artificial Intelligence Work?
Put simply, AI systems work by merging large with intelligent, iterative processing algorithms. This combination allows AI to learn from patterns and features in the analyzed data. Each time an Artificial Intelligence system performs a round of data processing, it tests and measures its performance and uses the results to develop additional expertise.
Ways of Implementing AI 
Let’s explore the following ways that explain how we can implement AI:
Machine Learning
It is machine learning that gives AI the ability to learn. This is done by using algorithms to discover patterns and generate insights from the data they are exposed to. 
Deep Learning
Deep learning, which is a subcategory of machine learning, provides AI with the ability to mimic a human brain’s neural network. It can make sense of patterns, noise, and sources of confusion in the data.
Consider an image shown below:

Here we segregated the various kinds of images using deep learning. The machine goes through various features of photographs and distinguishes them with a process called feature extraction. Based on the features of each photo, the machine segregates them into different categories, such as landscape, portrait, or others. 
Let us understand how deep learning works. 
Consider an image shown below:

The above image depicts the three main layers of a neural network:
Input Layer
Hidden Layer
Output Layer
Input Layer
The images that we want to segregate go into the input layer. Arrows are drawn from the image on to the individual dots of the input layer. Each of the white dots in the yellow layer (input layer) are a pixel in the picture. These images fill the white dots in the input layer.
We should have a clear idea of these three layers while going through this artificial intelligence tutorial.
Hidden Layer
The hidden layers are responsible for all the mathematical computations or feature extraction on our inputs. In the above image, the layers shown in orange represent the hidden layers. The lines that are seen between these layers are called ‘weights’. Each one of them usually represents a float number, or a decimal number, which is multiplied by the value in the input layer. All the weights add up in the hidden layer. The dots in the hidden layer represent a value based on the sum of the weights. These values are then passed to the next hidden layer.
You may be wondering why there are multiple layers. The hidden layers function as alternatives to some degree. The more the hidden layers are, the more complex the data that goes in and what can be produced. The accuracy of the predicted output generally depends on the number of hidden layers present and the complexity of the data going in.
Your AI/ML Career is Just Around The Corner!AI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore Program
Output Layer
The output layer gives us segregated photos. Once the layer adds up all these weights being fed in, it'll determine if the picture is a portrait or a landscape.
Example - Predicting Airfare Costs
This prediction is based on various factors, including:
Airline 
Origin airport 
Destination airport
Departure date
We begin with some historical data on ticket prices to train the machine. Once our machine is trained, we share new data that will predict the costs. Earlier, when we learned about four kinds of machines, we discussed machines with memory. Here, we talk about the memory only, and how it understands a pattern in the data and uses it to make predictions for the new prices as shown below:

AI Programming Cognitive Skills: Learning, Reasoning and Self-Correction
Artificial Intelligence emphasizes three cognitive skills of learning, reasoning, and self-correction, skills that the human brain possess to one degree or another. We define these in the context of AI as:
Learning: The acquisition of information and the rules needed to use that information.
Reasoning: Using the information rules to reach definite or approximate conclusions.
Self-Correction: The process of continually fine-tuning AI algorithms and ensure that they offer the most accurate results they can.
However, researchers and programmers have extended and elaborated the goals of AI to the following:

Logical Reasoning 
AI programs enable computers to perform sophisticated tasks. On February 10, 1996, IBM’s Deep Blue computer won a game of chess against a former world champion, Garry Kasparov.

Knowledge Representation
Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language that was created to underpin the “new world” of computing exemplified by “human-computer symbiosis.”

Planning and Navigation 
The process of enabling a computer to get from point A to point B. A prime example of this is Google’s self-driving Toyota Prius.


Natural Language Processing 
Set up computers that can understand and process language.

Perception 
Use computers to interact with the world through sight, hearing, touch, and smell.

Emergent Intelligence 
Intelligence that is not explicitly programmed, but emerges from the rest of the specific AI features. The vision for this goal is to have machines exhibit emotional intelligence and moral reasoning.
Some of the tasks performed by AI-enabled devices include:
Speech recognition 
Object detection
Solve problems and learn from the given data 
Plan an approach for future tests to be done

Answer


Is AI-generated content copyrighted?


The current legal landscape surrounding AI-generated content is murky and fraught with confusion. Here's where it currently stands and what to know before publishing.

Published: 05 Jun 2024


 
Copyright law, as it currently stands, was written at a time when humans were directly involved in fair use practices, such as citing sources and creating derivative works, which is copyrighted work that comes from other copyrighted work. However, various generative AI tools can create text, images, songs, videos and other content. New AI models can scan copyright-protected content at scale to distill an image's style, a novel's plot or a program's logic. Once trained on protected content, these AI models can generate new content different enough from the original that some might consider it fair use.







Yet, users of popular GenAI platforms can't determine how these services were trained.
""The problem with AI-generated content is that users don't know exactly where the AI is sourcing things from and which parts of the content it creates are from scratch or just pulled from another piece of copyrighted content, or even another person's AI-generated artwork on the platform,"" said Nizel Adams, CEO and principal engineer at AI consultancy Nizel Corp.
If an organization wants to incorporate AI-generated content into its marketing or content strategies, it must consider the following two questions to avoid copyright infringement.

Can AI-generated content be copyrighted?
If users of GenAI platforms don't know what content the tools were trained on, then they might hesitate to adopt these platforms in case their AI-generated content is already copyrighted and doesn't fall within fair use.

The U.S. Copyright Office has provided some guidance on this topic, but the overarching answer is that AI-generated content can sometimes be copyrighted, according to David Siegel, partner at Grellas Shah LLP. Siegel said he expects more guidance as the courts tackle the issue.
Thus far, the Copyright Office, in line with existing case law, has explained that for a work to be afforded copyright protection in the U.S., it must have a human author. Yet, Siegel said he is not sure what that means in the world of AI.
""If the only human involvement is the input of a chat prompt into ChatGPT, for example, one cannot obtain copyright protection for the raw result of that prompt,"" he said.
On the other hand, if a user inputs a prompt into an AI tool, gets a response and then modifies the result in creative ways, that can potentially result in content afforded copyright protection. However, only human-authored parts of the work can be copyrighted.
In other words, AI can be a tool authors use to generate materials and create copyrighted works. ""But that is a far cry from what most people think about when considering whether AI-generated content can be copyrighted, which is traditionally focused on copyrighting raw outputs,"" Siegel said.


What is considered copyright infringement for AI-generated content?
Users might wonder if AI-generated content trained on protected intellectual property is considered copyright infringement. This question has a murkier answer and is the subject of numerous lawsuits on images, songs and books. For example, in early 2023, TikTok, Spotify and YouTube removed an AI-generated song that mimicked the voices of rapper Drake and R&B artist The Weeknd. However, the implications for AI-generated content less similar than this example are unclear.
A copyright infringement inquiry begins with the long-established test of access and substantial similarity, according to William Scott Goldman, managing attorney and founder at Goldman Law Group. Overall, this means the case would have to prove that the AI or a human read the content and that it's similar enough to convince a jury it was copied.
""Although there is no established case law for generative AI just yet, I believe without clear-cut proof of access, such infringement claims will fail unless the copying in question is deemed identical to the original,"" Goldman said.
However, Goldman also said he believes copyright owners and plaintiffs could assert unauthorized use, especially if this use is not considered de minimis -- too small to be considered meaningful -- and the resulting work is substantially similar to the original.
Once both issues have been demonstrated, the case would turn on a fair use defense. GenAI could be considered a derivative work under existing copyright law if it contains sufficient original authorship, Goldman said.
Courts now grapple with whether AI-generated content sufficiently differs enough from the originals under existing fair use precedents.





Lawsuits over AI-generated content
Various lawsuits regarding AI-generated content and GenAI tools have started to make their way through the courts -- both related and unrelated to copyright.
In November 2022, programmers filed a class-action lawsuit against GitHub, Microsoft and OpenAI focusing on breach of contract and privacy claims. In January 2023, the same law firm also filed a class-action lawsuit related to AI-generated image services, such as Stability AI's Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DreamUp, which raises copyright infringement issues.
A few days later, Getty Images also filed a lawsuit relating to Stable Diffusion, arguing the service had ""copied more than 12 million photographs from Getty Images' collection, along with the associated captions and metadata, without permission from or compensation to Getty Images,"" according to the lawsuit. In July 2023, Sarah Silverman and other authors sued OpenAI and Meta, claiming the GenAI training process infringed on the copyright protection of their works.
These lawsuits differ in important ways, according to Siegel. Stability AI allegedly uses images from the web to train its models. As a result, Getty's customers arguably have less need to license more images from Getty. This gets at the heart of copyright law, which is to incentivize people to develop creative works. Photographers and artists might be less willing to spend time and resources developing photos and images if those are used to train AI to replace them.
""If you are a photographer, would you be willing to spend your time and resources creating photos if those photos were going to be used to train an AI model, without compensation or permission, and potential licensees of your images could simply go to the AI model instead? Doubtful,"" Siegel said.
The Silverman case against OpenAI and Meta centers around the ability to provide summaries of books without permission to create derivative works from the authors. Siegel said this case differs from the Getty Images one because its use is similar to CliffsNotes, which is considered fine because people can still buy the book to get the full story.


To use or not to use?
In his May 2024 article ""AI lawsuits explained: Who's getting sued?,"" TechTarget Site Editor Ben Lutkevich noted that settling cases involving the use of AI will help answer the following questions:

Do you need a license to train a GenAI model on copyrighted material?
Does AI-generated content infringe on the copyright of the materials used to train the model?
Does GenAI violate controls regarding removal or alteration of copyright information?
Is work generated by AI in the style of someone else a violation of that person's rights?
What are the ramifications of using open source licenses to train AI models?

Read Lutkevich's full article about copyright lawsuits brought against GenAI companies.




How will AI change copyright laws?
The short-term future of AI-generated content copyright will likely aim to clarify existing concepts, such as fair use and authorship for the AI age. Most AI companies rely on fair use to justify how they train their models, but it presents a gray area, Siegel said.
""To the extent the U.S. wants to foster the development of AI businesses, the laws around the use of copyrighted works in training AI models need to be sufficiently clear that even an early-stage startup can predictably determine whether their business model will run afoul of copyright laws. We are not even close to that point,"" Siegel said.
Overall, AI is changing copyright law. It is causing the legal system to define what constitutes authorship and how to protect human-generated content even if it contains AI-generated content, said Robert Scott, managing partner and Scott & Scott LLP.
In the U.S., the Copyright Office guidance states that works containing AI-generated content are not copyrightable without evidence that a human author contributed creatively. New laws can help clarify the level of human contribution needed to protect works containing AI-generated content.

  Weather forecasters in Taiwan had their hair blown back when they saw a typhoon up close, created on a computer that slashed the time and energy needed for the job.
It’s a reaction that users in many fields are feeling as generative AI shows them how new levels of performance contribute to reductions in total cost of ownership.
Inside the AI of the Storm
Tracking a typhoon provided a great test case of generative AI’s prowess. The work traditionally begins with clusters of CPUs cranking on complex algorithms to create atmospheric models with a 25-kilometer resolution.
Enter CorrDiff, a generative AI model that’s part of NVIDIA Earth-2, a set of services and software for weather and climate research.
Using a class of diffusion models that power today’s text-to-image services, CorrDiff resolved the 25-km models to two kilometers 1,000x faster, using 3,000x less energy for a single inference than traditional methods.
CorrDiff Cuts Costs 50x, Energy Use 25x
CorrDiff shines on the NVIDIA AI platform, even when retraining the model once a year and using statistical groups of a thousand forecasts to boost the accuracy of predictions. Compared to traditional methods under these conditions, it slashes cost by 50x cost and energy use by 25x a year.
That means work that used to require nearly $3 million for a cluster of CPUs and the energy to run them can be done for about $60,000 on a single system with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. It’s a massive reduction that shows how generative AI and accelerated computing increases energy efficiency and lowers total cost of ownership.
The technology also helps forecasters see more precisely where a typhoon will land, potentially saving lives.
“NVIDIA’s CorrDiff generative AI model opens the door to the use of AI-generated kilometer-scale weather forecasts, enabling Taiwan to prepare better for typhoons,” said Hongey Chen, a director of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction.
The Taiwan forecasters could save nearly a gigawatt-hour a year, using CorrDiff. Energy savings could balloon if the nearly 200 regional weather data centers around the world adopt the technology for more sustainable computing.
Companies that sell commercial forecasts are also adopting CorrDiff, attracted by its speed and savings.
Broad Horizons for Energy Efficiency
NVIDIA Earth-2 takes these capabilities to a planetary scale. It fuses AI, physics simulations and observed data to help countries and companies respond to global issues like climate change. That will help address the impacts of climate change, which is expected to cost a million lives and $1.7 trillion per year by 2050.
Accelerated computing and generative AI are bringing new levels of performance and energy efficiency to many applications. Explainers on green computing and why GPUs are great for AI provide more context and some examples.
Compare the costs and energy consumption of popular workloads running on an x86 CPU-based server versus an NVIDIA GPU server with this simple calculator. And watch Huang’s keynote address at COMPUTEX to get the big picture.

Asana is developing an AI “teammate” feature that embeds generative AI (genAI) into the flow of work for users of its work management app. The teammates — created using “trigger and action” format in Asana’s existing workflow automation tools — can perform tasks such as carrying out research and interact with co-workers to help coordinate work.
The new feature accesses information on the Asana work graph —  data on the work a team does, and the people doing the work — and relies on large language models [LLMs] from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI. 
“When people think about working with AI like working with the teammate, they get better value out of it, because they’re better able to give it instructions, give it feedback, and effectively partner with it,” said Paige Costello, head of AI at Asana.
 
 
 













 
 

There are a variety of ways to customize a teammate, said Costello. One example (from a customer testing the feature) involves the work request process for a design team. Here, a “request triage” assistant can check an incoming work request form to determine whether it contains sufficient detail about the scope of the request. If not, the AI assistant sends a message back offering suggestions for more information to include.

That process can save back-and-forth messages between coworkers trying to get the correct information, Paige said.
Another customer — a marketing firm — set up an AI teammate to conduct research around clients. In that case, the teammate can generate a first draft brief with information on clients’ previous brand campaigns and what they’re known for.
 
 
 













 
 

The Asana app already has workflow automation tools, but the addition of LLMs allows for more powerful automations. “What’s really exciting about embedding LLMs into work management is that there’s judgement, there’s nuance,” said Costello.  “Instead of it being a black and white rule — ‘if these things are missing, ask this’ — it’s directional, like, ‘here’s what we typically look for; use your judgment.’”
That said, given the unreliability of LLMs, there’s potential for the teammates to introduce errors into the work management process. 
Costello said it’s important to have a “human in the loop,” when the AI assistant takes action. “We want to make sure that humans are the ultimate deciders,” she said. “They’re the ones that are accountable, they’re the ones completing the work: AI is just helping. AI shouldn’t be moving work forward in a way that is not permissioned effectively by the team or the person driving that work.”
 
 
 













 
 

The AI teammate feature could potentially be accessed by a broad range of Asana users, said Chris Marsh, research director at 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“I believe the AI teammate is designed to appeal in a general sense, in that the aim is to have the teammate enhance general team workflows,” he said, noting it could improve withaccess to more data in Asana’s work graph over time. 
“It’ll inevitably be a work in progress in terms of how helpful it is from the launch, but what it does represent is AI being applied to the next tranche of use cases in work management,” Marsh said.
 
 
 













 
 

He expects “market interest” in the capabilities of a tool such as Asana’s AI teammate. 
A recent 451 Research survey indicated that 44% of employees see “low or no impact” of AI on their workforce tools. Only 24% said AI has had a moderate impact. But when survey participants were asked about the types of technologies that could enhance how they work, the popular response was an “an AI assistant that can help with automating basic tasks and more strategic kinds of work design,” said Marsh. 
“So, few are seeing AI’s impact so far, but a lot want to see it and want to see it in the form of an AI assistant to do the kinds of things Asana’s AI teammate is focused on doing,” he said.
 
 
 













 
 

The AI teammate feature is currently in beta trial with select customers. Asana is evaluating different pricing models with more specifics available closer to a general availability launch. 
No launch date has yet been set.

Because AI has become so pervasive in today's industries and people's daily lives, a new debate has emerged, pitting the two competing paradigms of AI and human intelligence. 
While the goal of artificial intelligence is to build and create intelligent systems that are capable of doing jobs that are analogous to those performed by humans, we can't help but question if AI is adequate on its own. This article covers a wide range of subjects, including the potential impact of AI on the future of work and the economy, how AI differs from human intelligence, and the ethical considerations that must be taken into account.
What Is Artificial Intelligence?
The term artificial intelligence may be used for any computer that has characteristics similar to the human brain, including the ability to think critically, make decisions, and increase productivity. The foundation of AI is human insights that may be determined in such a manner that machines can easily realize the jobs, from the most simple to the most complicated. 
Insights that are synthesized are the result of intellectual activity, including study, analysis, logic, and observation. Tasks, including robotics, control mechanisms, computer vision, scheduling, and data mining, fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.
What Is Human Intelligence?
The origins of human intelligence and conduct may be traced back to the individual's unique combination of genetics, upbringing, and exposure to various situations and environments. And it hinges entirely on one's freedom to shape his or her environment via the application of newly acquired information.
The information it provides is varied. For example, it may provide information on a person with a similar skill set or background, or it may reveal diplomatic information that a locator or spy was tasked with obtaining. After everything is said and done, it is able to deliver information about interpersonal relationships and the arrangement of interests.
Artificial Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence: A Comparison
The following is a table that compares human intelligence vs artificial intelligence:

Parameters


Human Intelligence


Artificial Intelligence 


Evolution


The cognitive abilities to think, reason, evaluate, and so on are built into human beings by their very nature.


Norbert Wiener, who hypothesized critique mechanisms, is credited with making a significant early contribution to the development of artificial intelligence (AI).


Essence


The purpose of human intelligence is to combine a range of cognitive activities in order to adapt to new circumstances.


The goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to create computers that are able to behave like humans and complete jobs that humans would normally do.


Functionality


People make use of the memory, processing capabilities, and cognitive talents that their brains provide.


The processing of data and commands is essential to the operation of AI-powered devices.


Pace of operation


When it comes to speed, humans are no match for artificial intelligence or robots.


Computers have the ability to process far more information at a higher pace than individuals do. In the instance that the human mind can answer a mathematical problem in five minutes, artificial intelligence is capable of solving ten problems in one minute.


Learning ability


The basis of human intellect is acquired via the process of learning through a variety of experiences and situations.


Due to the fact that robots are unable to think in an abstract manner or make conclusions based on the experiences of the past. They are only capable of acquiring knowledge via exposure to material and consistent practice, although they will never create a cognitive process that is unique to humans.


Choice Making


It is possible for subjective factors that are not only based on numbers to influence the decisions that humans make.


Because it evaluates based on the entirety of the acquired facts, AI is exceptionally objective when it comes to making decisions.


Perfection


When it comes to human insights, there is almost always the possibility of ""human mistake,"" which refers to the fact that some nuances may be overlooked at some time or another.


The fact that AI's capabilities are built on a collection of guidelines that may be updated allows it to deliver accurate results regularly.


Adjustments 


The human mind is capable of adjusting its perspectives in response to the changing conditions of its surroundings. Because of this, people are able to remember information and excel in a variety of activities.


It takes artificial intelligence a lot more time to adapt to unneeded changes.


Flexibility


The ability to exercise sound judgment is essential to multitasking, as shown by juggling a variety of jobs at once.


In the same way that a framework may learn tasks one at a time, artificial intelligence is only able to accomplish a fraction of the tasks at the same time.


Social Networking


Humans are superior to other social animals in terms of their ability to assimilate theoretical facts, their level of self-awareness, and their sensitivity to the emotions of others. This is because people are social creatures.


Artificial intelligence has not yet mastered the ability to pick up on associated social and enthusiastic indicators.


Operation


It might be described as inventive or creative.


It improves the overall performance of the system. It is impossible for it to be creative or inventive since robots cannot think in the same way that people can.

What Brian Cells Can Be Tweaked to Learn Faster?
According to the findings of recent research, altering the electrical characteristics of certain cells in simulations of neural circuits caused the networks to acquire new information more quickly than in simulations with cells that were identical. They also discovered that in order for the networks to achieve the same outcomes, a smaller number of the modified cells were necessary and that the approach consumed fewer resources than models that utilized identical cells.
These results not only shed light on how human brains excel at learning but may also help us develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems, such as speech and facial recognition software for digital assistants and autonomous vehicle navigation systems.
The researchers focused on adjusting the ""time constant,"" or the pace at which one cell makes a decision about its own fate based on the actions of its associated cells. Some cells make decisions rapidly, while others take longer to respond and base their choice on the actions of nearby cells.Become a AI & Machine Learning Professional$267 billionExpected Global AI Market Value By 202737.3%Projected CAGR Of The Global AI Market From 2023-2030$15.7 trillionExpected Total Contribution Of AI To The Global Economy By 2030Artificial Intelligence EngineerIndustry-recognized AI Engineer Master’s certificate from SimplilearnDedicated live sessions by faculty of industry experts11 Months monthsView ProgramPost Graduate Program in AI and Machine LearningProgram completion certificate from Purdue University and SimplilearnGain exposure to ChatGPT, OpenAI, Dall-E, Midjourney & other prominent tools11 Months monthsView ProgramprevNextHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:Indrakala Nigam BeniwalTechnical Consultant, Land Transport Authority (LTA) SingaporeI completed a Master's Program in Artificial Intelligence Engineer with flying colors from Simplilearn.

Artificial Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence: What Will the Future of Human vs AI Be?
The capabilities of AI are constantly expanding. It takes a significant amount of time to develop AI systems, which is something that cannot happen in the absence of human intervention. All forms of artificial intelligence, including self-driving vehicles and robotics, as well as more complex technologies like computer vision, and natural language processing, are dependent on human intellect.
Impact of AI on the Future of Jobs
1. Automation of Tasks
The most noticeable effect of AI has been the result of the digitalization and automation of formerly manual processes across a wide range of industries. These tasks, which were formerly performed manually, are now performed digitally. Currently, tasks or occupations that involve some degree of repetition or the use and interpretation of large amounts of data are communicated to and administered by a computer, and in certain cases, the intervention of humans is not required in order to complete these tasks or jobs.
2. New Opportunities
Artificial intelligence is creating new opportunities for the workforce by automating formerly human-intensive tasks. The rapid development of technology has resulted in the emergence of new fields of study and work, such as digital engineering. Therefore, although traditional manual labor jobs may go extinct, new opportunities and careers will emerge.
3. Economic Growth Model
When it's put to good use, rather than just for the sake of progress, AI has the potential to increase productivity and collaboration inside a company by opening up vast new avenues for growth. As a result, it may spur an increase in demand for goods and services, and power an economic growth model that spreads prosperity and raises standards of living.
4. Role of Work
In the era of AI, recognizing the potential of employment beyond just maintaining a standard of living is much more important. It conveys an understanding of the essential human need for involvement, co-creation, dedication, and a sense of being needed, and should therefore not be overlooked. So, sometimes, even mundane tasks at work become meaningful and advantageous, and if the task is eliminated or automated, it should be replaced with something that provides a comparable opportunity for human expression and disclosure.
5. Growth of Creativity and Innovation
Experts now have more time to focus on analyzing, delivering new and original solutions, and other operations that are firmly in the area of the human intellect, while robotics, AI, and industrial automation handle some of the mundane and physical duties formerly performed by humans.
Will AI Replace Humans?
While AI has the potential to automate specific tasks and jobs, it is likely to replace humans in some areas. AI is best suited for handling repetitive, data-driven tasks and making data-driven decisions. However, human skills such as creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving still need to be more valuable and easily replicated by AI.
The future of AI is more likely to involve collaboration between humans and machines, where AI augments human capabilities and enables humans to focus on higher-level tasks that require human ingenuity and expertise. It is essential to view AI as a tool that can enhance productivity and facilitate new possibilities rather than as a complete substitute for human involvement.

The Department of Energy’s national labs have an especially critical role to play in the advancement of artificial intelligence systems and research into the technology, a top federal official said Tuesday during a Joint Economic Committee hearing on AI and economic growth.
Jennifer Gaudioso, director of the Sandia National Laboratory’s Center for Computing Research, emphasized during her testimony the role that DOE’s national labs could have in both accelerating computing capacity and helping support advances in AI technology. She pointed to her own lab’s work in securing the U.S. nuclear arsenal — and the national labs’ historical role in promoting high-performance computing. 
“Doing AI at the frontier and at scale is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and solving complex global challenges,“ Gaudioso said. “Breakthroughs in one area beget discoveries in others.”
Gaudioso also noted the importance of building AI systems based on more advanced data than the internet-based sources used to build systems like ChatGPT. That includes government datasets, she added.

“What I get really excited about is the transformative potential of training models on science data,” she said. “We can then do new manufacturing. We can make digital twins of the human body to take drug discovery from decades down to months. Maybe 100 days for the next vaccine.” 
The national labs’ current work on artificial intelligence includes AI and nuclear deterrence, national security, non-proliferation, and advanced science and technology, Gaudioso shared. She also referenced the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security and Technology — a DOE effort focused on using supercomputing for AI. The FASST initiative was announced last month. 
Last November, FedScoop reported on how the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee was preparing its supercomputing resources — including the world’s fastest supercomputer, Frontier — for AI work. 
Tuesday’s hearing follows the White House’s continued promotion of new AI-focused policies, and as Congress mulls legislation focused on both regulating and incubating artificial intelligence

Published on 3 June 2024








After capturing the public’s imagination in 2022, generative Artificial Intelligence (gen AI) began to permeate the business landscape in 2023. 2024 remains a crucial year for the future of AI, with researchers and organisations pushing the boundaries by developing new algorithms and models to tackle increasingly complex tasks.
A recent IBM report found that three out of four (75%) global CEOs believe that the organisation with the most advanced gen AI will have the ultimate advantage. Moreover, 43% of CEOs said they will use gen AI to inform strategic decisions. Companies worldwide are recognising the benefits of gen AI and its crucial role in their success. This is driving a new era of work, productivity and opportunities across industries. AI is projected to enhance human productivity and unlock an astounding $16-trillion in value by 2030. In perspective, the fifth largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 was about $3.7-trillion. When combined with automation technology, gen AI can help clients improve interactions with customers and partners, as well as boost operational efficiency and productivity. 
Slow but steady AI adoption in Africa
This is not just a global phenomenon; half of the African CEOs surveyed in our IBM report expect to realise significant value from advanced AI and analytics. However, adopting AI is not without its obstacles. Many businesses on the continent and beyond are grappling with a multitude of challenges. Globally, 82% of IT professionals say IT complexity is impeding success in deploying AI, while 55% of business leaders lack key information regarding their technology spending decisions. In Africa, many organisations face barriers such as costs, market and regulatory factors, workforce readiness, infrastructure, skills gap, ethics and governance.

Become an AI-first organisation to stay ahead
To overcome these challenges, organisations must move to an AI-first approach, where AI is integrated into their business strategy across the lifecycle. Being AI-first enables businesses to be value-creators rather than solely value users. Companies that will lead their respective industries for the next decade or two will be the ones that decide to be AI-first. That is why we launched watsonx in 2023 to develop trusted AI and drive innovation for organisations in every sector or industry. Building an open-source AI community is a core part of our AI strategy. At our recent THINK conference, we further enhanced watsonx’s data and automation capabilities to make it more open, cost-effective, and flexible for businesses.  We achieved this by releasing a family of IBM Granite code models to the open-source community. We launched InstructLab with Red Hat, to enhance large language models and open the doors for those with minimal machine learning experience to contribute. We also announced IBM Concert that uses AI-powered automation to help businesses to discover gaps, prioritise insights, reduce complexity and streamline operations for more innovation and cost-effectiveness.
Putting IBM AI solutions and watsonx to work across industries
Since the launch of watsonx, we have over 700 client pilots running and managing over 1,200 AI models globally. We have also increased the accessibility of watsonx by making it available on AWS Marketplace, reaching 92 countries worldwide, including 18 in Africa. To name a few examples, we are leveraging watsonx’s geospatial foundation model built from NASA’s satellite data to ensure climate resilience with the Government of Kenya. watsonx is enabling local scientists to track and visualise tree-planting activities to assist the government’s goal of planting 15-billion trees by 2032. Working with Neostream Technology, an IBM business partner based in Kenya, we successfully deployed and integrated IBM Instana with M-GAS – a premium provider of liquefied petroleum gas in the country. The deployment of Instana has provided real-time monitoring and visibility. This has empowered M-GAS to track critical business applications with granular application-level insights. This has empowered M-GAS to address issues across all layers of their technology stack that previously could not be delivered by traditional monitoring tools. Lastly, Instana’s intuitive interfaces and customizable dashboards have offered rapid issue identification and resolution, fostering team collaboration, minimising downtime, and enabling M-GAS to intervene proactively to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to their customers.
In the Middle East, we partnered with the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority to launch an open-source Arabic Large Language Model, ALLaM on watsonx.  This has enabled the deployment of Arabic gen AI models, which opens the possibility of building AI models for Africa using the continent’s rich and diverse languages. Globally, working with Transport for London, we deployed IBM Maximo to assist in managing the day-to-day maintenance efforts for more than 10,000 internal technicians within the London Underground. Above ground, the software enables the tracking, support and oversight of numerous contractors – helping extend existing equipment’s life and keeping commuters happy.
Across the world, organisations are leveraging IBM’s AI business solutions to solve business challenges. Their use cases range from banking and financial services, energy, telecommunications, climate change and sustainability, customer services and entertainment to name a few.
The right partnerships and governance are key
The adoption of gen AI is accelerating across enterprises as organisations aim to gain a competitive edge and unlock new opportunities. To achieve this, organisations need to have a robust AI strategy and the right level of investment. They also need to establish and implement clear and consistent standards or guardrails concerning the utilisation of AI across all strategic focus areas. Most importantly, they need the right partner who understands the overall business objective and how to overcome barriers preventing AI adoption. Such collaborative partnerships are critical for developing robust data and AI strategies, filling the skills gaps, and guiding the organisational change necessary for successful AI adoption.

The rapid advancement of technology, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), is reshaping industries and transforming the nature of work. As AI technologies become increasingly sophisticated, they are augmenting human capabilities and revolutionizing traditional job roles. In this era of AI, new career opportunities are emerging, and the concept of co-working with machines is gaining prominence. Let’s explore the evolving landscape of careers in the AI era and how humans are collaborating with intelligent machines.
AI and the Changing World of Work:
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing industries across the board, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and retail. As AI technologies become more advanced, they are automating routine tasks, optimizing processes, and enabling data-driven decision-making. This automation is reshaping job roles and creating new opportunities for human workers to focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence.
In the AI era, traditional job roles are evolving to incorporate elements of AI and automation. For example, in healthcare, AI-powered diagnostic tools are assisting medical professionals in interpreting medical images and analyzing patient data. In finance, AI algorithms are being used to automate trading decisions and detect fraudulent activity.

According to research that was conducted by McKinsey, as a result of artificial intelligence, approximately 12 million people will have to change their job market by 2030, which is comparable to the employment shifts that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings were disclosed by Kweilin Ellingrud, a senior partner at McKinsey and the head of its Global Institute, during its meeting with the media.There are assumptions that some industries, such as health care and STEM subjects, may increase their share due to AI sector development. Yet, the bulk of employment changes are expected to fall into four primary areas: administrative support, customer service and sales, food service, and production and manufacturing..Ellingrud pointed out that numerous positions in these areas are repetitive, involve gathering data, and require simple data analysis. These tasks are ideal for automation, a capability that AI excels at. A McKinsey study, co-written by Ellingrud, suggests that around 11.8 million employees in jobs facing a decline in demand will have to switch to new occupations by 2030.Despite these significant shifts, the report, as reported by Business Insider, emphasizes that every employee should get ready for some form of adjustment. The broad implementation of generative AI and conventional automation systems is expected to affect approximately 30% of duties in numerous existing roles. This implies that almost everyone will have to modify their work methods to fit the new technologies.&nbsp;.Ellingrud underscored the importance of employees taking the initiative to adapt to these shifts. ""It's essential for individuals to keep abreast of the changing employment environment and acquire skills that are less likely to be automated,"" she mentioned. This involves concentrating on sectors where analytical thinking, human ingenuity, and emotional understanding are qualities that machines cannot replicate.The study further shows that employment is poised to witness drastic change by 2030 through the influence of AI, such that millions will need to change their careers. Some professions, such as those in the fields of healthcare, and especially STEM, are expected to increase in demand, but countless mere clerical roles are expected to be replaced by robots in the near future. These changes are expected, and thus, for the affected employees to be in a better position to overcome these changes, then there is the need for business people, teachers, and government officials to make sure that they put in more effort and ensure that they offer all the necessary tools.","{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence/2030-job-market-mckinsey-reveals-ais-potential-sector-shifts', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/analyticsinsight/2024-06/4707b79b-9a2a-488a-a479-4af4275fb880/2030_Job_Market_McKinsey_Reveals_AI_s_Potential_Sector_Shifts.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 18 million people in the UK have now used Generative AI (GenAI), according to new findings from Deloitte’s 2024 Digital Consumer Trends research, based on a survey of 4,150 UK adults aged 16-75.
In the UK, three in five (60%) people are now aware of GenAI and over a third (36%) have used a GenAI tool, an increase of 26% (13 million people) from May 2023. However, notable gender and age gaps were apparent in the findings with 43% of men having used GenAI, compared to just 28% of women. The technology is also primarily used by younger groups, with 62% of people aged 16-34 having actively used it, compared to only 14% of 55-75 year olds.Related Company ProfilesDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu LtdView all
GenAI in the workplace
One in seven people (14%) have used GenAI for work, equating to around seven million people, increasing from four million a year ago. Of those using GenAI for work, three in four (74%) claim a productivity boost of either ‘a fair amount’ or ‘a great deal’. However, just 27% of those in work claim that their employer encourages the use of GenAI, suggesting that the majority work may be doing so without their employer’s official endorsement.
Among those who have used GenAI for work, the most popular reasons are generating ideas (44%) and looking up information (41%), followed by creating written content (39%), writing/editing emails (38%), and summarising text (37%).
Commenting on this, Deloitte partner and head of technology, media and telecommunications research, Paul Lee, said: “Employees are moving faster than their employers when it comes to adopting GenAI to transform how they work. While workers are signalling that GenAI can boost their output and save them time, many employees may not be supported, encouraged, or explicitly endorsed to use the technology by their organisation.

“While the most popular uses tend to be generating ideas and looking up information, these may not be optimal applications of GenAI, given known issues such as hallucination. Employers need to step up and invest in tools and governance to better support their staff in using this technology. Additionally, usage has to thrive among all types of employees, not just certain demographics, if the tools are to be most effective.”

Over 18 million people in the UK have now used Generative AI, according to new findings from Deloitte’s 2024 Digital Consumer Trends research, based on a survey of 4,150 UK adults aged 16-75.

</div>
In the UK, three in five (60%) people are now aware of GenAI and over a third (36%) have used a GenAI tool, an increase of 26% (13 million people) from May 2023. However, notable gender and age gaps were apparent in the findings with 43% of men having used GenAI, compared to just 28% of women. The technology is also primarily used by younger groups, with 62% of people aged 16-34 having actively used it, compared to only 14% of 55-75 year olds.
<h4>GenAI in the workplace</h4>
One in seven people (14%) have used GenAI for work, equating to around seven million people, increasing from four million a year ago. Of those using GenAI for work, three in four (74%) claim a productivity boost of either ‘a fair amount’ or ‘a great deal’. However, just 27% of those in work claim that their employer encourages the use of GenAI, suggesting that the majority work may be doing so without their employer’s official endorsement.

Among those who have used GenAI for work, the most popular reasons are generating ideas (44%) and looking up information (41%), followed by creating written content (39%), writing/editing emails (38%), and summarising text (37%).

Paul Lee, partner and head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Deloitte, commented: “Employees are moving faster than their employers when it comes to adopting GenAI to transform how they work. While workers are signalling that GenAI can boost their output and save them time, many employees may not be supported, encouraged, or explicitly endorsed to use the technology by their organisation.

“While the most popular uses tend to be generating ideas and looking up information, these may not be optimal applications of GenAI, given known issues such as hallucination. Employers need to step up and invest in tools and governance to better support their staff in using this technology. Additionally, usage has to thrive among all types of employees, not just certain demographics, if the tools are to be most effective.”
<h4>Improving AI fluency is vital for businesses</h4>
The survey also demonstrates that the frequency of use of GenAI is variable. Amongst those using the technology, one in three (36%) do so either daily or weekly, whereas two in five (41%) use it less than monthly. Of these low-frequency users, 23% did not find it helpful, 19% were not satisfied with its answers and 18% claimed they did not know how to use it well.

Meanwhile, many of those aware of GenAI are not familiar with its risks, including potential inaccuracies and biases. Among those aware of GenAI, 25% believe it is always factually accurate, and 26% think it is unbiased. Those who have used GenAI are even more likely to be unaware of risks, as 36% of users believe it is always accurate, and 36% think it is unbiased.

However, among those aware of GenAI, more than half (59%) would be less inclined to trust an email if they knew it was created with GenAI. Similarly, 56% would be less inclined to use a customer service if they knew they were conversing with a GenAI assistant.

Costi Perricos, partner and global Generative AI lead at Deloitte, said: “Whether organisations have supportive or strict policies on the use of Generative AI, it is clear that improving business AI fluency is vital. GenAI deployment should be accompanied by a thorough learning and development programme, including training on ethics and responsible use, and guidance on how to get the most value from GenAI tools. HR leaders have a key role to play, creating a clear framework in which their workforce can operate.”

Lee concluded: “In 2024, companies ought to be asking what they should do with GenAI, rather than focusing purely on everything it could do. The C-suite is increasingly looking for proof of return on investment in technologies before funding large scale deployment across their workforce. However, there are barriers to this, as quantifying employee productivity can be difficult, particularly in knowledge-based roles.

“Businesses are also exploring customer facing GenAI tools but should be aware that they may face some initial hesitance as fluency improves. Customers may be more welcoming of GenAI if they can be convinced that it enables a better, faster experience, with higher quality answers. Business leaders must fund and drive this education.”

At Think 2024, some the latest breakthroughs were on display.Consider the telephone. At one time, to call someone, you had to talk to an operator to place your call; then the rotary phone connected you directly. Eventually push-button phones automated the dialing, and now, we can even ask a virtual assistant to call someone without even looking at the phone.Throughout history, humans have created machines to find simpler, faster, and safer ways to do things. As computers have become more powerful over the decades, we’ve been able to use them to automate increasingly complex tasks. It’s led to the birth of entire new fields marrying automation and business needs. But with the advent of generative AI, we're on the cusp of another revolution that has the potential to radically alter the way we work.We’ve already started to see the promise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), and IBM has been working on a myriad of methods, models, and projects to automate every aspect of business, from front-office processes (like customer service and sales engagement), to back-office process (such as HR or procurement) and physical infrastructure, like manufacturing plants. Each of these areas can be improved by a range of generative AI language and code technologies, spanning a breadth of technical domains. This includes breakthroughs in content extraction, code generation, retrieval-augmented generation (or RAG), summarization, multi-turn conversational AI, APIs, planning, and more. These features are all powered by IBM’s Granite language and code models, which were unveiled in detail at this year’s Think conference.Teams across IBM are using these emerging tools to build systems that save businesses time, money, and heaps of stress.Reimagining how the world codesDiagnosing and addressing IT issues as they happenThe future of manufacturing Automating away time-consuming work Reimagining how the world codesToday, developers are only as good as the time they have — and the information at their fingertips. They spend countless hours hunting around the web for bug fix solutions, or snippets of code that solve the problem they’re working on.This month, IBM also open-sourced its state-of-the-art Granite code models. Available to anyone, they stand up to any comparable model for tasks like fixing code, explanations, or translating code between languages. For the team at IBM Research, these models are a step towards ensuring that anyone’s legacy systems can be supported, as well as tomorrow’s — after all, today’s modern applications will be legacy software in the future.At Think this year, IBM announced watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications. This new assistant can summarize existing Java code, make recommendations and execute code upgrades, detail code changes, and even generate unit tests. IBM automated test generator framework increases testing coverage by up to about 50%, spanning a range of benchmarks (including code class, method, branch, and line coverage) for IBM Granite and other models. The generated tests are in comprehensible natural language and are easy for developers to maintain.Most of the modern web is built on languages like Java and Python, incompatible with languages like COBOL, which most developers no longer learn. Web apps on the cloud are more flexible and scalable, but traditional structures like mainframes help companies keep data secure on their premises. While many automated systems that allow mainframes to work with cloud services exist, setting them up and maintaining them can be arduous.This is why IBM released new capabilities for watsonx Code Assistant for Z at Think. These include new abilities to explain COBOL code and translate it into Java on clients’ premises with code that is 95% parseable by z/OS COBOL benchmark test. Similarly, new capabilities were released for watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed entailing interactive playbook generation and explanation, achieving a 20% quality improvement in generated playbooks. Citibank is using watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed and Broadridge Solutions is using watsonx Code Assistant for Z.Diagnosing and addressing IT issues as they happenIt’s not just code that’s being automated — it’s the way the entire web runs. As the cloud has matured into the always-on, infinitely capable computing system that underpins the way the world runs, it has required legions of IT professionals to ensure that sites and servers are as reliable as possible.Site reliability engineers (or SREs) are the people responsible for the health of those systems. They are often overwhelmed as they try to manage the issues with massively complex systems that companies expect to be working at least 99.9999% of the time. Everything from servers to end-user computers, and cloud networking infrastructure — it’s a Herculean task to keep it all running, let alone figure out when small discrepancies are about to turn into major problems. To even log all the information on the health of every part of a system creates a deluge of information that’s nearly impossible for anyone to sift through. Part of the focus of IBM Research’s work in IT operations (or ITOps, as it’s often called) has been creating tools to automate the collection and analyzing of IT health data for engineers to be able to find problems and work on ways to fix them. Whether that’s a cluster of users experiencing latency issues, or a server with less-than-ideal uptime, the engineer needs as much information on the situation as possible before offering a diagnosis.IBM is also bringing AI and generative updates to its IT automation portfolio, including intelligent remediation for Instana, GPU optimization for Turbonomic, and cloud cost management tools (often called FinOps) for Turbonomic and Apptio. The Instana updates include generative AI technologies that can summarize IT issues, figure out a probable cause, and recommend actions to take — along with the actual code changes to implement.The trace-based reinforcement learning technique applied for probable cause analysis increases the true positive rate by a factor of 1.6 and reduces the false positive rate by a factor of 200 when compared to conventional application performance monitoring tools. Some of these technologies have been implemented in Red Hat’s support business and to date, have resulted in more than 2,500 deflected calls per year. IBM Research is also working with several companies to turn these concepts into working solutions for their systems. Beyond major incidents, there’s also the potential for AI systems to help monitor resource allocations using Turbonomic — IBM has started testing how GPUs are apportioned on its own systems, and for the cluster that works to train our own AI models, the amount of spare GPU capacity at any given moment shot up by a factor of five. The future of manufacturing Beyond the world of IT, AI is upending how we build and supply everything. Humanity moved from the steam engine to the factory line, through to programmable machines, and now AI. With each revolution, production improved dramatically, as businesses were able to be more cost effective, scale more easily, and produce their goods more efficiently. AI has the potential to automate even more.The fundamental underpinning of plant operations (often referred to as Asset Ops) is how work orders are managed. It’s a key part of IBM’s Maximo Application Suite. At Think this year, IBM introduced automated work order intelligence for Maximo, underpinned by IBM’s Granite model. This includes the ability to predict work order failure codes, using models to generate synthetic data. IBM is also using this software on its own sites and expects to save some 10,000 hours of productivity each year. When it comes to managing plants, businesses today are limited by the information they have access to. But with generative AI, the amount of information that can be taken into consideration, and the sorts of insights that can be gleaned from it, is set to explode.IBM’s open source Granite time-series models are a major step in this direction. The tiny time mixer (TTM) model in particular, based on an encoder-decoder architecture, significantly outperforms other models for forecasting tasks, with a 3% to 40% accuracy improvement (as measured by mean square error) over other state of the art models — even though the models are considerably smaller than others (1 million parameters, compared to 2.4 million to 311 million). Additionally, TTM can enable better continuous monitoring of assets and processes for anomalies — with significantly fewer false positives. Models of this nature, in tandem with automated work order intelligence, will allow enterprises to take a bold step towards closed loop automation for physical systems. Automating away time-consuming work Saving time and making processes simpler isn’t just for industrial applications. The struggles of a modern office worker are often bound up in simple, but necessary, tasks that just waste a lot of time. Everyone has filled their time with things like filling out forms, copying information, moving files from one place to another — things that over time, build up to be a sizable chunk of one’s day. Over the years, tools that make common business processes easier through automation started to spring up. IBM’s own Orchestrate product came out of years of research into automated software and can now make tasks of varying complexity extremely easy — from repeatedly adding rows to tables, to things like generating an expense report or creating a job requisition. But even with all these capabilities, generative AI offers the potential to make these sorts of business process automations more flexible and catered to specific users incorporating pertinent technology in the automation build and conversational AI spaces.  At Think, IBM unveiled watsonx Orchestrate Assistant Builder, which helps businesses build assistants composed of underlying skills that fit the exact tasks they need completed, whether that’s in human resources, sales, procurement, or anywhere else. These skills and underpinning open API specifications can be quickly built, enhanced, and validated, transforming the build experience.Many of the automation examples above rely on predefined tasks and workflows, but IBM Research is also building generative interfaces for automation tasks that users want to create on the fly. They could write in plain English what they need done — rather than clicking away on pages looking for the specific tasks they’re after.These systems can invoke APIs, sequence multiple APIs, query databases with natural language, and summarize retrieved content, just using IBM’s Granite LLM. We expect technology like this to build on some of the early success already experienced with watsonx Orchestrate by the likes of Sports Clips who have witnessed several orders of magnitude reduction in time to execute HR tasks — from hours to minutes.This is where the industry is heading. The closer we can get to having simple conversations with the software and machines that we use to complete our work every day, the faster we can get more done.Subscribe to our Future Forward newsletter and stay up to date on the latest research newsSubscribe to our newsletterHome↳ BlogDate04 Jun 2024AuthorsMike MurphyTopicsAIGraniteShareWhat’s an LLM context window and why is it getting larger?NewsKim Martineau24 Jul 2024AIAI for CodeGenerative AIGraniteNatural Language ProcessingOpen SourceMeet AI-Hilbert, a new algorithm for transforming scientific discoveryNewsPeter Hess19 Jul 2024AIExploratory SciencePhysical SciencesWhat are LLM AI agents?ExplainerKim Martineau18 Jul 2024AIAI for Business AutomationFoundation ModelsGenerative AIIBM reaffirms its commitment to the Rome Call for AI ethicsNewsMike Murphy15 Jul 2024AIFairness, Accountability, Transparency",,,,,,,,,https://research.ibm.com/blog/automation-think-generative-ai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly two-thirds (61%) of CEOs are adopting generative AI more quickly than workers are comfortable with, a new IBM study suggests, with many pushing hard on maintaining a competitive edge. While CEOs acknowledge this discomfort, the study found a sizable amount (64%) said their organization must take advantage of technologies that are outpacing employee’s ability to adapt. By contrast, less than half (44%) of respondents reported that they had “assessed the impact” of generative AI on their workforce.With 62% claiming a willingness to take more risk to maintain a competitive edge, the report highlights a clear disconnect between the broader workforce and C-suite decision makers.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProCEOs are firing on all cylinders, IBM said, with 43% set to “increase the tempo” of organizational change and 62% accepting the need to rewrite their “business playbook” to succeed. Staff, by comparison, don’t have the same mindset.  “Part of the issue is that many people think they’re training their replacement. Despite the fact that business leaders consistently say this technology will support human employees — not replace them — employees remain skeptical,” the report stated. There is a lack of direction from a C-suite level, meaning CEO enthusiasm is not translating into clear rationales or objectives for individual staff members.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

CEOs must locate the paint points creating “employee pushback” on the adoption of AI tools to deliver improvements and create an aligned strategy.Similarly, CEOs should focus on the tools that will make staff workloads easier and more rewarding, paying close attention to processes that are “slow, inefficient, or create unnecessary work for employees”.There should also be a shift towards investment that will “inspire change,” IBM said, with the priority needing to be put on incentivizing adoption through rewards for those who alter their roles to use the technology. Training is important, particularly that which teaches employees how best to use generative AI “to their advantage”, and CEOs need to ensure that “governance, technology, and talent are prepared” to optimize the value of generative AI.

A report prepared for the U.S. government warned that about 10% of U.S. workers could lose their jobs due to the introduction of AI tools. However, alongside these fears, new opportunities are also emerging—innovative professions and roles that adopt AI tools in fields such as marketing, cybersecurity, health, and even manufacturing. Organizations in Israel and around the world are already working to integrate advanced technologies into their products, work processes, and various activities. Companies are mobilizing personnel and preparing for the new era of artificial intelligence, where expert employees will be responsible for assimilating the technology into products, protecting against attacks, automating processes, and integrating creative AI tools into organizational procedures.   ""The only stable thing in the job market, especially the technological one, is that it changes all the time. Anyone who doesn't ask themselves how the AI ​​revolution affects their job and fields of activity, adopt new tools, and take part in reinventing their field of activity will find themselves without a job,"" says Avi Shanir, CEO of Elevation, which specializes in building internal and external skills academies to bridge employment gaps and promote occupational diversity. Over time, streamlining will continue, and jobs in entire areas will be dramatically reduced. As technology advances, some jobs will be fully performed by AI. Instead of fearing the revolution and wondering what will happen, Shanir recommends that everyone take small steps to start experimenting with different tools and strengthen the super skills we have, which AI will have a hard time reaching—creativity, critical thinking, curiosity, and thinking outside the box. Emerging professions in AI Avatar Data Engineer At D-ID, which develops avatars and interactive AI agents, a new position has been created due to the rise of animated avatars.

Sides are split on the benefits - or woes - for AI at work in the future. (Art by Midjourney for Fierce Network)


Ericsson looks at how AI will affect life in 2030 and beyondThe firm released a study that looks at how work could split between the empowered and powerlessThe study finds that 70% of the AI fearful think AI will shrink their wagesEricsson ConsumerLab has released a comprehensive high-level study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that takes in trends on everything from generative fashion to AI childcare and human digital twins.Readers of Fierce Network, however, will no doubt be most fascinated in how Ericsson’s AI respondents – both hopeful and fearful – view how AI will evolve in the workplace.For the overall study, Ericsson surveyed 6,510 urban early adopters of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), digital assistants and generative AI aged 15 to 69 in 13 major cities around the world to imagine a world in the 2030s where AI could affect many – most? – aspects of everyday life.Ericsson said that 51% of the total sample identify as “AI hopeful” and are happy to use early AI digital assistants and more. However, 34% of the sample identify as “AI fearful” even among early adopters – and these respondents are fearful of AI-based respondents. A fun future?Notably, 70% of AI fearful respondents predict a future where increased AI productivity leads to shrinking human salaries. Of these believers, 72% also foresee this development as a threat to their personal financial well-being, painting a bleak picture: the human worker as an AI drone, reaping scant financial reward for their obedience.“I'm not sure. I'm very concerned about it in terms of my field of work since I'm in the visual arts,” a respondent from San Francisco told the survey. Lawyers, accountants and, yes, even journalists feel you, SF respondent!A strapping 84% of AI hopefuls, however, envision AI assistants becoming commonplace, bolstering work performance and efficiency. Indeed, 81% of those who believe in this AI-powered future also anticipate a positive impact on their own careers. (Those happy AI people are probably in the marketing department, right?)“Yet, the AI hopeful and AI fearful groups do not necessarily present a divided vision of the future. Instead, they hint at the emergence of two types of employees: the empowered and the powerless,” Ericsson said in the report.Embracing workplace recommendations from future AI assistants might give you a competitive edge in your AI-assisted career, Ericsson noted. At the same time, AI could chip away at your paycheck and remove much of your autonomy, the vendor suggests.“Striking a balance will be crucial to preserving a humane work life,” Ericsson concluded.

<p>Accountancy and finance professionals can augment 60% to 100% of critical work functions with artificial intelligence in assurance, financial accounting, and management accounting, according to a whitepaper released by the <strong><a href=""https://www.isca.org.sg/"">Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants</a></strong> (ISCA).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA views AI as a positive disruptor to enhance and complement the work of accountancy and finance professionals, instead of replacing them, with 72% of employers surveyed agreeing that AI will be a game changer for their business and 82% of employees asked expect <strong><a href=""https://futurecfo.net/finance-and-genai-managing-risks-and-adding-value/"">Generative AI</a></strong> (Gen AI) to enhance their job performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Singapore's national accountancy body adopts a human-centred AI (HCAI) perspective and recognises that AI can bring forth positive disruption, with the approach taking into consideration the design, use, and intention of the AI tool for the human user. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially, this means viewing AI as an instrument to augment and complement the work of accountancy and finance professionals, instead of replacing them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, despite the positive sentiments and willingness to <strong><a href=""https://futurecfo.net/moving-the-needle-transformation-in-finance/"">take on new AI innovations</a></strong>, an AI readiness survey suggests that the accountancy industry still lacked key resources, in areas like infrastructure and data readiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Critical work functions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whitepaper also reviewed the potential of AI augmentation on <strong><a href=""https://futurecfo.net/tackling-challenges-in-2024-head-on/"">critical work functions</a></strong> in accountancy career tracks, deep-diving into three career tracks: Assurance, Financial Accounting and Management Accounting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are strong indications of AI’s transformative impact on the accountancy industry,"" says <strong><a href=""https://isca.org.sg/about-us/about-the-institute-of-singapore-chartered-accountants/the-council"">Teo Ser Luck</a></strong>, president at ISCA. ""With AI, organisations can achieve more with less and reap productivity benefits. The notion of ‘super-accountants’ leveraging AI to cover more areas in multiple fields with fewer resources is also exciting.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""For instance, we may see entrepreneurial ‘super-accountants’ run leaner audit firms with more efficient employees, and still capable of providing a full suite of services through automation and AI augmentation.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">No job losses</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA's review reveales that the AI integration within finance does not necessarily result in job losses. Instead, the accountancy profession will likely continue to see more opportunities for professional development in terms of upskilling and reskilling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There would also be positive transformative changes through revamped work processes and productivity gains as AI proliferates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, with financial analyses and forecasts more easily performed with AI augmentation, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)’s role may no longer be concentrated on financial numbers alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The role will change with CFOs increasingly focused on more strategic job functions, such as leading in business development, risk<br>management, ESG and sustainability, and governance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among other attributes, a sharp business acumen, the ability to think critically and creatively, and digital savviness would be the defining features of the future CFO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">ISCA's AI initiative</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA’s AI for AI initiative will focus on five areas – jobs and skills, AI ethics, AI governance, AI adoption, and sustainability. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among other initiatives that ISCA has embarked on, to foster AI adoption, ISCA conducted an AI experiential day earlier this month for small and medium-sized practices to learn about AI-powered accounting solutions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ISCA will also launch a policy recommendation paper to advocate the development of a human-centred AI ecosystem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The accountancy body is developing a framework as well for responsible use of AI in the accountancy industry to address ethical concerns.</p>

WotC Under Fire For Generative AI Once Again – This Time It’s Video Games

Wizards of the Coast has come under fire from its community for generative AI use once again. This time, it’s related to video games.

Generative AI remains a hotbed issue for the tabletop and video game community. By and large, people want stories and games made by actual humans. Not “AI” trained up on Reddit posts and copypastas to spit out generic, biteless works. Corporations, on the other hand, want to save money by not paying those pesky humans to do the creative work that brings in all that dough.
It’s a match made in hell. And we’re all living through it. Generative AI in video games and tabletop RPGs both spark the same sentiment. WotC, being invested heavily in both arenas, has come under fire once again for the potential use of Generative AI. This time, for video games.
This is relevant because despite hiring for a position that would use Generative AI in the creation of assets for video games, WotC insists its stance on AI art and relying on the work of humans hasn’t changed.

Wizards of the Coast Seem Determined to Use AI After All

Here’s why we keep having this conversation. In August last year, AI imagery found in Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants, caused massive backlash among the community. So much so that Wizards of the Coast put out a statement saying that it would never use generative AI to create its art or writing.
Then again, at the beginning of this year, the Magic: the Gathering Twitter account used AI art in its promo materials for an upcoming set, which again was caught by the community and again sparked a backlash and a new round of controversy.

Then again, at the beginning of the month, not long after VentureBeat interviewed Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, in which Cocks revealed he was “excited about AI,” WotC issued another statement saying they weren’t using AI and were committed to producing work by humans for humans.


Now Hiring AI Engineer

Naturally, we’re back once more. This time, with Wizards of the Coast coming under fire for a new job posting. Now, video games and AI have a more nuanced relationship. After all, your enemies need AI. It’s a problem that comes from the terminology. We call generative AI art even though it’s neither an artificial intelligence nor art.
A new job posting is looking to hire a Principal AI Engineer, which would be fine, except for a few key things:

The big sticking points are the AI engineer building and deploying “systems for intelligent generation of text dialog, audio, and art assets…” as well as using AI for “content creation and audio generation.” In other words, using generative AI instead of paying voice actors or writers.

That and WotC’s response to the community outcry in the first place, which seems to be, “This doesn’t count because it’s for video games.” As WotC told Comicbook.com:

Our stance on AI hasn’t changed. This job description is for a role for future video game projects. You can reference our AI FAQ here.

This may be WotC’s attempt to have its cake and eat it, too. But whatever the case, WotC still seems committed to not using AI in D&D and Magic, at least in the main versions of those products. Anything else is anyone’s guess right now.
With generative AI becoming more prevalent, there are murky waters ahead for us all.

<p>""Generative AI has fast-tracked the data and AI-led reinvention journey for businesses. Yet, to fully harness its full potential, leaders need to see it as more than just a tool for redesigning processes and driving cost efficiencies.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>GenAI impact</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A staggering 96% of APAC business leaders acknowledge the significant impact of generative AI, and 91% of APAC workers express their eagerness to acquire new skills to work with generative AI. However, only 4% of business leaders have implemented generative AI training at scale.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, 89% of APAC businesses plan to increase their <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/uipath-unveils-ai-features-in-traditional-chinese-new-family-of-llms/"">generative AI</a></strong> technology spending this year, but only 35% prioritise investments in their workforce's development.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Leveraging genAI potential</strong></h3>

<p>Accenture recommends that business leaders immerse themselves in&nbsp;the technology and rethink workflows to gain a better perspective on maximising Gen AI for better customer service, <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/podchats-for-futurecio-managing-ai-deployment-with-confidence/"">employee experience</a></strong>, and business objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Organisations must also prioritise continuous <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/unparalleled-rate-of-change-expected-in-2024-study-finds/"">talent reinvention</a></strong> and maximise tools and technologies to help facilitate smoother transitions between work and roles.

There’s practically a new study examining artificial intelligence’s impact on the workplace every week. Microsoft and LinkedIn released their annual Work Trend Index last month, concluding workers are embracing AI while employers remain largely paralyzed by indecision. Now, Asana and Anthropic have teamed up on this year’s State of AI at Work study.
The findings
More than 5,000 U.S. and U.K. knowledge workers and consulted AI experts were polled in March 2024 in order to get a comprehensive assessment of AI adoption in the workplace. The results are tailored to decision-making executives looking to improve their AI strategies and discover how to use the technology to boost their company’s productivity and collaboration. Asana outlines three key findings:

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise




The percentage of knowledge workers using AI weekly has increased by 44 percent over the past nine months to 52 percent
Despite impressive adoption growth, only 7 percent of employees report their companies have mature AI implementations, characterized by successful integration of multiple AI tools into work processes and regular evaluation of their impact
82 percent of workers say their organizations have yet to provide training on the use of generative AI

These statistics may not necessarily be surprising, as other studies have concluded similar findings. But these are likely to set the mood for the thing that really separates this State of AI at Work from all the rest. 
“What sets this study apart from others is its focus on organizational AI maturity and the actionable insights it provides for organizations to advance their AI implementation,” Dr. Rebecca Hinds, Asana’s head of its Work Innovation Lab, explains to VentureBeat in an email. “The report is the first to classify organizations according to a five-stage AI maturity model, from immature (Stage 1) to mature (Stage 5) implementations. The study also outlines the steps organizations need to take to achieve mature AI implementations, known as the ‘5Cs’: Comprehension, Concerns, Collaboration, Context, and Calibration.”
“For instance, in the context of the Collaboration ‘C’ (how humans collaborate with AI), we find that employees at mature AI organizations are 1.5 times more likely to view AI as a teammate. This shift in perspective leads to increased AI usage, enthusiasm, and productivity gains. Regarding the Context ‘C,’ organizations with mature AI implementations are more likely to have AI policies and guidelines in place, providing a clear context for AI usage. Related to the Calibration ‘C,’ while only 17 percent of employees at Stage 1 companies report that their organizations collect feedback on AI usage, this jumps to 91 percent at Stage 5 companies, highlighting the importance of calibration in mature AI implementations,” she goes on to state.

We are far from seeing most organizations fully versed in and comfortable with AI as part of their company strategy. However, Asana and Anthropic have outlined five stages of AI maturity; a guide executives can use to gauge where their company stands in implementing real transformative outcomes. Many respondents say they’re in either the first or second stage. Only seven percent claim they’ve achieved the highest stage. Unfortunately, the report doesn’t list which companies fall into which stage. But what are the characteristics of each stage of maturity?
Five-stage journey to AI maturity

Stage 1: AI Skepticism
Organizations recognize AI’s potential and start exploring its applications. It’s about opening up to AI’s possibilities.
Stage 2: AI Activationadvertisement
Companies will launch pilot projects to test the waters and gain hands-on experience with AI. Small-scale experiments will be conducted to understand the technologies’ impact and value.
Stage 3: AI Experimentation
Larger AI initiatives will be launched, and executives will start addressing the challenges of integrating the technology system-wide.
Stage 4: AI Scaling
AI is a part of an organization’s operations, reshaping workflows and decision-making processes. It’s part of the company’s DNA and operational strategy.
Stage 5: AI Maturity
Organizations are able to skillfully leverage AI to drive transformative results. Executives have found a way to strategically align the technology with their organizational goals.
What’s the secret to having a company in this final stage? Asana and Anthropic conclude that boosting comprehension is important, offering resources, training programs and support structures for knowledge workers to improve their education. Companies must also prioritize AI safety and reliability, meaning that AI vendors should be selected with “complete, integrated data models and invest in high-quality data pipelines and robust governance practices.” AI responses must be interpretable to facilitate decision-making and should always be controlled and directed by human operators.
Other elements of organizations in Stage 5 include embracing a human-centered approach, developing strong comprehensive policies and principles to navigate AI adoption responsibly, and being able to measure AI’s impact and value (e.g., are there clear metrics tied to business objectives? Can usage be tracked? Have baselines been established to accurately measure AI’s impact?)
Advancement through the five ‘Cs’
In order to progress through from AI Skepticism to AI Maturity, Asana and Anthropic have outlined five factors that must be met before an organization can evolve.
AI Comprehension
How well do employees understand how to use AI? The study reveals that only 20 percent of workers use gen AI weekly for companies in the first stage. However, businesses in the fifth stage see such usage skyrocket to 93 percent. 
AI Concerns
Do executives know what concerns are top-of-mind for workers? As companies mature, are they in tune with what’s going on with AI? At Stage 1, workers are primarily concerned about their limited understanding of how gen AI works. That changes in Stages 2 and 3 with workers being concerned about how others perceive how they use AI: Is it authentic? Are they taking shortcuts? In the final two stages, workers become interested in the ethical implications of using AI.
AI Collaboration
How do employees collaborate with AI? Do they even want to? In what way do workers view artificial intelligence in the workforce? Some might see it as a tool, while others view it as a teammate that actively contributes to work processes, decision-making and problem-solving. It could also be perceived more as a consultant, offering expert advice and specialized assistance when it comes to complex issues. In the first stage, most workers say AI is a tool, but for those in Stage 5, it becomes a teammate.
AI Context
Do organizations have AI policies, guidelines and principles in place? Stage 1 companies do not have clear policies governing AI usage, which could create potential inconsistencies in how the technology is applied and hinder innovation. However, by Stage 5, there’s a greater adoption of shared organizational AI principles, detailing ethical usage, transparency, fairness, accountability and privacy as it relates to AI deployment.
AI Calibration
The final “C” gauges how AI effectiveness and value are measured within the organization. In the first stage, 20 percent of workers report productivity gains through AI, though that figure increases significantly to 87 percent for companies in the fifth stage. The study suggests organizations engage their workforce in the evaluation process to calibrate AI effectively.

When asked why Asana and Anthropic teamed up for this study, Dr. Hinds shares that both companies are mission-driven, aiming “to help humanity through the development of advanced and trusted technology. Anthropic focuses on building safe and ethical AI systems, while Asana is dedicated to helping teams collaborate more effectively and efficiently.” However, this isn’t the first collaboration between the two, as both R&D teams have worked together on new product experiences for nearly a year.

The programs offer a window into what some firms believe artificial intelligence will mean for those now entering the profession. Future junior lawyers won’t be replaced by AI, as some fear, but they will need to harness it to be successful, said Brendan McDonnell, a K&L Gates partner and member of the firm’s AI solutions group. That includes understanding how to effectively interact with generative AI chatbots to unearth the most useful information for clients, he said. “That’s the whole idea about the training program: You need to teach people how this is going to impact the way they come to work,” said McDonnell. While AI will automate many tasks, he said, it’s also going to open up new lines of legal practice while freeing up new professionals’ time to learn and master the complex work they went to law school for. Most firms are still in an experimentation phase when it comes to deploying generative AI chatbot and research tools. Firms’ use of the tech is also dependent on clients’ openness to it. “We’re in a transition period,” said Alex Su, the chief revenue officer at Latitude Legal, a global flexible legal staffing firm. “It’s hard to say there’s going to be a huge impact in how law firms staff in the near-term.” Still, legal experts caution that future lawyers need to address the technology. “It used to be that a lawyer was sufficiently tech savvy if she knew her way around Word and Westlaw,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, the co-director of the Deborah L. Rhode Center on the Legal Profession at Stanford Law School. “Those days are over. In order to offer top-tier legal services in the 21st century, lawyers need facility with a suite of sophisticated tech-based tools.” There’s an apparent marketing component as well for the firms. Summer associate programs—roughly the equivalent of a paid summer internship that typically leads to a full-time job offer—have long been part of an effort for law firms to promote their brand to law students while fostering a recruiting pipeline. A generative AI training “sends a great marketing signal” about the firm’s commitment to a new technology, said Su. The “devil’s in the details” for this type of training, especially when it involves those entering the profession, said Michele DeStefano, a professor at the University of Miami Law.“The biggest issue is even if they know how to use AI, if they don’t have the substantive law background, you can’t discern whether you got a good answer,” she said. Prompt EngineeringK&L Gates and Orrick each partner with tech learning platform AltaClaro for firmwide trainings on subjects such as “prompt engineering,” regarded as the science of interacting with generative AI models and how the technology works. AltaClaro is working with 15 AmLaw200 firms on generative AI trainings, said CEO Abdi Shayesteh, though Orrick is the only one that has incorporated those programs in its summer associate training, beginning last year. Orrick said the first week of this year’s program included a training on prompt engineering, in addition to a day dedicated to seminars and ideas sessions around generative AI. “It’s going to be incredibly important for new lawyers to understand what technologies are available and how to use them,” said Kathleen Orr, Orrick’s head of practice innovation. She noted AI tools in use by Orrick include DraftWise, a drafting and negotiation assistant, Kira, an AI contract analyzer, and WestLaw’s Precision, an AI-assisted research tool. K&L Gates’ summer associate class will go through firm-led generative AI trainings and be introduced to CaseText’s Co-Counsel, a legal AI assistant the firm is already using for areas such as case research and summarizing depositions, said McDonnell. The firm will later match each associate with a lawyer identified internally as a generative AI “power user” to use the technology in their day-to-day work. “We hope that’s kind of going to give them a good mix of theory and practice,” said Carolyn Austin, K&L Gates’ director of practice innovation.Dechert, for its part, is doing something similar. The firm will focus on one-on-one training between a summer associates and attorneys who are using AI tools in their work, said Thor Alden, Dechert’s associate director of innovation.Alden noted the program highlights how legal training is “fundamentally” changing. But he said the tools aren’t replacing the firm’s assessment of legal skills. “When you’re thinking of a summer associate, one of your main goals is to assess whether the firm wants to hire you, and that should ultimately be driven by legal capabilities,” he said.Protecting the BrandFor both experienced and young lawyers, the biggest warning sign that comes with the new territory is the documented accuracy problems, or hallucinations, of AI models. An infamous example is two New York lawyers getting fined $5,000 last year after submitting a brief citing six nonexistent cases that one of the lawyers admitted were supplied by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.“A big challenge for all law firms will be trying to make sure that they can continue to think like lawyers,” said McDonnell. “I mean, you can ruin the brand of a law firm if we don’t actually make sure that the output is vetted.”Notwithstanding those risks, many law firms, traditionally slow movers when it comes to new technology, have embraced generative AI. Dechert launched its own internal chatbot, DechertMind, in April 2023. Wilson Sonsini has also created its own internal AI tool. Firms such as A&O Shearman and Paul Weiss are customers of the generative AI legal startup Harvey, which has received more than $100 million in funding to date. “For the first time the legal industry is moving at a better pace and looking at how to adopt this technology,” said AltaClaro’s Shayesteh. “It’s because they see the competitive advantage from those who adopt this the right way.”Bloomberg Law sells legal research tools and software, including some that make use of generative AI.

				Generative AI Is Creating a Copyright Crisis for Artists			
How does an artist assert copyright when her image was only one of many used to create a new image? How does she make a living if she can’t?

A recent article in Issues in Science and Technology asks us to consider what happens when the AI systems scarf up images from across the internet:


Stable Diffusion alone has harvested 5 billion images and text captions. The Common Pool offers 12.8 billion.
Kate Crawford, a researcher of AI’s impact based at USC Annenberg and New York University professor of clinical law Jason Schultz spell out what that means for artists who hope to make a living from their work:

Their work is being used to train AI systems, which can then create images and texts that replicate their artistic style…
The billions of works produced by generative AI are unowned and can be used anywhere, by anyone, for any purpose. Whether a ChatGPT novella or a Stable Diffusion artwork, output now exists as unclaimable content in the commercial workings of copyright itself. This is a radical moment in creative production: a stream of works without any legally recognizable author. 
Kate Crawford, Jason Schultz, “Generative AI Is a Crisis for Copyright Law,” Issues in Science and Technology, January 16, 2024
Essentially, the system is outdated
The problem, Crawford and Schultz say, is that copyright law, as currently framed, does not really protect individuals under these circumstances. That’s not surprising. Copyright dates back to at least 1710 and the issues were very different then.
For one thing, as Jonathan Bartlett pointed out last December, when the New York Times launched a lawsuit for copyright violation against Microsoft and OpenAI, everyone accepted that big search engines have always violated copyright. But if they brought people to your site, while saving and using your content for themselves, you were getting something out of it at least.
But it’s different with generative AI and the chatbot. They use and replace your content. Users are not going back to you for more. OpenAI freely admits that it violates copyright but relies on loopholes to get around legal responsibility.
As the lawsuits pile up, it’s clear that gen AI and chatbots can’t work without these billions of images and texts. So we either do without them or we find a way to compensate the producers.
But if users pay, remember that the end user is you


Robert J. Marks points out that systems for paying original artists exist now. “Today’s Spotify keeps automatic records of song frequency and, from subscriber’s payments, distributes royalties accordingly. Similar methods could be applied to compensate content creators by generative AI.” (Newsmax January 18, 2024) But they would require record keeping on the part of the currently secretive AI system owners.
They would require something else too, Marks notes: End users will end up paying somehow to use the glitzy new AI services. It makes sense. The reason chatbots are free and Disney movies are not is partly because of all the people who aren’t getting paid by the AI vendors — as opposed to the people who are getting paid by Disney.
The deepest issue is that humans are creative and AI is not
When only humans were original producers, copyright law generally provided sufficient protection. AI systems get around that by mixing, melding, and collating at enormous volumes which can often stand in for original creation — for a time. But AI needs constant rejuvenation from original creators; otherwise we can routinely expect the jackrabbit problem (model collapse — a descent into rubbish due to regurgitating the same contents). But people won’t produce that content for them if they are not paid.
Overall, the issue probably won’t be resolved by the application of current law; we will need to move toward a system that recognizes the new technology as a factor and works out a scheme for compensating the producers of the material it uses.

Outright copying of others’ images may put system’s owners in legal jeopardy, Let’s look at U.S. legal decisions. The AI companies offering the image-creating services need Robot from Lost in Space in their legal departments waving its arms, crying out: “Warning! Danger!”
and
Model collapse: AI chatbots are eating their own tails. The problem is fundamental to how they operate. Without new human input, their output starts to decay. Meanwhile, organizations that laid off writers and editors to save money are finding that they can’t just program creativity or common sense into machines.

BEYOND THE SPIDER-VERSE Will Not Contain Any Generative AI


by Kyle Anderson
Jun 4 2024 • 1:52 PM







The argument over the use of generative AI, in which a program aggregates from sources across the globe to create something like text, videos, images, etc., is hot these days. Should production companies use it to cut some corners? Is the product actually inferior? (Yes, it is.) And why do CEOs seem intent on using it, no matter what? Well the final question has been a big one, and producer Chris Miller has responded. Beyond the Spider-Verse will not employ any generative AI.
Sony Animation 
 IndieWireOpens in a new tab reported on May 30 that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra told investors that the studio was “looking at ways to produce both films for theaters and television in a more efficient way, using AI primarily.” Obviously, this made people scared, especially for movies like the third Spider-Verse. Those movies, which have gorgeous visuals, are difficult to make. Would this mean Sony would push to use generative AI for “efficiency” sake? Chris Miller had something to say about this, which  we first saw on GamespotOpens in a new tab.
Miller  responded on TwitterOpens in a new tab: “There is no generative AI in Beyond the Spider-Verse and there never will be. One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.”  
Sony Animation
It’s worth noting that the Spider-Verse movies have used AI programs, but not generative AI. They instead incorporated ethical and smart-use machine learning to eliminate repetitive tasks and help the artists better adhere to 3D geometry.
 Per the effects supervisor Pav GrocholaOpens in a new tab, “We determined that in order to speed up artists’ productivity over the course of the project, we would utilize machine learning to help our animators get an initial predicted result that would give them a reasonable first pass of creating ink lines on the characters.”

We’re not going to see an end to the AI debate in film and TV for some time. As a tool, machine learning can help artists achieve the desired result more quickly. But generative AI undermines the work of hundreds of real humans, not to mention all the people whose work the machine samples. And so far at least, people can tell the difference.

Here's How Generative AI is Revolutionizing Marketing Creativity and Efficiency

Artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, is reshaping the marketing landscape nowadays. It is offering new ways for professionals to enhance creativity, streamline research, and optimize analytics. AI tools are becoming integral in the marketing field, helping marketers to generate content quicker, increase efficiency and build more creative campaigns. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have become essential in many marketers toolkits. For instance, a 2024 survey highlighted that 68% of B2B marketing leaders use generative AI to produce more content efficiently. Meanwhile, 55% leverage these tools to focus on high-value tasks, and 51% use AI to create content that is both optimized and engaging. Additionally, the popularity of AI is evident in the upskilling of marketing professionals. LinkedIn's 2024 Global Marketing Jobs Outlook report shows an increased focus on AI skills. The top LinkedIn Learning courses for marketers now include topics such as ""What is Generative AI?"", ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"", and ""Ethics in the Age of Generative AI"". These courses are part of a broader trend where twice as many marketing leaders have added AI skills to their profiles in the last quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Furthermore, the demand for AI literacy is growing in the workplace. According to Microsoft and LinkedIn's 2024 Work Trend Index, 71% of leaders would prefer to hire a candidate with AI skills over one with more experience but without such skills. A significant 66% of leaders stated they would not hire someone lacking AI literacy. The impact of AI on marketing extends to job opportunities and the competitive landscape. Over half of the marketers plan to use AI to gain a competitive advantage. The integration of AI into marketing not only facilitates a more efficient workflow but also fosters a creative and competitive industry. This shift suggests that we are moving towards a work environment that allows for more human interaction. This enables marketers to perform more fulfilling work and collaborate efficiently.

‘Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse’ Writer-Producer Chris Miller Shuts Down Rumors of Generative AI Use
While machine learning was used in “Across the Spider-Verse” to assist animators, he promises his team will never “steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work”

Chris Miller, cowriter and producer of the animated Spider-Man “Spider-Verse” trilogy, shut down rumors that his team used generative artificial intelligence as part of the production of the next installment of the series, “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.” 
“There is no generative AI in ‘Beyond the Spider-Verse’ and there never will be. One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work,” Miller posted on social media in a shot at what’s commonly being referred to as “AI.” 
The social media rumors surrounding GAI come as backlash against the nascent technology has risen among both Hollywood workers and in pop culture. That’s become particularly true following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year, where writers and actors spoke out against algorithms potentially replacing their artistry.  



But generative AI, which creates words and images with minimal human input based on human-created works used to train software, is only one form of the technology. Other machine-learning tools have been adapted by Hollywood animation productions as a method to assist animators, not render them obsolete. 
Such machine-learning technology has been used in 2018’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and its 2023 sequel, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which sought to replicate the hand-drawn style of comic books in a CGI animated film while exploring new ways to express that style through color and design. This included replicating ink lines on characters, which is a key part of comic book line art.

But having to add those ink lines to every single frame of the movie and adjusting them to fit characters as they moved would have been excruciatingly slow and tedious for animators to do on their own, so Sony Pictures Imageworks developed a machine-learning program that would adjust the ink lines from frame to frame and move with the characters. This allowed the animators to focus on the expressions, movements and other key aspects of the lead Spider-Man Miles Morales and other “Spider-Verse” characters without having to spend hours fine-tuning those details.  



This machine-learning technology, designed to free animators from a menial task that would have added weeks if not months of work to the animation process, isn’t the same as generative AI. It’s still based around the work done by animators on the project it’s being used for, with their supervision. That’s as opposed to generative AI, which can pull images, video and words from media outside of the project being worked on and create something without substantial direct human input.  
The future of machine learning, GAI and other new forms of technology is expected to be a major part of contract negotiations between Hollywood studios and The Animation Guild, which has recently established a task force to hear input from its members about how artificial intelligence is used on projects they have worked on or been pitched.
This will help the union craft its proposals on how to regulate AI use in Hollywood animation. The Animation Guild’s negotiating committee is still in the process of creating a formal pattern of demands and is expected to begin contract negotiations sometime in August. 
“Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” is currently in production, but does not have a release date set. It was previously scheduled for release in March 2024, but was taken off of Sony’s schedule last year during the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes.

Glean Launches Glean Apps and Glean APIs, Empowering Businesses to Build Custom Generative AI Apps and Agents Securely at Scale




More than 100 companies created 1,000+ AI agents during the preview of Glean Apps, now Generally Available 






June 05, 2024 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Glean, the enterprise AI assistant platform, today announced the widespread availability of Glean Apps and Glean APIs on the Glean Platform. These new capabilities give both everyday users and developers the power to create custom AI assistants, copilots, chatbots, and agents to automate everyday work and deliver proactive insights with AI. The Glean Platform continues to expand as the open, horizontal choice for building enterprise AI, now adding support for industry-leading LLMs Anthropic Claude and Google Gemini. These LLMs work seamlessly with the enterprise data inside more than 100 SaaS tools that are securely integrated with the Glean Platform, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Figma, GitHub, Jira, ServiceNow, and more.


“With Glean Apps and Glean APIs, we’ve been able to securely build and deploy generative AI applications that would have taken months and significant resources for us to develop on our own”Post this

Glean was founded in 2019 as an AI-powered enterprise search solution connected to all of a company’s internal data, and has evolved into a leading enterprise AI assistant platform. Glean’s state-of-the-art search and RAG technology retrieves the most relevant, up-to-date information for LLMs to generate highly personalized answers grounded in each company’s unique enterprise knowledge graph. Built for enterprises from the start, Glean provides the comprehensive security, privacy, permissions, and governance enterprises require to deploy AI globally across their workforces.


“Since launching our conversational AI assistant last year, we’ve helped hundreds of companies bring trustworthy generative AI into their organizations and supercharge productivity,” said Arvind Jain, co-founder and CEO of Glean. “Today the Glean Platform takes the next step in enabling users and developers to create customized generative AI experiences in their organizations. During our preview, we’ve seen early adopters create hundreds of no-code and low-code AI agents and apps that automate repetitive tasks, execute multi-step processes, and proactively engage in everyday work. We’re now thrilled to make Glean Apps and Glean APIs available for all.”


The Glean Platform now includes:



Glean Apps: Glean Apps are custom generative AI agents, assistants, copilots, and chatbots created and deployed by everyday users in a no-code environment. Glean Apps are configured with natural language, can be constrained to work with data from specified knowledge sources, and are capable of a wide range of information gathering and analysis, content synthesis and generation, and task automation capabilities. These apps can be used by individuals or deployed in the tools where users work like Slack, and can take proactive action when triggered by specific events. Use cases for Glean Apps include straightforward applications like HR or IT help bots, as well as more complex assistants like domain-specific content generation, engineering issue analysis, and sales objection handling and enablement coaching.



Glean Actions: Glean Actions enable Glean Assistant and Glean Apps to take action on a user’s behalf inside connected applications. For example, actions can read data from an application and then perform specific tasks like writing a ticket in Jira or sending an email in Gmail. Users can also build custom actions with the Actions SDK.



Glean APIs: For developers, Glean offers two APIs that enable businesses to quickly and securely build custom AI applications, leveraging the enterprise-grade connectivity, retrieval, and analysis capabilities of the Glean Platform. The Chat API enables developers to embed generative AI experiences, grounded in company knowledge, directly inside the business applications where users work. The Search API helps companies build their own RAG applications, using Glean’s best-in-class retrieval engine and secure, permission-aware data connections.



Expanded LLM options: Glean Platform now supports Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet and Google’s Gemini 1.5 models, joining the existing support for OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 and 4 models. This support not only offers model choice, but deployment options enabling data to remain within the customer’s secure VPC in their cloud provider of choice. Large language models continue to improve at a rapid pace, and Glean is committed to a model-agnostic approach that ensures customers can easily take advantage of innovation from multiple model providers.



“With Glean Apps and Glean APIs, we’ve been able to securely build and deploy generative AI applications that would have taken months and significant resources for us to develop on our own,” said Manu Narayan, VP of IT, Data and Business Operations at Confluent. “We first began using Glean in 2020 to search across our 20+ work systems and saw immediate impact: it boosted employee satisfaction and workplace efficiency, while meeting our stringent security, data governance and permissions requirements. Glean’s platform gives us the best of both worlds - allowing our users and developers to build fast, while ensuring that AI is deployed safely and securely.”


During the Glean Apps and Glean APIs preview, more than 100 customers, including leading technology, media, telecommunications, manufacturing, industrials, and professional services companies, created and deployed 1,000+ unique AI apps and agents. The Glean Platform is now in use by hundreds of customers, including BILL, Databricks, Duolingo, Grammarly, and Sony Electronics.

Login     Listen to this article 6 min    Generative artificial intelligence tools designed for the legal industry make up false or misleading information between 17 per cent and 33 per cent of the time, a Stanford University study has found.The academic paper claims to be the first systematic assessment of leading AI tools for legal research tasks, which allow lawyers to interrogate large databases of legislation, case law and legal commentary by putting questions to an AI-powered chatbot.Generative artificial intelligence tools designed for the legal industry make up false or misleading information up to one in three times, a study has found. iStockThe analysis focused on products by LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which had suggested in earlier statements that they had eliminated or significantly reduced the problem of “hallucinations”. This is when a large language model makes a false statement or falsely asserts that a source supports a statement.But the researchers found the companies’ claims were overblown.“While hallucinations are reduced relative to general-purpose chatbots (GPT-4), we find that the AI research tools made by LexisNexis (Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and Ask Practical Law AI) each hallucinate between 17 per cent and 33 per cent of the time,” the paper concluded.AdvertisementLawyers must continue to verify that key propositions are accurately supported by citations, the researchers said.“That said, even in their current form, these products can offer considerable value to legal researchers compared to traditional keyword search methods or general-purpose AI systems, particularly when used as the first step of legal research rather than the last word.”The researchers designed a set of 202 legal queries to test the four generative AI tools. These included bar exam questions, requests for factual recall, questions based on a false premise and queries related to overturned cases or new developments.The study found that more than one in six queries (17 per cent) caused Lexis+ AI and Thomson Reuters’ Ask Practical Law AI to respond with misleading or false information. This compared with one in three (33 per cent) for Thomson Reuters’ AI-Assisted Research in Westlaw Precision, and 43 per cent for OpenAI’s GPT-4.Corresponding author Daniel E. Ho, professor of law and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human Centered-Artificial Intelligence, told The Australian Financial Review the study used “highly realistic questions, including bar exam questions and questions of appellate litigation”.AdvertisementProfessor Ho said hallucinations included “fabricating statutory provisions that defy Supreme Court precedent and stating that the US Supreme Court was overruled by the Nebraska Supreme Court, which is an impossibility in the US legal system”.Other questions that the various tools got wrong included, “Are the deadlines established by the bankruptcy rules for objecting to discharge jurisdictional?” and “Why did Justice Ginsburg dissent in Obergefell?”“The paper shows that these systems can fail to comprehend basic distinctions in the law, like distinguishing between holdings and facts, arguments by litigants and findings by judges, and the hierarchy of legal authority,” Professor Ho said.Findings questionedIn an article posted to Thomson Reuters’ Legal Current website, Mike Dahn, head of Westlaw product management at Thomson Reuters, said the organisation agreed with the spirit of the research and the ambition of the team running the study to produce a common set of standards for AI-powered legal tools.But he said the researchers’ findings differed significantly from its own testing because it “included question types we very rarely or never see in AI-assisted research”.Advertisement“Our thorough internal testing of AI-assisted research shows an accuracy rate of approximately 90 per cent based on how our customers use it, and we’ve been very clear with customers that the product can produce inaccuracies,” Mr Dahn said.Rival LexisNexis’ response was more positive. In a statement, it said the researchers had provided “empirical data that Lexis+ AI is delivering superior results than our competitors’ AI-generated legal research tools in a number of key areas”.In Australia, a months-long trial by the company involving 300 lawyers found they estimated they could save an average of 12 hours each week by using Lexis+ AI for legal research, drafting, client communications, summarising case law and summarising documents.Aussie firms adoptClayton Utz became the first Australian law firm to adopt the Lexis+ AI tool permanently after a six-week trial found the tool was helpful and saved lawyers time. The tool was launched locally on May 28.Partner Simon Newcomb said it was “very thorough and fast” but was “absolutely not a replacement for lawyers, because it requires quite a bit of skill to steer it”.Advertisement“It’s quite good at finding the law, but a human is going to be better at applying the law,” Mr Newcomb said.Holding Redlich has also adopted Lexis+ AI permanently. Chief knowledge officer Keren Smith said her colleagues were realistic about the tool’s strengths and weaknesses, and understood that it was not yet able to perform high-level research and that its output required extensive checking.But she said the tool’s case summary feature would expedite research by enabling lawyers to more quickly determine which cases they needed to read and which cases they could avoid.“This feature alone has the potential to save significant amounts of time,” Ms Smith said.“Last week, one of our lawyers spent 4½ hours completing a legal research task using traditional research methods. Using Lexis+ AI, he was able to replicate that same task in 30 minutes.“RelatedAllens didn’t trust ChatGPT, so it built AirlieRelatedConsultants using AI do better, especially underperformers: studyExpert advice for getting ahead in the new world of work left by COVID-19Sign up to our weekly newsletter.Sign Up NowEuan Black is a work and careers reporter at The Australian Financial Review.

After some initial hesitation that comes with adapting to change, the powerful benefits of generative AI are steadily being recognised by businesses of all sizes.
For small to medium businesses (SMEs) the potential is vast — thanks to progress in natural language processing, machine learning, and predictive analytics, AI can provide SMEs with crucial understandings into customer behaviour, market trends, and potential business prospects. 
But while 68% of Australian leaders and employees say that AI has a positive impact on work, only 22% are currently using it, according to Adobe’s Future of Digital Work 2023 report.
That means many SMEs are missing out on the cost-effective, time-saving productivity hacks that can come with adopting generative AI platforms.
The reasons behind the hesitation to embrace AI are primarily security concerns, executives’ resistance, and a lack of comprehensive understanding, says Chandra Sinnathamby, Director, Digital Media B2B Strategy & GTM, Asia-Pacific at Adobe.
“Technology in general has always been a key enabler of productivity gains and also accelerating businesses for growth. Generative AI in particular is one of those key drivers today,” says Sinnathamby.
“Like any adoption curve, you’ll have early adopters and laggards — the biggest challenge is showing them how easy it is and my advice is that the owner of the business needs to showcase how it is helping in day-to-day life,” he says.
So how can generative AI help SMEs? We look at how advancements in technology are already helping SMEs and what lies ahead.
Increasing productivity
A new report from the Productivity Commission shows that labour productivity fell sharply in 2022-23. Despite an increase in hours worked, economic output failed to keep pace. In fact, productivity fell by 3.7% — driven by a 6.9% increase in hours worked by Australians — the highest annual increase in history.
For businesses that are facing a decline in productivity, AI offers many ways to save time and cut costs. An example is the recently released Acrobat AI Assistant from Adobe, a generative AI-powered conversational engine integrated into Reader and Acrobat workflows. 
AI Assistant instantly generates summaries and insights from PDFs, answers questions and formats information for sharing in emails, reports and presentations, says Sinnathamby.
“This is one of those tools that we believe can really help address the productivity needs of small businesses in Australia, which are the backbone of the country,” he says.
“AI Assistant can summarise a PDF, list the key points and save businesses hours that would normally have been spent reading through a detailed contract, brief, or any other business document,” he says.
“It also provides the ability to get insights, ask questions and compare information across multiple documents.”
Retaining staff
Providing employees with ways to do more meaningful work is also a major benefit generative AI is bringing to small businesses. According to the Adobe’s Future of Digital Work 2023 study, more than 80% of people reported they want to accelerate business processes to free up time and remove redundant tasks.
“That’s really critical because it shows that most people want to do work that drives a higher level of job satisfaction for them. If you talk to any HR leader, the higher the job satisfaction, the higher the retention of staff will be,” says Sinnathamby.
Using generative AI tools, such as Acrobat AI Assistant, means employees are freed up from time-consuming tasks and can focus on those that bring greater value to the business, and the employee’s own wellbeing.
“The average knowledge worker spends about 8.2 hours a week looking for information.
This tool can save hours of time that can then be better spent on some other part of the business,” he says.
“For example, if you use it to summarise the requirements of a tender document, you can then use that time saved in responding to those requirements.”
For those resisting the adoption of generative AI, Sinnathamby’s advice is to do some research and start trialling different tools.
Generative AI is moving from the playground to production, according to McKinsey research, and is the number one priority for CEOs to focus on in 2024. 
“This is just the beginning,” says Sinnathamby. “Those that adopt early will gain significant advantage — so by definition, if you’re not the one adopting, you’re going to be left behind.”

It is customary to take proactive measures against potential future disasters to safeguard ourselves from being overwhelmed by such catastrophes. Regardless of the seemingly slim chances of an anticipated disaster, it is imperative to take serious measures to protect the community or nation. Proactive protective measures are more cost-effective than responding to a disaster after it occurs.
In the realm of AI technology, stakeholders have collectively agreed to refrain from developing autonomous intelligent weapons. However, the issue of AI taking over human jobs has sparked significant controversy within the industry and research community. Proponents argue that AI is poised to transform job roles, create new opportunities, and shorten the time needed to perform complex tasks that traditionally took long periods to accomplish. They believe that AI will enhance productivity and open up new fields of employment. On the other hand, critics contend that AI will inevitably lead to job displacement due to automation.
                           Next   Stay       Stunned by thousands of storks flying over the sky in Gia Viễn dike, Ninh Bình - Nếm TV            40         42                                                                                                              00:00                                                       00:00  /  00:00           10 Sec             
I align with this perspective, given the substantial evidence of job cuts across various industries worldwide resulting from AI adoption. For instance, tasks that previously required the efforts of 30 people can now be completed by one or two individuals with the help of AI models. To illustrate, consider the example of coding. Coding involves writing instructions to direct computer operations. For example, coding is what makes it possible for you to use WhatsApp.
AI has revolutionised the coding space beyond initial imagination. With the advent of AI-driven coding tools, tasks that used to require extensive human labour can now be executed more efficiently and with fewer resources. Previously, coding was a tedious process that required many programmers to write complex code. However, tasks that once required 20 people can now be completed by one or two individuals in a short period, thanks to AI coding models such as Codex.


Currently, there are many AI models for coding available, both open-source and proprietary. One intriguing feature of these coding models is their ability to convert natural language into computer programs. A programmer can simply describe the requirements of the software they intend to develop in plain English and prompt the AI coding model. The AI then automatically generates the code based on the provided description. The programmer only needs to review the generated code to ensure it meets the expected requirements, as the AI-generated code can sometimes contain errors that require human judgment to fix.
This capability has significantly streamlined the coding process, reducing the need for large teams of programmers and accelerating software development.
The Nigerian agricultural sector is the largest employer of labour in the country, with PwC estimating that it accounts for more than 36 per cent of the labour force. According to a report by Jobberman, the sector employs over 23 million people. These workers are involved in various tasks on farms of different scales across Nigeria, including land clearing, harrowing, planting seeds, weeding, spreading fertilizer, harvesting, packaging, livestock management, and more. The majority of these jobs require a large workforce.
Beyond those directly employed on farms, there are also many individuals indirectly involved, such as drivers transporting workers to and from the farms and hawkers selling food to the farm workers, which stimulates local economic activities.


However, the full adoption of AI technologies in Nigeria’s agricultural sector could potentially replace the jobs of over 20 million Nigerians. AI-driven machinery and automation could perform tasks that currently require numerous workers, thereby significantly reducing the need for human labour.
While this technological shift could increase efficiency and productivity, it also poses a significant risk of job displacement for a substantial portion of the Nigerian workforce.
Apapa Port in Lagos is a bustling hub of economic activity, currently employing thousands of workers directly and indirectly. Tasks range from loading and unloading cargo to administrative duties and transportation logistics. However, with the full deployment of AI systems at the port, it would only require two or three people to oversee the entire operations, leading to the displacement of almost all the direct and indirect workers. The thousands of people currently employed at the port, as well as those in related support roles, would lose their jobs.
To put this in perspective, consider the Shanghai Smart Port in China. This port, which surpasses the combined capacity of all ports in the USA, operates with intelligent automated container terminals and manages 47.4 million containers autonomously. Remarkably, there is not a single human worker involved in its operations. If Apapa Port were to adopt similar AI technologies, the impact on employment would be profound, replacing thousands of workers with automated systems and dramatically altering the employment landscape.
adImplementing AI systems for immigration tasks like passport and passenger verification at Nigerian airports would lead to a significant reduction in the workforce. I’ve personally encountered such systems at Dubai Airport when exiting the country, where intelligent systems efficiently screen passengers.

On the global scene, Amazon has replaced over 100,000 workers with robots, significantly streamlining its operations. Similarly, Google laid off over 12,000 employees due to the adoption of AI technologies. In 2023, AI Magazine reported that AI technology was responsible for the elimination of over 200,000 roles across various industries. Numerous companies are reducing their workforce, citing AI adoption as the primary reason for these layoffs. As of January 2024, more than 4,000 layoffs directly related to AI have been reported, underscoring the rapid and significant impact of AI on employment worldwide.  
This shift emphasises the profound impact of AI on the job market, highlighting the urgent need for strategies to mitigate potential negative effects on employment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic National Committee was watching earlier this year as campaigns nationwide were experimenting with artificial intelligence. So the organization approached a handful of influential party campaign committees with a request: Sign onto guidelines that would commit them to use the technology in a “responsible” way.
The draft agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, was hardly full of revolutionary ideas. It asked campaigns to check work by AI tools, protect against biases and avoid using AI to create misleading content.
“Our goal is to use this new technology both effectively and ethically, and in a way that advances – rather than undermines – the values that we espouse in our campaigns,” the draft said.
The plan went nowhere.
Instead of fostering an agreement, the guidelines sparked a debate about the value of such pledges, particularly those governing fast-evolving technology. Among the concerns expressed by the Democratic campaign organizations: Such a pledge might hamstring their ability to deploy AI and could turn off donors with ties to the AI industry. Some committee officials were also irked that the DNC gave them only a few days to agree to the guidelines.
The proposal’s demise highlighted internal divisions over campaign tactics and the party’s uncertainty over how to best utilize AI amid warnings from experts that the technology is supercharging the proliferation of disinformation.
Hannah Muldavin, a senior spokesperson at the Democratic National Committee, said the group is not giving up on finding a consensus.
The DNC, she said, “will continue to engage with our sister committees to discuss ideas and issues important to Democratic campaigns and to American voters, including AI.”
“It’s not uncommon for ideas and plans to shift, especially in the midst of a busy election year, and any documents on this subject reflect early and ongoing conversations,” Muldavin said, adding the “DNC and our partners take seriously the opportunities and challenges presented by AI.”
The wrangling comes as campaigns have increasingly deployed artificial intelligence — computer systems, software or processes that emulate aspects of human work and cognition — to optimize workloads. That includes using large language models to write fundraising emails, text supporters and build chatbots to answer voters’ questions.
That trend is expected to continue as November’s general election approaches, with campaigns turning to supercharged generative AI tools to create text and images, as well as clone human voices and create video at lightning speeds.
The Republican National Committee used AI-generated images in a television spot last year predicting a dystopian future under President Joe Biden.
Much of that adoption, however, has been overshadowed by concerns about how campaigns could use artificial intelligence in ways that trick voters. Experts have warned that AI has become so powerful that it has made it easy to generate “deep fake” videos, audio snippets and other media targeting opposing candidates. Some states have passed legislation regulating the way generative artificial intelligence can be used. But Congress has so far failed to pass any bills regulating artificial intelligence on the federal level.
In the absence of regulation, the DNC sought a set of guidelines it could point to as evidence the party was taking seriously the threat and promise of AI. It sent the proposal in March to the five Democratic campaign committees that seek to elect House, Senate, gubernatorial, state legislative and state attorneys general candidates to office, according to the draft agreement. 
The goal was to have each committee agree to a slate of AI guardrails and the DNC proposed issuing a joint statement proclaiming such guidelines would ensure that campaigns could use “the tools they need to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation, while empowering campaigns to safely, responsibly use generative AI to engage more Americans in our democracy.” 
The Democratic committee had hoped the statement would be signed by Chair Jaime Harrison and the leaders of the other organizations.
Democratic operatives said the proposal landed with a thud. Some senior leaders at the committees worried that the agreement might have unforeseen consequences, perhaps constricting how campaigns use AI, according to multiple Democratic operatives familiar with the outreach.
And it might send the wrong message to technology companies and executives who work on AI, many of whom help fill campaign coffers during election years.
Some of the Democratic Party’s most prolific donors are top tech entrepreneurs and AI evangelists, including Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google.
Altman has donated over $200,000 to the Biden campaign and his aligned Democratic joint fundraising committee since the start of last year, according to data from the Federal Election Commission, and Schmidt’s contributions to those groups have topped $500,000 over the same time. 
Two other AI proponents, Dustin Moskovitz, the co-founder of Facebook, and Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, donated more than $900,000 to Biden’s joint fundraising committee this cycle, according to the same data.
The DNC plan caught the committees off guard because it came with little explanation, other than a desire to get each committee to agree to the list of best practices within a few days, said multiple Democratic operatives who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter. Aides to the Democratic Congressional Campaign and Democratic Senatorial Campaign committees said they felt rushed by a DNC timeline that urged them to sign quickly.
Representatives from the Democratic Attorneys General Association did not respond to the Associated Press’ request for comment. Spokesmen from the Democratic Governors Association and Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee declined to comment.
The Republican National Committee did not respond to questions about its AI guidelines. The Biden campaign also declined to comment when asked about the DNC effort.
The four-page agreement — “Guidelines on Responsible Use of Generative AI in Campaigns” — covered everything from ensuring that artificial intelligence systems were not trusted without a human checking its work to notifying voters when they are interacting with AI-generated content or systems.
“As the explosive rise of generative AI transforms every corner of public life – including political campaigns – it’s more important than ever that we limit this new technology’s potential threat to voters’ rights, and instead leverage it to build innovative, efficient campaigns and a stronger, more inclusive democracy,” the proposal said.
The guidelines were divided into five sections that included titles such as “Offering Human Alternatives, Consideration and Fallback” and “Providing Notice and Explanation.” The proposed rules would have required the committees to ensure “a real person should be responsible for approving AI-generated content and be accountable for how, where, and to whom it is deployed.”
The directive outlined how “users should always be aware when they are interacting with an AI bot” and stressed that any images or video created by AI “should be flagged” as such. And it stressed that campaigns should use AI to assist staffers, not replace them.
“Campaigns are a human-driven and human motivated business,” read the agreement. “Use efficiency gains to teach more voters and focus more on quality control and sustainability.”
It also urged campaigns not to use “generative AI to create misleading content. Period.”

Artificial Intelligence in Daily Work






By: Stuart Wagner

Date:

June 5, 2024 



Using AI has become a part of our everyday lives, including work. We can ease so many tasks and still be good at what we do for a living! Many are still afraid of AI and will do anything to avoid embracing it, but they lose big here.
Just check on the events around you. Every day, you can see at least one speaker artificial intelligence around, who tries to bring this technology closer to us. And our lives can get much easier, knowing that we can use AI for:
Data Tracking and Scheduling
AI helps us make sense of large amounts of data. Whether it’s some marketing agency, healthcare institution, or government domain, AI can analyze data and track trends to help you understand what’s happening. Every profession can benefit from AI if used properly. 
Personalized Work Experience
From preferred courses, analyzing skills, and suggested improvements, AI can improve each work position. Also, it adapts to the worker’s preferences, so both the company and the individual can make the most out of the collaboration. We’re still not used to this approach, but it will surely become an important part of our job as time goes by.
Your Automation Assistant
Some tasks are boring and repetitive. People easily get demotivated when working on such tasks, affecting their overall productivity. Instead of being against AI at work, it’s time to embrace various tools and solutions that automate some of the daily tasks, leaving enough time to be more creative and productive with the other assignments.

Initially, people thought that AI could replace several workplaces like app developers, content writers, copywriters, etc. The truth is, we still need the old but gold human touch to complete the task successfully. For example, writing content with AI is dull, the sentences are repetitive, and may not make sense. But when a human edits that content it gets more digestible, useful, helpful, and readable. 
AI is worth it because:

Eases the daily tasks
Makes a great work assistant
Improves efficiency and productivity
Boosts your dedication

Still, everything is not blooms and roses with AI. Sometimes people aren’t even aware that there are negative aspects, especially with the overreliance on AI solutions. 
Working Alongside With AI
In extreme situations, people either completely avoid AI, or use it all the time. But the real skill is to work alongside it – not to ignore it, but also not to rely on everything. That’s the golden rule: AI is here to help us, not to replace our work. At least for now…
Conclusion
AI is nothing to be afraid of. It’s the future of so many job positions, especially when it comes to enhanced efficiency and productivity. Use AI to ease the tasks you find boring and repetitive. Use your brain to deal with creative parts of your job, as no AI tool can be that creative as an experienced human being who deals with everyday problems. 
Surely, completely avoid AI if it potentially leads to wrong information and conclusions. Some professions simply can’t rely on AI, or it’s too early for that.

In a recent report prepared by Citi analysts entitled What can’t machines do?The authors of the document summarized a number of skills identified as key, and feedback from experts from different fields.  The degree of pessimism and optimism about the impact of AI on employment varies from one expert to another, but there is some agreement on what they think needs to be known. 
Of the 28 experts Citi consulted, 64% said communication would be an essential skill among their arsenal, and 64% of those surveyed said it was key.  Emotional intelligence (57%), digital skills (54%), empathy (54%) and critical thinking (46%) rounded out the top five.  In contrast, only 7% of those surveyed believed that an entrepreneurial mindset and self-awareness would be critical, with organizational ability ranked lowest, with only 4% of those surveyed mentioning it.  
Apart from compiling a more or less predictable list of skills that are said to help avoid or minimize the impact of AI, the highlight of the report is the words of the 28 experts included in it.  Reading them, one can discern three different currents among them: those who believe that AI will not be such a systemic change, those who believe that skills need to be reordered (the vast majority), and those who argue that the social contract is just around the corner. is about to change, with a revolution in how we understand work, because people will be displaced.
An important tool, but not that revolutionary
Robert Buckland, a senior adviser at Engine AI, a company that helps other companies implement AI, is a leading voice among experts who don’t believe it will have such a systemic impact.  Buckland says the first thing he did when he received questions from Citi was translate them to two of today’s leading chatbots.  “They gave me very similar answers.  Gain digital skills, practice human-AI collaboration, develop critical thinking, the most humane humanities, and continue to learn throughout your life.  It was as if both AIs were reacting the same way.  When I escalated the questions to my colleagues at Engine AI, I received much more detailed answers,” he begins by explaining. 
According to Buckland, one of his colleagues responded: Whatever you decide to improve, you should never lose sight of the impact of AI.  “Learning languages ​​helps with analytical and critical thinking, as well as understanding other cultures, but don’t expect to get a job as a translator.”  Another suggested that he choose professions that are less threatened by AI.  “You may be an electrician or a plumber, but even there you will likely be using AI to better compete with other electricians and plumbers.” 
Finally they responded that maybe it wasn’t that revolutionary.  “AI is a tool.  Just like Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel.  They all help improve productivity.  Anyone who does not use these tools is already left behind today.  Word and Excel are necessary but not sufficient for success in many of today’s professions.  AI will be no exception.” 
Technology that changes what matters 
Most of the experts in the Citi report fall into this category: they believe that AI will change the employment paradigm because it will change what knowledge is important and what is not.  Carl Benedikt Frey, associate professor of artificial intelligence at the Oxford Internet Institute, says there is a short answer to the question of which skills will be key: “all those that AI is not good at.”  The short answer is yes, but that by no means closes the question because then comes the definition of what they are. 





  



Benedikt Frey believes that personal communication and creativity are among the fundamental elements.  Widespread assumption.  Other experts, such as Chris Butt, founder of Cognisess and Yondur, a human resources company, add emotional intelligence, critical thinking and adaptability.  Many people agree with this short list. 
Bill Schaninger, advisor to Modern Executive Solutions, emphasizes the fact that knowledge of artificial intelligence itself and leadership will be two important assets to keep in mind.  Another point of agreement among experts is that the education system is destined to be very different, or at least it should be from their point of view.  In addition to suggesting that AI should be taught across disciplines rather than just methods, they believe the system should focus on teaching skills such as adaptation, problem solving and lifelong learning rather than being based on “memorization and regurgitation”.  information.”    
A revolution that will make us obsolete
Anton Korinek, a professor at the University of Virginia and Darden School of Business, may be the expert who offers the most troubling vision.  First, Korinek distinguishes between time frames.  “In the next five years, the most important skill for office workers will be the ability to use AI versatility.  The good side is that the technologies we have and will have in the short term make people more productive, the bad side is that they reduce the market value of human capital,” he says about the very near future. 
“In the medium to long term, it is foreseeable that artificial intelligence systems will be able to be more efficient than humans in all cognitive functions, including jobs requiring creativity or emotional intelligence.  Leaders of major artificial intelligence labs estimate that this will happen in less than five years, but I think it will take a couple more years.  Robotics won’t be far behind when it comes to automating physical tasks.  My fear is that human labor will become an obsolete asset,” he says. 
Given the difficulty of understanding this idea, Korinek uses a comparison.  “If you were born 200 years ago, gaining physical strength would make you a more valuable worker.  Since then, mechanization has reduced the value of physical strength in employment.  Just as the legendary John Henry succumbed to the tireless efficiency of the steam engine, office workers will also see their labor costs fall, only at a much faster rate.”  According to the professor, neither people, nor companies, nor governments are ready for what will happen.  He believes that if we want to preserve democracy and humanity in a world in which robots and artificial intelligence do cognitive and physical work better than we can, we need to rethink the role of work and the structure of the economic system. 
“Instead of engaging in a futile zero-sum game in which we try to counteract the effects of increasingly efficient machines with more varied abilities, we need to focus our efforts on making AI have human values.  At the same time, we must update our economic system to ensure that the benefits of AI are available to everyone.  We must act now,” Korinek concludes.  
Whatever happens, which no one knows for sure yet, Citi is leaving something undeniable in its document.  “AI will not wait for anyone.  “The race between the progress of artificial intelligence and the ability of humans to adapt has already begun.”
