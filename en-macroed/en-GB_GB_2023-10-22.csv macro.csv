In November 2022, OpenAI grabbed headlines by releasing ChatGPT, and “generative AI” became a term used in households around the world. According to Open AI CEO Sam Altman, “A lot of people working on AI pretend that it’s only going to be good; it’s only going to be a supplement; no one is ever going to be replaced.” But, he adds, “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.” Two major labor strikes this year, by the Writers Guild of America and the actors union (SAG-AFTRA), have helped focus attention on the threat AI poses to well-paid jobs.
Artificial Intelligence is poised to upend work around the world over the coming decades. Whether this lessens or increases inequality remains to be seen. AI technology is relatively new, but the impacts of previous high-impact innovations like the power loom, steam engines, electricity, and digital computers shed ample light on what could happen next. The consequences of any technology depend on who gets to make pivotal decisions about how the technology develops. This is doubly true for AI, because these new tools can be developed for many different types of activities, with the potential to spread rapidly in every sector of the economy and in every aspect of our lives.






Making Tech Work for Workers 


This in-depth article series, sponsored by the Ford Foundation, explores the harms of the digital economy and asks workers, organizers, technologists, economists, and funders: How can we collectively build a future of work that is just, equitable, and sustainable for all?

Too many commentators see the path of technology as inevitable. But the historical record is clear: technologies develop according to the vision and choices of those in positions of power. As we document in Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle over Technology and Prosperity, when these choices are left entirely in the hands of a small elite, you should expect that group to receive most of the benefits, while everyone else bears the costs—potentially for a long time.
Rapid advances in AI threaten to eliminate many jobs, and not just those of writers and actors. Jobs with routine elements, such as in regulatory compliance or clerical work, and those that involve simple data collection, data summary, and writing tasks are likely to disappear.
But there are still two distinct paths that this AI revolution could take. One is the path of automation, based on the idea that AI’s role is to perform tasks as well as or better than people. Currently, this vision dominates in the US tech sector, where Microsoft and Google (and their ecosystems) are cranking hard to create new AI applications that can take over as many human tasks as possible.
The negative impact on people along the “just automate” path is easy to predict from prior waves of digital technologies and robotics. It was these earlier forms of automation that contributed to the decline of American manufacturing employment and the huge
increase in inequality over the last four decades. If AI intensifies automation, we are very likely to get more of the same—a gap
between capital and labor, more inequality between the professional class and the rest of the workers, and fewer good jobs in the economy.
There is a second, very different path available to us, however. This path would focus on creating new tasks and capabilities for humans, rather than sidelining them. This too is not new in history. The augmentation of human capabilities, by creating new tasks and providing better tools and information for workers, was the bedrock of wage growth and shared prosperity during the decades that followed World War II.
In principle, AI could magnify the possibilities for human-complementary technological change. It could enable the development of a wide array of tools that provide better information to human decision-makers. Critically, this need not be limited to office workers and professionals. Much of the workforce today, from blue-collar workers in factories to electricians, plumbers, educators, and health care providers, depends on problem-solving and real-time decision-making. With better context-specific information, these workers could become more productive in the tasks they are performing and venture into new, more complex tasks.
Alas, this more hopeful path is not where we are heading. Three big social changes would be necessary for such a path, and each one of them is a tall order.
First, management needs to see and understand workers as a key resource whose productivity should be augmented, whose information should be improved, and whose training should be a priority. But the dominant perspective in most C-suites views
labor as a cost to be cut, either to withstand competition or to better remunerate shareholders. What gets lost in the rush to reengineer the corporation with fewer workers is the long-term health of the companies, which never achieve the promised productivity gains from so-so automation and offshoring. Companies must recognize that, in reality, labor is a critical resource for productivity growth.
Second, the tech sector needs to prioritize helping workers, rather than focusing on tools of automation and surveillance. The industry’s vision has too long been shaped by an ill-advised quest for artificial general intelligence and autonomous machine intelligence, and many technologists are still preoccupied by showing how their algorithms can reach “human parity.” In practice, that means automating as many tasks as possible.
Third, labor needs to have a voice in how technologies are used. This voice is critical not only for resisting excessive emphasis on labor cost-cutting and automation. It is also essential because workers typically know which parts of their jobs would benefit from automation and which would not. They recognize which tasks could be made more efficient, freeing them to spend time on more productive activities, or even creating new opportunities for increased productivity. Increased worker buy-in reduces businesses’ incentives for further intensification of worker monitoring and surveillance. It also ensures that any productivity gains are shared more fairly between capital and labor.
These three social changes are possible, even if very unlikely to happen without a coordinated effort. 
There is much greater pushback against the “shareholder values revolution”—which elevated cost-cutting and the interests of shareholders at the expense of workers—than at any other time over the last four decades. A new philosophy prioritizing long-term productivity growth may yet emerge, which management and workers can work together to achieve.
The tech sector can change, too. It was always an aberration that arguably the most powerful industry in the US (and the world) would ignore all social responsibility and elevate the virtues of “disruption” with an almost religious zeal. In its next, more mature phase, the industry could focus on providing better tools for workers and augmenting human capabilities, rather than replacing them wholesale.
And labor can become better organized and better focused on charting a new course for involvement in the production process during the age of AI, which will also enhance productivity. In fact, pro-union sentiment is higher
than we’ve seen in decades, and the WGA strike has set an example of how focusing on technology—who controls it and how it will be used—could become central to contract
negotiations in other industries.
It is crucial, however, that the renewed energy of organized labor is channeled in the right way. Labor cannot hope to ask for and obtain high wages unless technology moves in a more pro-worker direction. Nor can one reasonably expect that opposing new technologies, including AI, will be a viable option for the union movement. Rather, leaders and rank-and-file workers alike must understand the potential of new tools, including artificial intelligence, and articulate a vision for how these technologies can be used in a way that helps both labor and corporations. Making workers more productive in their decision-making and problem-solving tasks is the bedrock of such an approach.
None of this will happen automatically. Any meaningful change must start with a recognition of the problem—technology is heading in an anti-labor direction. People promoting change must also recognize the feasibility and desirability of a pro-worker direction for technological change.
Neither the tech industry nor other large corporations will undertake a huge course correction without strong pressure from others in society. In addition to robust labor voices, government regulation and civil society organizations have previously played a critical role in pushing companies in the right direction. This role is even more important today when we need a fundamental redirection of AI technology.
The government should adopt a set of complementary policies encouraging a better path for technology use and development, as we detail in a recent policy memo (jointly written with our MIT colleague David Autor, through the new MIT Shaping the Future of Work Initiative that we collectively co-direct) entitled “Can We Have Pro-Worker AI?”
Lawmakers should revise the federal tax code to equalize the tax burden across labor and machines, so companies are encouraged to hire, train, and retain human workers. Regulatory agencies should also find ways to include and amplify worker voice on how AI and other technology is used in the workplace—including regulating AI-assisted personnel management and placing safeguards around workplace surveillance.
The public sector should invest in research that prioritizes human-complementary AI technology and create a federal government consultative AI center of expertise to support lawmakers and officials who need to understand this technology. We should use this federal expertise to assess whether specific AI technologies live up to their promise to augment human work before they are rolled out in any publicly funded programs such as education or health care.
There is much to be alarmed about when it comes to AI. But if AI brings a dystopian future, it will not be because this was the only path available to us. It will be because we failed to grasp how this technology could be developed and used, and how it could help workers, rather than just replacing them. Understanding this is a first step toward the right type of AI revolution.
How can data-driven technology be harnessed to give power back to workers? Listen to a case study from SSIR’s 2023 Data on Purpose conference:

Sarah AyoubSun 22 Oct 2023 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Oct 2023 18.55 EDTShare3434When Anisa* graduated from her second degree, she felt “fairly confident” that her postgraduate studies, double-major undergraduate degree and years spent balancing two volunteering roles and a part-time job would account for something in the job market.She applied to every entry-level or junior role she could find in her industry, tracking each application’s outcome on a spreadsheet. Before she knew it, “applying for jobs became a full-time job”: in total, she applied for, and was rejected from, 350 jobs before finally landing one 18 months later. And she believes that AI – in particular its use in screening applications – is a huge part of the reason.Artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT to be allowed in Australian schools from 2024Read more“The rise of third party, AI-run digital online forms are a huge pain point for so many jobseekers,” Anisa says as she recalls uploading CVs alongside filling in digital forms.“I can count on one hand how many personalised interview processes I had where there was a face I could put to it.”Although the uptake of AI in the recruitment space in Australia is fairly new, it is not uncommon. The elements of the hiring process that were once the domain of human beings – resume screening and preliminary interviews – are increasingly being outsourced to AI, with researchers estimating that there are now more than 250 commercial AI recruitment tools being used in Australia. As of last year, one in three Australian organisations reported that they had utilised AI tools while filling positions, though some researchers have deemed this a “high-risk” activity.

John Shields, professor of human resource management and organisational studies at the University of Sydney Business School, says increasing use of AI in the recruitment sector is not necessarily a bad thing.He believes that it’s all about “quickly and effectively managing huge bodies of information on candidates” and achieving “a strong alignment between individual and organisation, or individual and job”, mitigating the issues and cost of a mis-hire.According to Sue Williamson, associate professor of human resources management at UNSW, employers are turning to AI because the typical, traditional recruiting process – application, interview, work test, referee contact – is “outdated, onerous and time-consuming” and does not always result in the best person for a job.View image in fullscreenJobseekers are increasingly being interviewed on video by AI. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images“Managers are increasingly time-poor and looking for ways to shorten the recruitment process,” she says. “They may be turning to AI to help streamline the administrative processes or to assist in vetting potential candidates, for example, by ‘assessing’ resumes or providing candidates with work tests. Video resumes are also becoming increasingly popular and these can also be assessed by AI.”But it’s a sore point for many jobseekers, raising issues around fairness and merit. Recent research has revealed that AI-assessed job applications reinforce biases against women and cultural minorities. In Australia, the Merit Protection Commissioner issued new guidance for employers in the public sector after overturning 11 promotional decisions made by Services Australia in the 2021-22 financial year because they were made using AI-assisted and automated selection techniques  that involved no human review, leading to “meritorious applicants missing out on promotions”.“A lot of research has been conducted about biases in recruitment and selection, with one of the most well-known being that of Amazon, where programmers loaded up the AI [resume screening tool] with resumes from men,” Williamson says. “The AI then preferenced future resumes from men, disadvantaging women. Studies have also shown that candidates with non-western names, including Arabic and Asian names, also receive far fewer invitations for interview than candidates with western names.”‘Job search depression’Amplifying candidate concern is the lack of transparency around the recruitment process – or specifically, how they will be reviewed. Williamson says that Australia does not have specific laws that require candidates be informed about AI screening processes.“This is potentially problematic as it may lead to indirect discrimination against groups of jobseekers,” she says. “Requiring candidates to undertake online tasks as part of recruitment [for example] may disadvantage those with limited manual dexterity.”Candidate-recorded interview is going to be an increasingly important part of a filtered process John ShieldsAnisa cites the time spent on various tasks, the lack of feedback to applications and the emotional and physical toll of such a repetitive process, which often culminated in what she calls “brutal” rejections, as a source of frustration and resentment.“[The process] was stressful, disheartening and draining in the searching and the applying, the numerous interview stages and [consecutive] rejections and then the hundreds of times I was simply ghosted,” she says.With the average job search taking around five months, that resentment can also lead to “job search depression” which experts warn can manifest in increased procrastination, maladaptive coping (such as increased drinking, sleeping or disordered eating) and prolonged anxiety.Lisa*, who has been in her industry for 15 years, applied for the same job at a different employer and found herself being interviewed on video by AI. She would be asked a question, given 60 seconds to respond and then recorded as she answered it. Frank*, a data analyst, remembers how “nerve-wracking” it was having to answer a 100-question “psych-test” before taking up his current role. It’s since turned him off any tasks employers expect of candidates at the first instance.“I think the first point of call should always be a face-to-face interview to get to know a candidate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It felt really impersonal and I didn’t meet or speak to anyone – even through a phone call – before I got a generic rejection email. For another role we were given problem-solving maths questions, working out [the] cost of services after inflation, and a final open question about how much money you’d need to live the rest of your life comfortably without working.”View image in fullscreen‘I think the first point of call should always be a face-to-face interview to get to know a candidate,’ says jobseeker Frank.

Candidate-recorded interview is going to be an increasingly important part of a filtered process before a candidate gets close to a face-to-face or panel interview.”Anisa has described the rejections during her job search as brutal; Lisa* says the situation is insane because the process should be two-sided.AI is not a one-time bomb, but a slow burn of devastation that is consuming jobs and culturePeter LewisRead more“Initial interviews are vital in understanding more about the business and how you see yourself working there,” she says. “It feels egotistical of [a] business to think that a interview should be one-sided.”But Shields says the technology can be effective for both employees (in aligning them for the right job) and employers (getting the most suitable candidate) if it is used properly.“If the programming that determines the recommendations of the AI platform is itself biased, it’s garbage in, garbage out,” he explains. “There’s got to be close attention paid to [ensure] analogic rules for AI platforms are literally written to iron out biases and unfairness.”So what’s a jobseeker to do?Stick to employer expectations and be clear about their strengths when applying for jobs, Shields says, recommending resumes are concise, precise and accurate, “and more importantly the covering letter needs to be forensically focused on the selection criteria”.He also warns jobseekers to be careful of their online footprint. “If you’re serious about getting that job, do not have anything in your media profile that might raise questions about your integrity, behaviour, your political views,” he says.*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job huntingWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveSecret Service director resigns after assassination attempt at Trump rally – liveBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in face",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the public release in November 2022 of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s large language-based chatbot, the number of people who have experimented with generative AI has grown rapidly. In its first five days the platform had more than one million users. Insider Intelligence, the research and insights provider, forecasts that by the end of 2023, 25 per cent of internet users in the US, nearly 80mn people, will deploy generative AI at least monthly, up from 8 per cent at the end of 2022. It says that proportion will rise to 33 per cent in 2024. Most people will experiment with AI in the office, Insider Intelligence says. Unlike many new technologies more users are aged 55 to 64 than aged 12 to 17 as usage is concentrated in the workplace. The AI phenomenon is not limited to America. A Salesforce survey of 4,000 people in the US, UK, Australia and India found that half of them had used generative AI. India was the leader with nearly three-quarters of respondents having tried the technology. Since the public release, the functionality of generative AI models has improved. Their understanding, reproduction of natural language and accuracy are all better. Tech for Growth Forum💾 View and download the entire reportChristian Ward, the chief data officer of Yext, the digital experience platform, says the fact that generative AI can understand human language has helped. He says that when internet search evolved, users learnt to “speak keywords . . . bending their behaviour to computers”. With generative AI people no longer have to be tech-savvy despite its advanced technology. AI is “human-savvy” and allows us to communicate with it naturally, making it more accessible. “It used to be that computer-savvy humans had an advantage,” Ward says. “Now that computers are human-savvy, that advantage is being democratised. That is absolutely one of the biggest breakthroughs we have seen in technology in a very long time.” He adds that once search functions reach the point where we use them by speaking to them as if they are human, “that construct [opens up] in a way we’ve not experienced before”.Commercial potentialMichael Wooldridge, a professor of computer science at Oxford university, calls 2023 a “watershed year” for generative AI. He says the technology will be as transformative as the microprocessor, which made possible the personal computer, the web and smartphones. While those took months or years to catch on, the pace of development of generative AI is exceptional and it is hard to envisage its full effect.GlossaryLarge language model/LLM: a deep learning algorithm capable of taking in vast amounts of content and producing human-like writing or realistic imagery.Deepfake: Realistic fabricated media, often video, which purports to show a prominent person saying or doing something they have never said or done. One of the most well known is this deepfake of President Barack Obama from Buzzfeed Video.Guardrail: A programming feature that allows or instructs generative AI not to follow certain commands or perform certain tasks, for example copying someone’s work or their creative style, or generating hate speech.Despite the technology’s youth it has already penetrated the commercial sphere. Estimates of the value it could add to the global economy vary from the 7 per cent of gross domestic product ($7tn) over 10 years predicted by Joseph Briggs, a Goldman Sachs economist to the $2.6tn to $4.4tn a year forecast by McKinsey’s (as a comparison UK GDP in 2022 was $2.7tn). Banking, life sciences and high tech could be the sectors that experience the greatest gains. Marketing, sales and customer experience will all be profoundly affected. AI’s use of natural language means that its large language-based versions are especially well suited to creative endeavours. Today’s tools can help to produce text, audio, video, music, code, images and design. For instance, based on models that draw on troves of online data, generative AI has sufficient grasp of the variety of directions in which a sentence can go that it appears to be able to create entirely original work an infinite number of times. Besides the written word, generative AI will create images from textual descriptions. These are more realistic than thought possible and can even incorporate 3D perspective and shadows. In audio and music the potential for new work that features existing artists — without their involvement — is well documented. AI-generated output has led to copyright concerns but then, given allegations of plagiarism especially in the music industry, there is doubt that humans create original work every time.Arguably the applications for generative AI are greater in the creative field than in science (think research and engineering) where accuracy and reliability are more critical. This upends the expectation of a few years ago when machines were slated to add most value in heavy or rote tasks. It had been predicted that they would augment humans’ physical capabilities or analyse data at greater speeds than we could ever process. Creativity was expected to remain the preserve of humans: some people said it was the defining essence of what it meant to be human. With its unexpected creative capability, generative AI can take on jobs once considered untouchable by technology. Goldman Sachs estimates that a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe could be automated by generative AI. At the upper end of its potential, more than 40 per cent of tasks in administration and the legal profession could be automated. This compares with less than one-tenth of tasks in physically intensive professions such as construction and maintenance. What is generative AI?Generative AI is a set of algorithms based on foundation models, a term that the Stanford Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence says “underlines their critically central yet incomplete character”. Such models are “trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks”. The data behind generative AI programs such as ChatGPT and Google Bard are sourced from across the internet. It is a huge set of training information. One example is Dall·E 2, the text to image generator from OpenAI, which was trained on 650 million images.A White House white paper gives this summary: “The power of AI comes from its use of machine learning, a branch of computational statistics that focuses on designing algorithms that can automatically and iteratively build analytical models from new data without explicitly programming the solution. It is a tool of prediction in the statistical sense, taking information you have and using it to fill in information you do not have.”What can it do? Based on the training data, generative AI can “create” content by autocompletion based on predictive sequencing or probability. In the same way that it uses likely word sequences to build sentences, generative AI employs pattern recognition and reproduction to create images, video and audio. In the case of image generation, given a text description it predicts the most relevant image. It can also summarise and answer questions about data, including text.How can it be adapted? By augmenting the training data with narrower or specialised inputs, generative AI can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. It can create marketing content in a given style or be adapted to suit an individual recipient. It can collate swaths of information and distil these into recommendations based on a specific input, for instance travel itineraries or consumer products. It can analyse data and come up with novel conclusions.What can it not do? AI cannot reason — and due to its “autocomplete” nature, users can never be sure of its factuality. It is a statistical beast and not a database. Ward says: “[The models] are just piecing words together and then using statistics to pick the next words off of that string — but it really depends on what you ask it, how you phrase it and that changes the outcome.” Ask how British company Dyson is dealing with the space vacuum — or even what time a particular shop opens — and there is a high chance that, in its current state, you will receive a confident but nonsense answer unsupported by facts.How does AI work: an easy to understand explanation Who is in the field?In its analysis of the generative AI market, Acumen Research and Consulting lists D-ID, Genie AI and Rephrase.ai among the leading players, together with more recognisable names such as Amazon Web Services, Adobe, Google, IBM and Microsoft. Besides these heavyweights, applications have mushroomed to serve specific industries such as marketing or to perfect functions including video or audio generation. In the chatbot arena ChatGPT and Bing Chat, both based on OpenAI’s large language models, compete with Google Bard. Although the technology is relatively new it has spawned lots of applications in the creative industries. For instance there are tools to supercharge communications and marketing. These include Jasper and Signum.ai, which itself provides a list of other players such as Phrasee and Clarifai. CB Insights has listed more than 360 companies that specialise in generative AI and that number will only grow. The market intelligence provider says that in the first half of 2023 investment into generative AI start-ups went up 5-fold, from the $2.5bn invested for all of 2022 to $14bn. Even excluding the $10bn raised by OpenAI, the inflows are still considerable, as is the start-up activity. Conviction, a new AI venture capital firm, received more than 1,000 applications for 13 places on Embed, its start-up accelerator programme that began in early September.Get with the strategyEven though it is early days for generative AI, BCG, the consulting group, believes that “to be an industry leader in five years, you need a clear and compelling generative AI strategy today”. This is no exaggeration. Already, there are universal corporate functions, for instance knowledge-sharing, communications and recruitment, that can be enhanced and made more efficient with generative AI. As the use of generic tools becomes more common, the way to keep a competitive advantage will be to develop specialised, in-house tools trained on significant quantities of proprietary data. Deloitte says that data-rich industries will integrate AI faster than those that rely on judgment. It says companies that build vertical-use cases and industry solutions will be able to add more value than those using general purpose models. As with platform models, such solutions could either be deployed in-house or provide new revenue streams from external licensing. All that said, ManMohan Sodhi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Bayes Business School, London, said in the FT report on supply chains that companies should first identify the problem or goal to which a technology is suited rather than adopt a technology then look for a use. With generative AI, Gartner advises that “end users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve”. The risk is that the necessity for human validation can offset any efficiencies gained.Modify or build?There is no straightforward answer to the question “modify or build?”. Tweaking the general model to create a niche application is at least not too costly. According to BCG, fine-tuning (providing a curated data set on top of the original training data) can be cost effective. The consultancy highlights a 2022 experiment in which Snorkel AI spent less than $8,000 to fine-tune a large language model to complete a legal classification. Designing questions to extract relevant information, a technique known as prompt engineering, is another way to refine outputs.Wooldridge stresses that while there is “a huge range of opportunities” in fine-tuning, it comes with “one big caveat: you have got no clue what data went into that”. An organisation cannot be certain that an off-the-shelf model reflects its values. Wooldridge says: “You ought to be very concerned about the data this thing has been fed on . . . it will have absorbed the whole of Reddit and the whole of Twitter and every toxic and vile opinion out there . . . so it’s not a complete solution, being able to fine-tune things.” An alternative to fine-tuning is to build a model based on proprietary data that is stored on-site. This can be more secure and flexible but Ward advises against it. The requirements for clean and legally compliant data that feed such a model are huge, he says. The data, resources and time needed make it an expensive endeavour, too. BCG estimates that costs could run into millions of dollars.Whatever the approach, companies have to be certain that any valuable proprietary data is protected and secure as well as clean and legally obtained. When it comes to output, Ward and Wooldridge agree that human oversight is essential.Generative AI is already producing a greater volume of more varied output than humans can achieve alone. Because of the risk of errors, however, human oversight and quality control are essential.Use cases• Consumer facingMarketing content and strategiesAmplifying or creating marketing content and strategies can work well where experimentation (or even AI hallucinations) is a creative bonus and where accuracy is not critical. Through fine-tuning based on a company’s content, marketing materials can be generated at scale in a tone that maintains brand and message consistency. These can also be easily translated into numerous languages. Such communications can be personalised by using customer data. Content can be text, image or video based.Strategies can be tested and tweaked for optimisation based on engagement and conversion data. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30 per cent of large corporations’ marketing messages will be generated by AI.Customer service and supportAI can provide chatbot responses to customer queries in natural language. Human interaction can come later for more complex queries. AI can also help with retrieval of client data and internal enterprise knowledge, both to anticipate queries and customise responses. Film and videoSarah Guo, the founder of Conviction, believes that video content is a noteworthy growth opportunity. “High quality video at lower cost means there will be more of it,” she says. “Any story you want to publish you could have it described by an avatar and in any language.” The cheapness and ease with which video can be created from text prompts will facilitate the creation of short films for anything from advertising to internal information dissemination. On the big screen, Gartner predicts that by 2030 we will see a blockbuster film that is 90 per cent created by AI.TeachingAI is excellent at explaining things. It will produce different iterations to find an answer that resonates most with a learner. It can then create personalised lesson plans to match the learner’s style as well as help with broader course design. Duolingo, the language learning app, uses AI to create responsive dialogues and explainers that enhance the learning experience.Search functions Searches that use AI can provide comprehensive answers on anything from product comparisons, which increasingly come with references to aid fact checking, to suggestions for travel itineraries and recipes. JournalismAI’s first forays into the creation of news content have been unsuccessful. Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, California, has pointed out the drawbacks of using generative AI for reporting. By ChatGPT’s own admission the technology cannot tell the difference between fact and fiction — it simply makes informed guesses about plausibility. In addition, there is a recency issue: large language models are trained to a cut-off date, so they are unlikely to be able to find current news. If given the facts with which to produce an article, AI could, however, do a credible job at simulating an author.• InternalHype about generative AI generally outruns implementation. Plenty of company managements talk about it but few offer evidence of having used it. Ultimately businesses may gain more value from experimenting with AI internally than in a consumer-facing area. For the early movers the goal is not simply efficiency gains or cost-cutting. A McKinsey survey found that organisations that employ generative AI were more likely to be using it to create new businesses and increase revenue streams. BrainstormingGenerative AI can create numerous suggestions based on limited input. Wooldridge says that in-person brainstorming “is a terribly difficult thing”. He says: “One of the cool things about this technology is it will brainstorm for you. You can feed it some rough drafts of ideas and then keep pressing a button. ‘Give me another idea’ and it maybe gives you 10 ideas, but you have one that grabs your attention.” Particularly in science, where marrying ideas and techniques across disciplines can take a leap of imagination, generative AI is likely to offer new insights.Product designGiven enough prompts, generative AI can design new products or personalise existing ones based on customer data. For example, Under Armour and Nike, the trainer/sneaker makers, have both experimented with AI for design. In time, generative AI may inspire or come up with novel products, processes or services ideas. Writing softwareAI can write a first draft of a code based on natural language prompts (“I’d like software that does this”) or edit and help to find bugs in current software. It can also run and test programs to ensure that they achieve the intended outcome or to optimise code. It is important to have realistic expectations. Wooldridge says: “My experience is that it’s very good writing short, routine programs at the moment”, which is “an awful lot of what programmers do”. He adds, however, that it is far from “superhuman” and that its output needs human oversight.Medical innovationsImportant breakthroughs in medicine are likely to be accelerated by AI. Already the technology can identify candidate molecules for therapies, a technique especially suited to proteins. There is also the potential for it to consider symptoms and find a connection with an illness that has been missed by a human. AI can identify the best candidates for drug trials and accurately match treatments to patients. The first AI-designed drugs are on their way.Internal knowledge banksLarge quantities of textual or numerical data can be collected, collated and summarised using AI, which will also translate the results at speed. Notable applications range from summarising manuals to locating corporate knowledge and creating knowledge repositories. Ward believes knowledge banks could be transformational for company intranets. “Most people that start at new companies, especially in a distributed workforce, don’t know who to reach out to ask for guidance — but this thing will know, based on what it knows about the inside of the company. “I think intranets, which have historically been horrific in terms of usability, are going to skyrocket in use because of this type of access.”Data analysisGiven any set of data, generative AI can create charts and find trends that a human analyst might not think to look for. Presentation creationA variety of AI programs can already put together slides based on a basic text brief and information gleaned from the internet, or from uploads of more complex documents or data.• Sector specificAcademic and research papersStudents’ use of ChatGPT to write university essays has been well documented. The intention is not necessarily malicious. Wooldridge has sympathy with those who simply wish to improve their writing. “We’d all love to read better-written scientific papers [given that] the average standard of scientific paper is dull beyond imagining,” he says.Papers so doctored, however, come with a health warning given the propensity for generative AI to make things up. “We know that this technology hallucinates and gets things wrong and it introduces that possibility. I’d rather have a paper where I was confident that I was listening to what the author said,” Wooldridge added. Legal professionAI can speedily analyse and condense screeds of documents from contracts to case law. As such it is likely to be of great value in the legal profession and it is already deployed by numerous firms. It can help with drafting, standardising and rationalising contracts, performing due diligence, drafting and compliance. In March PwC UK, the professional services group, entered a deal to develop generative AI with OpenAI’s Harvey. In a similar vein non-law firms can use generative AI to create requests for proposals and analyse which contracts and services generate the most revenue. Note though that using AI to create a legal case without checking is generally regarded as a bad idea.  FinanceGenerative AI is already being deployed for financial analysis. Guo mentions a company that has built an app to understand the earnings reports, interviews and stock exchange filings of competitors. By using generative AI “they can grasp a lot of information for their company’s use”, she says.  Guo expects that fund managers will also develop apps to screen for certain criteria in reports and accounts, or to analyse internal research memos and subsequent investment decisions. This would help them to find new companies and replicate previous successes. For internal use, generative AI can extract and summarise information from documents, helping with “non-standardised book-keeping”. • DrawbacksProne to errorsWhile generative AI programs have advanced rapidly and results from ChatGPT4 have already surpassed those from the initial release, the content that large language models are designed to produce is what is statistically probable rather than factually correct. Wooldridge says that while it is a good tool, companies would be “criminally negligent” to let loose AI-generated software code without checking it. “That would be an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do, not because I think it would destroy the world but it might trash your employer’s hard drives,” he says. Reputational risk is also high. McKinsey’s survey finds that the proportion of companies that are aware of this is far higher than that trying to mitigate it.  Public perceptionIpsos data show that consumer distrust is high and rising but this may improve as use of the technology becomes more common. Data from Pew suggest that in industries where exposure is higher, the understanding is greater and anxiety is lower. Research from KPMG shows that the young, the university educated and managers generally hold more positive attitudes towards AI, as do those in emerging economies such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa, where the benefits are perceived to outweigh the risks. Skills obsolescenceOne side-effect of generative AI’s ease of use is that the skills required to develop technology more generally are likely to change. For instance the demand for quality control and human oversight of AI-generated content will grow, while that for humans who can originate content is likely to fall. The landscape is changing so quickly that even prompt engineers — the programmers who optimise questions to get the best response from foundation models — could soon be obsolete. In addition workers who currently help non-technical people understand computers will be redundant. Generative AI can of course help to devise retraining courses. Critical thinking will be an increasingly valuable tool.IP and copyright concernsThe issue of intellectual property will be increasingly important for “created content”, especially with generative AI being able to write or draw “in the style of”. Authors are ever more vocal about copyright infringement over the use of their works in the training data set. They also fear risks to their livelihood from the artificial generation of works. In September writers including Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and George RR Martin added their names to the list suing OpenAI for unauthorised use of their work. A five-month writers’ strike in Hollywood was resolved in September with a deal which included guidelines on the use of AI.Microsoft has sufficient confidence in its guardrails against any infringement that it has pledged to provide legal protection for users sued for copyright breach.MisuseAs well as the drawbacks above, generative AI has the potential for misuse. Wrongdoers can use it for anything from disinformation at the state level, including creating and spreading deepfakes, to honing phishing scams at an individual level. Actions that used to be limited by money or time are now achievable with generative AI. A UK parliamentary committee on large language models noted that the cost of election tampering had fallen from about $10mn to a few thousand dollars.Cyber and data security is increasingly problematic and Ward cautions that “there can be a lot of issues with letting this thing run around on your data”. Problems range from potential leakage of proprietary information to falling foul of privacy laws.Regulation may be one way to counter some of these aspects. Wooldridge says that even if governments establish some sort of authenticating body to ratify models, any tests they use must be credible, new each time . . . and something the machine will never read on the internet. Allowing Big Tech to self regulate is not a safe solution.What next?With such a new and fast developing technology it is almost impossible to anticipate what comes next. The generation that grows up with generative AI may devise entirely new uses for it, similar to the way in which the digital native generation has reimagined how and what can be sold via channels such as social media and YouTube. One thing is certain though: business managements will need to keep up with developments to know when and how they may be able to use generative AI. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

Since the public release in November 2022 of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s large language-based chatbot, the number of people who have experimented with generative AI has grown rapidly. In its first five days the platform had more than one million users.

Insider Intelligence, the research and insights provider, forecasts that by the end of 2023, 25 per cent of internet users in the US, nearly 80mn people, will deploy generative AI at least monthly, up from 8 per cent at the end of 2022. It says that proportion will rise to 33 per cent in 2024. Most people will experiment with AI in the office, Insider Intelligence says. Unlike many new technologies more users are aged 55 to 64 than aged 12 to 17 as usage is concentrated in the workplace.

The AI phenomenon is not limited to America. A Salesforce survey of 4,000 people in the US, UK, Australia and India found that half of them had used generative AI. India was the leader with nearly three-quarters of respondents having tried the technology. Since the public release, the functionality of generative AI models has improved. Their understanding, reproduction of natural language and accuracy are all better.

Christian Ward, the chief data officer of Yext, the digital experience platform, says the fact that generative AI can understand human language has helped. He says that when internet search evolved, users learnt to “speak keywords . . . bending their behaviour to computers”. With generative AI people no longer have to be tech-savvy despite its advanced technology. AI is “human-savvy” and allows us to communicate with it naturally, making it more accessible.

“It used to be that computer-savvy humans had an advantage,” Ward says. “Now that computers are human-savvy, that advantage is being democratised. That is absolutely one of the biggest breakthroughs we have seen in technology in a very long time.”

He adds that once search functions reach the point where we use them by speaking to them as if they are human, “that construct [opens up] in a way we’ve not experienced before”.

Commercial potential

Michael Wooldridge, a professor of computer science at Oxford university, calls 2023 a “watershed year” for generative AI. He says the technology will be as transformative as the microprocessor, which made possible the personal computer, the web and smartphones. While those took months or years to catch on, the pace of development of generative AI is exceptional and it is hard to envisage its full effect.

Despite the technology’s youth it has already penetrated the commercial sphere. Estimates of the value it could add to the global economy vary from the 7 per cent of gross domestic product ($7tn) over 10 years predicted by Joseph Briggs, a Goldman Sachs economist to the $2.6tn to $4.4tn a year forecast by McKinsey’s (as a comparison UK GDP in 2022 was $2.7tn). Banking, life sciences and high tech could be the sectors that experience the greatest gains. Marketing, sales and customer experience will all be profoundly affected.

AI’s use of natural language means that its large language-based versions are especially well suited to creative endeavours. Today’s tools can help to produce text, audio, video, music, code, images and design. For instance, based on models that draw on troves of online data, generative AI has sufficient grasp of the variety of directions in which a sentence can go that it appears to be able to create entirely original work an infinite number of times.

Besides the written word, generative AI will create images from textual descriptions. These are more realistic than thought possible and can even incorporate 3D perspective and shadows. In audio and music the potential for new work that features existing artists — without their involvement — is well documented. AI-generated output has led to copyright concerns but then, given allegations of plagiarism especially in the music industry, there is doubt that humans create original work every time.

Arguably the applications for generative AI are greater in the creative field than in science (think research and engineering) where accuracy and reliability are more critical. This upends the expectation of a few years ago when machines were slated to add most value in heavy or rote tasks. It had been predicted that they would augment humans’ physical capabilities or analyse data at greater speeds than we could ever process. Creativity was expected to remain the preserve of humans: some people said it was the defining essence of what it meant to be human.

With its unexpected creative capability, generative AI can take on jobs once considered untouchable by technology. Goldman Sachs estimates that a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe could be automated by generative AI. At the upper end of its potential, more than 40 per cent of tasks in administration and the legal profession could be automated. This compares with less than one-tenth of tasks in physically intensive professions such as construction and maintenance.

Who is in the field?

In its analysis of the generative AI market, Acumen Research and Consulting lists D-ID, Genie AI and Rephrase.ai among the leading players, together with more recognisable names such as Amazon Web Services, Adobe, Google, IBM and Microsoft. Besides these heavyweights, applications have mushroomed to serve specific industries such as marketing or to perfect functions including video or audio generation.

In the chatbot arena ChatGPT and Bing Chat, both based on OpenAI’s large language models, compete with Google Bard. Although the technology is relatively new it has spawned lots of applications in the creative industries. For instance there are tools to supercharge communications and marketing. These include Jasper and Signum.ai, which itself provides a list of other players such as Phrasee and Clarifai.

CB Insights has listed more than 360 companies that specialise in generative AI and that number will only grow. The market intelligence provider says that in the first half of 2023 investment into generative AI start-ups went up 5-fold, from the $2.5bn invested for all of 2022 to $14bn. Even excluding the $10bn raised by OpenAI, the inflows are still considerable, as is the start-up activity. Conviction, a new AI venture capital firm, received more than 1,000 applications for 13 places on Embed, its start-up accelerator programme that began in early September.

Get with the strategy

Even though it is early days for generative AI, BCG, the consulting group, believes that “to be an industry leader in five years, you need a clear and compelling generative AI strategy today”.

This is no exaggeration. Already, there are universal corporate functions, for instance knowledge-sharing, communications and recruitment, that can be enhanced and made more efficient with generative AI. As the use of generic tools becomes more common, the way to keep a competitive advantage will be to develop specialised, in-house tools trained on significant quantities of proprietary data.

Deloitte says that data-rich industries will integrate AI faster than those that rely on judgment. It says companies that build vertical-use cases and industry solutions will be able to add more value than those using general purpose models. As with platform models, such solutions could either be deployed in-house or provide new revenue streams from external licensing.

All that said, ManMohan Sodhi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Bayes Business School, London, said in the FT report on supply chains that companies should first identify the problem or goal to which a technology is suited rather than adopt a technology then look for a use. With generative AI, Gartner advises that “end users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve”. The risk is that the necessity for human validation can offset any efficiencies gained.

Modify or build?

There is no straightforward answer to the question “modify or build?”. Tweaking the general model to create a niche application is at least not too costly. According to BCG, fine-tuning (providing a curated data set on top of the original training data) can be cost effective. The consultancy highlights a 2022 experiment in which Snorkel AI spent less than $8,000 to fine-tune a large language model to complete a legal classification. Designing questions to extract relevant information, a technique known as prompt engineering, is another way to refine outputs.

Wooldridge stresses that while there is “a huge range of opportunities” in fine-tuning, it comes with “one big caveat: you have got no clue what data went into that”. An organisation cannot be certain that an off-the-shelf model reflects its values. Wooldridge says: “You ought to be very concerned about the data this thing has been fed on . . . it will have absorbed the whole of Reddit and the whole of Twitter and every toxic and vile opinion out there . . . so it’s not a complete solution, being able to fine-tune things.”

An alternative to fine-tuning is to build a model based on proprietary data that is stored on-site. This can be more secure and flexible but Ward advises against it. The requirements for clean and legally compliant data that feed such a model are huge, he says. The data, resources and time needed make it an expensive endeavour, too. BCG estimates that costs could run into millions of dollars.

Whatever the approach, companies have to be certain that any valuable proprietary data is protected and secure as well as clean and legally obtained. When it comes to output, Ward and Wooldridge agree that human oversight is essential.

Generative AI is already producing a greater volume of more varied output than humans can achieve alone. Because of the risk of errors, however, human oversight and quality control are essential.

• Consumer facing

Amplifying or creating marketing content and strategies can work well where experimentation (or even AI hallucinations) is a creative bonus and where accuracy is not critical.

Through fine-tuning based on a company’s content, marketing materials can be generated at scale in a tone that maintains brand and message consistency. These can also be easily translated into numerous languages. Such communications can be personalised by using customer data. Content can be text, image or video based.

Strategies can be tested and tweaked for optimisation based on engagement and conversion data. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30 per cent of large corporations’ marketing messages will be generated by AI.

AI can provide chatbot responses to customer queries in natural language. Human interaction can come later for more complex queries. AI can also help with retrieval of client data and internal enterprise knowledge, both to anticipate queries and customise responses.

Sarah Guo, the founder of Conviction, believes that video content is a noteworthy growth opportunity. “High quality video at lower cost means there will be more of it,” she says. “Any story you want to publish you could have it described by an avatar and in any language.”

The cheapness and ease with which video can be created from text prompts will facilitate the creation of short films for anything from advertising to internal information dissemination. On the big screen, Gartner predicts that by 2030 we will see a blockbuster film that is 90 per cent created by AI.

AI is excellent at explaining things. It will produce different iterations to find an answer that resonates most with a learner. It can then create personalised lesson plans to match the learner’s style as well as help with broader course design. Duolingo, the language learning app, uses AI to create responsive dialogues and explainers that enhance the learning experience.

Searches that use AI can provide comprehensive answers on anything from product comparisons, which increasingly come with references to aid fact checking, to suggestions for travel itineraries and recipes.

AI’s first forays into the creation of news content have been unsuccessful.

Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, California, has pointed out the drawbacks of using generative AI for reporting.

By ChatGPT’s own admission the technology cannot tell the difference between fact and fiction — it simply makes informed guesses about plausibility. In addition, there is a recency issue: large language models are trained to a cut-off date, so they are unlikely to be able to find current news. If given the facts with which to produce an article, AI could, however, do a credible job at simulating an author.

• Internal

Hype about generative AI generally outruns implementation. Plenty of company managements talk about it but few offer evidence of having used it. Ultimately businesses may gain more value from experimenting with AI internally than in a consumer-facing area.

For the early movers the goal is not simply efficiency gains or cost-cutting. A McKinsey survey found that organisations that employ generative AI were more likely to be using it to create new businesses and increase revenue streams.

Generative AI can create numerous suggestions based on limited input. Wooldridge says that in-person brainstorming “is a terribly difficult thing”.

He says: “One of the cool things about this technology is it will brainstorm for you. You can feed it some rough drafts of ideas and then keep pressing a button. ‘Give me another idea’ and it maybe gives you 10 ideas, but you have one that grabs your attention.”

Particularly in science, where marrying ideas and techniques across disciplines can take a leap of imagination, generative AI is likely to offer new insights.

Given enough prompts, generative AI can design new products or personalise existing ones based on customer data. For example, Under Armour and Nike, the trainer/sneaker makers, have both experimented with AI for design. In time, generative AI may inspire or come up with novel products, processes or services ideas.

AI can write a first draft of a code based on natural language prompts (“I’d like software that does this”) or edit and help to find bugs in current software. It can also run and test programs to ensure that they achieve the intended outcome or to optimise code.

AI can identify the best candidates for drug trials and accurately match treatments to patients. The first AI-designed drugs are on their way.

Large quantities of textual or numerical data can be collected, collated and summarised using AI, which will also translate the results at speed. Notable applications range from summarising manuals to locating corporate knowledge and creating knowledge repositories.

Ward believes knowledge banks could be transformational for company intranets. “Most people that start at new companies, especially in a distributed workforce, don’t know who to reach out to ask for guidance — but this thing will know, based on what it knows about the inside of the company.

“I think intranets, which have historically been horrific in terms of usability, are going to skyrocket in use because of this type of access.”

Given any set of data, generative AI can create charts and find trends that a human analyst might not think to look for.

A variety of AI programs can already put together slides based on a basic text brief and information gleaned from the internet, or from uploads of more complex documents or data.

• Sector specific

Students’ use of ChatGPT to write university essays has been well documented. The intention is not necessarily malicious. Wooldridge has sympathy with those who simply wish to improve their writing. “We’d all love to read better-written scientific papers [given that] the average standard of scientific paper is dull beyond imagining,” he says.

Papers so doctored, however, come with a health warning given the propensity for generative AI to make things up. “We know that this technology hallucinates and gets things wrong and it introduces that possibility. I’d rather have a paper where I was confident that I was listening to what the author said,” Wooldridge added.

AI can speedily analyse and condense screeds of documents from contracts to case law. As such it is likely to be of great value in the legal profession and it is already deployed by numerous firms. It can help with drafting, standardising and rationalising contracts, performing due diligence, drafting and compliance.

In March PwC UK, the professional services group, entered a deal to develop generative AI with OpenAI’s Harvey.

Authors are ever more vocal about copyright infringement over the use of their works in the training data set. They also fear risks to their livelihood from the artificial generation of works. In September writers including Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and George RR Martin added their names to the list suing OpenAI for unauthorised use of their work. A five-month writers’ strike in Hollywood was resolved in September with a deal which included guidelines on the use of AI.

Microsoft has sufficient confidence in its guardrails against any infringement that it has pledged to provide legal protection for users sued for copyright breach.

As well as the drawbacks above, generative AI has the potential for misuse. Wrongdoers can use it for anything from disinformation at the state level, including creating and spreading deepfakes, to honing phishing scams at an individual level. Actions that used to be limited by money or time are now achievable with generative AI. A UK parliamentary committee on large language models noted that the cost of election tampering had fallen from about $10mn to a few thousand dollars.

Cyber and data security is increasingly problematic and Ward cautions that “there can be a lot of issues with letting this thing run around on your data”. Problems range from potential leakage of proprietary information to falling foul of privacy laws.

Regulation may be one way to counter some of these aspects. Wooldridge says that even if governments establish some sort of authenticating body to ratify models, any tests they use must be credible, new each time . . . and something the machine will never read on the internet. Allowing Big Tech to self regulate is not a safe solution.

With such a new and fast developing technology it is almost impossible to anticipate what comes next. The generation that grows up with generative AI may devise entirely new uses for it, similar to the way in which the digital native generation has reimagined how and what can be sold via channels such as social media and YouTube.

One thing is certain though: business managements will need to keep up with developments to know when and how they may be able to use generative AI.",3695.0,"{'@type': 'Organization', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'Financial Times', 'legalName': 'The Financial Times Ltd.', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://im.ft-static.com/m/img/masthead_main.jpg', 'width': 435, 'height': 36}, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.twitter.com/FT', 'https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/FinancialTimesVideos', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Companies', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/companies'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Technology', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/technology'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Artificial intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence'}]",Financial Times,FT.com,http://www.ft.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>‘The use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in UK actuarial work’ explores the growing importance of AI/ML in actuarial work. It examines how these techniques are being used and where, and what risks are arising from this.</p>

<p>The report was written by GAD actuaries Sam Davies and Chris Paterson, and Senior Analyst Sam Kinshuck, supported by a wider team in GAD.</p>

<p>The research was carried out in the first 6 months of 2023 and first involved an online survey completed by over 100 respondents across different fields. This was followed by more in-depth interviews with 37 interviewees.</p>

<h2 id=""survey-results"">Survey results</h2>

<p>The survey results indicated that the largest area of use of AI/ML techniques in UK actuarial work cover a wide range of applications within General Insurance pricing, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining claims risk for policyholders</li>
  <li>forecasting price-elasticity of demand for policyholder groups</li>
  <li>informing the ‘front-end’ process for customers and policyholders</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as ‘traditional’ actuarial fields of Pensions, General Insurance, Life Insurance and Finance &amp; Investment, the research also showed AI/ML being used by actuaries who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>analyse the impact of public health interventions</li>
  <li>assist pharmaceutical companies with patient profiling</li>
  <li>develop long term economic projections</li>
</ul>

<p>The research indicated that they apply more advanced techniques to more diverse use cases.</p>

<p>Survey results indicated the use of AI/ML techniques in actuarial work was limited but increasing rapidly.</p>

<p>Researchers found that during the 6 months duration of the survey, awareness of ChatGPT (a Large Language Model, or ‘LLM’, developed by OpenAI) grew significantly. Initial responses did not mention it, however from March to June 2023 it was raised by almost all interviewees as a discussion topic.</p>

<p>The survey responses indicated that some organisations were using LLMs in a variety of ways including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping to aid efficiency of some processes</li>
  <li>to assist programming</li>
  <li>horizon-scanning</li>
  <li>summarising large volumes of text</li>
  <li>developing bespoke in-house LLMs to build financial models</li>
</ul>

<p>Sam Davies, one of the report’s authors said: “Our report highlights the established and growing importance of AI/ML in UK actuarial work.</p>

Generative AI: Connecting insight to (inter)action 














Over the past decade, AI has enabled banks to derive insights from vast information troves and the value of analytics has shifted from historical insight to prediction, leading to better decisions.




 

Generative AI is the latest evolution in the AI paradigm shift from automation to intelligence to creation and is bridging the gap between insight and action.
When generative AI systems and large language models (LLMs) can both draw insight from large data sets, as well as understand, interpret, and generate human language, the time and effort required to act on insights is drastically shortened. And with LLMs we can unlock previously impracticable insights and manage the documentation to boot.
With this combination of forward insight and creative capabilities, the financial services sector is ripe for novel innovation, from customer services improvements through to credit risk understanding. A recent report on AI in the finance sector by The Alan Turing Institute found that: “AI has been used only for implementing ‘small benefits' such as cost reduction and process optimisation.” Now with generative AI, we can connect insight to action and even to interaction leading to highly personalised financial advice and much improved customer experience.
One example is compliance with Consumer Duty regulations, which requires lenders to ensure consumer understanding. This can be challenging for automated and self-service processes, but generative AI can help by creating materials for different levels of understanding and language comprehension, improving customer care and connecting analytics to conversational capabilities.
Generative AI has been shown to improve outcomes on a range of high-value tasks, for example producing drafts for internal and external financial reporting, which will save considerable time during month and quarter end. It could also be used to automate activities like reconciliations, journal entries, and financial consolidation. The diagram below from a recent CGI article shows the varying impact of AI tools across many financial services operational areas.

More generally, a recent Harvard study on management consultants showed that support in the form of ChatGPT raised all workers to the top tiers of performance. A Cornell University study on potential labour market impacts, found broad applicability of generative AI to work tasks. Starting off, about 80% of people could do 10% of their tasks better and or faster; but once LLMs are integrated in the tools we use daily, everyone will eventually see half their work tasks supported by AI.
Even though AI has much to contribute, it’s important to understand its shortcomings. Human oversight and collaboration are still essential for ensuring the quality and appropriateness of generated responses, but that work is offset by the efficiencies gained. As Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCunn said: “Large language models are prone to hallucinations, and have no concept of how the world works, no capacity to plan, and no ability to complete tasks.” Financial institutions should also have a clear and well-defined policy for the use of LLMs outlining the risks and benefits of using them, as well as the steps that will be taken to mitigate the risks.
As generative AI technology continues to develop, we can expect to see it being used in even more innovative ways. We do however need to acknowledge the current limitations and consider how we could use a multi-model approach to create the most value. Using a mix of AI, financial institutions can gain access to insights to help them take action to better manage risk, optimise operations, and gain operating savings - all while improving both customer and employee experience.

 Today (Oct. 26) the employment site published a report evaluating the jobs most exposed to (or impacted by) generative AI—and how artificial intelligence could change, rather than kill, careers. The report collected over 15 million job postings to evaluate the skills that employers commonly include—more than 2,000 in total—along with which could be performed or assisted by ChatGPT.


Among the findings: Women are marginally more exposed to generative AI than men. Of racial and ethnic groups,  Asian American and Pacific Islanders have the highest exposure to generative AI, while Hispanics  are least exposed. 

That brings up an important distinction: Indeed’s study stresses that race and gender aren’t the main drivers of AI exposure; instead, it’s the occupations that certain demographics tend to be concentrated in that impact these groups. Women are slightly more likely to see AI change their jobs, for example, because they’re more likely to be employed in high-exposure industries like education and administration. And Asian American and Pacific Islanders tend to work in sectors with the highest exposure to generative AI, like mathematics and computer science, as Hispanics are represented in sectors with the least exposure.

There are differences, too, when it comes down to job title or location. Managers have a higher exposure to AI than non-managers, and remote jobs are more exposed than ones on an in-person or hybrid schedule. And in contrast to some narratives, the report posits that jobs that usually require physical skills are least affected by artificial intelligence.

Why generative AI may not be coming for your job

Stahle said the study’s purpose is to see every job where generative AI could possibly be used. Even in physical jobs—say, the warehouse runner or the classroom custodian—might need ChatGPT for email communications. But he’s skeptical that generative AI is coming for any job, even in roles that face automation like grocery store checkouts and driverless cars.


“There are still the human aspects in the jobs that are hard to replicate by Gen AI, or it’s hard to get people to accept and use,” said Stahle. “We’re so early in this Gen AI movement that it’s hard to know what the overall impact would be. That’s why we’re measuring by exposure rather than the nitty-gritty trends.” 

It’s worth adding that only 0.05% of the millions of Indeed job postings this August asked for generative AI skills. 1.7% of the job postings asked for broader technological skills from fields like machine learning or data science. Those are pretty small numbers, Stahle said.

But while the shares remain small, Stale said, it’s worth picking up experience with AI applications like ChatGPT now—because every industry will eventually use them in some way. 

“It’s not likely that people are going to lose their jobs. What is more likely is that people will be displaced by people who have these AI tool skillsets,” said Stahle. “Job seekers of all ages and groups should look to embrace these technologies—it can  unlock the ability to move forward and unleash the potential workers can have.”

But employees who love them are finding ways to discreetly backchannel.,N/A,N/A,"The employees secretly using AI at work24 October 2023ShareAlex ChristianFeatures correspondentShareWoman with green glassesSome employers are either tacitly or outright banning access to generative AI tools like ChatGPT. But employees who love them are finding ways to discreetly backchannel.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, companies have scrambled to keep its workplace use under control.Many organisations are concerned their data will be leaked – not only unintentionally training OpenAI algorithms with sensitive information, but also potentially surfacing corporate secrets to competitors' prompts, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US.Yet many workers love the technology, and have come to desire, even depend on it.""These are practical tools that make life easier, such as content aggregation – rather than look through several sources to find an obscure organisational policy, ChatGPT can provide a useful first draft in moments,"" says Bryan Hancock, partner at McKinsey & Co, based in Washington, DC. ""They can also aid with technical tasks, like coding, and complete routine tasks that lighten employees' cognitive load and schedules."" Berlin-based business consultant Matt and his colleague were among the first at their workplace to discover ChatGPT, mere weeks after its release. He says the chatbot transformed their workdays overnight. ""It was like discovering a video game cheat,"" says Matt. ""I asked a really technical question from my PhD thesis, and it provided an answer that no one would be able to find without consulting people with very specific expertise. I knew it would be a game changer.""Day-to-day tasks in his fast-paced environment – such as researching scientific topics, gathering sources and producing thorough presentations to clients – suddenly became a breeze. The only catch: Matt and his colleague had to keep their use of ChatGPT a closely guarded secret. They accessed the tool covertly, mostly on working-from-home days. ""We had a significant competitive advantage against our colleagues – our output was so much faster and they couldn't comprehend how. Our manager was very impressed and spoke about our performance with senior management,"" he says.AlamyWorkers are finding ways to access the technology in secret, whether by simply blocking their screens from view or employing higher-tech solutions (Credit: Alamy)Whether the technology is explicitly banned, highly frowned upon or giving some workers a covert leg up, some employees are searching for ways to keep using generative AI tools discreetly. The technology is increasingly becoming an employee backchannel: in a February 2023 study by professional social network Fishbowl, 68% of 5,067 respondents who used AI at work said they don't disclose usage to their bosses.Even in instances without workplace bans, employees may still want to keep their use of AI hidden, or at least guarded, from peers. ""We don't have norms established around AI yet – it can initially look like you're conceding you're not actually that good at your job if the machine is doing many of your tasks,"" says Johnson. ""It's natural that people would want to conceal that.""As a result, forums are popping up for workers to swap strategies for keeping a low profile. In communities like Reddit, many people seek methods of secretly circumventing workplace bans, either through high-tech solutions (integrating ChatGPT into a native app disguised as a workplace tool) or rudimentary ones to obscure usage (adding a privacy screen, or discreetly accessing the technology on their personal phone at their desk).And an increasing number of workers who've come to depend on AI may have to start looking for ways to avoid attention. According to an August 2023 BlackBerry survey of 2,000 global IT decision makers, 75% are currently considering or implementing bans on ChatGPT and other generative AI applications in the workplace, with 61% saying the measures are intended to be long-term or permanent.While these bans may help companies keep sensitive information out of the wrong hands, Hancock says keeping generative AI away from workers, particularly on a longer-term basis, can backfire. ""AI tools are set to become part of the employee experience, so restricting access to them without providing a vision of when and how they'll be adopted – such as following the introduction of guardrails – could create frustration,"" he says. ""And that could lead to folks thinking of working somewhere with access to the tools they need."" As for Matt, he's found a workaround to keep a step ahead. He and his colleague have begun covertly using the search engine platform Perplexity. Like ChatGPT, it's a generative AI tool that returns complex written answers to basic prompts in an instant. Matt likes Perplexity even more than ChatGPT: it features real-time information and cites sources that can be quickly checked, ideal when his presentations require in-depth, up-to-date knowledge. He queries it hundreds of times a day on his work laptop, often working remotely, and uses it more than Google.He hopes he can keep using his latest AI tool in secret, for as long as possible.

October 25, 2023 · 6 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  October 25, 2023 · 6 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Generative AI is one of the biggest talking points today. It promises to transform how work is done across multiple sectors, and legal work is a particularly rich area of opportunity.  Many firms and legal departments are already switched on to Generative AI, and there is no avoiding it. We spoke to Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute about the potential and pitfalls of the technology, and to separate fact from fiction – including a question about notorious generative AI ‘hallucinations’.  Zach Warren leads technology and innovation content for the Thomson Reuters Institute. Zach has been writing and speaking on tech and innovation for more than a decade, and with Thomson Reuters, charts the future of professional services industries, including legal, tax, and risk & fraud, through writing, podcasts, speaking engagements, and more. Zach was also the lead author of TRI’s Generative AI in the Law Firm Report, among other technology-centric reports. Before coming to Thomson Reuters, Zach was the editor-in-chief of ALM’s Legaltech News and featured on Law.com, The American Lawyer and ALM events such as Legalweek. Jump to:How has Generative AI landed in legal so far? Who should be overseeing the adoption of Generative AI?Can you describe some of the impacts it will have on legal practice?How does the cost of implementing generative AI in law firms compare to other technology investments commonly made in the legal industry?Will things really change for junior legal professionals?Can you explain what Generative AI hallucinations are?How should the legal industry approach Generative AI in the short term? How has Generative AI landed in legal so far? Warren: With surprising enthusiasm. Legal has something of a reputation for slow uptake of tech, which we’ve seen recently with the cautious adoption of cloud and some types of AI. That may be because lawyers and firms have preferred to do things the way they’ve always been done.   But with Generative AI it’s been a different story. Thomson Reuters conducted a survey only a few months after ChatGPT was launched, and it found that firms were already playing around with it. Interestingly, 82% of survey respondents said Generative AI could be used for legal tasks, and 51% said it should be used. However, that’s on a hypothetical level – at the time in April, only 3% had actually adopted Generative AI. And even now, the vast majority of legal professionals are in “wait and see” mode.  Who should be overseeing the adoption of Generative AI? Warren: At the moment it’s primarily CIOs, IT directors, and CTOs who have been tasked to be at the forefront of technology adoption. But Generative AI will be the most transformative tech in legal, so partners and managing partners should be learning more about it now.  In fact, everyone should have a stake in it to some extent, because Generative AI is intended to be democratized – so we will see it being used in everything from onboarding new employees to day-to-day transactional work.  Can you describe some of the impacts it will have on legal practice? Warren: Speed, efficiency, consistency in research, document reviews, and many repetitive tasks are some of the many promised benefits. However, there is uncertainty around who realizes the value of Generative AI. One of the biggest questions for partners will be, ‘What is chargeable now?’ Firms bill in six-minute increments, which requires great transparency – will clients insist firms cut billable hours now that work can be done much faster with Generative AI, or even done by the clients themselves? Going back to the survey I mentioned, 80% of corporate clients actually want their firms to use Generative AI – but they also want firms to add value and skills above and beyond the tech. So, firms will really need to prove the value that they’re providing in this new era, which puts the emphasis on more experienced lawyers.  How does the cost of implementing generative AI in law firms compare to other technology investments commonly made in the legal industry? Warren: It’s a bit higher right now, but that’s for generative AI across the board. Generative AI requires a lot of data to work, which means a lot of processing power to run the searches. There just aren’t enough servers to make generative AI as widespread as the technology deserves right now, but there are a lot of smart people working on that problem.  Will things really change for junior legal professionals? Warren: Absolutely. Manual work like research and document or contract drafting – obvious use cases for Generative AI – is typically the domain of first- and second-year associates. I heard a good quote recently: “All the writing you learn in law school will become editing”.  That’s because Generative AI is so good at producing first drafts. We’re seeing lots of interest in firms and departments hiring prompt engineers – and this is a skill which could soon become part of every new lawyer’s training.   Can you explain what Generative AI hallucinations are? Warren: This is one of the biggest concerns surrounding the technology currently. Hallucinations are basically errors that pop up in the output of Generative AI, presented as fact, and which it can’t recognize as wrong. The reason for this is that Generative AI is not actually “intelligent” – it predicts the next possible word in a sentence, giving the most likely answer based on previous results.  Even OpenAI’s GPT-4 is around 85-90% factually accurate on multiple choice questions – that level of accuracy is obviously not where you want to be in legal. However, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models can take feedback about the accuracy of answers and fold that back in, so things could improve quickly.  How should the legal industry approach Generative AI in the short term? Warren: At the moment, Generative AI – particularly public, open-source tools – is not a good fit beyond general question-and-answer tasks. Firms and departments need to create guidelines around proper usage. And the applications of Generative AI should for now be restricted to internal work, or work where you can afford to be wrong – and someone always needs to check the output. For the immediate future, most usage of Generative AI will be through new features baked into pre-existing tools from trusted technology providers. However, some of the very biggest firms are hiring data scientists and developing their own knowledge models. We’re going to see a hybrid of these approaches, with legal technology vendors keeping in-house data behind a wall but checking it against publicly available datasets. This means the results will be both accurate and up to date.   Zach Warren spoke on a recent webcast in which generative AI and its impact on legal was discussed in even greater detail.

Spiceworks delves into the latest findings from Aberdeen Strategy & Research’s Generative AI study completed in March 2023.
The study delves into opinions on advanced generative AI tools such as ChatGPT broken down across three age groups. 

About 65% of users believe AI tools will replace traditional web search engines as the faster alternative for online search, according to the Aberdeen Generative AI study conducted in March 2023 by Aberdeen Strategy & ResearchOpens a new window .
“In a likely future where more people use chatbots to find answers, there will likely be less of a need to click through to ad-supported websites for more information,” noted Peter Tsai, the head of technology insights at Spiceworks Ziff Davis (Aberdeen is owned by Spiceworks’ parent company Ziff Davis).
“I don’t think anyone will miss wading through half a dozen distracting ads and  autoplay videos while scrolling past someone’s overly SEO-optimized life story just to find a recipe for mac and cheese at the bottom of a long page. Currently, with a chatbot, you simply ask your question, then a recipe and ingredients list comes back within seconds.”
It has been over a year since OpenAI released the text-to-image tool DALL E and more than six months since the AI chatbot, ChatGPT, amazed audiences with quick and accurate responses. The latter, in particular, has taken netizens by storm, garnering over one million users in just five days and over 100 million users in two months of launch. For comparison, TikTok took nine months, Instagram 30 months, and Netflix 10 years.
In fact, 59% of respondents from the Aberdeen study had extensively or casually used generative AI tools as of March 2023. Besides online search, 41% of respondents believe AI tools will help create long-form documents as soon as two years from now, while 58% said generative-AI-based long-form document creation would take five years.
Beyond searches and document creation, AI is also expected in content creation, streamlining business processes, improving customer experience, concocting a symphony or at least a jingle (with MusicLM), graphics and illustrations (with Midjourney), and more.
“There are many intriguing aspects of this technological future that deserve further thought and comment,” noted Christopher D. Manning, a Thomas M. Siebel professor in machine learning at the School of Engineering; professor of linguistics and computer science at Stanford University; director of Stanford AI Lab; and associate director of Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence or Stanford HAI.
“We’re still in the early days of figuring out what new models of normal business practice are and aren’t possible. In nearly all cases, the AI system will help humans to get work done. As such, it continues the story of new technologies and automation making things easier and improving quality of life.”
And if that’s not enough, 74% of power users (i.e., those with advanced computing skills) and 56% of casual users who responded to the Aberdeen Generative AI study believe that the development of advanced AI will be as important as the creation of the internet. Clearly, generative AI tools are a winner, despite technologists calling for a cessation of unchecked development of advanced AI capabilities.
Fei-Fei Li, Sequoia Capital professor in the Computer Science Department; Denning co-director of Stanford HAI, noted, “The progress in a machine’s capability to generate content is very exciting, as is the potential to explore AI’s ability to see what humans are not able. But we need to be attentive to howthese capabilities will disrupt our everyday lives, our communities, and our role as world citizens.”

More than that, corporations are now engaged in a rat race to upend one another to gain a competitive edge. Generative AI can augment operations for some businesses and professions, while some can be automated. For others, generative AI is an existential threat.
While AI’s measurable impact is yet to be gauged on the operations, users and potential customers may not necessarily jump the gun and adopt AI-powered products. According to Aberdeen’s findings, only 20% of respondents are more likely to use an advanced AI-powered product.
On the other hand, unsure or neutral in their likelihood of 21% of respondents are less likely, and as much as 59% of respondents are unsure or neutral in their likelihood of using said products.
However, the numbers vary across different age groups. A higher number of millennial professionals and the younger generation are more likely to use products with advanced AI compared to Gen X and baby boomer professionals.

Similarly, millennial professionals are more likely to pay for generative AI for professional use compared to Gen X and baby boomers.
The Aberdeen Generative AI study quantifies several such opinions that help professionals in the three aforementioned age groups. Let us look at what these are.

What Millenials, Gen Xers, and Baby Boomers Think of AI
The three generations of professionals were asked about the potential impact of AI on work.

62% of millennials and younger generation professionals said they expect the impact of AI on work to be positive, 28% said they’re neutral or don’t know, while 10% said they expect it to be negative.
45% of Gen Xers are positive, 35% are neutral or don’t know, and 19% expect negative effects.
An even low 38% of baby boomers are optimistic about AI in work, 33% are neutral, whole 29% harbor negative opinions about the tech.

Here’s how the numbers look on the prospects of the future of AI by generations:




Sentiment on the Future of AI

Hopeful
Not Sure
Worried


Millennials and Younger
43%
17%

40%




Gen X

17%
18%
43%


Baby Boomers
40%
24%

49%




Consequently, millennials and younger generations leverage generative AI in more business use cases than their peers. For instance, more millennials (in percentage terms) are using AI to search for information online than Gen X and baby boomers combined.
Some other business tasks millennials are fulfilling through AI are email creation and response, data processing and analysis, writing long-form documents, troubleshooting complex problems, and more.

“These technologies have the potential to speed up the rate of innovation itself by facilitating invention, design, and creativity. Thus they may not only increase the level of productivity but also accelerate its rate of change,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki professor at Stanford HAI; director of Stanford Digital Economy Lab, wrote.
As such, Li called on for a prudent approach to developing AI by assessing people’s needs first.

Fashion is a form of self-expression. Whether it’s Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showing up in a hoodie for a meeting to signal he doesn’t need to dress up, someone wearing a bright red blazer to stand out from a sea of gray jackets at a job interview, or a teenager picking out a trendy outfit to wear to school to boost their popularity, what someone wears says a lot about who they are and how they want to be seen.
But how does the retail industry predict what trends will be popular ahead of the start of the season?
It turns out many of today’s leading fast-fashion companies, like H&M and Zara, are turning to artificial intelligence to help them predict tomorrow’s trends to stay ahead of the curve, track inventory levels, analyze historical data, and understand what customer demand will look like in the future. AI technologies and AI-powered solutions are becoming increasingly popular as a method for understanding sales data and even cutting down on operational costs.
What Is Fast Fashion and the Fast Fashion Supply Chain?

If you want the look for less, you want fast fashion. Examples of fast fashion include H&M, Zara, Old Navy, Urban Outfitters, Topshop, Mango, and Uniqlo. Fast fashion is, typically speaking, the trendy pieces of clothing and accessories that you can purchase inexpensively. 
The styles are often found from demand forecasting, market trends, and what’s recently been on the runways, and fast fashion companies then create cheaper alternatives.
“Inexpensive” is, of course, a relative term. Many fast fashion stores create pricing strategies that involve bargain-basement prices for clothing for younger shoppers seeking a look that won’t be in style beyond the season, as well as higher price point looks for shoppers who are looking for outfits that are still considered affordable by the middle class but are more professional looking or made from better materials.
The word “fast” comes into play because these of-the-moment looks are often ripped from the catwalks and from celebrity culture and then found in brick-and-mortar stores shortly thereafter. This means their production cycle is compressed as much as possible so brands can capitalize on trends before their customers declare them passé.
How Fast-Fashion Retail Industry Finds Trends

How can a retailer predict a trend if the very nature of a trend is that it’s a short-lived fad? In the past, fast fashion brands have looked at what high fashion designers are doing during Fashion Week and emulated their looks. As well, they’ve looked to see what celebrities are wearing and even what streetwear looks like in cities like Paris and London.
Fashion labels also look to history. By and large, fashion is cyclical. What goes around, comes around. ’90s kids could be found wearing ’60s and ’70s bell bottoms along with their baggy JNCOs, and now Millennials and Gen Y are rocking the slip dresses and combat boots of the ’90s. As such, the fashion industry looks to the 20-year rule for inspiration.
Social media trends 
They also look at current events. The hemline index theory proves that when the economy is booming, women’s skirts get shorter. Meanwhile, the lipstick effect suggests that when the economy slumps, women look to little luxuries like new lipstick to brighten up their styles.
With the rise of social media platforms like Instagram, influencers are posting their OOTD — outfit of the day. On the one hand, it allows the fashion industry to quickly capture trends through SEO and algorithms. On the other hand, it means trends may have shorter cycles, as everyone is looking for the next big thing instead of repeating looks. 
Today, though, the fast fashion industry has artificial intelligence at its disposal. Although customer behavior has changed when it comes to shopping, machine learning is helping companies understand customer sentiment and new patterns.
What Is Artificial Intelligence?

When a machine seems to have the uncanny ability to be able to make decisions, that’s essentially artificial intelligence at work.
At its broadest definition, artificial intelligence (AI) uses computer science to simulate human, or natural, intelligence in machines. Algorithms enable machines to problem solve. Not just that, the algorithms allow the machines to learn. An AI-powered system can accept user queries and provide instant responses, all while learning how to better respond and provide better solutions.
Along with these abilities, AI can perform automated planning and scheduling, support supply chain operations, and store data. AI algorithms can work quickly to determine patterns, solve problems, and predict future demand for retail companies. 
When it comes to AI in retail, it’s remarkable what this tech can do to exceed brand expectations, assist with inventory management, and better the customer experience as a whole.
How Fast Fashion Applies Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence tools, natural language processing, and computer vision are transforming supply chain management, customer experience, and more across the retail landscape.
There are a number of roles that AI can play in the supply chain. Chatbots could handle purchase requests, smart warehouses could deal with inventory management, and autonomous vehicles could help with shipping. It can optimize inventory levels and keep track of what’s available in stores, in warehouses, and currently in production.
AI technology can also analyze customer feedback and thus improve customer satisfaction, help with the returns process (and reduce it), and work through virtual assistants to partake in customer relations. 
For trend forecasting and demand forecasting
In 2019, a McKinsey survey found that most companies that are leveraging AI increased their revenue: “In supply-chain management, respondents often cite sales and demand forecasting and spend analytics as use cases that generate revenue.” 
In 2021, global AI in the retail industry was valued at USD $2,938.20 million. It’s expected to reach $17,086.54 million by 2028.
This demand forecasting, or predictive analytics, is used throughout the fashion supply chain.
In the past to predict demand, fast fashion had to gather insight from across the fashion world, taking into account the colors, patterns, materials, and cuts showcased on the runways in Paris, the streets of Berlin, the red carpet in Hollywood, and the dive bars of Brooklyn. 
It ran the risk of the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, in which a fashion buyer’s brain experiences selective attention and confirmation bias. Today, computers and AI in retail can gather and group information much more efficiently.
And more effectively: “In a recent Gallup study centered on predicting consumer demand, data was provided on NASDAQ, product and brand searches, underemployment, and standard-of-living indices. By combining these data sources, Gallup was able to create a predictive model that outperformed their client’s previous consumer demand model by more than 150%.”
This then allows stores to work out competitive prices and nail down the brand loyalty customers have for them. It’s also an interesting way to explore new revenue streams and figure out customer sentiment when they purchase online or in person.
How AI is used for analyzing customer data and understanding customer preferences
AI technologies are able to analyze customer data, which can provide a more detailed look at browsing behavior and even offer personalized recommendations to shoppers. Customer engagement is extremely important for sales and AI in retail is capable of improving the customer experience. AI algorithms can also store browsing and purchase history, as well as transaction data, which is useful for both parties.
AI tools are also brilliant in helping enhance customer service. It can liaise with the brand and customer, figure out the problem with the item, initiate an exchange or return, and then analyze customer feedback afterwards. The retail sector is often riddled with customer service questions and returns, especially in fast fashion, so having AI tools to handle the issues that arise can be game-changing. 
Another way this shows up in the retail industry for the consumer is directly while they’re shopping. Even the most mundane store fixtures have received AI upgrades. With the use of objects like smart shelves, customers simply scan barcodes to get suggested products or learn more about the items they’re interested in.
How AI used in automated inventory management
Using AI in retail inventory management is another way in which this technology comes into play.
Inventory management can be tricky, especially when massive quantities of clothing and accessories are being produced, shipped, and purchased. It’s also burdensome for small teams to tackle on their own.
AI-powered machines can automate repetitive tasks, optimize inventory levels, and keep track of what’s out of stock, what isn’t selling, and what’s continually selling out. Inventory management is often a beast, but with the right machine learning tools, it’s possible to streamline. 
How H&M Uses Artificial Intelligence to Predict Trends
The Swedish fashion empire H&M employs AI algorithms and more than 200 data scientists to predict and analyze trends. Its AI algorithms obtain fashion trend data by capturing information on search engines and blogs. This information informs everything from how much they buy, when they buy, and where it should be placed in its stores.
Importantly, retail AI not only forecasts new trends the company’s buyers should be aware of but also informs them of whether they should restock currently popular merchandise and if it will only be suiting one customer’s preferences or a whole segment. As Thomas has previously reported, H&M’s artificial intelligence therefore helps the company reduce waste and make more sustainable decisions.
Head of the H&M Club Samuel Holst said, “Knowing our customers — having this insight, knowing where, how and when they shop, knowing what they like — that is an important piece in how we will be able to predict trends.” 
In 2019, then-CEO Karl-Johan Persson reported that H&M’s venture into artificial intelligence had already helped the company predict trends. When companies like this are able to analyze customer behavior and purchasing habits alongside societal shifts, it’s easier to get trends right, increase customer loyalty, and boost revenue streams.

How Zara Uses Artificial Intelligence to Find Trends and Track Customer Satisfaction
Like its competitor, the Spanish fashion outfitter Zara has turned to artificial intelligence to further its goals. The company uses it in a number of ways, including employing AI robots to fetch requested orders for customers using its Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store (BOPIS) or Click and Collect options.
Unlike H&M, which relies heavily on outsourcing to speed its production, Zara’s use of outsourcing is minimal. As Thomas has previously reported, one of the advantages of this tactic is that “Zara controls everything from design to display to shipping, allowing it to gather valuable data at every stage. This data can then be analyzed to identify inefficiencies, pinpoint areas of success, and create accurate forecasting.” 
Having access to all of these prongs of a business, including historical sales data, insight into customer engagement, and how the supply chain operations are functioning, Zara can glean a lot from its AI software.
To further augment this, the company hired Tyco to install microchips into its clothing’s security tags so that they can identify where within the supply chain a particular style and size is located. This allows the company to have full visibility over the inventory it can sell, thereby informing its forecasting analytics.
Zara also has an initiative with Jetlore, a consumer behavior prediction platform that uses artificial intelligence. Founded by computer scientists from Stanford in 2011, the company was bought by PayPal in 2018. Crunchbase explains its use in fast fashion: 
“Jetlore’s AI-powered platform maps consumer behavior into structured predictive attributes, like size, color, fit, or style preferences, making it the only customer data platform for B2C businesses in the market. This structured data allows top tier retailers and large hospitality and media companies to optimize content and communication for the consumers, make better merchandising decisions, optimize search, and empower the next generation of customer service.”

AI Is Influencing Fashion, Inventory Management, and More
The irony is that artificial intelligence is doing more than just predicting trends. It’s also influencing them in the retail industry.
AI tracks shoppers’ behavior patterns online so it can offer a personalized shopping experience. Machine learning gathers data on what a shopper likes and when and how often they make certain purchases. While AI solutions are helpful in-store, online retailers are of course making the most of it, too.
Its predictive technology then allows it to anticipate a shopper’s needs and desires so it can offer them similar products. It even learns when online shoppers are more likely to be open to trying out a new brand.
In this way, leveraging AI in retail has many advantages. AI algorithms and AI-powered chatbots and software can be used to introduce shoppers to new brands and styles, push bulging inventory, and drive trends.

Join the industry boom and transform your career by learning ... [+] in-demand technical and non-technical skills.getty
A disruptive new industry has arrived on the scene...artificial intelligence. Or is it really new? AI has technically been in existence since the 1950s when it was discovered and coined, and we have been using it in some way or another for various technology-controlled aspects of our lives.


However, since the advent of ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been an unprecedented interest and excitement across multiple sectors that have been affected, in some ways comparable to technology booms in the past.

Millions of jobs have—and are predicted to be—created, with the McKinsey Global Institute forecasting the creation of up to 50 million new jobs across sectors globally by 2030. Upwork saw an over 1,000% increase in AI job postings in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, while demand for roles mentioning AI or generative AI on LinkedIn has doubled over the past year.

PROMOTED
Some roles that are now available include postings for AI research scientists, AI ethics consultants, machine learning engineers, AI engineers, AI product managers, and even AI management consultants, boasting salaries starting from $104,000, with an average salary of $151,668 according to current figures at Salary.com. With artificial intelligence impacting several sectors and industries, automating millions of jobs, boosting economies, and creating new jobs that previously were unheard of, there has never been a better time to consider securing your job future in AI, especially if you're concerned it might impact your job.

Here are five steps to securing a role within the industry while it is at its peak of growth:

Obtain Specific Technical Knowledge
To land a role working with AI, it is important to understand the technology behind it. The specifics will vary, of course, depending on which role you plan to pursue, but generally, you'll need a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics, programming, and data science, which you can usually gain through a degree. A few of the technical skills that are in demand include programming languages such as Python, R, Java, Scala, TypeScript, and C++; machine learning algorithms and frameworks, for example KNN, linear regression, Naive Bayes, Keras, PyTorch, and Theano; data engineering, processing, warehousing, and database modeling; and any AI-specific knowledge of applications, for example, IUI (Intelligent User Interfaces).

Dave McKean: Generative AI Creates “Stuff” (Not Art) 



Emily M. Reigart

TL;DR

“Prompt: Conversations With AI” is illustrator and director Dave McKean’s response, in the form of graphic stories, to learning that his work had been fed into AI learning data sets.
McKean is very concerned about AI’s impact on society at large and its influence on creativity in particular. He believes that effort and process are crucial to making art. 
While he has many problems with how generative AI has been developed and is being used, McKean has and continues to experiment with gen AI as a tool for his work, understanding that it will not be going away in the future but rather become ubiquitous.






Many creatives have been struggling with our feelings about generative artificial intelligence. Illustrator and director Dave McKean went one step further as he grappled with AI: He wrote a 96-page book as he processed how this technology would change his work… and our society. 
Prompt: Conversations With AI is McKean’s response, in the form of graphic stories, to learning that his work had been fed into generative AI data sets.  
“I’m just an individual human being, trying to make sense, to work out what the hell’s going on, mostly by making marks on paper,” McKean told an audience at Film and Media Exchange, where he was invited to share his thoughts on AI. (Watch the full keynote and Q&A below.)



His initial reaction was along the lines of… not good.
“I did about 10 minutes’ research on what Midjourney was and what artificial intelligence image creation was. And then I spent a day in a fetal position on the floor of my studio,” McKean said. 
McKean’s feelings have evolved, but he still maintains strong reservations about AI’s use in creative endeavors.
“I’m very much a critic of this. But a critic who wants to understand it,” McKean said.


AI Explorations and Experiments
After his initial panic, McKean determined he’d need to explore AI’s capabilities, so he began to experiment with Night Cafe, a free tool. 
“I fed lines from Roadside Picnic into the bot, and it spat out a few raw materials,” McKean said. But ultimately, he “found it quite hard work to get anything out of it that I liked in any way.” 
Later, McKean tried another tack: using it as a shortcut to design an album cover for a friend. “I didn’t really have a firm idea of what it was … so I typed eight words into Midjourney.” He said the image generated “looks like my work, so I used it” and liked it. (His friend’s band ultimately did not.) 

However, that initial result also freaked him out and caused McKean to reach out to a neighbor (who happens to be an expert in AI) to understand how the bot was able to recreate his style with such a general prompt. “I just wrote some very bland words in that I thought might put it in a certain kind of image, but I didn’t use my name at all,” McKean recalls. “And she said, ‘Well, it probably knows your IP address.’” (An unsettling idea!)
His next endeavor involved translating the Epic of Gilgamesh into images using AI. He wondered, “Would anything of the story survive that weird conversation?” The end result was that some of the plotlines were discernible to someone unfamiliar with the myth (as tested on McKean’s wife).
McKean also experimented with feeding newspaper headlines into the bot as a way “to see how AI sees us.” He did this over the course of a month, which also happened to be the time frame when Blake Lemoine was fired because he was worried about chatbot sentience, as well as the month of the Uvalde, Texas, massacre. 
“All kinds of strange images came out of this,” McKean said.



Strange and at times disturbing. McKean ultimately did not include the AI-generated description of the school shooting, the only image he “censored” from inclusion in the book. “What I took from that is that AI has no feelings to hurt, doesn’t care about hurting our feelings,” he said. 
His final experiment was to feed his questions about AI…into the AI. He also included photographs that he’d take on his daily walks (which he’d use to create his AI musings), and created renderings combining the images and questions. After enough re-renderings, “Everything started to look like my work,” he said.

Art Vs. Stuff
McKean thinks that generative AI has created “ethical black holes” that “are obviously really pressing.” 
Beyond the legality and issues like copyright, he is concerned about more philosophical aspects, like: “What is the nature now of art and creativity, if all that is happening is somebody’s tapping away?” and “Where do any of us fit into this anymore? And is this the future we want?”
McKean has answered some of these questions, for himself, anyway.
First, he said, “I don’t call it AI art. It’s AI stuff. It’s a great generator of stuff, an endless plane of stuff.” 
While that sounds rather derisive, he also admits, “It remains a powerful tool for generating curious and surprising stuff. And that stuff when curated by interesting prompters like my friends, Mario Cavalli, and Ryan Hughes, for example, can be genuinely engaging. It can be used as raw material for further collage or physical media work, and can therefore be part of the creative process.”
He said, “The images that it coughs up are genuinely surprising. And surprise is a big part of creativity. It’s a big part of what we hope to get in our own work.” 
Nonetheless, when it comes to creativity, McKean said, “It’s the challenge that’s important. And it’s in the doing of it. And for it not to be easy, and to do things that surprise yourself, and to find things along the way that you would never have discovered about yourself, or about the thing that you end up doing.”
McKean explains, “The AI equivalent of going for a walk is just a teleport to the final destination. Well, that’s not a walk, is it? That gives you nothing of what you want to go on a walk for. It doesn’t get blood pumping, or air in your lungs, or it doesn’t get you — allow you — to try a path that you wouldn’t have come across if you hadn’t gone on that walk or that journey. That’s creativity.” 
Even worse, McKean said, “There’s no magic involved with Midjourney. It’s boring and tedious.” 
As an artist, he said, “I don’t want to spend my life tapping away on a keyboard. This is so boring. I like making things and getting my hands dirty. So I’ll play with it until I’m bored with it, which is 10 minutes.”
Legal and Ethical Challenges
“Even though I don’t think there’s any chance of returning any or many of the contents to Pandora’s box, I do think the total lack of any forethought on the part of the radical tech fundamentalists has to be called out,” McKean said. “The argument that it is just a tool remains hopelessly naive. It is a tool, but not just a tool. We are racing to keep up with the implications of how it will change society.”
“There are lots of people trying to take these people to court trying to get some sort of opt out, trying to get some sort of royalties paid whenever your name is coughed up. I honestly don’t hold out much hope that things are going to change,” McKean said.
So that means “It’s down to us, again, to form our own ethical boundaries for dealing with this stuff,” he said.
One of his own bright lines is not using AI to copy another creative’s style directly. “Putting a prompt into Midjourney using another artist’s name, as far as I’m concerned, is obviously wrong. I’ve never done it. And I hope none of you have either,” McKean told the audience.
He also scoffs at the idea that AI programmers can’t solve some of the problems we’ve already been presented with. 
For example, McKean said, “If it is possible to blockchain an image to prove its ownership no matter what turbulence happens to it online, then it must be possible to watermark AI activity to at least prove beyond doubt, and conspiracy theorists that the photo realistic image of a beloved television news anchor in sexual congress with a koala bear is fiction.”

The StartersExpandSiri and HomePod in-store advertisement.Photographer: Hollie Adams/BloombergOne of the most intense and widespread endeavors at Apple Inc. right now is its effort to respond to the AI frenzy sweeping the technology industry.The company has some catching up to do. Apple largely sat on the sidelines when OpenAI’s ChatGPT took off like a rocket last year. It watched as Google and Microsoft Corp. rolled out generative AI versions of their search engines, which spit out convincingly human-like responses to users’ queries. Microsoft also updated its Windows apps with smarter assistants, and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled an AI-enhanced overhaul of Alexa.All the while, the only noteworthy AI release from Apple was an improved auto-correct system in iOS 17.Now, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook says that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years. But I can tell you in no uncertain terms that Apple executives were caught off guard by the industry’s sudden AI fever and have been scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time. “There’s a lot of anxiety about this and it’s considered a pretty big miss internally,” a person with knowledge of the matter told Power On.As I first reported in July, the company built its own large language model called Ajax and rolled out an internal chatbot dubbed “Apple GPT” to test out the functionality. The critical next step is determining if the technology is up to snuff with the competition and how Apple will actually apply it to its products.ExpandApple AI boss John Giannandrea.Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergApple’s senior vice presidents in charge of AI and software engineering, John Giannandrea and Craig Federighi, are spearheading the effort. On Cook’s team, they’re referred to as the “executive sponsors” of the generative AI push. Eddy Cue, the head of services, is also involved, I’m told. The trio are now on course to spend about $1 billion per year on the undertaking.Giannandrea is overseeing development of the underlying technology for a new AI system, and his team is revamping Siri in a way that will deeply implement it. This smarter version of Siri could be ready as soon as next year, but there are still concerns about the technology and it may take longer for Apple’s AI features to spread across its product line. Federighi’s software engineering group, meanwhile, is adding AI to the next version of iOS. There’s an edict to fill it with features running on the company’s large language model, or LLM, which uses a flood of data to hone AI capabilities. The new features should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences, mirroring recent changes to competing services.Apple’s software engineering teams are also looking at integrating generative AI into development tools like Xcode, a move that could help app developers write new applications more quickly. That would bring it in line with services like Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, which offers auto-complete suggestions to developers while they write code.And Cue’s organization is pushing to add AI to as many apps as possible. The group is exploring new features for Apple Music, including auto-generated playlists (this is something Spotify rolled out earlier this year in partnership with OpenAI), as well as the company’s productivity apps.ExpandCraig Federighi and Eddy Cue.Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergCue’s team is examining how generative AI can be used to help people write in apps like Pages or auto-create slide decks in Keynote. Again, this is similar to what Microsoft has already launched for its Word and PowerPoint apps. Apple is also testing generative AI for internal customer service apps within its AppleCare group, I’ve previously reported. One debate going on internally is how to deploy generative AI: as a completely on-device experience, a cloud-based setup or something in between. An on-device approach would work faster and help safeguard privacy, but deploying Apple’s LLMs via the cloud would allow for more advanced operations.The on-device strategy also makes it harder for Apple to update its technology and adapt to a fast-changing industry. With that in mind, I wouldn’t be surprised if the company adopts a combined approach: using on-device processing for some features and the cloud for more advanced tasks. When it comes to getting this right, the stakes are high. Generative AI has quickly become much more than a buzzword and will be central to the next several decades of computing. Apple knows it can’t afford to take a back seat.

The BenchExpandTim Cook with the latest MacBook Air.Photographer: Philip Pacheco/BloombergApple’s iMacs and MacBook Pros are in short supply ahead of planned launch at end of month. Apple last updated the iMac in April 2021, introducing a version of its iconic all-in-one computer with an M1 chip. Since then, news about a follow-up model has been as  elusive as a PowerBook G5. In an era of in-house Apple chips, it’s rare for a Mac to go this long without an upgrade. Fans of the iMac have waited more than 900 days since the last model debuted.This was never the plan. Apple had aimed to release a larger, pro-focused iMac soon after the 24-inch iMac launched. Under the original road map, you would have seen the M1 24-inch iMac, then an M2-based iMac Pro and, finally, a 24-inch iMac refresh.I’m told that the company tabled the iMac Pro plan a while ago due to cost concerns. So Apple has had to adjust. That’s included positioning the Mac Studio and Studio Display combination as a high-end iMac replacement. But any passionate iMac user knows that’s not an apples-to-apples comparison.Fortunately, a new iMac is finally on the way. As I reported in March, the company has been readying the updated 24-inch iMac — a model that could be out soon. How soon? Well, I’m told that Apple is planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month. That could be its chance to announce this model.Another clue: Apple retail stores are in short supply of the iMac, as well as the 13-inch MacBook Pro and high-end MacBook Pro — two other models that may be due for a refresh. If you try to order the products from Apple’s website, several configurations won’t arrive until mid-November. That several-week delay is a clear sign that something is about to happen.I believe the Mac announcement will take place on either the 30th or 31st of this month. Apple is holding earnings on Nov. 2. It will be the first time since 2018 that the company posts its quarterly results in November (usually it occurs in late October). The last time this happened, the earnings followed an iPad and Mac event on Oct. 30.I recently reported that while next-generation MacBook Air models with M3 chips won’t launch until 2024, the company has made headway on new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. You’ll recall that Apple just released MacBook Pros in January, so an additional update the same year would be unusual, but not inconceivable.Back to the iMac: It’s worth noting that the pro version was tabled but never canceled. This larger model is still poised to follow the 24-inch one, coming in either late 2024 or 2025. It will have a 32-inch display, making it the biggest iMac in Apple’s history. It’s something I’m watching closely. After all, the iMac, which turned 25 this year, was what got me interested in Apple in the first place.ExpandThe Apple Vision Pro.Photographer: Philip Pacheco/BloombergApple will begin training retail employees on the Vision Pro in “first months” of 2024. The release of the Vision Pro is approaching, with Apple beginning to prepare retail employees for the device to go on sale next year. The company has sent a memo out to retail employees asking them to apply for a secretive “product training event” in Cupertino, California. The gathering will take place in the early months of 2024. This event is, of course, to teach retail employees about the Vision Pro and train them on the complex sales procedures involved. “Selected team members will travel and participate in an event in Cupertino, California, at some point in the first months of 2024. Upon returning to their home store, they’ll deliver training and ongoing support to store team members,” the memo says. “This is a group opportunity for those who have a deep passion for demonstrating Apple products and teaching others.” Those who want in will need to pass an application and interview process.In other words, Apple wants to bring in a couple people from each retail store in the US to train them on the Vision Pro and then send them back home to teach their colleagues about it. What does this tell us about the Vision Pro launch timing? Not much, perhaps. The memo doesn’t say when the product will go on sale or how long the training will run. But it’s probably a further signal that the device won’t be ready at the very beginning of the new year. Apple has only said that the Vision Pro is arriving in “early” 2024, wording that gives it plenty of wiggle room. The rollout of the Vision Pro is expected to be the most complicated in the company’s history. Flagship Apple retail locations will be adding dedicated hands-on areas, with other stores getting one or two demo units apiece. The company is also planning to assemble the Vision Pros for customers in-store — like it does with the Apple Watch — embedding proper bands, light seals and optional prescription lenses.ExpandiPad Air with Apple Pencil.Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/BloombergApple debuts a new low-end Apple Pencil ahead of fresh iPads in the spring. Apple isn't planning to launch new iPads until around next March, I'm told. In the meantime, we got something a bit less exciting: a new low-end Apple Pencil. This device is a successor to the original Pencil from 2015, adding USB-C charging to fit in with Apple’s current lineup. The new model lacks the pressure sensitivity of the first Pencil, but it gains most of the benefits of the second-generation version: design changes, matte finish and the magnetic attachment feature. At $79 (or $69 on the Apple education store), it's a pretty good deal and a strong competitor to styluses from the likes of Logitech.I anticipate that Apple will eventually discontinue the first-generation Pencil and only offer low-end and high-end versions. But that may not happen until the low-end iPad with a Lightning connection is discontinued. After all, customers will probably want a Lightning Pencil to go with their Lightning iPad.For now, having three Pencils only underscores how cluttered the iPad offerings are. There’s a confusing array of models and generations, and it’s not clear why consumers should buy one versus another.That probably won’t change anytime soon, but Apple will at least update the lineup with new hardware in 2024. I’ve written that the company has been working on a slew of models, including versions of the iPad Air, entry-level iPad and iPad mini with bumped-up specifications. There’s also a revamped iPad Pro in the works. I’m told that Apple is currently planning to release at least the more minor iPad refreshes in March.The ScheduleExpandAn Apple retail store in New York City.Photographer: Gabby Jones/BloombergNov. 2: Apple announces quarterly results. Apple is set to report fourth-quarter earnings at the start of November, capping its fiscal 2023. This is a critical report: We’ll get our first slice of data on how the latest iPhone 15 models have performed and insight into how the company is feeling about its all-important holiday period. The fourth quarter includes a little over a week of iPhone 15 sales, so we should get a pretty good idea of early momentum for the device and color from executives on how it’s selling. One big question is how it’s doing in China, where early sales indications have been weak.

This serves to inspire them to come up with their own startup venures. Quite often, customer service representatives and data-entry keyers come up in the list. Indeed, generative AI has plenty of potential to automate many aspects of customer service. And other areas of AI, such as computer vision combined with natural language processing, can take over data entry substantially. AI is changing the nature of work—but that isn’t always bad.Recently, JPMorgan’s CEO predicted a 3.5-day workweek in the future, owing to AI. The more we get machines to work for us, the more time we get back for ourselves.Machine learning, which is a branch of AI and increasingly being used interchangeably with it, is about teaching machines to learn to behave like human beings—and even outperform them in certain tasks. I have been teaching the subject to graduate and undergraduate students at San Jose State University for the past five years, using my flipped classroom videos, and motivating them in a number of ways, such as asking them to interview subject matter experts from the industry; ask questions that I use in “Ask Me Anything,” a series with renowned researchers; and implement challenging course projects. The students explore the math behind the methods and design interesting machine learning applications.Most of us already use machine learning in our day-to-day lives, knowingly or unknowingly. Whenever we converse with Siri or Alexa, unlock our mobile phones using facial recognition or laptops using fingerprints, take recommendations from Netflix, or search the internet, we are using machine learning. In several recent and upcoming inventions such as the self-driving car or generative-AI-based ChatGPT, machine learning has the real potential to replace human beings.States like California have already passed multiple bills limiting the use of AI. I agree that artificial intelligence poses risks, but the opportunities are too compelling to be ignored.With automation, economies of scale quickly add up, resulting in accelerated progress. Automation already helps with blue-collar jobs such as the bank teller or dishwasher. Artificial intelligence can help in white-collar jobs with data-based decision-making made possible by machine-learning-based data analytics. In that sense, AI is capable of substituting at least partly for our very expensive human intuition.Jeetu Patel, chief product officer at Box, said recently that AI will impact half a billion white-collar jobs. Given that machines have some amazing qualities, like tirelessness and lack of other human fallibilities, the prospects of AI are huge. Human intelligence has millions of years of evolution behind it. Many paradigms have not yet been considered in the 50 or 60 years that artificial intelligence has been in existence. It can easily be said that we have hardly scraped the full potential of AI.However, all the above-discussed advantages of AI will not have the desired effect if they work only to fill the coffers of the C-suite and a few others at higher echelons. If the corporate culture does not practice giving back to its employees, their families, their alma maters, and the society at large, all the accelerated efforts will simply be siphoned off into an endless well of corporate greed. Governments and enterprises should strike a delicate balance between the two.Vishnu S.

And according to McKinsey’s Global Survey of AI from 2022, the buzz is real: AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017. As AI increases in the workplace, 53 percent of workers say they’re more concerned about their jobs being replaced by robots than immigration and outsourcing, per Gallup data.

Yet, there’s a paradoxical shift. According to Gallup, the focus is actually on people and transforming HR — the role of HR rather than changing technology. While it may sound ironic as generative AI increases in the workplace and workers may be concerned about job replacement, more specifically for purposes of this piece through the lens of HR professionals, it can also be equated to job freedom. AI can take on monotonous, rote tasks, and in turn, as technology handles mundane responsibilities, human workers can become more indispensable and get further immersed in deep-thinking and strategizing work.

For example, if transaction forms need to be issued for internal employee transfers, rather than an HR employee preparing the forms, they can have Gen AI handle that task while instead, the professional conducts goal-setting sessions with the transferring employee to set goals and expectations for the new role.

PROMOTED
Jill Goldstein, managing partner, talent transformation consulting at IBM, underscores this point in her recent blog post as to how HR organizations can prioritize people.

Goldstein wrote, “Invest in the talent and skills of your people. Create a culture of continuous learning. Success in the new AI era requires you to put people, instead of technology, at the center of your strategy. Your human workforce is integral to the success of this digital transformation. Their expertise gives them unique insights into where automation and AI could augment performance. Foster an open communication forum for them to provide direct input and insights.”

Ian Clawson, cofounder of BraveCore and coauthor of Brave Together: Lead by Design, Spark Creativity, and Shape the Future with the Power of Co-Creation, said, “As AI emerges in our work life, wise leaders have a massive opportunity to unleash the creative voice of their people. Creativity will become the fuel for shaping the future in how we connect, collaborate, and build together. It is the definitive skill for supercharging companies looking to lead and grow.”

The best way, Clawson, said to elevate work with creative skills involves relying on “those moments where your work excites you. Remove distractions. Ride the wave of creative bursts….  We can develop creative skills by leaning into questions more than answers. To stay curious and be anchored in the wrestle between possibilities and our power to build—together.

Inviting every perspective into brave conversations, challenging how we’ve done things, and treating our work like an exploration. The more we use our creative muscles, ideas start to stack, and we can start to make a difference in the lives of others.”
Particularly within human resources, as an example, that can be a year-end strategy session with the compensation teams and human resources business partners (HRBPs) to think about its workforce who increasingly want remote work. They can discuss topics such as what the hours look like, the compensation while they’re working remotely, and how their work can be positively impacted by these changes. It can look like brainstorming ways to boost morale along lines of business and productivity and rewarding employees with bonuses throughout the year — both monetarily, but perhaps “awards ceremonies” as well as their creativity sparks fresh ideas and new perspectives.
By stacking these ideas while collaborating with colleagues as HR organizations encourage and celebrate deep-thinking work, this excitement can fuel momentum for even more creativity within the HR engine as it accepts and embraces new technologies.
Chris Deaver, coauthor of Brave Together, indicated that leaders who avoided the internet, cell phones, and robots “led their companies into the dead-ends of history. Countless other inventions have proven to be new beginnings, not the end of everything. AI won’t eliminate all our work. It will just eliminate the boring work. The stuff we don’t enjoy. The things that hold us back from getting into creative flow.”
As HR teams focus on creativity, the ebb and flow of ideas, brainstorming, a-ha moments, and trying new and different ways of working for high touch, the creative muscle continues to be flexed. This includes hopefully better and more efficient ways of doing things, but may also include the occasional failure and figuring out what doesn’t work while celebrating the process, the journey, and the creative sparks rather than only focusing on the outcome.
“Nothing can replace imagination and human connection,” said Deaver. “Those who embrace AI will amplify a future filled with possibilities. Shifting our busy work from ‘to do’ lists to ‘what could be’ blueprints of a better future. Empowering us to go deeper into our creative voice, then expanding with others to solve some of the greatest challenges we’ve ever faced. Together.”
As HR organizations rely on AI to augment performance rather than replace all human work, a critical solution involves developing and honing a highly coveted skill that taps the expertise and minds of engaged workers: creativity. Original sparks of ideas, thoughts, and meaningful new creations are key.

The human problem with generative AI in HR


Generative AI's integration into HR software and processes presents both internal and external challenges, with concerns ranging from technology errors to human complacency.

Much can go wrong with generative AI in HR, ranging from errors in the technology to mistakes by humans operating these systems. The problems can come from two different directions: internal and external.







Generative AI requires human oversight, but experts say attention might fall away as workers become too complacent and trusting of the technology. Generative AI's ability to give wrong answers convincingly and its bias potential are also part of the risk of AI in HR.
Generative AI might also deliver external threats to HR. Job seekers can use large language models (LLMs), such as those that underpin ChatGPT, to craft resumes and cover letters with the right experience, words and phrases to be selected by an AI-enabled applicant screening system. That can make more work for recruiters in verifying various claims.
Nonetheless, HR managers are feeling pressure to adopt generative AI. In Gartner surveys, 76% of HR leaders have reported that ""if they don't adopt [generative AI] within the next one or two years, they'll be lagging,"" said Eser Rizaoglu, a Gartner analyst speaking at the company's ReimagineHR Conference in Orlando on Monday.
Using Gartner's hype cycle methodology, which it contends represents the typical path of new technologies, Rizaoglu said generative AI interest has reached the ""peak of inflated expectations."" Following rising expectations is the ""trough of disillusionment,"" which may have some users giving up on the technology.






Rizaoglu believes it will take two to three years for generative AI to start to demonstrate maturity -- the final stage of Gartner's five-phase hype cycle.
But there will be pitfalls to HR's adoption of AI, including the risk of putting too much trust in AI recommendations, said Balaji Padmanabhan, professor of decision, operations and information technologies at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.
The complacency risk ""will never go away,"" Padmanabhan said. ""And once the comfort level increases, that risk may actually increase in time.""

The risk of too much trust
One of the initial generative AI applications is writing job descriptions. Here, Padmanabhan can see how complacency might take over. He said employees might stop checking future job description outputs once the AI system correctly constructs the first 10 job descriptions.
Padmanabhan said other generative AI risks include the ""huge problem"" of incorrect answers. LLMs don't understand the underlying knowledge in their data; instead, they learn how to connect words. ""They're learning the structure of language, which is what they're meant to do,"" he said.
Padmanabhan said generative AI needs verification systems to double-check any outputs. One model might be verification as a service, where humans with expertise in benefits, for instance, review an LLM's responses.
John Farley, managing director of the cyber liability practice at Gallagher, a risk management and HR and benefits consulting firm in Chicago, believes enthusiasm about new technologies pushes aside discussions of risk.
""All too often as a society, we tend not to think about the things that can go wrong,"" Farley said. ""We gravitate toward efficiencies and get excited about the potential that new technology brings to an organization.""
To protect themselves from such risks, employers will need to take several steps, such as having contracts with vendors that address liability on issues such as intellectual property protection, according to Farley. They'll also need strong data governance programs to ensure that AI systems are used correctly by employees, he said.

Gartner

Gartner says new technologies start off with inflated expectations, illustrated by the path of blockchain and metaverse technologies, which are seeing declining interest. Right now, interest in generative AI is high.







Good governance key to AI in HR
Job applicants who use generative AI also complicate HR's work, said Trevor Bogan, regional director Americas at Top Employers Institute, a global HR certification provider based in Amsterdam.
Bogan said that candidates use generative AI to enhance their resumes, which may lead to over-reliance on superlatives and produce inaccurate and misleading information.



As humans, we try to find signs of consciousness in almost anything.


Flavio VillanustreVice president of technology and global chief information security officer, LexisNexis Risk Solutions




Recruiters will ""have to do a little bit more research to make sure that this person is who they say they are,"" Bogan said.
Christopher Hojnowski, vice president of technology and cyber product head at Hiscox, a global business insurance provider, said that as ""much as AI can go wrong, AI can do right,"" he said.
But Hojnowski recommended that employers have strong policies governing how employees use generative AI systems. For instance, they might establish that employees only post an AI-generated job description after human review.
""It's going to be up to the companies to write strong guidelines around how AI can be used,"" Hojnowski said. That includes setting expectations that employees ""can't be complacent.""
But employees could still become too trusting of AI systems, said Flavio Villanustre, vice president of technology and global chief information security officer at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.
There is a risk of misuse because some employees may naturally assign too much trust to the model, leading to problems later, he said. They might look for human characteristics in AI systems or believe that the system has a personality or even human-like reasoning, also known as artificial general intelligence.
""As humans, we try to find signs of consciousness in almost anything,"" Villanustre said.

Artificial intelligence is already disrupting operations across swaths of industries, and HR is no exception.
AI’s use cases in the HR space are evolving rapidly, from filtering and tracking job candidates to generating internal communications and analyzing facial expressions during video interviews. But it’s the use of AI in hiring that is drawing particular attention from regulators.
In 2023, New York City passed the nation’s first-ever law requiring employers to conduct annual bias audits of automated employment decision-making tools. Months later, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued guidance for employers about how to audit AI for employment discrimination.
Here we track the states, cities and other jurisdictions that have passed laws on the use of AI and other automated decision-making tools in the hiring process. We’ll offer a brief description of each law’s requirements, its effective date and a link to the original law, along with any relevant coverage from our journalists.
Readers may sort through the laws using the field on the left side of this page. The categories by which readers may sort include state name and area of jurisdiction (statewide vs. locality only).

Effective date: Feb. 1, 2026
Employers affected: All employers
Employers that deploy “high-risk artificial intelligence systems” for purposes such as the provision or denial of job opportunities must take “reasonable care” to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination.
Employers must create AI risk management policies and programs. They also must complete impact assessments for all AI systems both annually as well as within 90 days after any modifications are made. Consumers must be notified about the AI’s deployment, and deployers must publish statements disclosing the AI systems they deploy and the information those systems collect.
Employers must provide consumers opportunities to correct any incorrect personal data processed by an AI and appeal adverse consequential decisions made by an AI. In the event that a deployer discovers algorithmic discrimination has occurred, it must report the discovery to the state attorney general within 90 days.
Some of the law’s requirements do not apply when the deployer employs fewer than 50 full-time employees and does not use its own data to train the AI; the AI system meets certain exemption criteria; and the deployer makes an impact assessment of the AI available to consumers.

Effective date: Jan. 1, 2020
Employers affected: All employers
Employers that ask candidates to record video interviews and conduct analysis of applicant-submitted videos using AI must, prior to the interview, notify applicants that AI may be used, provide information explaining how the AI works and what general characteristics it will use to evaluate applicants, and obtain candidates’ consent to be evaluated by the AI.
Employers may not share applicant videos with anyone other than those persons whose expertise or technology is necessary to evaluate a candidate’s fitness for the position.
Employers must, within 30 days after receiving a deletion request from a candidate, delete video interviews and instruct any persons who received copies of such interviews to delete them, including any electronically generated backup copies.
Employers that rely solely upon AI analysis of video interviews to determine whether applicants will be selected for in-person interviews must collect and report the race and ethnicity data of all applicants who are selected for in-person interviews following an AI analysis, those who are not selected following an AI analysis and those who are ultimately hired. This data must be reported annually to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

Employers may not use facial recognition services for the purpose of creating a facial template — i.e., the machine-interpretable pattern of facial features extracted from one or more images of an individual by such services — during an applicant’s interview for employment, unless the applicant consents to this by signing a waiver. The waiver must state the applicant’s name, the date of the interview, that the applicant consented to the use of facial recognition during the interview and whether the applicant read the consent waiver.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. This is accomplished by software that attempts to replicate a human process. While artificial intelligence can entail very sophisticated applications, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (which can converse with users) or autonomous driving applications, artificial intelligence encompasses a very wide range of applications. One term often associated with financial market artificial intelligence is algorithms, which refers to a set of programmed instructions that provides results from the data analyzed by the program. Artificial intelligence in investing and finance takes many forms, some of which are relatively straightforward. 


 Hedge funds and other trading operations utilize artificial intelligence at a very high level to, as an example, gain the slightest advantages in fast-moving markets. But artificial intelligence is also widely used in finance and investing because of its ability to process and analyze information from very large data sets. Further, artificial intelligence can be used to help choose stocks, make predictions on market movement, optimize portfolios, manage risk, obtain personalized investment advice, manage trade entry and exit strategies, and automatically build a customized portfolio that meets specific investor criteria like risk tolerances. We will discuss a variety of ways any investor can incorporate artificial intelligence into their investing. 


  How to Use Artificial Intelligence in Your Portfolio   
 Here are some ways regular investors can utilize artificial intelligence in their portfolios.


  Stock Picking  
 All of the companies that trade on U.S. stock markets have many data points that investors can use to determine what stocks they want to buy or sell. Artificial intelligence allows investors to efficiently sort through this data to identify stocks that meet their criteria. Stock screeners are sophisticated tools that allow investors to filter stocks on criteria that can include fundamental and technical data points, such as accounting ratios, market capitalization, trading volume, and moving averages, to name just a few of the literally hundreds of data points available. If you’re looking to get started with a stock screener, consider learning how to use these platforms by starting with one of the many free versions that are available, like ZACKS (NASDAQ).




  Automated Portfolio Building  
 Robo-advisors like Wealthfront and Betterment automate the traditional process of working with an advisor to outline investing goals, time horizons, and risk tolerances in order to create a portfolio that meets the needs of the investor. Automated portfolios guide the user through a questionnaire that then scores to a model portfolio that meets the criteria of the investor. In addition to the questionnaire and the scoring of models, these platforms also use artificial intelligence to determine the optimal mix of individual stocks for the portfolio. Further, automated portfolios are also set to automatically rebalance if the target allocations in the portfolio drift too far from the selected portfolio. 


  Trading and Trade Management   
 The ability to trade markets in near-instantaneous time, and strong computing power, has resulted in brokerage companies providing customers with very sophisticated order entry tools that allow computers to monitor trade entry and exit. This order management can be very sophisticated, but an example would be using tools to purchase a stock if it meets one or multiple criteria set by the user, then manage an exit strategy that could entail a conditional order such as using a stop or profitable level to exit a position based on what the market does. The diligent use of AI for trading and trade management, if used properly, can greatly reduce the emotional aspect of trading. This article on trading psychology discusses why dealing with your emotions is important for traders and investors alike. 


  Portfolio Optimization  
 AI is a good tool for portfolio optimization. It enables investors to identify a portfolio that fits their specific needs relative to risk tolerance and time horizon. Further, once a portfolio has been selected, AI can be used in conjunction with modern portfolio theory to craft a portfolio of stocks that falls on the efficient frontier, which increases returns relative to risk.


  Data Interpretation and Predictions  
 The idea is to develop AI algorithms that allow a prediction about where a stock or other security will go for the purpose of making a profit. While many develop algorithms using AI to make trading or investment decisions, not all models are correct. Active money managers are trying to outperform the general market indexes, and some do, while others do not. If you believe that cycles repeat, for example, you might utilize AI tools  to identify these cycles. Order entry based on a technical analysis tool is another possible area where AI could help make automatic entries and exits. 


  Risk Management  
 Various risk management techniques have been discussed, such as using AI in conjunction with modern portfolio theory and the efficient frontier, and using sophisticated order options to manage risk on active trades. However, AI can also be used to reduce over-exposure to individual stocks in a portfolio (such as when multiple managers all have the same stock in different asset classes in the same portfolio), or to establish automated options strategies to assist with risk management.1


  How Robo-Advisors Use Artificial Intelligence  
 Through automated portfolio building, robo-advisors automate the traditional process of working with an advisor to outline investing goals, time horizons, and risk tolerances in order to create a portfolio that meets the needs of the investor. Automated portfolios guide the user through a questionnaire that then scores to a model portfolio that meets the criteria of the investor. In addition to the questionnaire and the scoring of models, artificial intelligence is also used by these platforms in order to determine the optimal mix of individual stocks for the portfolio, which is often accomplished using modern portfolio theory. Further, automated portfolios are also set to automatically rebalance if the target allocations in the portfolio drift too far from the selected portfolio. 


  Steps Needed to Use Artificial Intelligence in Your Investing   
 As we have illustrated, AI in investing encompasses a lot of tools that can be used by professional and individual investors and traders. If you want to incorporate the use of AI into your investing or trading, you may consider taking the steps that follow.


  Step 1: Understand Your Financial Goals  
 The first step is the same for every investor, which is to understand your financial goals so you can move forward with an investment strategy that fits your needs.


  Step 2: Choose Your Investing Method  
 Next, you need to determine whether you will be using a robo-advisor that does much of the work, or investing on your own. If you go with a robo-advisor, the advisor’s AI technology will be doing most of the heavy lifting. This entails the questionnaire, model proposal, and the management of the portfolio. 


  Step 3: Select an Investing Strategy  
 Those making their own investment decisions should determine their investing strategy to understand the types of stocks they want in their portfolio. Investors could also utilize suggested models from robo-advisors, often available for free, to help determine the mix of asset classes for their portfolio. This is using AI to help set a strategy that will be individually managed.


  Step 4: Identify Your Investing Tools  
 For those making their own investment decisions, stocks screeners would likely be helpful AI tools when choosing the individual stocks for your portfolio. Stock screeners often have pre-set screens to help get the user started in filtering for stocks to consider.


  Step 5: Start Managing Your Portfolio  
 Once the portfolio is up and running, investors may want to utilize automated tools to help manage their positions for entry and exit points. They may also want to consider further refining their stock screen searches and learning how they can use the efficient frontier to craft a portfolio built for both favorable returns for the lowest level of risk possible. 


 What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the use of machines to simulate human intelligence. AI is accomplished by computers and software, and uses data analysis and rules-based algorithms. It can entail very sophisticated applications and encompass a very wide range of applications.2 Artificial intelligence in investing and finance takes many forms, but the tremendous amount of data available on financial markets and financial market prices provides many opportunities to apply AI to investing and trading. 


 What Kind of Financial Data Is Analyzed by AI?
Just about any financial information can be analyzed by AI. This includes fundamental data, such as a company’s earnings, cash flow, and any other data that may impact the stock’s price. This article, What are Stock Fundamentals?, provides more information on what fundamental data is and how it is used. Artificial intelligence is also used in technical analysis tools, which include data related to the number of shares traded, and other mathematical criteria related to past price activity. 


 Is Investing With AI Suitable for Beginners?
Absolutely, AI is suitable for beginners! Robo-advisors are often the first step for beginning investors, and these platforms are heavily reliant on AI. While some artificial intelligence represents cutting-edge technology and the ability to understand and process language, plenty of it is much more intuitive. In investing, such as stock selection, AI allows investors to filter stocks that meet their criteria much more simply through stock screeners. These screeners apply the same intelligence as an individual would, but they can do so much more quickly, efficiently, and accurately than a human. Any investor, even a beginner, would benefit from these powerful and easy-to-use stock screeners, as well as other AI investing tools. 


 Is Investing With AI Safe?
It is safe to use AI, but AI applications for financial markets are only as good as both the quality of the AI application and the ability of the individual to use the application. AI tools for financial markets can be used to identify risky or safe stocks, so the relative safety is a function of the choices the investor makes related to risk and reward of different stocks. Using modern portfolio theory to find a portfolio of stocks that maximizes gains while minimizing risk is another safe tool to use in making investing decisions. Faulty algorithms, and the potential for moves related to large numbers of investors using the same AI-generated information, are potential risks with using AI for investing.


  The Bottom Line  
 Whether you know it or not, the link between AI and investing is here to stay. Even if you are not directly using AI yourself, portfolio and fund managers all utilize AI in multiple ways, and your investment advisor is likely also using the same tools robo-advisors use to help determine risk tolerances and the best portfolio for their clients. Fortunately, AI tools for investing are now widely available to individuals.


 If you are a hands-on, active investor, you will be using AI in more than one way to manage your portfolio, make decisions on purchases and sales, and manage trading positions, so it is important to understand and keep abreast of developments in the AI and investing space. Investors should, therefore, look at the various investing tools that use AI on their existing platform to ensure that they are sufficient for their needs. If not, investors may want to consider either a different broker with more robust AI investing tools, or supplementing their broker platform with third-party AI investing software; an example would be using a separate stock screener for choosing stocks.

         — 
    


            When you read “artificial intelligence,” you might think of new innovations such as Chat GPT, but AI has been used in video games since the 1950s.
    

            From Pacman’s trademark ghosts to autonomous decision-making in “The Sims,” AI is essential for things like creating adaptive characters and storylines.
    

            Now, the rapid development of generative AI is opening up a new frontier for video games: endless open worlds, unique content, autonomous characters, and the potential for faster game development.

        Act natural


Generative AI – artificial intelligence that creates text, images and audio in response to a prompt – is set to shake up one of the signature components of video games: non-playable characters, known as NPCs. These characters typically have a set pattern of behavior, and their mannerisms and speech are often stilted and unnatural.

            “When we think about those NPCs, they look a bit weird,” says Alexis Rolland, development director of La Forge China, the Chinese branch of video games publisher Ubisoft’s research and development unit. “You can tell there is something off about what you’re seeing or hearing.”

            Enter generative AI. Earlier this year, La Forge launched Ghostwriter, a text-generating AI tool designed to help writers create a greater variety of original dialogue for NPCs, and in 2022, it tested a new technology that helps to generate more realistic and natural gestures in NPCs that matches the tone and mood of their speech.
    

            “It takes speech as input and generates body gesture as output, so we can imagine those NPCs expressing themselves with non-scripted dialogues, having almost natural body animation, synthesized from speech,” says Rolland.
    

            Combining generative AI elements like dialogue and animation could create “a fully fledged, AI-powered NPC that might have a little bit more natural and unpredictable behavior,” says Rolland.

            Jitao Zhou, a student at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, is doing just that to generate more realistic NPCs that are smarter and less predictable.
    

            “This NPC, using deep learning, does not have a fixed pattern, so can have a greater variety of movements,” says Zhou, adding that smarter NPCs will make games more entertaining and challenging.

Artificial intelligence could help work out the best diet for every individual




            Some publishers are already employing generative AI in NPCs to make conversations more realistic. Chinese gaming company NetEase uses ChatGPT to generate NPC dialogue in its recently released “Justice” mobile game, while Replica Studios recently introduced “AI-powered smart NPCs” for game engine giant Unreal Engine, which allows game developers to use AI to read NPC dialogue, rather than hiring a human voice actor.
    

            However, one risk of using AI-generated NPCs is that game designers could lose control of the game narrative, says Julian Togelius, an associate professor at New York University, where he conducts research on AI and games. “(NPCs) may say stuff that is game-breaking or rude or breaks immersion,” he explains.

            Creating “good” AI-generated NPCs that help the player is also far more difficult than creating enemies that fight against you, Togelius adds. “We haven’t seen that much advancement in the artificial intelligence that powers the other characters in the games, or that tries to model the player, or tries to generate the world — so we’re going to see a lot of advancement along these directions.”
    

        Open worlds


            Open-world games, like “Grand Theft Auto,” “Skyrim,” and “Elden Ring,” approach gameplay with non-linear quests and stories. That offers another opportunity for generative AI to reshape the gaming experience.
    

            Togelius envisions a “huge open game” with infinite opportunities, new cities, landscapes, and people, each with its own backstory and interactive elements. By using data about the player gathered from previous gameplay, generative AI could create unique storylines and tailor-made quests for players pitched at just the right level – “like a personalized dungeon master,” he adds.
    






""No Man's Sky"" uses procedurally generated content to create almost unlimited worlds for players to explore.

No Man's Sky



            Some research is already being done in this area. Takehiko Hoshino, also a student at Rikkyo University, has created an AI tool that he’s teaching to generate its own mazes and dungeons one square at a time, based on previous ones that it has encountered.
    

            It’s still in the early stages of development, but Hoshino says the next step is to embellish the maze with features including “treasure chests, enemy characters, and other game-like features, such as traps and other tiles.”
    

            Near-infinite open worlds are already possible to some degree: “No Man’s Sky” (2016) is a “virtually endless game,” says Togelius, that uses a technique called procedurally generated content to create customized fauna, flora, geology, and atmospheric conditions for its planets — of which there are 18 quintillion unique variations.
    

            To the average person, procedural content generation looks a lot like generative AI, says Togelius. But it uses algorithms that generate content based on predefined rules, based on data input by the game developer.
    

            While the developers retain control over procedurally generated content, generative AI has the potential to develop unplayable levels, or deviate in unintended ways from the game’s narrative. “Games have functional constraints such that levels need to be completable and NPCs should not lie about the game world,” Togelius adds.
    






In the future, Maxis says artificial intelligence could help character behavior, and is open to exploring the technology.

            But generative AI could impact the game world in other ways.
    

            Players are already adapting gameplay to their own preferences and needs with user-generated content (UGC), which is a key component of many games, including “Fortnite,” “Minecraft” and “The Sims.” Generative AI could make the production of UGC easier and more accessible for players, as well as raise the quality of content.
    

            “Generative AI has the potential to allow for a much broader and more emergent set of personalized and reactive player experiences,” a spokesperson from Maxis, the developer behind “The Sims,” told CNN in an email.
    

            “Player customization today is limited by the complexity of tools and user experience that we can expose players to, but some of the new models can make it easier for the game to interpret and respond to what the player wants to do,” says Maxis.
    

        An additional tool


            While gamers are excited about the potential for gameplay, generative AI is likely to impact development before it alters the user experience.
    

            Maxis is developing generative AI tools, currently in varying stages of maturity, that can support game designers, eliminating repetitive tasks and enabling developers to work on more interesting problems, according to a spokesperson.
    

            At La Forge, generative AI tools like Ghostwriter or ZooBuilder, a 3D animator that animates four-legged animals based on videos, could help designers “accelerate the most tedious part of their process, so that they can really focus on the more creative and interesting parts,” says Rolland.
    

            Creatives across all kinds of industries have raised concerns about generative AI taking their jobs but Rolland is quick to add that this new technology won’t replace human game developers. Animators faced a similar existential threat with the advent of motion capture, which Rolland says did not actually impact jobs but became a tool to create better graphics.







Tools like ZooBuilder could allow animators to create more natural movements for animal characters.

            “We’ve never had as many animators as we have today, and we still need more. Motion capture really became part of their workflow as an additional tool,” says Rolland. “I think with generative AI, it’s essentially the same thing – or at least, we’re approaching it with the exact same mindset here at Ubisoft.”  However, there are still a lot of unanswered “legal and ethical aspects” to using generative AI, including artists’ copyright, he adds.

            La Forge is eager to explore the opportunities, such as the potential to increase iteration speed, and independent game designers are going to benefit from that too, he adds. “This technology becoming increasingly accessible is going to empower a lot of the smaller studios to produce games and scale their productions, and maybe reach higher quality than what they would have had without generative AI.”
    

            The generative AI Ghostwriter and speech-to-gesture animation have “passed the simple prototype stage,” says Rolland, and La Forge is now exploring how these technologies would work in the development pipeline.
    

            “Video games are in for quite a trip in the next decade or two,” says Togelius. “It requires us to change the way we’re thinking when it comes to game design, but I think that when it happens, games are just going to get so much better.”

La Forge is eager to explore the opportunities, such as the potential to increase iteration speed, and independent game designers are going to benefit from that too, he adds. “This technology becoming increasingly accessible is going to empower a lot of the smaller studios to produce games and scale their productions, and maybe reach higher quality than what they would have had without generative AI.” The generative AI Ghostwriter and speech-to-gesture animation have “passed the simple prototype stage,” says Rolland, and La Forge is now exploring how these technologies would work in the development pipeline. “Video games are in for quite a trip in the next decade or two,” says Togelius. “It requires us to change the way we’re thinking when it comes to game design, but I think that when it happens, games are just going to get so much better.”",1343.0,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61', 'foundingDate': '1980-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/cnn/', 'https://twitter.com/CNN', 'https://www.instagram.com/cnn/', 'https://www.youtube.com/cnn']}",,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@context': 'https://schema.org', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/world/generative-ai-video-games-spc-intl-hnk/index.html', 'dateModified': '2023-10-27T03:20:55.944Z', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'additionalType': 'article_leaf', 'publisher': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61', 'foundingDate': '1980-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/cnn/', 'https://twitter.com/CNN', 'https://www.instagram.com/cnn/', 'https://www.youtube.com/cnn']}, 'name': '‘Video games are in for quite a trip’: How generative AI could radically reshape gaming', 'headline': '‘Video games are in for quite a trip’: How generative AI could radically reshape gaming', 'description': 'AI is opening up a new frontier for video games: endless open worlds, unique content and autonomous characters.', 'datePublished': '2023-10-23T08:40:22.258Z'}",,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.article__content'}",['world'],,https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231019071855-04-video-games-generative-ai.jpg?c=original,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P0Y0M0DT0H5M58S,

What you need to knowApple could potentially explore the generative AI craze.A new job listing posted by the company highlights several tasks, roles, and duties that are generative AI-focused.The company will reportedly make $1 billion in investments yearly to facilitate its AI advances. The generative AI craze has completely taken off in the tech industry. Microsoft, in particular, was among the top corporations to embrace the technology, making a multi-billion dollar investment. Other corporations like Slack and Amazon followed suit, incorporating the technology into their services and workflow, but not Apple, which has mysteriously remained quiet in the midst of these developments.However, the company is now picking up the slack, at least according to its latest job listings. The positions advertised are generative AI-inclined, as reported by TechCrunch. To secure a position in Apple's App Store platform, you must have skills that will allow you to effectively work on a ""generative AI-based developer experience platform for internal use.""In another instance, a potential employee in Apple's Retail department is required to leverage a “conversational AI platform (voice and chat)” while interacting with clients. The job listing also outlines “long-form text generation, summarization, question-answering” as part of the job description. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksOnline Shopping ToolsAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackOnline Shopping ToolsBuilding on this, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a credible source when it comes to Apple rumors and leaks, recently disclosed that the company will set aside $1 billion annually to further its advances in generative AI as far as its products, features, and services are concerned. LATEST VIDEOS FROM windowscentralWindows CentralIs it the right time for Apple to explore generative AI?READ MORE>iPhone of Artificial Intelligence>Apple is listed by the EU as a gatekeeper>Apple's Vision Pro might be a flopThis isn't the first time generative AI and Apple have been mentioned in the same sentence. In July, our Senior Editor Zac Bowden reported that Apple is venturing into the AI space with a ChatGPT-like iteration, codenamed Ajax, built on Google Jax. It is essentially used internally to help Apple prototype products.So, it might not be entirely farfetched that Apple is looking into the technology and could eventually hop onto the bandwagon. But if Microsoft's ventures and advances are anything to go by, Apple should consider treading carefully before getting into this technology face-first. Because the technology is capital-intensive and users have seemingly lost interest, it should be enough for Apple to hit the brakes on AI. Besides, a source with close affiliations to Apple indicated that the company has reservations about venturing into the tech owing to the fact that it's “a pretty big miss internally.” Not forgetting its negative impact on the environment.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Do you think embracing AI is the right move for Apple right now?

Artists vs. Artificial Intelligence

Artists are constantly ripped off of their authentic work, from museum robberies to non-fungible tokens and, now, art generated by artificial intelligence (AI). It is no secret that the creative industry is competitive and pays next to nothing, so why are artists being targeted? While many people are excited about the development of AI art, others are scared about what it means for the future of their careers.AI AnalysisAs worried as artists are about AI, some are eagerly researching its applications and trying to discover everything it has in store. James ""Jim"" Porto, an RIT alum and assistant professor in the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences, talked about what he has discovered through his experimentation with AI. “If all that mattered was the result ... it’s a good result,” he started. “Working with it, though, is profoundly unsatisfying.” With over 30 years of experience using manipulated photography, Porto knows how much hard work goes into creating great artwork and how AI takes all of that away.“AI does what I was doing so much quicker, so much better ... but you don’t have as much control,"" Porto said. ""I’m really glad I’m not competing as a photo illustrator right now.”Wil Gross, a third year New Media Design student, had a similar thought.“I think art for the sake of art is garbage ... there is no human impression, and that’s what art is about,” Gross stated.Rip-off or Resourceful?Artists, professors and students alike are all navigating the balance between when and how to use AI, and if it should even be used at all. The consensus is that AI can be a great tool for artists to use during the creative process, such as for ideation and inspiration. In fact, many AI-powered tools are integrated into Illustrator, Photoshop and other editing programs.For instance, the ""Retype (Beta)"" tool in Illustrator allows editors to paste an image with typography and provides the closest font match. Another example is the ""Remove"" tool in Photoshop, which lets users brush over unwanted content with a similar replacement.""Art has meaning behind it,"" noted Sam Cazer, a second year New Media Design student. ""Only a human can create art, but AI will be another tool that artists or designers use.""Many students have already begun to explore and experiment with this new piece of technology, finding ways that it could help them, instead of hurt them.  “I prefer to use AI to enhance my projects,” said Alexa Contreras, a third year New Media Design student. “I think it can be used as a resource to take your work a step further or to think of new opportunities that you hadn’t thought of before. You can reference a lot of things that you might not have thought about.""Fear of the FutureImplementing AI as a tool proves resourceful when trying to make workflow more efficient, but this becomes controversial when using it in place of the work. This is where the fear of AI replacing artists' jobs starts. Porto and Cazer both mentioned how there was fear historically with the advent of photography. Painters were scared that photographers were going to take over their industry, but that never happened. Instead, painting and photography became their separate mediums, which is what Porto believes will happen with AI.""It's going to be its own medium,"" he stated. ""It's going to have the same market share, though. [AI] steps on the toes of photo illustrators."" Using AI as a tool proves to be resourceful when trying to make a workflow more efficient, but using it in place of the work is where controversy can arise Using AI as a tool proves to be resourceful when trying to make a workflow more efficient, but using it in place of the work is where controversy can arise This is where the fear of AI replacing people’s jobs stems from.  Porto and Cazer both expressed how this behavior happens historically with photography. Painters were scared that it was going to take over their industry. It didn’t. Instead, painting and photography became their own separate mediums, which is what Porto believes will happen with AI.“It’s going to be its own medium,” he stated. “It's going to have the same market share, though. [AI] steps on the toes of photo illustrators.” “It’s going to be its own medium,” he stated. “It's going to have the same market share, though. [AI] steps on the toes of photo illustrators.” This gets into what makes people afraid — how far is too far? AI is quick and efficient, and if it can create the same type of work photo illustrators and designers make, why hire someone else to do the work? The result lacks authenticity, but that is not a concern for corporations. Companies may be able to save time and money using AI, but the software lacks the fine-tuning that artists can achieve.Although it can be helpful, many artists are facing the reality of what their future careers may look like with the integration of AI. Jennifer Zhang, a fourth year Graphic Design student, talked about her fears with AI.“As a graphic design major, I’m worried about AI taking over and there are not as many jobs,"" Zhang said. ""Using [AI] will be super easy to do and the positions for a company might be taken by [it].” Silver Linings Ahead?With all that said, people are finding ways to make really cool, unique art with AI. Artists on Instagram, including Tim Tadder (@timtadder) and Joshua Vermillion (@joshuavermillion), are exploring the world — or “medium” — of AI and integrating their own style to create incredible work. They curate their inputs and prompts to replicate the style of work they did previous to AI. For some pieces, it is hard to tell the difference.So what does this mean? Are the creations they have made with AI truly their work? It is really hard to say, and as of now, numerous legal issues are projected to arise if AI were to be implemented commercially. But with the growing popularity of AI, we may start to see an increase in traditional art forms, such as photography and illustration. Despite the ease and accessibility of AI, it cannot create the same value of work that a human can, no matter how advanced it is. AI cannot capture the real moments, nor can it create the physical texture that oil paintings and charcoal drawings have.People still care and appreciate the hard work that artists do to express their craft, and with the inauthenticity of AI artwork, that appreciation and value is just going to increase. Although realistic, AI simply cannot match the human element of artwork.As Porto stated, “there’s a deadness to it, there’s a lack of soul, something off about it ... but it’s amazing.”

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Jobs that Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace.How Far Has AI Come?We all understand and believe in the game-changing nature of artificial intelligence that has permeated every aspect of our personal and professional lives. To quantify this understanding, PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study has highlighted the immense potential of AI, with a projected $15.7 trillion contribution to the global economy by 2030. This impact will also be translated into a 26% boost in GDP for local economies. Improvement in labor productivity and product enhancements are set to drive economic gains and stimulate consumer demand with increased personalization. China and North America are expected to lead with a contribution of $10.7 trillion, nearly 70% of the global impact. With this overwhelming potential, it was inevitable for artificial intelligence to have a role in the disruption of employment and jobs around the world.Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s recent Work Trend Index report based on interviews with 31,000 individuals across different markets, has highlighted the urgency of acquiring artificial intelligence skills. The report reveals that AI aptitude is critical for staying relevant in the workforce. Notably, 82% of business leaders believe employees must upskill to adapt to the AI age, but 60% of workers currently lack these necessary capabilities.In terms of the company’s developments in AI, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s new AI assistant, Microsoft 365 Copilot, is set to become available to users starting on November 1st. This assistant will summarize meetings in Microsoft Teams for those who choose not to attend and create documents and presentations. It uses technology similar to ChatGPT, which Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested in through OpenAI. Copilot costs $30 per month and operates online. While it's expected to improve productivity, some critics express concerns about potential job disruptions and over-reliance on AI tools. To read more about AI disruption, check our article about the industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies. On the other hand, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) allows users to generate images and written drafts from text prompts. This development will transform content creation by offering new tools for generating visual and written content. While Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is taking responsible steps to ensure its tools adhere to policies and guidelines, these AI-driven features can potentially disrupt and change creative and content-related professions. Story continuesThe disruption of AI is not just limited to jobs. In fact, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI is optimizing traffic lights in multiple cities, reducing wait times and emissions. Preliminary results indicate that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI has reduced stops by up to 30% and emissions by 10% for 30 million vehicles monthly. This AI development addresses a long-standing issue and makes urban life more sustainable.Future of the Ultimate Transition to Artificial IntelligenceRecent research reveals that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI development may soon consume an alarming amount of electricity, potentially rivaling the energy consumption of entire countries like Argentina, the Netherlands, or Sweden by 2027. The  research estimates that if Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) transitioned its entire search business to AI, it could use as much electricity as Ireland, reaching 29.3 terawatt-hours annually. However, this scenario assumes full-scale AI adoption using current hardware and software, which is faced by challenges like a limited supply of powerful GPUs. How Many Jobs will AI Replace By 2030?While the exact number of jobs AI will replace by 2030 may not be known but there are projections about the impact it will create. According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute study, nearly 12 million American workers may have to transition to new occupations by 2030, owing to the proliferation of AI with an aging population and the expansion of e-commerce. The study identifies that ai technologies could automate up to 30% of work hours in the US by 2030 and will affect roles in office support, customer service, and food services. It is also worth noting that positions in customer service and data entry are among the jobs already replaced by AI. Moreover, with the advent of self-checkouts, jobs in retail stores as cashiers have also been largely reduced. To read more about jobs AI will replace in the future, check our article Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.AI has evolved in several ways in recent years, with the industry now valued at over $100 billion. Heavyweights like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and OpenAI are in fierce competition, leading to the rapid development of sophisticated large language models. These models can outperform humans in different tasks, from strategy games to diagnosing cancers and composing music. However, they have not reached Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the point where AI possesses human-like cognitive abilities. AGI is still a goal as AI has limitations in creativity and emotional awareness. It is due to this very limitation that we have several jobs that artificial intelligence can not replace.20 Jobs that Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace A contractor working on home repairs, perfecting the details of a homeowner's dream. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9MethodologyTo list jobs that artificial intelligence can’t replace, we identified 3 common qualities that can make jobs resistant to AI. Firstly, jobs that involve complex and nuanced human interactions, like therapy and counseling, are far from being replaced by AI. Secondly, jobs that rely on creativity, innovation, and artistic expression, like artists, fashion designers, and chefs, are challenging for AI to replicate as they involve original thinking and personal expression. Lastly, jobs that demand specialized physical skills, dexterity, and expertise, such as surgeons, are generally less susceptible to AI replacement as they require precision and real-time decision-making with adaptability. To rank these jobs in order, we have scored these jobs out of a total score of 60 based on the representation of these three features on the basis of consensus from Reddit threads. A higher score indicates a lesser likelihood for the job being replaced by AI. The list is presented in ascending order. 20. Event PlannersIM Score: 20Event planners require human creativity and interpersonal skills to meet unique client needs and handle unforeseen circumstances. AI may assist with logistical tasks but can't replicate (even if it simulates) the emotional intelligence, intuition, and personal touch necessary for successful event planning.19. TeachersIM Score: 22While AI can provide information and assist in education or training, human teachers offer emotional support, adaptability to individual learning styles, and valuable mentorship. Teachers, especially vocational training teachers, foster creativity and precision, which AI cannot offer. It is one of the jobs least likely to be replaced by AI. 18. PlumbersIM Score: 24Plumbers deal with different and unstandardized plumbing systems, requiring problem-solving and adaptability. They must assess unique situations, account for local regulations, and consider the nuances of individual homes. AI lacks the human judgment necessary for plumbing tasks.17. ElectriciansIM Score:  26AI can't fully replace electricians because their job requires adapting to complex and unpredictable electrical systems, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring safety. Electricians also need to interact with clients, making interpersonal skills and judgment vital areas where AI struggles.16. Welder and MouldersIM Score: 28These professionals work on different projects with varying materials, thicknesses, and shapes, demanding precise control and expertise. They must make real-time adjustments based on visual and tactile feedback, which AI currently struggles to replicate accurately. Welding and molding also require creativity and innovation in problem-solving for complex, non-standard projects. It is worth mentioning that underwater welders have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. 15. Agricultural Equipment OperatorsIM Score: 30Agriculture often involves intricate decision-making based on weather conditions, soil quality, and crop maturity, requiring human judgment. Moreover, agriculture often involves working in unstructured, dynamic environments where AI rarely performs reliably. Reinforcement learning is one technique used to train AI models on such tasks and the technique is rife with challenges, namely, getting the model to learn optimal behavior.14. Clergy and Religious LeadersIM Score: 34Artificial intelligence lacks the human qualities of ""spirituality"" and moral judgment that are essential for clergy and religious leaders. These roles involve personal and emotional connections, guiding individuals through faith and life's complexities. It is one of the jobs that artificial intelligence can’t replace. 13. NursesIM Score: 35Nurses offer emotional support, administer medication for patients, and make swift, ethical decisions. Since human touch and intuition are vital in nursing, AI can't fully replicate these capabilities. Besides, when one is sick, the warmth of human support becomes essential. Thus, nursing is one of the jobs AI will probably never replace. 12. Personal Shoppers and StylistsIM Score: 39Personal shoppers and stylists involve intricate human understanding of fashion trends and personal preferences. AI may assist with suggestions but can't grasp unique individual styles, emotions, and cultural nuances. It is one of the jobs AI can’t replace, not even chatGPT. 11. Chefs and Culinary ExpertsIM Score: 40Artificial intelligence can never replace culinary experts owing to the nuanced artistry, innovation, and sensory experiences of these professionals, which AI can not achieve. It can assist in recipe generation and optimization but can't match their holistic culinary expertise.10. Fashion DesignerIM Score: 42Artificial intelligence in fashion design lacks the intuition and cultural awareness that human designers possess. It can analyze data and generate designs but can't add the artistic flair and trend-setting oomph that make fashion designers uniquely creative and adaptable to ever-changing styles and tastes.9. Emergency RespondersIM Score: 44AI cannot replace emergency responders like firefighters because their roles demand quick physical responses to rapidly changing, life-threatening situations. Firefighters require complex decision-making and physical strength, mostly under unpredictable circumstances. It is one of the jobs that artificial intelligence can’t replace. 8. MusiciansIM Score: 46The job of artists like musicians is unlikely to be fully replaced by AI because creativity, emotion, and the ability to convey relatable human experiences are integral to art. For example, AI can compose music, but it can't infuse it with the personal experiences and emotions that make it truly meaningful.7. Social WorkersIM Score: 47AI can't fully replace social workers due to their role's deeply human and emotionally sensitive aspects. Social work entails understanding and addressing complex, personal, and often traumatic situations. It is one of the jobs that won't be automated by AI. 6. CarpentersIM Score: 48Carpenters create custom woodwork and structures, demanding creativity, craftsmanship, and adaptability. It is one of the jobs AI can’t replace anytime soon. Click here to see the 5 Jobs that Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace.Suggested Articles:25 Highest-Paying Jobs for 18-year-olds20 Highest-Paying Part-Time Jobs For College Students30 High-Paying Remote Jobs Without a Degree or ExperienceDisclosure: None. 20 Jobs that Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace is originally published on Insider Monkey.

Guardians of Genius: Securing Tomorrow’s Generative AI via Copyright Protection


By Swati Sharma & Nityesh Dadhich on October 23, 2023
Posted in Copyright




         

   
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

Gen-AI tools and the Copyright violation of an Unprecedented Scale
Data is the new oil of the 21st century. We all generate data in our daily lives, and their misuse by AI developers have often been criticised. Firstly, the AI developers have been criticized of unauthorised “web scarping” i.e. taking users’ data without their consent.[4] It is alleged that OpenAI scarped over 300 billion words from the internet, including “articles, websites, books, posts, including personal information obtained without users’ consent”[5] to train their software. In USA, the courts have recognized data as a ‘property’, therefore, such scarping raises allegations of data misappropriation and theft.[6]
Secondly, even if we upload a picture or any other data over the internet for public access such as on our blog or social media profile, we still maintain a reasonable expectation of ensuring our data to be safe and secure. In KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court recognised right to privacy as a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. If our data is used for training AI software without our specific consent then such negligent act results in the breach of trust, and it is an intrusion upon our privacy.[8]
Thirdly, the data generated by children and their privacy concerns stand at a separate pedestal. They stand at higher risk of abuse, discrimination, and exploitation. Unfortunately, AI lacks sufficient tools to prevent children from accessing their portal. In USA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) forbids monitoring, collecting data or using information from children unless valid parents’/guardian consent is obtained. Unfortunately, such provisions are missing in India, with self-reporting as the only check available, which is not effective.[9]
Fourthly, AI software(s) have also produced false or inaccurate paragraphs when they are asked to cite a specific author’s work, such as a poem. Such false result causes misinformation to the public, and it also hampers the moral rights of the authors by distorting their works.[10] The subsequent section shall answer how the Courts are addressing these concerns, thereby, giving a direction to the future course of copyright jurisprudence.
Judicial Intelligence to address the conundrum of Generative Artificial Intelligence
“Machine learning is no excuse to break the law…the data used to improve algorithms must be lawfully collected and lawfully retained”[11]
OpenAI claims that the data fed for AI training and execution is covered under the fair-use exception.[12] For instance, Section 52 of India’s Copyright Act, 1957 lays down certain fair usage exceptions such as “reading or recitation in public of reasonable extracts from a published literary or dramatic work” when extended to digital context[13]; or “the reproduction, for the purpose of research”[14], inter alia. Similarly, the US Jurisprudence determines fair usage based upon the following four factors[15]:  

Firstly, the purpose and character of the usage, whether it is commercial or educational. In Campbell v. Acuff Rose Music, the Court held that the protection would strengthen if the work is “transformative” i.e. if it supersedes the original creation, or adds something new, rather than merely being “expressive”.[16]
Secondly, the substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. For instance, OpenAI has claimed that the training material is not made public, rather it is the new content developed upon such material that is made available. Hence, they claim that the program is transformative.
Thirdly, the effect of the use upon the relevant market, or the value of the product within the relevant market. For instance, OpenAI claims that since the data set is consumed by the machines without presenting it to the humans, the authors would not lose any potential audience. However, New York Times, inter alia, is considering a legal action against OpenAI as the AI tool has “greatly diminished the need to visit the publisher’s website”.[17]
Fourthly, the determination involves consideration of the nature of the copyrighted work as well[18]. For instance, in Andy Warhol v. Goldsmith, the court held that if the secondary work shares the same or highly similar purpose, and if the secondary work is used for commercial purpose, then the justification of fair-use becomes especially difficult unless compelling reasons exist.[19]

Now, once the user’s query has generated an output, the US Courts then rely upon a two-pronged test to determine any copyright infringement in the result. The burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that, firstly, the software had “access to their works” to indicate the actual copying of the underlying work; and secondly, the software created a “substantially” similar output. Here, the second aspect is difficult to determine as it involves the consideration of various factors such as “similar concept and feel” or “overall look and feel” or the inability of an ordinary/ reasonable person to differentiate between the two works.[20] This is a subjective determination for each output produced by the AI software in response to the user’s query.
This suggests that both the AI user (whose search query generated the infringing content) and the AI company (which provided such platform) could be potentially liable for the copyright infringement. OpenAI argues that their AI systems “generally do not regenerate unaltered data from any particular work in their training corpus”[21]. Yet, despite OpenAI’s best claim, they may still be liable under “vicarious liability” if they failed to prevent an infringement.[22]
Moving on, the next section deals with the issues concerning the authorship of AI-generated texts, and it brings out clarity regarding the developing Indian jurisprudence. 
Indian Jurisprudence on GenAI – Past, Present and the Future
The US Copyright Office only recognises the work “created by humans” as eligible for protection.[23] The initial ownership goes to the creator of the work, and non-human authors have been denied copyright protection.[24] Broadly, a similar position ensues in India. Section 2(d) of the Copyright Act, 1957 defines an “author” in relation to computer generated work as any “person” who causes the work to be generated. Section 13 requires that such work must be “original”, however, the word “original” is not defined in the statute. The Indian Copyright Office has been uncertain about extending the protection to AI generated content. It has earlier issued a withdrawal notice where AI was a co-author with a natural person.[25]
The 161st Parliamentary Standing Committee Report found that the Copyright Act, 1957 is “not well equipped to facilitate authorship and ownership by Artificial Intelligence”.[26] For instance, Section 16 of the Act specifically provides that “no person” shall be entitled to the copyright protection, except in accordance to the provisions of this Act. However, the Report suggested that ‘patent protection’ should be extended to AI-generated works to “incentivize innovation and R&D”.[27] We suggest that this reasoning should be further extended to copyright protection for AI-generated content to encourage creativity and to enhance AI-based expressions.
Furthermore, Section 12 of India’s recent Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 dated 11th August 2023, lays down the “right to be forgotten”. It mandates the removal of the user’s personal data upon his/her request. This can act as an easy mechanism for removal of the copyright infringing material. However, practical concerns arise as once the AI-software is trained on a data set, it cannot “unlearn” itself.[28] For instance, ChatGPT’s opt-out function from data collection would only turn off the chat history. It means old data continues to be a part of the training, and only the new content is not used for “training purposes”. It does not provide any method to remove the previously fed data.[29] This is especially concerning as AI-tools are now being integrated on several platforms such as web-browsers, etc., enabling real time information upon each click.
The Indian Courts have been proactive in restraining the misuse of AI tools for copyright infringement. In Anil Kapoor v. Simply Life India[30], the Court issued injunction against the use of Artificial Intelligence to create fake, morphed content, especially for commercial purposes. It aimed to protect the personality rights of the individual. In Mareta v. Google Inc[31], the US District Court held that remedial measures such as to prevent copyright infringement and privacy protection must be construed broadly to include “new technologies”. This underlying idea for rapid evolution has been accepted by the Indian Courts as well. However, as the 161st Parliamentary Report suggested “there is a need to review the provisions of [the Copyright Act] on a priority basis”.[32]
Conclusion and Recommendation
AI-generated content is a reality, and it is penetrating deeper into our lives with each passing moment. This creates an urgent need to bring up comprehensive discussions on the elephant in the room. We reiterate the suggestions of the 161st Parliamentary Report to “create a separate category of rights for AI and AI related works”.[33] Furthermore, discussion must be initiated on the feasibility of the following suggestions:  firstly, to establish an independent AI Council for approval/ rejection of AI-platforms. Such body would be a ‘“Certification Board” for AI platforms, evaluating them on pre-defined standards. Secondly, to create and implement accountability platforms. AI Platforms such as GPT-4 are monetised, and any copyright infringement must involve monetary compensation for violation of rights, while adhering to our ethical principles. Thirdly, there is a need for effective transparency and cybersecurity protocols involving disclosure of data, and ensuring the right to erasure, in light of Section 12 of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.  Fourthly, to set up an AI Fund for immediate redressal of any future infringement, and to ensure penal provision to prevent the misuse of children’s data, and to protect the Right to Privacy granted under Article 21.[34]
