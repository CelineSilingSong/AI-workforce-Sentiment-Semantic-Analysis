More than four in 10 translators said that their income has decreased because of generative AI, while more than three-quarters believe the emerging technology will negatively affect their future income.The SoA, the UK’s largest trade union for writers, illustrators and translators, ran the survey in January. It found that 37% of translators had used generative AI to support their work, and 8% used it because they were asked by their publisher or commissioning organisation.Thomas Bunstead, whose translations from Spanish include The Book of All Loves by Agustín Fernández Mallo, said it is important to draw a distinction between literary translators and “commercial” translators. “Though a third of translators have responded to the SoA survey saying they think they’ve lost work to AI already, literary translation remains in the hands of humans,” he said. “The work that has presumably been handed over to AI will be the kind of uncomplicated bread-and-butter stuff which doesn’t require so much nuance,” such as instruction manuals.“Idiomatic, knotty and complex writing,” is likely to remain with human translators, agrees Nichola Smalley, whose translations from Swedish and Norwegian include A System So Magnificent It Is Blinding by Amanda Svensson. “But perhaps the people translating crime and romance novels who are currently getting less work due to AI will all start getting into the complex stuff and we’ll all be fighting for space in that niche. I hope not!”Ian Giles, the co-chair of the Translators Association whose translations from Scandinavian languages into English include the forthcoming The Cuckoo by Camilla Läckberg, said that his income from commercial translation work has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2023. The loss of non-literary streams of income for literary translators will mean the “raising of the bar to entry into the industry, with only those with wealth able to translate literature for publication”. He also said that cost-cutting is not confined to non-literary translation – a publisher specialising in ebooks and audiobooks for which he previously translated has switched to a process known as post-editing, when an AI translator has a first go at translating a text before a human editor checks it and makes tweaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

CEO Robert Casten Carlberg said that “integrating AI into the translators’ toolbox” will enhance productivity “without sacrificing creativity or quality”.However, Smalley said there are concerns that post-editing can create “a lot more work” for translators, who have to carefully compare texts to catch misreadings and “poor or unidiomatic” style. “Colleagues who have done this kind of post-editing work say that it requires a far higher degree of attention, because the AI generated text often reads so plausibly,” she said.The survey results come in the wake of a boom in popularity of translated books, highlighted Bunstead. He added that “translators, like all freelancers, can go through lean periods. They won’t always know for certain the reasons why, but AI is currently the obvious explanation. A few years ago Brexit insularity was the root of all our money worries.”Of the 787 SoA members who responded – including writers of fiction and nonfiction, scriptwriters, poets and journalists, as well as illustrators and translators – 94% reported wanting credit or compensation when their work is used to develop generative AI tools. In light of the survey, the SoA said that there is an “urgent need” for government regulation of AI tools to ensure they are developed and used “ethically and lawfully”.“I’m certain that the act of creative and literary translation will live on in one shape or another,” said Giles. “For many there is a deep-seated desire to translate and I also believe there is an audience that desires human-translated content.”Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingArtificial intelligence (AI)Fiction in translationnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

Generative AI doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The rapid advancements we’ve seen in generative AI over the past year or so have been made possible by other tech breakthroughs. Cloud computing, for example, democratizes access to AI technologies. 5G amplifies the potential of generative AI by facilitating real-time analytics and AI processing. And the Internet of Things provides a rich source of data for generative AI models to mine.


In other words, generative AI has been aided and influenced by many other technologies. But what about the flip side? How might generative AI itself accelerate other technologies? Here are a few predictions.

Generative AI In The Metaverse
Whether you’re on board with the metaverse or not, there’s no denying that the concept of immersive digital spaces where we can work, game, socialize, shop, and learn is compelling. Generative AI could enhance metaverse environments by enabling automatic content creation on the fly. As an example, imagine playing a VR game with unique characters and challenges being created in real time, just for you. Generative AI can power features like this in the metaverse, crafting more immersive, personalized experiences for gamers and other metaverse users.

PROMOTED
Just as most businesses today have a website and social media presence, in the future I believe most will have some sort of metaverse presence – be it a virtual shop, an immersive brand experience, or a virtual campus for employees to visit. Generative AI could prove to be a valuable tool for any business that wants to create a metaverse presence. After all, generative AI solutions can write computer code as well as create content – which means businesses could, in theory, design their own immersive 3D metaverse spaces simply by telling a generative AI tool what they want to build.

Get Ready For AI-Equipped Robots
Generative AI will also influence robotics by enabling the development of robots that can learn and adapt to new tasks dynamically. This will help to create more autonomous robots – and broaden the range of tasks that robots can undertake. For instance, the robots of the future will be capable not just of impressive physical feats, but also having natural conversations with humans and making complex decisions. In other words, generative AI will help to make robots intelligent.

This will likely expand the range of jobs impacted by AI automation. So far, generative AI enables us to automate certain cognitive and creative tasks, including some of the work done by designers, teachers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as construction, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of generative AI transformation – at least for now. But combine generative AI with robots and that may change. We could see AI-equipped robots working in all sorts of sectors, such as factory floors, retail stores, hotels, and construction sites.

Combining Materials Science And Generative AI
Generative AI is already beginning to play a role in the discovery and design of new materials. How? By simulating various properties, analyzing vast datasets, and applying predictive analysis to project outcomes. Basically, generative AI can help to reduce the trial-and-error involved in material discovery and design.

This will aid and expedite the discovery of materials with novel properties. It will enable rapid prototyping of new materials, and even enable materials to be more easily customized for specific industries and applications.
Accelerating Synthetic Biology And Gene Technology
As with materials science, generative AI also promises much for synthetic biology and gene technology, acting as a catalyst in the synthesis of novel biological systems (and the refinement of existing ones). By leveraging vast datasets derived from genomic sequences and biological research, generative AI models can predict the potential outcomes of genetic alterations, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of research and innovation.
This could benefit our world in several ways. For one thing, it could lead to a new era of personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailor-made to suit an individual’s genetic makeup. Or it could aid the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) designed to enhance crop yield, nutritional value, and resistance to pests.
Hooking The Brain Up To ChatGPT? Introducing Brain-Computer Interfaces
Brain-computer interfaces – devices that allow the human brain to communicate directly with a computer, for example, via an implant or chip – may sound like science fiction. But companies like Neuralink are already working on such interfaces.
Combine brain-computer interfaces with generative AI and the possibilities are truly mind-blowing. You could, for example, have access to the entire internet instantly from your brain, and need only think of a question to be presented with the AI’s answer. It’s astonishing stuff – the ultimate merger between humans and machines.
The key takeaway is that we’re at a critical inflection point, where multiple groundbreaking technologies are coming together. From now on we will continue to see massive acceleration of machine intelligence – and we can expect that to accelerate other cutting-edge technologies in turn.

A new report on generative AI reveals that most service professionals believe GenAI will be a large part of their future — and the work to prepare for that needs to begin now

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is no longer the technology of the future — it is here now. The process of integrating GenAI systems into daily work — and figuring out what that means for the future of professional work — has begun.
Professionals in service industries such as legal, tax & accounting, risk & fraud, and government operations have long adapted to new ways of working, at varying degrees and to differing extents. Upon ChatGPT’s initial public release in late-2022, however, GenAI and related technologies have promised a more disruptive potential. Indeed, GenAI offers the opportunity to create entirely new content, in plain language or easy-to-understand images, in a way that mimics human output in a fraction of the time.
To dig into the potential GenAI revolution and its impact on how professional service work is done, the Thomson Reuters Institute recently published its 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services report. The survey was conduct online with 1,128 respondents in January and February 2024. Respondents were screened to ensure that they were familiar with GenAI technology and were located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Interestingly, the report found that while GenAI usage is currently not widespread, many professionals believe that GenAI can and should be used in the future — and many of their organizations are already making preparations for that reality.
The current state of GenAI
As the report shows, GenAI use is still in its nascent stages, with many more organizations exploring the technology than actively using it on a daily basis. About one-quarter of the report’s survey respondents said their organizations were already using GenAI or had active plans to use it, with usage higher among all legal and corporate risk & fraud respondents than for tax & accounting or government respondents.
Almost one-third of all respondents said their organizations were still considering whether or not to use GenAI. This could be one-off usage of public platforms such as ChatGPT, but increasingly, this also includes tools built specifically for industry use cases — such as legal research or drafting tools, or those that could spot accounting irregularities or aid in tax return preparation, risk assessment, and compliance reporting.
At the same time, the report shows that many service professionals are still figuring how to integrate GenAI into their daily work product and into their overall business plans as well, with no uniform answer among legal and tax professionals as to how they plan to approach GenAI costs and whether GenAI will cause their rates to raise.
Looking to the future
For all the questions currently surrounding GenAI, there is a growing feeling that its presence will continue to be felt for years, across all industries.
In fact, early sentiments skewed positively towards GenAI’s impact on professional services. A large portion of respondents (44%) said they were hopeful or excited about GenAI’s introduction into their industry, while more than one-third of respondents (35%) said they were hesitant, and 18% said they were concerned or fearful.

This sentiment is reflected in how many believe GenAI can and should be used for work in their respective industries. A large majority (81%) said GenAI can be applied to their work, while fewer (54%) said they believe GenAI should be applied to their work. These figures are slightly higher than the responses to a similar question asked of for legal and tax professionals in a previous survey done in Spring 2023.
Further, among those respondents who said they believe GenAI should be applied to their work, many focused particularly on the business impact of the technology. Tax industry respondents, for example, pointed to increasing efficiency and productivity, streamlining work processes, and improving quality and accuracy of work. Legal industry respondents, meanwhile, pointed to GenAI’s potential for cost savings, its ability to allow professionals to spend more time on high-value tasks, and its capacity to aid in quality control checks.
Overall, the 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services report illustrates how the professional services market is reacting quickly to a potentially disruptive force in GenAI. Although its true impact may seem a proposition for far in the future, planning for its impact now is critical.
As our research shows, those proactive organizations that have already begun to explore how GenAI will change the future of their work will gain a distinctive advantage of those organizations without such inclination or planning.

THE TUC special taskforce report on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Employment Rights Bill is published today, April 18. Comprising of the TUC, the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, unions academics and employment rights specialists the taskforce was set up to try to secure proper regulation of AI and algorithmic management to halt Britain’s tech sector from becoming the “wild west” of the economy. The report makes several key recommendations including a legal requirement for employers to consult unions on the use of “high risk” and intrusive forms of AI in the workplace; a legal right for job seekers and workers to have a human review of decisions made by AI systems so they can challenge AI decisions that are unfair and discriminatory; amendments to the Equality Act to guard against discriminatory algorithms; protections against unfair dismissal by AI; a prohibition on some uses of emotion recognition technology and a right to a personalised explanation of high-risk risk decisions made by AI workers in Britain’s media, digital and tech sector, accounting for over two million jobs will be on the AI front line. One of the key problems is that union membership in the tech sector remains stubbornly low in many countries, with a diverse employment base — from large corporations to small start-ups — many with precarious and third-party employment. From the 1980s onwards unions tried to recruit new members in tech areas by setting up specialist ‘associations' to attract tech workers or using high profile  campaigns imported from USA where “start up unions” such alliance@ibm (which joined the Communication Workers of America) in global companies. What sounded good failed to achieve mass union membership after years of grinding management opposition, and “re-balancing the workforce”. But maybe things have turned the corner. In 2023 workers at the Swedish fin-tech company Klarna demanded representation and collective bargaining by joining Unionen. The company told the workforce collective bargaining “did not fit their business model.” The Unionen union organised immediate strike action and 5,000 workers in Stockholm won union recognition and a collective agreement. In the US workers in the video gaming company Sega of America followed Raven Software, Blizzard Albany, ZeniMax, and game developer Tender Claws in winning union recognition. AEGIS-CWA (Allied Employees Guild Improving SEGA — Communication Workers of America) organised across Sega facilities including workers in marketing, product development and sales to build membership and making it now the largest video game union in the US. In Romania, Sindicatul IT Timisoara (SITT the Romanian IT Union) now represents 3,000 tech and outsourced workers at Alcatel-Lucent, Wipro, Accenture and Alto and were helped in organising by the European Union federation Uni Europa. In Britain the CWU, via the United Tech and Allied Workers Union Branch, is organising workers in Apple stores; the white-collar union Prospect has launched a tech sector and Unite’s London Digital and Tech branch has seen a membership boost since 2023. James Bowen the secretary of the Unite London Digital and Tech branch told me: “The branch had doubled in size over due to organising in ‘big tech’ firms such as Google. We’ve also grown at firms where we were well established, such as Voyix and Atleos thanks to the work of our Representative during pay negotiations. We are recruiting members from a diverse range of companies such as Accenture, the BBC, Cap Gemini and Computacenter.” The branch organised protests at Google at its Kings Cross HQ in London over redundancies which gained a national profile — and increased union membership. 2023 was a pivotal year with over a quarter-of-a-million workers in tech industries globally laid off. So far in 2024, there have been layoffs at Pixar, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and TikTok among others.
Microsoft’s 1,900 global layoffs in January this year have made tech workers “union conscious.” The fact is they are no different to other workers — they join unions for protection and representation, and to find collective and just solutions to problems.” And the good news, Bowen says, is “that members are keeping up their membership even when the threat of lay offs recedes.” He says AI will be a major challenge: “AI can replace a real person and workers become concerned for their jobs. Service desk, first-line roles which are heavily scripted can be replaced by an online chatbot. AI can be used to write code, reducing the number of software developers required so there are fears over job security.”
And there are fears over AI discrimination: “People have biases and this impacts the many choices that are made when building and training an AI whose purpose is to make decisions which impacts people’s lives. There’s a good argument to be made that AI should not make any management decisions.” The branch is also running meetings for tech workers on AI with speakers from Equity, the performing arts and entertainment union, on the impact of AI on voice-over artists. “Clare Vernade an ex-member of ours who now teaches ‘machine learning’ has done a session and were are happy to share our experiences and the video of Clare’s presentation is available on our site. Other Unite reps have been in touch with us wanting to discuss how we are handling AI.” On April 25, in partnership with Media North and the Festival Of Debate, Unite national officer for the print, media, digital and tech sector, Louisa Bull, along with the NUJ general secretary Michelle Stannistreet will run the session AI: Threats And Opportunities For The Media — see www.festivalofdebate.com to book your place.

Artificial Intelligence is the process of building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data. Systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform human-like tasks. It enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human efforts. AI uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make decisions on their own. Machine Learning and Deep learning forms the core of Artificial Intelligence. 

AI is now being used in almost every sector of business:
Transportation
Healthcare
Banking
Retail
Entertainment
E-Commerce
Now that you know what AI really is, let’s look at what are the different types of artificial intelligence?
Check out:Best AI and ML courses 
Types of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence can be broadly classified into several types based on capabilities, functionalities, and technologies. Here's an overview of the different types of AI:
1. Based on Capabilities
Narrow AI (Weak AI)
This type of AI is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car). Most current AI systems, including those that can play complex games like chess and Go, fall under this category. They operate under a limited pre-defined range or set of contexts.
General AI (Strong AI)
A type of AI endowed with broad human-like cognitive capabilities, enabling it to tackle new and unfamiliar tasks autonomously. Such a robust AI framework possesses the capacity to discern, assimilate, and utilize its intelligence to resolve any challenge without needing human guidance.
Superintelligent AI
This represents a future form of AI where machines could surpass human intelligence across all fields, including creativity, general wisdom, and problem-solving. Superintelligence is speculative and not yet realized.
2. Based on Functionalities
Reactive Machines
These AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions. They analyze and respond to different situations. IBM's Deep Blue, which beat Garry Kasparov at chess, is an example.
Limited Memory
These AI systems can make informed and improved decisions by studying the past data they have collected. Most present-day AI applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars, fall into this category.
Theory of Mind
This is a more advanced type of AI that researchers are still working on. It would entail understanding and remembering emotions, beliefs, needs, and depending on those, making decisions. This type requires the machine to understand humans truly.
Self-aware AI
This represents the future of AI, where machines will have their own consciousness, sentience, and self-awareness. This type of AI is still theoretical and would be capable of understanding and possessing emotions, which could lead them to form beliefs and desires.

Machine Learning (ML)
AI systems capable of self-improvement through experience, without direct programming. They concentrate on creating software that can independently learn by accessing and utilizing data.
Deep Learning
A subset of ML involving many layers of neural networks. It is used for learning from large amounts of data and is the technology behind voice control in consumer devices, image recognition, and many other applications.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This AI technology enables machines to understand and interpret human language. It's used in chatbots, translation services, and sentiment analysis applications.
Robotics
This field involves designing, constructing, operating, and using robots and computer systems for controlling them, sensory feedback, and information processing.
Computer Vision
This technology allows machines to interpret the world visually, and it's used in various applications such as medical image analysis, surveillance, and manufacturing.
Expert Systems
These AI systems answer questions and solve problems in a specific domain of expertise using rule-based systems.

That was a research question addressed by MIT Sloan Professor Danielle Li at a recent session of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER) weekly seminar series.
On April 9, Li gave a presentation based on her National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper “Generative AI at Work,” coauthored with Erik Brynjolfsson, the Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Professor and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, and Lindsey Raymond, a doctoral candidate at MIT Sloan. Li is an Associate Professor of  Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Strategic Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as a Faculty Research Fellow at NBER.

MIT Sloan Associate Professor Danielle Li
Li, Brynjolfsson, and Raymond studied the rollout of an AI conversational support tool for workers providing technical customer support via chat for a Fortune 500 company that sells software products to small businesses. The tool was rolled out in the workplace in 2020 and 2021, and the researchers were able to analyze data from 3 million chats involving 5179 customer support workers, including 1.2 million chats involving 1636 workers after they had access to the AI tool.
This AI tool offered conversational suggestions and links to resources to the workers providing customer support, but the workers had the choice about whether or not to adopt the tool’s suggestions. Li explained that not all of the tool’s suggestions were great, so workers didn’t blindly follow its advice; in fact, they adhered to only about 38% of the tool’s suggestions, on average.
Overall, access to the new tool increased worker productivity by about 14% on average, with the productivity gains concentrated among lower-skill, newer workers. For the most skilled workers, the efficiency gains from the tool were close to zero. By using the tool, “newer workers move down the experience curve faster,” Li explained, noting that such generative AI tools learn from the behavior of better workers and disseminate those best practices to lower-skilled workers.
There were also some signs that tips from the AI tool made a difficult job more pleasant: Customers swore less at workers and were less likely to ask to speak to a manager, and worker turnover decreased. With the AI tool’s assistance, newer workers get yelled at less frequently by unhappy customers, Li said.

Large language models (LLMs) fall into a category called foundation models. Language models take language input and generate synthesized output. Foundation models work with multiple data types. They are multimodal, meaning they work in other modes besides language.







This enables businesses to draw new connections across data types and expand the range of tasks that AI can be used for. As a starting point, a company can use foundation models to create custom generative AI models, using a tool such as LangChain, with features tailored to its use case.
The GPT-n class of LLMs has become a prime example of this. The release of powerful LLMs such as GPT-4 spurred discussions of artificial general intelligence -- basically, saying that AI can do anything. Since its release, numerous applications powered by GPTs have been created.
GPT-4 and other foundation models are trained on a broad corpus of unlabeled data and can be adapted to many tasks. That's what makes it a foundation model.

What is a foundation model?
Foundation models are a new paradigm in AI system development. AI was previously trained on task-specific data to perform a narrow range of functions.
A foundation model is a large-scale machine learning model trained on a broad data set that can be adapted and fine-tuned for a wide variety of applications and downstream tasks. Foundation models are known for their generality and adaptability.
GPT-4, Dall-E 2 and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are all foundation models. The term was coined by authors at the Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models and Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) in a 2021 paper called ""On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models.""
The authors of the paper stated: ""While many of the iconic foundation models at the time of writing are language models, the term language model is simply too narrow for our purpose: as we describe, the scope of foundation models goes well beyond language.""
The name foundation model underscores the fundamental incompleteness of the models, according to the paper. They are the foundation for specific spinoff models that are trained to accomplish a narrower, more specialized set of tasks. The authors of the Stanford HAI paper stated: ""We also chose the term 'foundation' to connote the significance of architectural stability, safety, and security: poorly constructed foundations are a recipe for disaster and well-executed foundations are a reliable bedrock for future applications.""


Characteristics of foundation models
The main traits of foundation models include the following:

Scale. To make foundation models powerful, there are three ingredients that enable scale for foundation models:



Hardware improvements. GPUs, which power foundation models' chips, have significantly increased throughput and memory.
Transformer model architecture. Transformers are the machine learning model architecture that powers many language models, such as BERT and GPT-4.
Data availability. There is a lot of data for these models to train on and learn from. Foundation models need large quantities of unstructured data to train.



Traditional training. Foundation models use traditional machine learning training methods, such as a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning, or reinforcement learning from human feedback.
Transfer learning. By using knowledge learned from one task and applying it to another, models use transfer learning on surrogate tasks and then fine-tune to a specific one. Pretraining is the type of transfer learning used in the GPT-n series of language models.
Emergence. Model behavior is induced rather than explicitly constructed. The model produces results that are not directly related to any one mechanism in the model.
Homogenization. Homogenization means that a wide range of applications could be powered by a single generic learning algorithm. The same underlying method is used in many domains. The Stanford Institute HAI paper stated that almost all state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models are adapted from one of only a few foundation models.



Examples of foundation model applications
Foundation models are fine-tuned to create apps. GPT-3 and GPT-4 have become the basis for many applications in the short time they've been around, with ChatGPT being the most notable. A paper from researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch and the University of Pennsylvania posited that GPTs -- the AI model -- exhibit qualities of general-purpose technologies. General-purpose technologies, such as the steam engine, printing press and GPTs, are characterized by widespread proliferation, continuous improvement and the generation of complementary innovations. These complementary technologies can work with, support or build on top of the GPT.
The paper's findings showed that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the U.S. could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality.



One example of a foundation model is Microsoft's Florence, which is used to provide production-ready computer vision services in Azure AI Vision. The application uses the model to analyze images, read text and detect faces with prebuilt image tagging.
Sweden is attempting to build a foundational LLM for all major languages in the Nordic region: Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Faroese. It would be used primarily by the public sector. The Swedish consortium running the project has gained access to the supercomputer Berzelius, along with hardware and software help from Nvidia. The model is still in development, but early versions are available on Hugging Face.
Hugging Face is an open source repository of many LLMs, sort of like a GitHub for AI. It provides tools that enable users to build, train and deploy machine learning models.


How are foundation models used?
Foundation models serve as the base for more specific applications. A business can take a foundation model, train it on its own data and fine-tune it to a specific task or a set of domain-specific tasks.
Several platforms, including Amazon SageMaker, IBM Watsonx, Google Cloud Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure AI provide organizations with a service for building, training and deploying AI models.
For example, an organization could use one of these platforms to take a model from Hugging Face, train the model on its proprietary data and fine-tune the model using prompt engineering.


Opportunities and challenges of foundation models
Foundation models are multimodal because they have multiple capabilities, including language, audio and vision.
Because of their general adaptability, foundation models could provide numerous opportunities and use cases in a variety of different industries, including the following:

Healthcare. In this industry, foundation models show promise for generative tasks, such as drug discovery. An IBM foundation model -- Controlled Generation of Molecules, better known as CogMol -- recently generated a set of new COVID-19 antivirals using a common architecture called a variational autoencoder. IBM's MoLFormer-XL is another foundation model currently being used by Moderna to design messenger RNA medicines.
Law. Law uses generative tasks that foundation models could help with. However, they currently lack the reasoning ability to generate truthful documents. If they could be developed to show provenance and guarantee factuality, then they would be beneficial in this field.
Education. Education is a complex domain that requires nuanced human interaction to understand students' goals and learning styles. There are many individual data streams in education that together are too limited to train foundation models. Still, foundation models could be broadly applicable to generative tasks, such as problem generation.

Despite their broad potential, foundation models pose many challenges, including the following:

Bias. Because foundation models stem from only a core few technologies, inherent biases due to social or moral issues in those few models might spread through every AI application.
System. Computer systems are a key bottleneck for scaling model size and data quantity. Training foundation models might require a prohibitively large amount of memory. The training is expensive and computationally intensive.
Data availability. Foundation models need access to large amounts of training data to function. If that data is cut off or restricted, they don't have the fuel to function.
Security. Foundation models represent a single point of failure, which makes them a viable target for cyberattackers.
Environment. It takes a large environmental toll to train and run large foundation models, like GPT-4.
Emergence. The outcomes of foundation models can be difficult to trace back to a particular step in the creation process.



Foundation model research
""On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models"" is just one of the influential research papers about foundation models. AI research is being published at a significant clip. Here are some other foundational AI research papers to know about:

""Attention Is All You Need."" This paper introduced the transformer architecture, which became a new standard in AI systems using NLP.
""BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding."" This paper introduced BERT, which became a widely used language model for pretraining.
""Language Models are Few-Shot Learners."" This paper introduced GPT-3, which laid the groundwork for ChatGPT. GPT-3 could perform a wide range of NLP tasks with little to no task-specific training.
""DALL-E: Creating Images from Text."" This paper was the basis of Dall-E, an AI that generates images from natural language output.

Why Is Generative AI Important?
Generative AI is important because it takes AI in a more mature direction, making the technology more accessible and useful to a larger audience.
Individuals can make use of this technology in their daily lives at little to no cost. More important, breakthrough innovations in areas like medical imaging and drug discovery are now possible to develop at scale because of generative AI.
Finally, this technology can better define, contextualize, and automate business operational tasks than previous types of AI ever could, making this a technology that is already being applied to and ripe for more enterprise use cases.
How Does Generative AI Work?
Depending on what users are trying to generate, generative AI works through different types of large AI large language models that undergo extensive training with massive datasets and deep learning algorithms on an ongoing basis.
This type of training allows generative AI tools to pull data-driven knowledge from all corners of the web and other resources, which makes it possible for these AIs to generate believable, human-like data and results. The deep learning, neural network design intends to mimic a human brain, which also helps generative AI software to understand context, relationships, patterns, and other connections that have traditionally required human thinking to grasp.
To learn how generative AI models work and how users can make the most of their capabilities, read this guide: What Is a Generative AI Model?

This comprehensive study explores the attitudes, perceptions, and usage of GenAI among professionals in the legal, tax & accounting, risk & fraud, and government sectors. Conducted in early 2024, the survey gathered valuable insights from respondents across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, primarily featuring partners, managers, directors, general counsel, assistant general counsel, attorneys, and judges. The report offers a deep dive into the transformative impact of GenAI on professional services, and here is a brief summary of how legal professionals specifically perceive AI-powered technology and its potential applications in their daily work. Key findings The report reveals a positive outlook toward GenAI, with about one-quarter of professionals saying their organizations have already begun to update workflows by incorporating GenAI. However, concerns regarding the potential for unethical and fraudulent uses of GenAI were also acknowledged, underscoring the need for robust ethical frameworks and responsible implementation strategies.  Perceptions of GenAI for legal professionals Legal professionals are seeing the benefits of GenAI, with 88% of corporate legal departments believing it can be applied to their work. The top reason for this optimism is the potential for increased efficiency and productivity. GenAI can automate many of the time-consuming tasks that legal professionals currently perform, such as document review, contract analysis, and legal research, freeing them up to focus on more strategic and complex work. It could also amplify skills and work for paralegals and legal assistants. Despite the automation, there are some concerns about the potential for unethical and fraudulent uses of GenAI. Some people worry that GenAI could be used to create fake legal documents or to mislead judges and juries.  The unauthorized practice of law looms as a perceived threat specific to the legal industry, as shown in the report. Some GenAI technology lacks the legal expertise and qualifications to provide legal advice, yet they could potentially be deployed to offer such services without proper regulation. “The example of Michael Cohen relying on AI to generate case cites resulted in fake legal citations being relied on by his counsel. AI cannot replace a lawyer’s research and understanding of legal issues,” explained one law firm partner. However, most professionals believe that the benefits of GenAI outweigh the risks, with nearly half of all respondents saying they were hopeful or excited about the future of GenAI.  Usage of GenAI for legal professionals The majority of legal professionals believe that GenAI can be applied to their work. Just 12% of legal industry respondents say they use legal-specific GenAI today, but an additional 43% said they plan to do so within the next three years.  Using industry-specific GenAI tools for legal work ensures that the data and machine learning algorithms used are tailored to the specific needs and regulations of the legal industry. This increases the accuracy and reliability of the results, making it a more responsible and safe option compared to using public-facing GenAI tools, that may not have the necessary safeguards in place.  The use of industry-specific GenAI tool use has the potential to equal, or even surpass, public-facing GenAI use for the legal industry by 2027.See why in the full report  GenAI’s impact on the legal industry The use of GenAI is raising questions about how rates may change. As legal GenAI becomes more sophisticated and can handle more complex tasks, law firms may be able to adopt alternative fee arrangements instead of the billable hour model, allowing them to offer their services at lower rates, making legal services more accessible. Clients are also beginning to demand that their outside firms use GenAI. More than half of respondents from corporate legal departments (58%), as well as nearly half of court systems (44%) and government legal departments (40%), said the outside firms they work with should be using GenAI.   The future of work Despite certain challenges, the possibility of GenAI’s impact on the legal profession is clear. GenAI has the potential to make legal professionals more efficient, productive, and flexible. Some organizations are already planning for structural changes to the way they approach personnel and business operations, and some organizations are actively training their legal teams and staff on proper GenAI usage. Those organizations that wait could risk becoming quickly left behind. The future of work for legal professionals with GenAI is bright.  2024 Generative AI in Professional Services Read the full report Never miss an update – check out more on the topic of artificial intelligence for legal professionals.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceInnovationLegal Topics",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,

The result is a new open-access collection of 25 research papers that provide road maps, policy recommendations, and calls for action about generative AI from MIT experts. Topics range from using generative AI in education, manufacturing, and drug development to how generative AI will affect inequality and music discovery.
The research papers are being widely shared as quickly as possible because generative AI is evolving at a rapid pace and they could “serve as a springboard for further research, study and conversation about how we as a society can build a successful AI future,” Kornbluth said in an introduction to the collection. The papers are all works in progress and may be further developed. They have not been formally peer-reviewed.
MIT Sloan faculty members and researchers contributed to the following research projects. 
AI in engineering and manufacturing 
From Automation to Augmentation: Redefining Engineering Design and Manufacturing in the Age of NextGen-AI
This paper examines the barriers, risks, and potential rewards of using generative AI for design and manufacturing. MIT Institute professor Daron Acemoglu, MIT Sloan economist Simon Johnson, and co-authors interviewed manufacturing experts and industry leaders to find weaknesses that need to be addressed by the next generation of generative AI tools.
Implementing Generative AI in U.S. Hospital Systems
AI can transform health care, but there are often challenges when new technologies are introduced into clinical settings. In this paper, the researchers, including MIT Sloan professors Kate Kellogg and Retsef Levi, look at the difference between deploying narrow, or traditional, AI and generative AI in health care systems and how challenges associated with both technologies inform where AI might be most effective. 
AI’s impact on work and productivity 
The Impact of Generative AI on Labor Market Matching
MIT Sloan PhD student Justin Kaashoek and MIT Sloan professors Manish Raghavan andJohn J. Horton discuss areas where generative AI might appear in the labor market, including AI-generated cover letters, resumes, and job postings. The researchers examine the risks and benefits of these uses and identify ways to mitigate risks while promoting the benefits of AI.
The Productivity Effects of Generative AI: Evidence From a Field Experiment With GitHub Copilot
Two field experiments found evidence that software developers at Microsoft and Accenture who were given access to an AI-based coding assistant became more productive. The researchers, including MIT Sloan professor Mert Demirer, indicated that their findings are preliminary and that the team is still in the process of collecting additional data.
Bringing Worker Voice Into Generative AI
Input from workers can increase the likelihood that organizations use generative AI tools effectively and that workers’ job quality improves. The researchers, including MIT Sloan professors Thomas A. Kochan and Emilio J. Castilla and MIT Sloan MBA candidate Ben Likis, identified ways to bring workers’ voices into the development and use of generative AI.
Practical AI applications 
Generative AI From Theory to Practice: A Case Study of Financial Advice
Researchers, including MIT Sloan professor Andrew W. Lo, looked at the most pressing issues facing the adoption of large language models. Using financial advice as a test for determining the shortcomings of LLMs, the researchers suggest ways to improve generative AI in general. 
Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions
How should policymakers, platforms, and practitioners decide how to label AI-generated content? MIT Sloan professor David G. Rand and other researchers outlined two goals for labels: communicating whether a piece of content was created or edited using AI, and diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers. They found that under certain conditions, labeling can decrease individuals’ likelihood of believing or engaging with misleading AI-generated images.

New AI capabilities rely on massive, widely sourced, and under-documented training data. In their paper, the researchers, including MIT professorSandy Pentland, identify the shortcomings of existing tools for data authenticity and consent and argue for new universal data provenance standards.
Generative AI for Pro-Democracy Platforms
Generative AI has the potential to promote civil discourse, gather citizen input on policy questions, and strengthen democratic practices. A research team that includes Pentland presents a framework to help policymakers, technologists, and the public assess potential opportunities and risks when incorporating generative AI into online platforms for discussion and deliberation.
Generative AI and the Future of Inequality
Many fear that generative AI could lead to more inequality and even mass unemployment. MIT Sloan professor Nathan Wilmers summarizes existing research about how generative AI will likely affect the labor market and inequality. In particular, Wilmers looks at how the effects of generative AI will likely differ from previous technologies.

For all the hype about artificial intelligence revolutionizing the world, its impact on the boardroom has so far been minimal. Until very recently, many corporations would have found the idea of appointing a chief metaverse or chief artificial intelligence officer laughable, yet the latter is quickly becoming the C-suite’s hottest new role.


Despite not even existing just a few years ago, these new C-level positions are being filled not just at bleeding-edge startups but in more established enterprises, too. According to Foundry’s AI Priorities Study 2023, 11% of midsize to large organizations have already designated an individual for the chief AI officer (CAIO) role, and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking one.

PROMOTED
But simply appointing a new member of C-Suite is no guarantee you’ll solve the challenges or reap the opportunities presented by AI or Web3. A well placed hire to get AI embedded in your company’s DNA can be the ticket to a fast, innovative approach.

As Teresa Carlson, an advisor at General Catalyst and the former Worldwide Public Sector executive for Amazon Web Services, told me, “In the U.S. government, CAIO roles will serve as a critical leadership position as they transition the use of AI in mission critical capabilities. A relevant example is the U.S. intelligence community just named John Beiler as the chief artificial intelligence officer at the office of the Director of National Intelligence. His role will be to direct the deployment of AI and machine learning along with covering privacy, protections, and civil liberties that of course must be taken into account when the IC develops algorithms. The IC community will need a consolidated view across all agencies on an AI strategy which the CIO will play a critical role.”

The much harder (though ultimately far more valuable) task is to understand how these roles contribute to your organization’s core strategy, what kind of work they actually entail, and how new technologies transform the dynamics and responsibilities within the boardroom. That may require a new, dedicated CxO. Equally, it might be far better to evolve an existing role. So rather than rushing to fill a new boardroom chair, businesses would do better to take a breath and work out precisely what they want to achieve—and who’s best to do it.

Who’s in charge?
On the face of it, creating one of these new “chief” job roles makes sense. Who better to champion and oversee the transformative capabilities of AI and the metaverse than someone with a dedicated seat at the top table? But hang on a second. Let’s say your organization is an insurance firm—one of the many industries that are profoundly affected by AI. What’s the value in appointing a data scientist to the C-suite if they don’t know the difference between an underwriter and a broker, say?
The key lesson is: Don’t be dazzled by people who know how AI works. Never forget that you will always know your own business better than they do—and that’s what matters most.An installation uses artificial intelligence to visualize historical documents and photographs.Getty Images
There’s a very good argument that the best person to take on responsibility for AI initiatives already sits in the boardroom. For example, the chief marketing officer (if that’s where AI is going to have the most meaningful, transformative and strategic impact on your business). By the same token, it might be the chief technology officer, given this role requires a thorough understanding of both tech and business priorities. It could even be the CEO.
Recent history gives us examples of how new job titles are often subsumed into other, more traditional C-suite roles. We only have to look at the chief cloud officer (CCO) role, a position that was crucial as we transitioned into the cloud computing era, but which eventually just came to be a standard part of the CTO or CIO’s responsibilities. The same fate could feasibly fall on the CAIO and CMO, although events like CAIO Summit 2023 are working to make them indispensable.
On the other hand, having a dedicated CxO may well be the best option. Lan Guan agrees. As the chief AI officer at Accenture
ACN
-0.4% and an exceptional female leader at a huge multinational IT company with over 730,000 employees, she told me she believes every business should have a CAIO. “Artificial intelligence doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she says. “It needs evangelists and champions. Above all, it needs leaders. We weren’t alone in seeing the enormous potential of generative combined with classical AI to transform the enterprise, but that wouldn’t have happened nearly as fast or as well without creating a dedicated role.”Lan Guan is the chief artificial intelligence officer at Accenture.Lan Guan
No matter how advanced, technology is always a tool that works best when applied to clearly defined and well-understood problems. It is always the servant of wider organizational goals rather than your business’ master. That’s why the best people to oversee AI and Metaverse initiatives might well be those who are already in charge.
The New C-Suite
I know from personal experience just how impactful an effective chief metaverse or artificial intelligence officer can be in transforming a business. But real success depends not on the role itself, but how well enterprises understand the changes within the traditional boardroom dynamic that they entail.
Because these new technologies have a virtually unlimited range of applications since they touch on so many aspects of business operations, the person in charge of AI or the metaverse needs to be something of a Renaissance (wo)man. Not only do they need to build teams with a wide range of technical and vertical skill sets, they also need to navigate the complex organizational politics of having such a wide-roving brief.Digital generated image of young woman jumping out from portal gate and being scattered to ... [+] particles. Metaverse concept.getty
For example, will this person have responsibility for internal investments and external partnerships? How much control do they get over setting and spending budgets? Who reports to them and to whom do they report? How does this reshape the chain of command? These are just some of the questions to consider when fitting new technology into existing corporate structures. They are also key considerations when selecting who will be in charge.
A Peek Into the Inbox
Following President Biden’s executive order on AI, many federal agencies are now required to name a CAIO, responsible for promoting AI and managing its risks and rewards. If the government installs CAIOs, we can be sure that major businesses will follow suit.
But what will these people actually do? At the federal level, CAIOs will “spearhead internal policy decisions, regulations and workforce recruitment to implement and utilize AI tools effectively.” In the corporate world, however, whoever’s in charge of AI and metaverse initiatives will have a much more varied and indeed challenging set of responsibilities.
Cathy Hackl, known to many as the “godmother of the metaverse” and a former chief metaverse officer, explains how hard it is to pin down these roles. “Every day is different, and you never know what challenges are going to land in your inbox,” she told me. “The only thing that never really changes is that my role requires me to be an evangelist and educator. I spend a lot of my time traveling, presenting and speaking—both at industry events and internally at my company.”Cathy Hackl is known to many as the “godmother of the metaverse.”Cathy Hackl
Hackl added, “I work across practically every line of business, so it’s a big challenge to be thoroughly on top of the detail about each department. I need to ensure I understand what their goals are, and they need to know how new technology can help accomplish them. But there’s also a lot of roll-your-sleeves-up, down-and-dirty work with the technology itself, whether it’s designing virtual components or shepherding implementation projects.”
If that sounds like a lot to have on your plate, it barely scratches the surface of the challenges ahead. Take ethics, for example. As the Women Leaders in Data and AI’s Executive Champion Award 2023, this is a particularly strong focus for me.
The overarching challenge is how to integrate AI in the corporate world, drive innovation, and try not to slow down any implementation timelines, all while being completely ethical, transparent and honest.
Whose role is it to predict unforeseen risks that any implementation could contain, and to handle change management? Who’s responsible for making sure that no one is disadvantaged by new technologies—so often designed and built by white men—and guard against unwitting discrimination? It may be that the most valuable CxO for your business reputation is actually a chief ethics officer rather than a head of metaverse.
None of this is to deny that the roles I mentioned at the beginning of this article have enormous potential value, and could be transformative for your organization. It is to point out that there’s a huge amount of preparatory work to do before you order those new business cards. In any technological revolution, one of the most difficult things to resist is the urge to jump on the bandwagon so as not to be left behind.
My advice? Let fools rush in and make their own mistakes. This opportunity is far too precious to waste, so take your time to think about what you want to achieve rather than what you’re going to name the role.

This is the foundation of Thomson Reuters CoCounsel generative AI (GenAI). Westlaw, Practical Law, and CoCounsel Drafting are built on 150 years of human insight, categorization like the Key Number System, and editorial enhancements that ensure the quality and structure of the source material. Thomson Reuters CoCounsel Core searches and analyzes your own trusted documents and delivers insights you can verify. Having humans in the loop as the AI is trained, deployed, and used is the way to ensure that work product has the integrity and accuracy clients need.  For Thomson Reuters, “human in the loop” means that knowledgeable attorney editors work with technologists to train the system and reduce hallucinations. It means human designers work with end users and attorney editors to ensure that the system understands prompts the way a legal researcher is likely to write them. And it means that a human attorney reads and validates every result and suggested text before using it in a brief or contract.   Generative AI in Westlaw Precision with CoCounselGenAI will help legal researchers using Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel. In addition to searching Westlaw Precision with Boolean and natural language searches, legal researchers are now able to engage with Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel in a conversational manner, much like they would with a colleague. AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision can read and synthesize content across databases to bring back a clear answer to a question like, “Can social media publicity prove that a trademark is famous for a dilution claim?” It also provides the authority the answer relies on so users can verify the response and understand the nuance of the law.  Providing the authority for the answer is one way the GenAI features from Thomson Reuters minimize hallucinations. When you can see the reasons for the response, you can verify for yourself that the answer makes sense and is based in fact.   Westlaw Precision with CoCounselGet a relevant answer with links to trusted Westlaw authority in momentsJumpstart your legal research  Generative AI in Practical LawThomson Reuters Practical Law also incorporates GenAI. The Practical Law team has been providing know-how for decades, with content developed by attorneys who are experts in their practice areas. Legal practitioners rely on it to help them get started on new matters and new areas of law. With the more chat-like experience that GenAI enables, that experience will be even better.  Ask Practical Law AI will help attorneys get to the answers they need faster. For example, if you have a question about how to get started drafting an indemnification provision, you can simply type your question, without filtering to a practice area or sorting through practice notes. The model will return the answer after consulting the trusted Practical Law resources. It will also provide the sources for the answer and steps for further research.   Ask Practical Law AI Introducing Ask Practical Law AI on Practical Law: Generative AI meets legal how-toRead blog post CoCounsel Core from Thomson ReutersCoCounsel Core is a package of GenAI skills from Casetext, part of Thomson Reuters. The one-year-old product does document review, deposition preparation, contract analysis, and timeline creation in minutes. It uses GPT-4 from OpenAI to analyze your document set.  For instance, you can upload a set of contracts to CoCounsel Core and ask the tool specific questions like, “What are the payment terms?”, “Do these contracts comply with company policy?”, or “Where are disputes brought?” CoCounsel Core will give you an answer and show you which language it relied on to develop that answer.   Using GenAI to draft legal documentsCoCounsel Drafting is an end-to-end drafting solution, that pairs GenAI capabilities with trusted Thomson Reuters content.

Earlier this year, a New York law firm made headlines after getting blasted by a judge for using ChatGPT to estimate its legal costs.
Among documents submitted to the court, Cuddy Law Firm included an analysis from OpenAI's generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Lawyers from the firm had asked the chatbot how much they should charge their client for the case they'd just won — and tried to use it to help justify the $113,484.62 bill.
Judge Paul Engelmayer was not pleased. He said that ChatGPT wasn't a good tool for calculating legal fees because the platform didn't have the right information to make an informed decision. He called the move ""utterly and unusually unpersuasive.""
While legal tech companies are pushing tools into the market, lawyers are still in the dark about how to use generative AI, let alone the best ways.
However, even though this technology is still evolving, there are ways to use generative AI to make legal work easier.
Generative AI tools on the market
Generative AI refers to technology that generates content based on prompts entered into the system. For example, a tool like ChatGPT can generate questions to ask a client on an intake form or create an image for a blog post about how to find a lawyer.
ChatGPT may be the most talked about AI tool, but it's not the only one on the market. For law firms, the most common tools include Microsoft's Copilot, which is integrated into Office 365, Google's Gemini, and Claude AI from Anthropic, which is competing with OpenAI to create the most human-like AI tool.
Legal tech companies are quickly adopting generative AI tools such as CoCounsel, a legal assistant that can review documents, help draft communication, and search documents.
There’s also Lexis AI+ from LexisNexis, which can summarize case law, help draft client emails, and search for cases.
In Canada, CanLII is rolling out a generative AI tool that summarizes case law, legislation, and administrative tribunal decisions. It's available in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and the Yukon.
What makes these legal AI tools different from ChatGPT is that they're built on existing legal databases to ensure more accurate information.
Jennifer Wondracek, a law school professor and director of the law library at Capital University Law School in Ohio, recently spoke at the American Bar Association's ABA TECHSHOW about how lawyers should be using generative AI.
""AI has been around since 1955,"" she says. ""We have Siri, Alexa and so many other AI products around us. What's important is figuring out what you need and understanding how AI works.""
Wondracek recommends reading the terms and conditions of any generative AI tool before using it, as it can present privacy and confidentiality issues. These tools are trained on data, and where that data comes from is the main issue for large language models like ChatGPT and Copilot. Currently in the United States, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are among the companies facing lawsuits for copyright infringement.
Users also have to opt-out to ensure their data isn't being used to train the software. Even then, there can be loopholes. Law firms have recently discovered that Microsoft's privacy policy allows the company's employees to read AI prompts to identify any hate or violent content.
While some of these tools have free access, those versions won't protect your data.
""You have to buy licenses because it has stronger privacy terms,"" Wondracek says. ""But even paid personal licenses may not have the data protection clauses you need for legal work, so look for enterprise or business-oriented licenses.""
Sanjay Khanna became the chief information officer at Cox and Palmer last year at the beginning of the ChatGPT craze. He's excited about the technology but wants firms to think about governance and compliance before deciding what to use.
""The legal industry can benefit greatly from generative AI due to the amount of data that can be used to create new content for legal and non-legal matters,"" Khanna says.
""It's important that firms assess and analyze the data utilized and ensure that client confidentiality and legal regulatory standards are followed.""
Khanna says getting the best results from generative AI requires organization. At Cox and Palmer, that's meant streamlining information management processes on how documents are stored, searched, and retrieved.
How lawyers can use generative AI
Here's the thing: generative AI is only as good as what you ask it. That's why prompt engineering is quickly becoming one of the many skills tech companies are clamouring for. It's the practice of creating inquiries for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs. It's more sophisticated than searching for a phrase or words since most generative AI tools also allow users to upload documents.
""Think about what you want and how to ask for it,"" says Wondracek. ""When I'm researching children under the age of 18, I have to think about the different ways we name people that age: minors, children, infants, etc. Think about what jurisdiction you're looking for too.""
Then there's the issue of hallucinations — the phenomenon where generative AI tools create false information as a result of trying to fill in data gaps in the system's database. While some legal AI companies claim to be hallucination-free, Wondracek says they can’t be fully eliminated.
""Legal AI companies are sitting on top of legal databases and that helps to try to mitigate them,"" she says, adding that ultimately, hallucinations are part of the package.
""It's a trade-off. You can tweak the underlying commands used to retrieve data but hallucinations will still occur.""
One of her tips is to always check your work. Guidelines from law societies in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan all require lawyers to check what they've generated from AI tools. Lawyers must also ensure confidential client information isn't entered into generative AI systems.
Wondracek says verifying information means reading every case you've cited to ensure the right law has been referenced and to confirm that the court cases exist.
The common thread when lawyers have been caught using fake citations? They’d all used ChatGPT for legal research, something Wondracek says should be a no-go.
Instead, lawyers should think of generative AI as a great place to start or finish — ""the sandwich method"" of doing legal work. For instance, start with generative AI tools to create questions for discovery or come to it after completing a draft of oral arguments to help make them more persuasive.
""You can have it write a high-level memo or look at contract clauses. You can feed it long PDFs and ask questions about the document. There are many mundane tasks generative AI can do,"" Wondracek says, noting she uses it to create onboarding checklists for new employees.
""But ChatGPT is not intended to do research.""
While mundane may not sound as exciting as having the technology do all the work, she says it can help lawyers make things easier and faster in their legal practice.
""There's lots of other things generative AI can do. Lawyers need to explore and figure out what works for them.”

What Percentage of Emerging Tech Jobs Focus on A.I.?

Some 29 percent of “emerging tech” jobs involve artificial intelligence (A.I.) skills, according to the latest CompTIA Tech Job Report. 

Last month, CompTIA classified 65,241 jobs as “emerging tech,” and 19,100 of those involved artificial intelligence in some way (either as the job itself, or heavily relying on artificial intelligence skills). The top states for A.I. job postings included (in descending order) California, Texas, Virginia, New York, and Washington, DC—no surprise, as these tech hubs host a plethora of tech giants with the funding and talent necessary to build out solid A.I. stacks. 

If you’re interested in mastering A.I. skills as part of your next job hunt, keep in mind that it all comes down to more than just mastering, say, TensorFlow or other tools. You’ll need to master a handful of more abstract, transferrable skills that’ll allow you to operate effectively in this brave new world.

Those skills (as we’ve broken down before) include: 


Critical thinking and problem-solving
Data literacy
Intellectual curiosity
Commitment to continuous learning
Identifying and addressing ethical challenges in tech/A.I.


If you want to quickly boost your knowledge about A.I. itself, multiple online resources can help you. For example, online learning portals such as Coursera have courses from the likes of DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Vanderbilt University, and other institutions. For those who want a certificate to slap on a resume, Udacity also offers a generative A.I. “nanodegree” program, with a focus on skills such as the OpenAI API, image pre-processing, and more; prerequisite skills include Python, neural networks, and more.

If you want to learn generative A.I. skills as fast as possible, Google also has online tutorials focusing on that tech, which include videos, quizzes, and short lessons:

Generative AI, explained
Introduction to Generative AI 
Introduction to Large Language Models 
Generative AI Fundamentals Skill Badge 
What is Generative AI Studio? 
Introduction to Generative AI Studio 
Introduction to Image Generation 
Introduction to Responsible AI 
Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud 



Once you have those skills in place, A.I.-centric jobs will often ask you to use them to build models and help companies analyze data. For example, an average day for a machine learning engineer might involve the following: 

Researching, designing and implementing ML models and systems
Implementing machine learning algorithms and tools
Scaling data science prototypes
Selecting appropriate data sets, verifying data quality, cleaning and organizing data (in collaboration with data engineers)
Performing statistical analysis
Executing tests and optimizing machine learning models and algorithms
Monitoring systems in production and retraining them to improve performance
Utilizing machine learning libraries

Yes, these skills are complicated and can take some time to learn—but demand for A.I.-related jobs is clearly high, and those who’ve mastered the necessary tools and tricks can earn premium pay. Last year, a study by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Access Partnership found that employers “are willing to pay an average of 47 percent more for IT workers with A.I. skills.”

The State Department is encouraging its workforce to use generative AI tools, having launched a new internal chatbot to a thousand users this week. The move comes as the agency leans heavily on chatbots and other artificial intelligence-based tools amid the Biden administration’s push for departments to look for use cases for the technology. 
“Of our workforce, there are a lot of people who haven’t been playing with ChatGPT,” State Chief Information Officer Kelly Fletcher said Thursday at AIScoop’s AITalks event in Washington, D.C. “We’re encouraging them to do so, but they need training.”
The internal chatbot, which FedScoop previously reported on, is an example of how the agency is weighing how generative AI might help with tasks like summarization and translation. It comes in response to staff demand. 
Beyond the chatbot, the State Department is using artificial intelligence for other purposes, including declassifying documents, said Matthew Graviss, the agency’s chief data and artificial intelligence officer. The department is also using open-source models to help create a digital research assistant for certain mandated reports, though he didn’t name those documents.

The department is also using public tools with public information to help synthesize information for ambassadors, Graviss said. “You don’t need FedRAMP this and FISMA that to do that kind of stuff,” he added. “Public tools work.” 
Earlier this month, FedScoop reported that the Department of State had removed several references to artificial intelligence use cases in its executive order-required inventory. 
Other agencies, meanwhile, have taken a variety of approaches to generative AI, with some more cautious about exploring the technology. Others are setting up sandboxes to explore generative AI tools, working, for instance, with versions of OpenAI tools available on Azure for Government.

Faculty unions are starting to take their concerns about artificial intelligence out of peer group discussions and into contract negotiations.
The advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)—which largely hit the general public when ChatGPT launched in November 2022 —immediately began causing concern for some faculty members across the nation. Faculty unions, from local state associations to national behemoths, are now discussing how to ensure their concerns are addressed by their institutions’ administrators.
“It’s looking at ethical concerns, data protection and educators’ involvement as AI continues to evolve,” said Noel Candelaria, secretary-treasurer at the National Education Association (NEA).

The NEA represents nearly 200,000 members and expects to have language finalized in July that members can use as a framework for their own bargaining. The union expects to lay groundwork focused on questions—centered on issues such as ethical concerns, data protection and educators' involvement—that faculty should be asking administrators as they create AI policies.
“We know what it looks like right now, but it will evolve and look different in how we as educators remain a central part of the policy processes,” he said.
Boston University faculty were alarmed earlier this month after the university’s dean of arts and sciences, Stan Sclaroff, emailed faculty suggesting they use AI to help manage course discussions, labs and student feedback during a strike by graduate students.

“What Dean Sclaroff is advocating in his memo is that in cases where some discussion groups have been affected by the union’s job action, professors should consider a wide range of teaching tools available to them to offset the absence of a striking teaching assistant,” Boston University said in a statement to Inside Higher Ed.
That AI was mentioned at all among other “creative” options raised alarm bells for Service Employees International Union Local 509 chapter, which represents BU faculty and staff.
“We sincerely hope that the university would reconsider this suggestion and instead focus on properly compensating the people who do the work that is crucial in keeping the university running,” the union’s BU chapter said in an email to Inside Higher Ed.

Some large university unions, including the California Faculty Association and the United University Professions, or UUP, which represents the State University of New York System, aren’t concerned about being immediately replaced by AI. 
“I think job replacement is a valid concern and I think [faculty and staff] could understandably be nervous about it,” said Kevin Wehr, bargaining team chair for the California Faculty Association. “Am I in a panic? No. Should others be? No, I don’t think they should think the sky is falling. We have a lot of issues facing higher ed and this is just one of many.”
However, concerns about the impact of AI on faculty members’ intellectual property rights and workload, and potential diminished autonomy have cropped up among faculty unions across the nation.

“We’re not being luddites; it’s not, ‘tech is bad and people will lose their jobs,’” said Laurie Stoff, a member of United Campus Workers of Arizona, which represents the state’s three public universities. Stoff, a professor at Arizona State University, is also a member of the Faculty Senate’s “AI Concerns” subcommittee. 
“Our argument is it’s our job to serve students, educate them, ensure their success, uplift them and provide them the best opportunities for their learning. We don’t see this as a valuable way to do that,” she said of the notion of using AI for teaching.
“There’s a lot we could potentially learn from other sectors of laborers who have dealt with automation in the past,” said Alissa Karl, the UUP’s vice president for academics. “We can be in a place where we’re creative and look to other industries.”
The State University of New York system has doubled down on investments in AI over the last few years, including a $200 million statewide AI initiative to boost research, policymaking and workforce development. The UUP’s contract was ratified in August 2023 and expires in 2026.
Although none of the union representatives interviewed called for the banning of artificial intelligence in higher ed, Karl said specific, detail-oriented conversations are best for discussions on AI policies. 
“We’ve heard off-the-cuff assertions from leadership about how easy it would make our lives to use AI to write syllabi, which has created a lot of alarm,” she said. “If someone generated a syllabus with the assistance of AI, would they be disciplined for it? We don’t know. We don’t have clear guardrails and boundaries.”
Multiple unions—including the NEA and the American Federation for Teachers—suggest the “gold standard” of creating AI policies is getting specific language in labor agreements that are enforceable if a disagreement arises between faculty and administration. 
The unions recommend faculty and staff members working at institutions or in states without strong unions—such as Arizona where it is illegal to have collective bargaining agreements—get college administrators to codify AI policy language in an employee handbook. Stoff, of Arizona State University, cited using demonstrations, social media, petitions and direct requests to the state regents, to press for better work environments. 
“Our goal is to make the universities the best place they can be for the students we serve, because our working conditions are our students’ learning conditions,” Stoff said. “When we improve those, everyone benefits—the whole university becomes a better, more welcoming, more constructive place.”

The research found 18 per cent used it for the former and 15 per cent used it for the latter.Other popular uses included summarising documents, understanding legal concepts and improving work quality and efficiency.Allens chief innovation and legal solutions officer Lisa Kozaris said the survey’s findings aligned with the law firm’s experience of generative AI.Related QuotesAdvertisementShe told The Australian Financial Review that lawyers at the firm were mostly using the technology to summarise lengthy documents, compare clauses across different documents and identify key points and action items from meetings.Others use it to check the tone of an email, translate documents or help explain technical concepts such as “spinning reserve” in power generation.“It’s not to be used instead of research, but [using it] to give an initial sense of a technical concept has been another use case,” Ms Kozaris said.Lawyers at the firm have access to Microsoft Copilot and two in-house tools: Chronology Plus, which helps lawyers create and present chronologies, and Airlie, the law firm’s own version of ChatGPT that was developed with Microsoft and built on the tech giant’s Azure platform.“While it certainly doesn’t replace the work that a lawyer would do, it really gets them to an advanced first draft much more quickly,” Ms Kozaris said, adding that close to half the firm are using the tools every day.“It means that lawyers can then really sort of apply their judgments and finesse the final work product, as opposed to doing summarisation or copying and pasting information.”AdvertisementMs Kozaris said Allens chose to develop its own version of ChatGPT so that lawyers could use the technology without sending client data beyond the company’s digital systems and without inadvertently training the next model of ChatGPT.“We’ve developed a huge volume of documents from advising clients in lots of different sectors over many years, so we’re now experimenting with [pointing Airlie] to collections of our own knowledge, so that our lawyers can really [use the tool] with much more reliable data,” Ms Kozaris said.‘It’s really about experimenting’King & Wood Mallesons senior associate Kendra Fouracre said she used generative AI to draft, proof, edit and otherwise improve emails and other written communications sent to clients.She said it was also helpful in transcribing and producing summaries of meetings.“It’s really about experimenting, being curious and actually continually learning what generative AI is best for [in] the legal profession,” Ms Fouracre said.AdvertisementTo ensure the tools are used ethically and responsibly, KWM requires every lawyer to undergo mandatory training to understand the limitations of generative AI tools before they are allowed to use them. Ms Fouracre said this helped to maintain high standards of governance.The LexisNexis survey found that almost all respondents (94 per cent) agreed generative AI would have an impact on routine tasks leading to significant efficiencies. But 52 per cent were also sceptical about generative AI’s ability to conduct legal research due to questions over its accuracy, traceability, completeness and ability to provide citations.In-house lawyers lead the wayGreg Dickason, LexisNexis’ managing director for Asia and the Pacific, said the research also revealed that in-house lawyers were keener adopters of generative AI than their law firm counterparts.Fifty-two per cent of in-house lawyers had already used AI, compared to 42 per cent in law firms, the research found.Mr Dickason said this could be because in-house lawyers were less risk averse and unencumbered by billable hours.“They’ll do whatever they can to get the job done,” he said, noting in-house lawyers often had to make do with fewer resources as well.RelatedHow soon will machines outsmart us?

        ""It could enhance workers’ productivity but also threatens some jobs. Investing in digital infrastructure and skills, as well as in strong social safety nets will determine the pace of AI adoption and its impact on productivity,"" she said.
    




        Earlier, Kristalina Georgieva urged African governments to adopt AI as a catalyst for rapid economic development across the continent.
    




        She emphasized AI's transformative potential in reshaping global economies, particularly in labor markets.
    




        Addressing attendees at the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit, Georgieva outlined key areas crucial for fostering growth.
    




        She said ""This is the likely largest transformation of our economies that we have experienced since the Industrial Revolution. It can be this big bang that allows us to live longer, healthier, better educated, more productive lives. But it is not given that we would take advantage of the benefits and manage well the risks. We face urgently the necessity to embrace AI and make the best out of it.""
