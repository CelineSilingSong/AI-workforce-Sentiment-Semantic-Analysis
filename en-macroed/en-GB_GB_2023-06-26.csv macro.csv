AI and the Workplace: Employment Considerations

June 2023

Skadden Insights – June 2023

Key Points

As employers and employees are increasingly using AI in the workplace, government regulation is playing catch-up. 
Existing EEO laws place some guardrails on an employer’s use of AI for traditional human resources tasks, and Illinois and New York City have enacted laws specifically regulating the use of AI in employment decisions. 
Employers should monitor for updates and mitigate risks when using AI systems. That may entail training HR and other staff and, in some cases, commissioning audits of the impact of the systems.




The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is growing exponentially. Companies are looking to harness AI to improve productivity and efficiency as AI’s capabilities continue to expand. In doing so, employers should be mindful of the evolving legal landscape surrounding the use of AI, including existing employment-related laws. 


Artificial Intelligence

AI generally refers to a computer performing tasks historically done by a human. Generative AI refers to AI algorithms that create new content based on existing data. AI generally draws on existing data and practices that are used to train the technology. (See our Spring 2023 The Informed Board article “What Is Generative AI and How Does It Work?”)

In the workplace, AI can be used for many functions, including recruiting and hiring. It can streamline these processes by, for example, preparing job descriptions and analyzing internal employer data to best predict which applicants would be most successful at the company. AI systems can be used to analyze productivity, measure individual performance and select candidates for promotion. 

AI proponents argue that AI reduces or eliminates human bias in screening and evaluating applicants and employees. However, because AI technologies generally draw on existing data and practices, some argue that use of AI for these functions may perpetuate any existing discriminatory practices. 

In addition to human resources functions, employees are also using chatbots to augment their work. For example, employees can outsource time-consuming tasks such as drafting an email, writing code or doing research to an AI chatbot. AI proponents believe it will revolutionize the workforce and reduce — if not eliminate — the need for humans to perform certain tasks. But information provided by chatbots may be incorrect or outdated because chatbots survey and pull from troves of publicly available information, which may themselves be incorrect or outdated. 

Chatbots also “hallucinate” or make things up. There are also privacy concerns associated with use of AI, as information (which may include confidential or proprietary information) entered into a company’s AI system might be inadvertently disclosed in the output given to a third party or, if such information is submitted in a query to a chatbot, it might be incorporated into the chatbot’s database and revealed in a subsequent response to an unrelated party’s query. 


Existing Guardrails

An employer’s use of AI must comply with existing employment laws, including the following that prohibit discrimination: 

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) — on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. 
Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) — against individuals with disabilities. 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act — against applicants and employees who are 40 years of age or older. 
Similar state and local laws. 


Both federal and state laws prohibit disparate treatment discrimination in the workplace (i.e., intentional discrimination of members of a protected class) and disparate impact discrimination (i.e., facially neutral practices or policies that may disproportionately affect members of a protected class). 

To the extent an employer uses AI in connection with recruitment, hiring and promotion, there is a risk that the employer may run afoul of applicable anti-discrimination laws. For example, if the AI model bases hiring decisions on criteria such as ratings, pay and titles that skew in favor of white or male applicants, the AI system may screen for applicants meeting those characteristics. 

There is also a risk that AI may make inferences based on an applicant’s religion, age, sexuality, genetic information or disability status learned from either the internet, social media or the applicant’s resume or interview. Though AI may not intentionally screen out or favor certain protected classes, AI’s choice could cause a discriminatory impact. 

In the event that use of AI results in employee layoffs, employers should also ensure that they are mindful of anti-discrimination laws when selecting those who will be separated from employment. They must also pay close attention to the requirements of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification and equivalent state and local laws, which govern notice obligations in connection with plant closings and mass layoffs. 

Additionally, to the extent employers use AI in robotic systems or other machinery, they should be sure to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Act and equivalent state laws and regulations, which require that employers provide a workplace free from recognized hazards. 


New AI Legislation and Guidance

Increasingly, federal, state and local governments have considered legislation to supplement existing employment laws and taken other steps in response to the rapid increase in use of AI in connection with employment. 


Federal Laws and Action

Although no comprehensive federal legislation has passed, there are several bills in Congress addressing different aspects of AI. For example, the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022 bill directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to require entities to conduct impact assessments for bias, effectiveness and other factors when using automated decision systems to make critical decisions. 

Additionally, the White House has released a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and an AI Risk Management Framework, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order related to bias and discrimination with respect to the use of AI. (For more on the AI Risk Management Framework, see our May 18, 2023, client alert.) 

On May 12, 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued technical guidance addressing the use of AI to assess job applicants and employees under the ADA. The guidance outlines several ways that utilizing AI tools can violate the ADA, including, for example, using AI to evaluate video interviews without providing notice and the opportunity for applicants to request a reasonable accommodation, in light of the potential for AI to negatively evaluate a candidate with a speech disorder. 

On May 18, 2023, the EEOC issued technical guidance addressing the use of AI to assess job applicants and employees under Title VII. The guidance outlines how an employer’s use of AI tools can violate Title VII under a disparate impact analysis. It recommends that employers consider, among other things, whether the software has been evaluated to ensure it does not result in substantially lower selection rates for individuals with protected characteristics. 


State and Local Laws

At the state level, Illinois enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act in 2022, which imposes certain requirements on employers that analyze video interviews with AI. Many other states, including California, New Jersey, New York, Vermont and Washington, D.C., have proposed or are otherwise considering legislation to regulate AI use in hiring and promotion. 

At the local level, New York City Local Law 144, which sets forth limitations and requirements for employers using automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) to screen candidates for hire or promotion, will be enforceable as of July 5, 2023. 

The law prohibits use of AEDTs unless the tool has been the subject of an independent bias audit within the past year. Employers and employment agencies are also required to make public on their websites the date and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit and the AEDT’s distribution date. 
In addition, employers and employment agencies must provide a notice of the use of AEDTs to employees and candidates for employment who reside in New York City. The notice must include instructions for requesting an alternative selection process or reasonable accommodation under other laws. 


Employers in violation will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $500 for a first-time violation and between $500 and $1,500 for successive violations. 


Best Practices

Against this backdrop, employers should consider implementing policies and procedures governing employees’ use of AI at work. When using AI technologies for hiring, screening and promotion, employers should consider auditing the technology to ensure selection rates do not violate anti-discrimination laws, to the extent employers are not otherwise required by applicable law to conduct audits. 

Employers should also consider clearly informing applicants about the type of technology that will be used and the information it is measuring. Training staff regarding their use of — and potential discriminatory issues associated with — AI tools and the need to verify the accuracy of any AI-generated content is also advisable.

                          ",https://schema.org,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'Webpage', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/06/29/womens-jobs-will-be-disproportionately-affected-by-ai-according-to-new-research'}, 'headline': 'Nearly 80% of women’s jobs at risk from generative AI, new research finds', 'description': 'According to new research, a disproportionate number of jobs held by women are at risk of automation due to the emergence of generative AI.', 'articleBody': 'The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has for long been criticised for its potential impact on the job market, as people fear losing their jobs or seeing the most valuable parts of their daily tasks automated by computer systems. A recent  Goldman Sachs  report showed that the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs in the US and Europe being at risk of automation because of the disruptive technology. However, the impact on jobs may not be at all equal. As some jobs are more easily automated than others, and taking into consideration gender distribution in the job market, women may bear the biggest losses due to generative AI, according to new  research . “You\'ve got in the men\'s part, this 50-50 split between white collar and blue collar jobs. But in the women\'s part, you\'ve got 70 per cent are in white collar, 30 per cent in blue collar,” Mark McNeilly, professor of the practice of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler school and lead author of the research, told Euronews Next. “And so, just from that simple fact that there\'s more women in this space that\'s affected - which is cognitive jobs - then more women are impacted,” he added. Despite men outnumbering women in the workforce, the research shows that generative AI is expected to put more women at risk of losing their jobs than men. This is because 79 per cent of working women are employed in occupations susceptible to AI disruption and automation. ""It\'s nothing inherent necessarily in generative AI; it also tends to be a function of the types of jobs that women might be in,"" McNeilly told Euronews Next. ""But there\'s a lot of office positions that might be significantly impacted as well. Those are generally across a lot of different industries. So, office administrative support occupations, about 70 per cent of those are filled by women. That\'s going to be one that\'s going to be hit pretty significantly and it\'s also a sizeable population of jobs,"" he added. Other industries where jobs are occupied mostly by women that are expected to be impacted by the adoption of AI include healthcare (76 per cent) and education (73 per cent) and community and social services (67 per cent). How to adapt to the emergence of AI in the job market While generative AI has the potential to suppress or partially automate various jobs, it also offers huge opportunities for job creation. Historically, when machines were used to replace human workers for higher productivity and less cost, there was an emergence of new jobs that didn’t exist before. Moreover, AI can also be helpful in industries thanks to the technology’s ability to automate boring repetitive tasks of different jobs that are not susceptible to displacement and full automation. ""If you take healthcare professionals, for example, which, as we talked about, over 70 per cent of the people in there are women. You might have generative AI where it can answer questions from patients, it can help give advice to healthcare professionals on diagnoses and in prescriptive approaches,"" McNeilly said. ""By doing that and helping the patient answer questions on their own, it might free up more time for that healthcare professional to spend more time with that patient"". ""And we have a shortage of healthcare professionals. And so those folks should actually see perhaps more meaning in their jobs and would not be, you know, laid off or lose value in their jobs"". In the era of AI, effectively navigating the job market demands a shift in mindset regarding the essential skills required for task completion. Using all the knowledge acquired by being exposed to AI, workers should strive to ""pick it up, adopt it, learn how to use it well, and then set themselves apart,"" McNeilly argues.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds much promise for Japan, with the Japanese Government’s AI Strategic Council recognising the country’s high degree of affinity with generative AI, partly due to its high levels of research and technology, and the potential that generative AI holds to address issues such as the decline in the working age population and need for digitalisation. Recently, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) released its AI White Paper recognising the need to formulate a new national strategy for AI which acknowledges this growing evolution and social implementation of large-scale language AI models where a new era of AI is envisioned.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock JPY 148.7 trillion (USD 1.1 trillion) of productive capacity in Japan, equivalent to a quarter of GDP in 2022.2 Japan has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

I’m a little worried about how artificial intelligence might affect students’ motivation, sense of identity, and intuition around knowledge production and consumption.
A lot of us in higher education are thinking about using AI tools creatively, perhaps even embracing them. This is ultimately probably the right thing to do. But it’s going to be difficult to do right, especially if we rush.
The problem of fewer problems
Students already have access to tools that can write for them, improve their writing, perform literature searches, summarise arguments, provide basic critical analysis, create slide decks, and take the role of a tutor. With the right subscription, you can even get a bot to go online to try to accomplish long lists of automated tasks to achieve all manner of projects.
So these tools suddenly make it really easy to do all kinds of things, very quickly, that used to be hard and slow. Many of these things used to be essential to the intrinsic value of university work – planning, decision-making, struggling, searching, assessing sources, grappling with difficult texts, and learning to accept the discomfort of uncertainty.
AI tools remove problems. But some of the problems they remove are useful to have and to solve as a human. Students will find it really difficult to distinguish between what problems are good to solve quickly with AI, and which problems are more valuable to solve themselves.
And society is entering a whirlwind of new possibilities regarding what is and is not legitimate knowledge or legitimate knowledge work. Students will, for some time, I think, be very confused about what’s okay, what’s worth doing, and what their individual role is within the nuanced ecosystem of consuming and producing knowledge. What’s my role in this education thing anyway? Where’s the intrinsic value of learning? What am I aiming for, and will that be the same in two years?
Students have already been trained by our system to think instrumentally or extrinsically about the outcomes of their work. Many focus on getting the essay done, achieving the passing grade, obtaining the piece of paper. It often seems more difficult for students to see the intrinsic value, the self-transformative value that comes from wrestling with difficult tasks and processes. AI tools will exacerbate this conflict. We may, for a time, lose any clarity at all around what’s exciting and what’s important in university. A kind of built-in nihilism of knowledge work.
Through a scanner, darkly
In the broader information environment, there will be a steep rise of deepfakes, scams, pranks, political mischief and spammy internet content. It will become, in the next couple of years, quite difficult to know what’s real and what’s not. Especially in the absence of regulation.
Students, both in their private lives and in their university work, will find it increasingly difficult to know what to trust and what not to. Assessing and reassessing information could become a nearly constant activity. In this environment there’s a risk of exhaustion.
With all of these forces at work, then, it’s important to recognise that student energy, motivation, even identity could be at risk. Again: why am I doing this? What’s important in all this? What is my role?
So before we in higher education rush to integrate AI tools into the classroom, rush to have fun with ChatGPT and all the rest, and risk inadvertently accelerating or elevating these harms, can we resolve to proceed with caution?
Criticality and caution
Universities, at a governance, planning, and policy level, can aim to redouble values and aims for humane and people-centric cultures. This will mean a deep and serious reconsideration of budgets, allocation of resources, spaces, and teaching philosophy. Now more than ever it will be important to increase the ratio of teachers to students.
We must be crystal clear on what’s allowed. That needs to come from the university, but we can also do that in faculties and in individual courses and modules. What is the code of conduct? This will probably have to be reassessed frequently.
We should be crystal clear on what’s assessed. So, whereas a year ago we might have assessed clarity and correctness of language, for example, it no longer seems that that would be fair. It would benefit students using AI tools at the expense of those not using such tools.
We should also resist the urge to require the use of AI tools and we should try not to advantage those who do. Students who cannot afford to, or who do not wish to, use these tools should not be discriminated against. It will be quite difficult to design assessments so as not to create inequities of accessibility, but this is the right aim to have.
Perhaps most importantly, we should teach criticality and caution around AI, and acknowledge the complexity of the present moment. Talk with students about the confusion, the ethics, and the potential harms.
And finally, we should reintroduce humanity and physicality into learning and teaching wherever possible. Devise ways to let students unplug and interact with the real world, with the physical environment and with each other. Design digital interactions to minimise clicks and tabs and constant surfing and non-stop switching from platform to platform and app to app.
In other words, let’s leverage the embedded criticality in our higher education culture to promote a more humane world, even in the flood of new technologies that challenge equality, humanity, identity, knowledge, and the future of learning.

4 responses to “The real risk of generative AI is a crisis of knowledge”

Probably the best thing I have read so far about AI in HE; an extremely valuable perspective. That an argument for refocussing on the human purposes of education feels like such a novelty is quite an indictment of the direction things have been taking for some time.

As many colleagues in HE are, I am struggling to make sense of AI and how we need to move forward. I agree with Sarah: this is the best article I have read on the subject for a while – it eloquently echoes my discomfort around the numerous communications, webinars, etc in HE which seem to be advocating ’embracing’ AI instead of pausing, remembering our values and offering students an alternative to the fast and often superficial world of technology – a space to think, explore, compare, create.
I have often felt over the years that in education, some technology has been adopted without a great deal of thought. Of course, some tools do help and we all use them, but this recent development is in a different league and requires careful consideration.

Surely universities should be providing AI tools to students as they do other learning resources to avoid issues of who has access and who does not.

Thank you, Joshua.
This really struck a chord with me (does that mean I like what you say because you write what I think I might have been already thinking….?). Anyhow – this is the bit that stood out to me: “AI tools remove problems. But some of the problems they remove are useful to have and to solve as a human.” I also like that you open with “I’m a little worried”. I’m a learning developer, too, and I’m often a little worried. I worry that learning development is often asked to simplify, boil down, make swallowable that which is hard, thorny, unpindownable….
I see my role as revealing and celebrating complexity. It’s about making space and taking time. It’s about process as well as product. For me, learning is about being human and being authentic. Computer-generated and artificial worry me. Fast and simple worries me.

Please try again later.(Simoul Alva for The Washington Post)By  Danielle AbrilJune 28, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDTIt’s not a hallucination. The youngest generation entering the workforce may be the most prepared to champion and use generative artificial intelligence at work.For months, many of these up-and-comers have been exploring the technology’s capabilities, sharpening their skills and learning how to best apply it to their tasks. And while some are cautious about AI’s potential harms, many are more fascinated with than worried about the technology.“I’m really excited about AI and what it can do,” said Naomi Davis, a May graduate of business administration from Georgia Institute of Technology, who uses AI to help her clearly express her ideas in writing. “I used it every week [of my last semester], or at least played around with it.”Generative AI is making a big splash as it gets integrated into such workplace tools as email providers, graphics editors, productivity tools and coding programs. Despite some industry leaders, including AI creators, warning about doomsday scenarios in which the tech takes over humanity, hundreds of thousands of Gen Z students — those born between 1997 and 2012 — have experimented with it, and in some cases, even been encouraged by their schools to explore it. Now as new hires, Gen Z is bringing its AI chops to work, expediting more usage in the future. And young adults are more likely to use AI compared with older counterparts at work, a recent Pew Research Center survey suggests.Tell us what's happening at your workplace.Gen Z made up more than 13 percent of the civilian labor force last year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that number is only expected to grow as the youngest of Gen Z, also known as Zoomers, are still several years from joining the workforce.Since they were tykes, Zoomers have been exposed to digital devices and services — the oldest of the bunch were about a year old when Google launched. As a result, they tend to be open to exploring new technologies, said Shaun Pichler, professor of management at the College of Business and Economics at California State University at Fullerton.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“They’re the first digital-native generation,” he said, adding that many of the students grew up communicating digitally through text and social media. “They’re used to using tech day in and day out.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowZoomers have relied on the chatbot ChatGPT, from OpenAI, to help write cover letters, edit essays, formulate or clarify ideas, check code and even help with their finances. And some universities make generative AI part of their curriculum rather than banning it because of a fear of cheating.That was the case for students who took Kyle Jensen’s writing class at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University last semester. Jensen, also the director of writing programs, said he had been exploring generative AI before ChatGPT debuted in November. For his class, Jenson wanted to educate his students and learn how they feel about and might use the tech.Skip to end of carouselWork: ReimaginedWith attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.Read more.End of carousel“I thought this was an opportunity to teach AI literacy,” he said. “Let’s use this opportunity to think about different ways of applying AI and where it might be headed in the future.”The course, which 14 students took over 16 weeks, covered the history of artificial intelligence and gave students access to generative AI tools. Jensen then wanted students to discuss how they used the tools as well as their benefits and limits.Ximena Vasquez Bueno, a 22-year-old writing major, said she used generative AI to edit some of her essays. The AI sometimes misinterpreted a long-winded sentence, which helped her realize where she could’ve been clearer and more concise. It corrected tense errors she missed, as Spanish is her first language, and showed her what she brings to the table.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It helped me identify my voice as a writer better and how it differs from the AI,” said Vasquez Bueno, a former computer science major who is considering a user-experience writing career when she graduates next year. “I feel more comfortable using it for future projects.”AI is also serving as a research resource for Zoomers. Cortez Hill, a business and theater major who expects to graduate from the University of Michigan next year, said he used generative AI to understand complex investment concepts by asking for terms a 5-year-old would understand and finding sources he could use for a paper.“It is scary how it’s evolving into our world, but I’m open to leaning into that discomfort,” he said. “Our world is just shifting.”But the tech isn’t just helping Zoomers with writing prose. Daniel Osorno Villamil, a May computer science graduate from Georgia Tech, said he has used ChatGPT to double-check his math and review code. He once fed it 300 lines of code and asked it to find the problem, which it did. Generative AI also has helped him with his finances, finding areas in which to reduce costs, he said. He said he’s excited to see how he can leverage it at his new software engineering job at Microsoft in the fall.“Having something like that to do the boilerplate code and give me time to figure out actual problems — the prospect of that is exciting,” he said. “I’ve always really loved technology, so it’s more exciting than it is concerning.”While some coders have worried about being replaced by AI, Edith Llontop, who graduated in May with a degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California at Berkeley, said she expects to work alongside it rather than be displaced by it.“The coding can be left to generative models, but a lot of the creative process that is a part of a software developer’s job likely won’t,” she said. “We don’t code blindly … it’s about what can you bring to the table to advance the science.”Davis, the Georgia Tech graduate, says her experience shows that the tech is only as good as the human driving it. The 21-year-old, who will join Google in August, has used it for idea generation and fleshing out and clarifying her thoughts. But even then, she has to check or edit everything. She once had a chatbot write code but realized after reviewing it that the result was pretty basic.“I really calmed down after that,” she said. “I realized you still need to put in your brain power to make it look good.”But the explosion of AI has changed some young people’s paths. Rona Wang, who recently graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in math and computer science, turned down a tech job she thinks could be subject to automation. Instead, she opted to pursue a master’s degree in programming that is closer to the hardware.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Absolutely it’s about staying ahead of the curve,” she said. “A good rule of thumb is looking for jobs and skills that require [judgment] or research in some way.”Zoomers aren’t ignoring possible harms, despite their excitement. Some say they are worried about the implications of AI, including its ability to spread misinformation, make people lazy to learn, raise the bar for entry-level jobs and become a way for employers to cut costs — even if it means lowering the quality of work.Andrew Otchere, who got his acting degree from the University of Michigan, said the writers strike in Hollywood made him feel conflicted. He sees value in using AI for character development research but also worries that companies could use it for production or creative writing and other areas he’s hoping to pursue.“I just really am worried we may fall into the habit of becoming too reliant on AI, valuing profits over people,” he said. “That’s really scary because [creativity is] one of my strongest assets.”But AI’s artistic abilities aren’t that impressive yet, at least not in music, said Michigan arts graduate Nolan Ehlers, who just completed his master’s in percussion and chamber music. He has watched some of his peers experiment with how it can be used to generate music. But having used it himself for cover letters, he says, it might be more suited for administrative tasks.“Whether you like it or not, it’s here,” he said. “So you might as well learn how to use it now and get all the benefits. It won’t do us much good to nervously avoid it.”For many Zoomers, AI is mostly seen a new technology to help save time and build new skills.“I don’t feel like this is a phase,” said Mashal Imtiaz, a Berkeley graduate and new Microsoft software engineer, adding that she’s comfortable with the tech but hasn’t yet used it at work. “This is one of those things that will be used and only more and more … and it’s just going to become part of our daily lives.”Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already long impacted our lives, but recent developments in the technology have created a frenzy around its possibilities and risks. While some are excited about saving time and money with new AI technologies, others are sceptical and would much rather proceed with caution.
 
The most common ways AI is used in 2023 are to respond to people via text or email, answer financial questions, plan a travel itinerary, craft an email, prepare for a job interview, write a social media post, and summarise complex or lengthy copy. We want to know how charity professionals think these, and other, uses will impact upon the crucial work of charities.
 
In this episode, Charity Digital Content Writer Laura Stanley (she/her) speaks to CEO Jonathan Chevallier (he/him),  Transformation Manager Kiki Tetley (they/them), and Content Editor Ioan Marc Jones (he/him) to learn more about the different perspectives of AI in the charity sector, how it’s already impacting the ways we are working, and how it could impact charity work in the future.

Generative artificial intelligence may be able to pass the bar exam or help CEOs write speeches. But those results have been generated in a controlled setting, and with relatively little at stake.
In the real world, enterprises face the age-old question of technology innovation: How will generative AI affect workers, particularly those with limited experience?

According to a new paper by MIT Sloan associate professor Danielle Li, MIT Sloan PhD candidate Lindsey Raymond, and Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson, PhD ’91, inexperienced workers actually stand to benefit the most from generative AI.
The co-authors found that contact center agents with access to a conversational assistant saw a 14% boost in productivity, with the largest gains impacting new or low-skilled workers. In other words, the workers were upskilled, not replaced, thanks to the technology.
“Generative AI seems to be able to decrease inequality in productivity, helping lower-skilled workers significantly but with little effect on high-skilled workers,” Li said. “Without access to an AI tool, less-experienced workers would slowly get better at their jobs. Now they can get better faster.”
A different kind of disruption
Generative AI is the latest in a line of technologies to disrupt the workplace. Computers that can complete data entry, bookkeeping, and basic assembly-line tasks have been replacing or augmenting workers for decades. More recently, computerization has streamlined research and analysis, helping workers do more in less time.
Many of these technologies work when provided with explicit instructions, Li said: If you provide the right input, the computer will give you the right output. The subset of generative AI known as large language models is different, though, as it can infer the relationships between the inputs and outputs. (“Language” is a bit of a misnomer, as models can also analyze audio and visual files, computer code, protein sequences, and many other data sources.)
“If you give a large language model enough pictures of your mother and pictures of women who aren’t your mother, it will be able to figure out whether a single picture is your mother,” Li said. “What’s the impact of a technology that can do that?”
Room for improvement in the contact center
To study the impact of large language models, the researchers looked at a customer contact center at a Fortune 500 company that sells software to small businesses in the U.S. Eighty-three percent of the agents were based outside the U.S.





14%


Share
























Contact center agents with access to an AI assistant were 14% more productive, with low-skilled workers improving the most. 
Average contact centers have much room for improvement, the researchers write. Supervisors can spend up to 20 hours each week training low performers. Improvement comes from experience, which often means dealing with stressed-out customers. This can lead to employee burnout and extraordinarily high turnover; annually, up to 60% of contact center workers leave, and companies spend as much as $20,000 to replace each employee.
“Highly skilled workers are good at reading customers’ frustration — and that can take getting yelled at for six months,” Li said.
An abundance of data is another reason contact centers are a good testing ground for generative AI. As anyone who has called a helpline knows, conversations between agents and customers are routinely recorded for quality assurance purposes.
That gives generative AI models access to a large training data set, which can be used to provide agents with recommended responses to common customer questions or links to relevant product documentation.
Li and her co-authors emphasized that the generative AI model was meant to augment and not outright replace the contact center employees. The model offered recommendations only if it was “sufficiently confident” in its answers, which reduced the number of incorrect responses. In addition, workers weren’t required to use the recommendations. They followed them 38% of the time, which is consistent with the industry average for generative AI tools, Li said.
Gains in efficiency and customer sentiment
Workers using the generative AI model increased the number of customer chats resolved per hour by 13.8%, the researchers found. Within two months, they were resolving 2.5 chats per hour, compared with 1.7 for colleagues not using the model, who needed eight months to hit the higher threshold. In addition, workers using the AI model spent an average of 35 minutes on each chat, compared with 40 minutes for their colleagues who lacked a model. (These figures also account for the fact that workers often manage more than one chat at once.)
As noted, productivity gains were highest among workers with the least experience, who resolved 35% more chats per hour when they used the generative model. Productivity was essentially flat for workers with the most skills and experience.
Using the generative AI model also led to improved customer sentiment. Requests to speak to a manager declined by 25%, and transfers to other departments tended to happen earlier in the conversation, which suggests that the AI model was able to help workers better match a customer’s problem to the right business unit for a solution.
“The large effects on the lower-skilled workers tell us a lot about how we’re changing what workers are saying,” Li said. “It’s not just a recommendation that they always follow. It’s not just auto-complete. It seems that the model was changing [how they responded], leaving the customer thinking the situation has been resolved.”
Important findings, uncertain implications 
The paper’s findings show a clear benefit to using generative AI in the context of the contact center. They also raise a lot of questions, Li said.

First, it isn’t clear who benefits from the productivity gains. Are contact center agents paid more when their performance improves, or do the developers of the AI model get a bonus? If workers can resolve more chats per hour, does a company hire fewer agents? Will contact center volumes increase as customers begin to realize the experience is better than it used to be?
It’s also worth exploring whether workers are learning from the AI model’s recommendations or simply following instructions. Are they becoming what Li described as a “small business owner whisperer,” learning how to diagnose customers’ specific problems? Or are they more like programmers copying code snippets from GitHub or drivers getting to their destination faster using Waze — using the provided recommendations to augment their work without thinking about how to solve the larger problem.
“If you’re just typing the recommendations, then you may not necessarily be learning. You’re more productive, but the source of your productivity resides in the technology,” Li said.
On the other hand, if companies take the time to teach workers how the technology can augment what they do, “workers start to learn faster, “ Li said. “And being faster at learning is going to make a big difference.”

AI continues to dominate thinking in 2023 and is often – as is the way of the world these days – couched in apocalyptic terms. At the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity last week, discussion of AI was everywhere – featuring in numerous talks on the official programme for delegates, but also in ‘fringe’ events taking place across the city. The backdrop to all this was a sinister-sounding new report from Forrester that dropped the week before and prophesied that “advertising agencies in the US will automate 7.5% of jobs by 2030”.
The prospect of so many jobs being replaced by machines undoubtedly conjures up fear, alongside a sense of inadequacy and worthlessness. But in the wider discussions and debates, some more optimistic and nuanced positions emerged, along with the prospect that AI might improve rather than decimate our creative lives.
This was expressed in two very different talks – one on the main stage at the festival, which saw OpenAI’s COO Brad Lightcap in conversation with Margaret Johnson, CCO and partner at ad agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners; the other in a storefront in the city hosted by Wieden+Kennedy ad agency, which saw a much smaller crowd take in the thoughts of Nilesh Ashra, CEO of OK Tomorrow. Here’s what they had to say.

Automation fears have long haunted the future of work. Generative AI is now the latest technology to inspire fear and optimism.
AI will augment jobs in the future. But the argument could be made that job augmentation for some means job replacement for others. For example, if a worker's job is made 10 times easier, the positions created to support that job might become unnecessary.







A June 2023 McKinsey report stated that generative AI (GenAI) would automate 60% to 70% of employee workloads.
AI is already replacing jobs, responsible for nearly 4,000 cuts made in May 2023, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. OpenAI -- the company that created ChatGPT -- estimated 80% of the U.S. workforce would have at least 10% of their jobs affected by large language models (LLMs).

Examples of AI job replacement
One recent case of AI job replacement came when a writer at a tech startup was let go without explanation, but later found references to her as ""Olivia/ChatGPT"" on the work Slack channel. She also found communications from her managers about how ChatGPT was cheaper than using a writer. So, while there was no official explanation for the job loss, the signs pointed to AI.
The Writers Guild of America also went on strike, saying they wanted more regulation of AI in addition to higher wages and more residuals from streaming platforms.

GenAI might also disproportionately affect the jobs of women, according to a recent study from the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. Approximately 79% of working women have positions that are susceptible to automation versus 58% of working men.
In past automation-fueled labor fears, machines would automate tedious, repetitive work. GenAI is different in that it automates creative tasks such as writing, coding and even music making. For example, musician Paul McCartney used AI to partially generate his late bandmate John Lennon's voice to create a posthumous Beatles song. In this case, mimicking a voice worked to the musician's benefit, but that might not always be the case.


Other ways AI could affect jobs
Job replacement isn't the only effect AI could have on work. The positive angle is human-machine cooperation. AI will help people improve their work experience by automating rote, repetitive tasks. The technology will maximize the ""goods"" of work while minimizing the ""bads."" This may contribute to a surge in AI jobs and increased demand for AI skills.
AI needs a lot of human feedback. For example, LLMs train using a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback where people fine tune models by repeatedly ranking outputs from best to worst. A May 2023 paper also describes the phenomenon of model collapse, which states that LLMs malfunction without a connection to human-produced data sets.
There's also a another angle -- that workers will collaborate with AI, but it will stunt their productivity. For example, a generative AI chatbot might create an overabundance of low-quality content. Editors would then need to write additional content to flesh out the articles, pushing the search for unique sources of information lower on their list of priorities.


Jobs most affected by AI
Writing is just one example of a job being automated by the latest AI systems, but there are many job types that could be affected in various ways, including the following:
Administrative
GenAI tools can help office administrators and assistants with tasks such as basic email correspondence, identifying data trends, finding mutually available meeting times across time zones and other summary/synthesis exercises.
For example, Microsoft 365 Copilot -- a collection of AI-powered tools integrated into Microsoft's productivity suite -- could radically increase office workers' productivity.
Coding
Programs such as ChatGPT can write fluent, syntactically correct code faster than most humans, so coders who are primarily valued for producing high volumes of low-quality code quickly might be concerned. Coders who produce a quality product might have nothing to fear, however, and use AI to improve their workflow instead.
Customer service
The customer service sector offers many opportunities for automation. AI-powered chatbots can provide speedy, personalized responses to customer questions, reducing the need for human workers. There are many examples of AI in customer service pre-ChatGPT, including the following:

Robotic process automation.
Customer self-service.
Chatbots.
Sentiment analysis.

It's likely customer service departments will continue to integrate the newest AI technologies.
Currently, ChatGPT can't automate an entire contact center, but there are many ways it could lighten the workload, such as translating or summarizing customer inquiries.
Legal
There is significant evidence indicating AI will affect legal jobs.
AI will eventually perform many of the tasks paralegals and legal assistants typically handle, according to one study by authors from Princeton University, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania. A March 2023 study from Goldman Sachs said AI could perform 44% of the tasks that U.S. and European legal assistants typically handle. GPT-4, OpenAI's latest and greatest language model, passed the Uniform Bar Examination in the 90th percentile.
AI could help automate routine law tasks such as the following:

Document review.
Contract analysis.
Legal research.
Searches for relevant case law.

Teachers
Teachers could be affected by AI in several ways. The immediate concern is that they will have a harder time detecting plagiarism or students cheating on assignments. But AI could help teachers by doing the following:

Acting as productivity tools.
Drafting lesson plans.
Generating quiz questions and mock tests.

Teacher sentiments range from being worried about the technology replacing them to insisting that the in-person classroom connection is essential to education.
Some people draw an analogy between ChatGPT and when students weren't allowed to use calculators in the classroom. Now, most people have a calculator app on their smartphone. There might also be a time when it becomes accepted for students to use ChatGPT to aid with schoolwork.
Finance
AI is also making an impact on finance and banking. GenAI could be used to monitor transactions and give detailed financial advice on how to save and spend efficiently. For example, Morgan Stanley uses AI-powered chatbots to organize its database.



AI has several use cases in banking.





Graphic designers
Adobe Photoshop's new Generative Fill feature is one example of the way generative AI can augment the graphic design profession. The feature lets people with no photo editing experience make photorealistic edits using a text prompt. Other tools -- such as Dall-E and Midjourney -- also create realistic looking images and detailed artistic renderings from a text prompt.
Engineering
Generative design uses AI to expedite the computer-aided design process. Generative design helps with ideation, generating all computationally possible solutions to a problem within a given set of parameters -- even when the design is completely novel and a radical change from anything that has come before.
Even though generative design affects the field of mechanical design, it is unlikely to replace human engineers.
Human resources
The hype around AI and the fear of job losses has created a difficult dynamic for HR departments to manage in the interim.
""[Generative AI] will infiltrate every aspect of HR,"" said Patrick Thibodeau, a senior news writer at TechTarget, in a podcast. However, AI-powered recruiting tools could be used to do the following:

Source qualified candidates.
Review resumes.
Automate recruiter tasks.




AI in recruiting has its positives and negatives.





AI chatbots could also be used internally to help employees access their benefits and perform other self-service tasks.


What AI legislation is there?
In recent months, leaders in the AI industry have been actively seeking legislation, but there is no comprehensive federal approach to AI in the United States. Still, there have been state- and city-level rules passed. Several states -- including California, Illinois, Texas and Colorado -- have introduced or passed laws focused on protecting consumers from harms caused by AI.
New York City passed a bill, Local Law 144, regulating the use of AI in recruiting effective July 5, 2023. The law requires independent audits of AI hiring tools and publication of findings.
Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic launched the Frontier Model Forum on July 26, 2023. The forum aims to advance AI safety research, identify best practices for AI development and collaborate with policymakers to develop applications that help solve societal challenges. Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic and Inflection also pledged to subject AI systems to third-party testing before releasing systems to the government, and to clearly label generated content.
The European Union has the AI Act, which will be the world's first AI legislation and is expected to take shape late this year. The U.S. Congress is not likely to pass comprehensive regulations similar to the EU legislation in the immediate future. On June 21st, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer formally unveiled an open-ended plan for AI regulation, explaining that it could take months to reach a consensus on a comprehensive proposal. Schumer emphasized that the regulations should focus on protecting workers, national security, copyright issues and protection from doomsday scenarios.



AI regulation of some form is not a question of if, but when.





On Oct. 30, 2023, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on artificial intelligence. The order, though not a law, is a binding government action. The executive order aims to protect consumer privacy, create educational resources, create new AI government jobs, advance equity and civil rights in AI in the justice system and support workers in response to AI's effects on the workforce.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are rapidly gaining traction, allowing the technology to be used throughout the enterprise to automate a variety of manual tasks performed by workers today, leading to what’s expected to be a major shift in the global job market.
In the US and Europe, as many as 300 million jobs could be threatened by some form of AI, according to a March research note by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Fully two-thirds of US jobs could be partially automated through AI, and up to one in four current work tasks could be completely automated by AI in the US and Europe, according to Goldman Sachs.
In particular, roles that require repetitive data entry, legal administration, careers that involve mathematical skills – even healthcare jobs – will all be impacted by AI’s adoption.











 
 
 
 Goldman Sachs
As much as 29% of computer-related job tasks could be automated by AI, as well as 28% of work by healthcare practitioners and technical tasks in that field, Goldman Sachs projected.

Career fields with the highest exposure to AI automation are administrative positions (46%) and tasks in legal (44%) professions. Not surprisingly, jobs less likely to be affected tend to be in physically intensive areas such as construction (6%) and maintenance (4%).
While automation through AI is expected to disrupt an array of career fields, including IT, not all jobs in those areas will be affected equally. For example, in the legal sector, paralegal jobs are likely endangered than attorneys — that’s one reason the legal sector’s score is so high, according to Goldman Sachs.











 
 
 
Officials at ManpowerGroup are seeing many of the same trends. “A majority of what we’re seeing now are [effects on] jobs that are more information based,” said Rebecca Croucher, head of North America marketing at the global staffing firm. “So, math, law, doctors —  more of a day-to-day diagnosis [of patients].”
Data processing tasks such as data entry are also “going away,” especially in banking, according to Croucher.
 Goldman Sachs
“No longer does someone have to sit there and enter invoices or accounts receivables. Any data coming in like that is now being automated,” she said.











 
 
 
With AI taking on so many tasks in so many fields, organizations will be pressed to upskill or reskill their existing workforce. In fact, half of IT employers are upskilling workers to address staffing challenges, according to a June 8 report from ManpowerGroup. The report claims that emerging technologies such as AI and virtual reality could even help hire and train new employees.
Croucher said the need to retrain employees as AI takes on tasks will hit companies “hard and fast.” “I think there is the cirriculum available, but I don’t think the rubber has hit the road yet. In the US, you’re starting to hear more about apprenticeship programs in areas like cybersecurity,” Croucher said. “The need will happen. And when it hits, it will be a big wave.
Knowledge worker jobs are also threatened by AI.











 
 
 


 


Jack Berkowitz, chief data officer for HR software and service provider ADP, said companies are now taking longer to hire knowledge workers. For the most part, Berkowitz said, ADP’s data shows major dislocations for workers in three areas: digital marketing, digital advertising, and digital sales.
“…That’s because the previous generation of technology in e-commerce and marketing required people to click buttons to manage the search engine optimization,” he said. “Now, the tools are automating that. So, it’s the modern job that’s getting disrupted.”
Automating yourself out of a job
Berkowitz noted that in his current role, where he is helping to develop AI and machine learning tools to eliminate manual data analytics tasks, he may well be automating himself out of a job. But he calls the technology “amazing” and is sanguine about his future after 30 years working in product development for ADP.











 
 
 
For more than two years, the company has been using various large language models (LLMs), including GPT 4 and Google Bard, to improve the efficiency of ADPs’ skills graph. That application, among other things, maps in-demand skills to what people should be paid for them and the capabilities of the workforce.
“All the job numbers you see [from ADP] about who’s doing what and in what professions, that’s all actually run by machine learning and AI that we developed two or three years ago. So, all of the job numbers — everything that we publish — has machine learning behind it today,” Berkowitz said. “The technology is amazing.
“These large language models turn out to be really good at summarizing data. So, do I need someone to spend 100 hours building a dashboard for me, or will the new tools allow me to do it almost dynamically?” he said. “There are research assistants, associates; there are people who configure business rules around companies. Well, here’s our policy and now we’re going to configure and put those policies into action by either configuring software or training people on processes.











 
 
 
“These systems are really good at reading a policy document and taking action as a result of that,” Berkowitz said.
The good news: worker displacement from automation in the past has usually been offset by new job creation. That trend accounts for the vast majority of long-term employment growth.
Even as ADP automated digital tasks once done by workers, it didn’t reduce headcount as a result. In fact, Berkowitz said, the company ended up paying those data analysts more because those employees could develop new skills and advance up the career ladder.











 
 
 
“So, we literally changed the jobs for 10 or 12 people internally. I think eventually, my job might go away. I think if we do a good enough job, it will. But that’s OK. What’s wrong if I put myself out of work? That means I’ve done something meaningful and contributed,” Berkowitz said. “I’ve done my job. I’m sure they’d find something else for me to do.”
And, he noted, AI is not perfect. For at least the foreseeable future, it will continue to be more of a co-pilot than pilot in charge; people will still be needed to ensure the work produced by generative AI tools is accurate.
A coming productivity boom?
The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a productivity boom that could boost economic growth substantially, “although the timing of such a boom is hard to predict,” Goldman Sach said.











 
 
 
A study released this week by Upwork, a freelance staffing platform provider, underlines that possibility; it indicates companies plan to hire more people even with the rise of generative AI.
Contrary to the assumption that AI will replace millions of jobs, Upwork’s survey of 1,400 US business leaders across various industries found 64% of C-suite executives plan to hire more professionals of all types due to generative AI. And 49% of all respondents, which included senior managers through C-suite level, plan to hire more freelancers and full-time employees.
Remote-first enterprises are more likely to embrace generative AI, with 68% of full-time remote companies saying they’re actively doing so, compared to 53% of companies that are full-time in the office.











 
 
 
Almost six in 10 (59%) business leaders also said they’re personally embracing generative AI tools.
The survey, however, found a disconnect between leaders and their teams. Seventy-three percent of C-suite executives think their company is actively using AI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney, but just 53% of vice presidents, directors and senior managers say that’s the case. Kelly Monahan, managing director of Upwork Research Institute, said some teams are reticent to rollout AI due to a lack of understanding and training around the technology.
“Businesses that want to bridge this gap should roll out a change management strategy that includes communicating the expected outcomes for their workforce in relation to generative AI adoption, and clear policies,” Monahan said in a statement. “It’s important that leaders address fear and uncertainty, and, perhaps most critically, encourage their teams to adopt a learning orientation.”











 
 
 
The arrival of the ‘AI age’
Just as the industrial revolution ushered in the industrial age and the computer revolution launched the information age, the AI revolution heralds the coming AI age, according to Anant Agarwal, founder of online education provider edX. Not surprisingly, Agarwal sees the AI age as an opportunity to upskill workers for jobs that will be created through automation.
“With a billion jobs worldwide projected to undergo a dramatic evolution within the next decade due to AI, the demand for rapidly-growing skills, such as AI/machine learning, cloud computing, cybersecurity, product management, project management, and digital social media, is soaring, Agarwal said. Those skill sets, which opened up over five million job opportunities in 2022 alone, “represent a seismic shift in the job market.
“AI will become an augmentation skill that everyone will nee,d no matter what their job. For example, call center specialist to ChatGPT-augmented call center specialist,” Agarwal said.











 
 
 
AI itself will need to be tailored for specific tasks, managed and monitored. For example, prompt engineers will be needed to craft and optimize text prompts for LLMs to achieve desired outcomes. “[It] helps LLMs for rapid iteration in product prototyping and exploration, as it tailors the LLM to better align with the task definition quickly and easily,” said Marshall Choy, senior vice president of product at SambaNova Systems, a Silicon Valley startup that makes semiconductors for AI.
AI systems will also have to be monitored to ensure their output is accurate and useful; that will be the job of an AI auditor.  
Overall, AI competence will be prized by employers, with AI skills, from coding to working alongside AI, understanding its implications, and integrating it into existing structures, necessary in coming months.











 
 
 
“The future belongs to those who are ready to embrace the AI wave,” Agarwal said. “Remember, AI may not take away your job, but could be something that can help you do it more effectively.”

The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 found three-quarters of companies expect to adopt AI and half thought it would create jobs.But what do workers think about the transformation and how ready are they to embrace it?PwC’s latest Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey, presented at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, finds ""sizeable pockets"" of the global workforce are eager to learn new skills, embrace AI and tackle new challenges.Have you used generative AI to help you tick off your to-do list today? Since the launch of ChatGPT-4 in March, more and more companies have been trialling and adopting the latest artificial intelligence tools in search of productivity gains.Almost 75% of companies surveyed by the World Economic Forum for the Future of Jobs Report 2023 are expected to adopt generative AI – with high churn anticipated as a result. Around half of these organizations expect AI to create job growth, while 25% expect it to result in job losses.Around half of companies surveyed expect AI to drive job growth. Image: Future of Jobs ReportA huge reskilling effort is underway to harness the potential of AI – and guard against its pitfalls. Employers estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted in the next five years.Training workers to use AI and big data ranked third among company skills-training priorities in the next five years, according to the Future of Jobs Report – and will be prioritized say 42% of surveyed companies.But that's just one side of the conversation – what do workers think about AI disruption and how ready and willing are they to upskill? Have you read?These are the jobs most likely to be lost – and created – because of AI The future of jobs in the age of AI, sustainability and deglobalizationAMNC23: How to close the skills gap to enable future growthReady player one?The central challenge facing business leaders today, according to PwC's Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey 2023, is getting buy-in from everyone in the organization to make its reinvention a success.At the Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, China, PwC presented the results of its survey in a session called The Global Workforce.""What the workers tell us is they are wanting to embrace the opportunity to upskill, to develop themselves, to be relevant, to be able to be more productive and to contribute to that reinvention of their organizations,"" said Peter Brown, PwC Global People and Organization Leader.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesPwC surveyed more than 54,000 workers in 46 countries and territories and found workers are largely positive about AI despite the job churn it represents.""They see it as something that enables them to be more productive, to remove some of the mundane in their day-to-day work, an opportunity to develop new skills and, ultimately, an opportunity to create new job opportunities,"" added Brown.In the survey, more than 50% of workers chose at least one positive statement about the impact of AI on their careers, from increasing productivity to helping them gain new skills. Almost a third of respondents (31%) said: ""AI will help me increase my productivity/efficiency at work.""The majority of workers are positive about the impact of AI on their careers. Image: PwCWhen it comes to the shifting skills landscape, only a third (36%) of respondents strongly or moderately agree that the skills needed to succeed in their job will change significantly over the next five years.This contrasts with the 44% of employers who told the Forum skills would be disrupted in the next five years, showing the mindset gap around urgency between leaders and employees.Only a third of workers think the skills required for their job will change in the next five years. Image: PwCMinding the 'specialization gap'Digging deeper into worker perceptions around skilling needs, PwC identified a ""specialization gap"" – and it's growing, said Brown. ""We are seeing the emergence and the widening gap between those that have specialist skills and those that don't. Fifty-three percent of workers say they require specialist skills in order to do their job. That cohort of the workforce will broadly be more demanding of pay increases or promotions and seeking out opportunities to apply their skills and experiences. ""They will also be the people within an organization that are more likely to get opportunities to develop themselves and for upskilling.""Half of those whose jobs require specialist training said the skills needed to do their jobs would change significantly, compared to only 15% of those whose jobs don't require specialist training.PwC said this meant those workers who lack specialized training could be ""particularly vulnerable to job losses as skills continue to evolve, and as companies augment (or replace) jobs with automation, AI, or both"".The specialization gap affects how employees view skills. Image: PwCCrucially, workers without specialist training were less likely to say that the more human, soft skills, such as adaptability, critical thinking and collaboration, would be important to their role in the future.In another session at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, on New Skills for Fast-Moving Industries, Brown said those with specialist skills were more likely to have access to upskilling opportunities from their employer and are ""much more aware of the impact of technology disruptions and the importance of human skills"".""We need the whole workforce to be engaged and motivated and empowered to deliver this innovation.""Those who don't see their job will require new skills in the next five years don't get easy access to upskilling opportunities in their organizations. There is a great danger and unless we respond to that, we will have a whole society that is disadvantaged. We must work together as business leaders, as policymakers, as governments to solve that.""Bringing everyone along on the upskilling journeyGrowing skills gaps could further increase economic inequality and also slow down attempts to innovate for companies.PwC put the responsibility squarely on leaders for bringing everyone along and engaging employees in upskilling – but also to create a culture where it's OK to experiment and fail.Brown said: ""If we want to innovate and transform, innovation by its very nature requires valuing making mistakes, stretching boundaries. If workers are in an environment where culturally they feel it is not safe to make small-scale errors or to challenge and debate development, then there is a problem.""There is a real call to action for leaders to really have a look at the culture and focus on making sure it is inclusive, embracing all ideas, all diversity, not just gender but all forms of diversity so that we can solve those problems.""Transparency and inspiration were identified in the report as key tools for leaders to help in the transformation process.""As a leader, you must create a narrative around your vision for the future of your organization, and align it with the company's purpose and mission. Encourage employees to ask questions and get involved, which helps create ownership and inclusion.""Putting the AI in trainingWhen it comes to AI, employers need to nurture workers' interest in it, but also communicate the organization's approach to disruptive technologies and what they mean for jobs. ""Create opportunities for employees to responsibly experiment and explore with AI in their work, with the right guardrails around data access and privacy, copyright protection and other sensitive areas,"" said the report.""Being transparent and purpose-driven regarding plans and decisions can help employees who are wary of AI – and what it may mean for their jobs – feel more comfortable experimenting with it and even adopting it into their work where appropriate.""At the same time, strengthening the human skills that AI can’t replicate, as identified by the Forum's Future of Jobs Report, will be essential.Watch the full Global Workforce session here and the full New Skills for Fast-Moving Industries session here.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Future of WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalEmerging TechnologiesJobs and the Future of WorkShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

In a new study, researchers from IBM, Oxford University and Diamond Light Source show that IBM's AI Model, MoLFormer, can generate antiviral molecules for multiple target virus proteins, including SARS-CoV-2, that can accelerate the drug discovery process and bolster our response to future pandemics.





The results are laid out in a new paper published in Science Advances, and at the time of the paper's submission, the antiviral properties of eleven molecules were successfully validated by Oxford researchers. This breakthrough has the potential to get drugs to people faster in the next crisis and bring treatments for urgent, life-threatening illnesses within reach.
Early in the pandemic, a group of computer scientists at IBM wanted to explore if generative AI could be used to design never-before seen molecules to block SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. David Stuart, Head of the Division of Structural Biology in the Department of Clinical Medicine at the University of Oxford and Life Sciences Director at Diamond Light Source, the UK's national synchrotron who is an authority on pathogens HIV, SARS, and Ebola, among other viruses explains he was initially skeptical. ""The idea that you could take a protein sequence and, with AI, pluck out of thin air chemicals that would bind to a 3D site on the virus seemed very unlikely,"" he said.
However, he and Martin Walsh also an expert structural biologist and Life Sciences Deputy director at Diamond joined up with the IBM team and over the course of three years, demonstrated that generative AI could, ""pluck viable starting points for antivirals out of thin air,"" in collaboration with Enamine Ltd., a chemical supplier in Ukraine, and other researchers at Oxford.






Because the generative model was also a foundation model, pre-trained on massive amounts of raw data, it was versatile enough to create new inhibitors for multiple protein targets without extra training or any knowledge of its 3D structure.
The Stuart and Walsh groups had commenced working on two essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely the spike protein and the main protease. Using these targets, the team hit on four potential COVID-19 antivirals in a fraction of the time it would have taken using conventional methods. The work then exploited Diamond's high-throughput macromolecular crystallography beamlines to visualize how a subset of the AI generated compounds bound to the main protease.
Their work is showcased in their new paper in Science Advances and IBM has released a web-based interface for interacting with the model and chemical foundation models like it in IBM Cloud.
The team stated that the validated molecules have many more hurdles to clear, including clinical trials, before companies could potentially turn them into drugs. But even if the AI-generated ""hits"" never materialize into actual drugs, the work provides confirmation that generative AI has an important role to play in the future of drug development, especially in a time of crisis.
""It took time to develop and validate these methods, but now that we have a working pipeline in place, we can generate results much faster,"" said study co-senior author, Payel Das, a researcher at IBM Research. ""When the next virus emerges, generative AI could be pivotal in the search for new treatments.""
""Generating initial compounds that bind with high affinity to a drug target of interest accelerates the structure-based drug discovery pipeline and underpins our efforts to be better prepared for future pandemics,"" said, Martin Walsh, who was co-senior author at Diamond
The researchers built their model, Controlled Generation of Molecules (or CogMol), on a generative AI architecture known as variational autoencoders, or VAEs. VAEs encode raw data into a compressed representation, and then decode, or translate, it back into a statistical variation on the original sample. Their model was trained on a large dataset of molecules represented as strings of text, along with general information about proteins and their binding properties. But they deliberately left out information about SARS-CoV-2's 3D structure or molecules known to bind to it. Their goal was to give their generative foundation model a broad base of knowledge so that it could be more easily deployed for molecular design tasks it has never seen before.
Their goal was to find drug-like molecules that would bind with two COVID protein targets: the spike, which transmits the virus to the host cell, and the main protease, which helps to spread it. Though the 3D structures of both proteins had been discovered by that time, the IBM researchers chose to use only their amino acid sequences, derived from their DNA. By limiting themselves in this way, they hoped that the model could learn to generate molecules without knowing the shape of their target.






The researchers input only the amino acid sequence for each protein target into CogMol, which generated 875,000 candidate molecules in three days. To narrow the pool, the researchers ran the candidates through a retrosynthesis platform, IBM RXN for Chemistry, to understand what ingredients would be needed to synthesize the compounds. Based on the platform's predicted recipes, they selected 100 molecules for each target. Chemists at Enamine further pared the list to four molecules for each target, selecting those deemed easiest to manufacture.
After synthesizing the eight novel molecules, Enamine shipped them to Oxford for testing their ability to disrupt the functions of the two protein targets in the labs of Prof Chris Schofield and PRof Gavin Screaton. . The intense X-ray beam generated from Diamond which are 10 billion times brighter than the sun were used to visualize how the compounds interacted with proteins to inactivate their function. The novel compounds were further tested in target inhibition and live virus neutralization tests. Two of the validated antivirals target the main protease; the other two not only targeted the spike protein but proved capable of neutralizing all six major COVID variants. ""You get a map that shows exactly where things bind, and bang! you've got a confirmation,"" said Stuart.

CogMol is one of several chemical foundation models that IBM has since developed. The largest, MoLFormer-XL, was trained on a database of more than 1.1 billion molecules and is currently being used by Moderna to design mRNA medicines. ""We created valid starting points for accelerated development of antivirals using a generative foundation model that knew relatively little about its protein targets,"" said the study's co-senior author, Jason Crain, a researcher at IBM Research and professor at Oxford. ""I'm hopeful that these methods will allow us to create antivirals and other urgently needed compounds much faster and more inexpensively in the future.""
Though the researchers focused on validating antivirals for COVID, they argue that these methods can be extended to existing viruses that continue to mutate, like the flu, or viruses that have yet to surface. ""If you want to be prepared for the next pandemic, you want drugs that act on different sites of the protein,"" concluded Stuart. ""It becomes much harder for the virus to escape.""

Increasingly, artificial intelligence is playing key roles in driving business value, boosting efficiency while reducing costs. This trend is driving up demand for tech talent capable of building and maintaining AI models, which calls for a mix of evolving software coding capabilities and soft skills. We spoke to five leading artificial intelligence experts, to gauge how best to gain entry into a career in the space.






Highest-earning software salaries ranked — A deep dive into the highest-earning salaries that are being offered across the software market.

The AI job market
With so many areas of artificial intelligence being developed today, it makes sense that job creation in the space is bound to continue evolving with the space. 
Szymon Idziniak, machine learning engineer at STX Next, suggests splitting the AI job market into a few key roles:

Machine learning engineer – Someone who has a strong IT/engineering background, and the ability to write whole software by themselves. “They should also have strong machine learning background and need to understand how something is working before starting to use it.”
ML/deep learning researcher – Someone who has a strong mathematics and machine learning background. “They should have the ability to develop new neural networks from scratch to solve difficult programs. They will often lack some knowledge of software engineering, but could be supervised by another developer,” said Idziniak. Additionally, this role is mainly focused on just creating and evaluating new models.
Data scientist – Someone who has background in statistics, IT and mathematics. “They often lack software engineering background, but is good at analysing data and creating reports. They will have a good ability to write in notebook and provide useful insights of data, uses more classical ml approaches like XGBoost, scikit-learn, Pandas and NumPy.”
MLOps Engineer – Someone who has a strong DevOps background with knowledge of how to write code and also understands basic machine learning approaches. “They will mostly focus on how to utilise cloud providers in real projects.”

The best new roles in AI
When it comes to determining the job roles that are set to drive the most value from artificial intelligence-powered capabilities, experts see much of this value-add to come from product development pertaining to customer service and compliance.
“Prompt engineering is a role that has emerged recently with the development of generative AI technology. Prompt engineers are responsible for designing and refining the prompts or inputs that are used to generate text or other outputs from AI models,” says Kunal Purohit, chief digital services officer at Tech Mahindra.
“Another role that I can see emerging is AI product managers, who will be responsible for developing and managing generative AI products, from ideation to launch. The AI conversation designer, meanwhile, can be another role who is an expert in designing conversational interfaces for AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems, ensuring smooth and engaging user interactions.
“As the unprecedented power of AI and generative AI comes with a great deal of security and responsibility issues for its use, an ethics engineer will play a vital role to ensure transparency, fairness, and avoiding any unintended biases in the generated output. Then, the AI trainer will also get into the mainstream career path as they will have responsibility of training generative AI systems, teaching them to recognise patterns and generate output that aligns with specific goals.”
As every industry explores ways to harness generative AI to improve their business operations, many industry specific roles may emerge and evolve with time, and as generative AI continues to unfold its potential.

AI-led business processes – getting the balance right between business impact and staff satisfaction — David Semach, CEO of AIM Reply, spoke to Information Age about how businesses can keep staff motivated and productive alongside AI-led business processes.

Programming languages
According to Martin Butler, professor of management practice at Vlerick Business School, Python will be king when it comes to entering into and maintaining a career in artificial intelligence, due to it being widely used and easy to learn. 
He explains: “It provides an excellent entry into programming for novices, yet it is still used in complex scenarios by very seasoned programmers. Experienced developers will learn to add additional languages, often context-specific, but Python is the best entry point that can take you very far on the AI developer journey.”
When considering which programming languages not worth learning, Butler cites typical scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP, Perl and Ruby: “These are all very accomplished scripting languages which are powerful in their own right, but not necessarily for AI applications.
“The exception? Phyton, since it can be used for both scripting (i.e. easy to learn) and programming (more suited to AI work).”
Top technical qualifications
When looking to apply for job roles focused on AI, it’s important not to underestimate the challenges that the exciting but demanding technologies can bring — especially to those new to the space. 
“To put this in perspective, the UK’s main AI research organisation, DeepMind, used to recruit the top computer science graduate from Cambridge University each year, but they stopped that practice several years ago,” said Clare Walsh, director of education at the Institute of Analytics.
“They found that even the most promising, hardworking 21 year old was unable to cope with the demanding environment of experimental AI. As a company policy, DeepMind now require a PhD qualification as a minimum to get a job there.”
To become a chief data officer — a position increasingly involving work in AI — it is likely that a degree in a relevant field would be required as a minimum. Walsh continued: “There are different routes to do that. For example, to apply for Chartered data scientist status, a gold standard in the field, you’ll need a degree as a minimum.
“There are, of course, many people currently employed who went through different routes. Realistically, this current ‘AI summer’ or period of rapid expansion of AI only began in earnest around 2016. For the first few years, you had to be a PhD researcher, or perhaps completing an MSc to have access to university training in these fields.
“However, the field is becoming more formally regulated and although there will be older, more experienced coders who have no formal training, it would be risky to assume that the best jobs will still be available to anyone in, say 10 years’ time.”

UK data science degrees and diplomas — Here, we list out nearly 100 different data science university degrees (Bachelors and Masters), plus post-graduate diplomas and certifications.

Retraining as an AI specialist
One last question remains: is it ever too late to retrain as a specialist in artificial intelligence?
“I don’t think it’s ever too late,” said Heather Dawe, UK head of data at digital consultancy UST. “Diversity in the people who develop and use AI is so important – people who have done other things previously in their career or who have lived and worked in other ways bring diverse experiences and knowledge with them and this is a strength in itself.
“Further to this, given the uses of AI are likely to become more pervasive, we will all come into increasing contact with it. I think society will in turn become more aware of this and this familiarity will hopefully encourage more people to consider retraining as their interest is piqued.”

The human resources department has never been the cool kid in the workplace. Behind their back many people used to call this function “human remains.” In fact, the working assumption for years has been that HR is more often on the side of the top brass and too bossy itself. A Harvard Business Review article once put it like this: “We don’t like being told how to behave — and no other group in organizational life, not even finance, bosses us around as systematically as HR does.”Distrust of HR reached a zenith pre-pandemic when an admission in a regulatory filing from Uber Technologies Inc. ahead of its public offering noted within the summary of risk factors: “Our workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges.” This was a reference to sexism which the HR department sat on and ignored until engineer Susan Fowler blew the whistle.

Over the past year or so, there’s been no shortage of chatter about how artificial intelligence (AI) is going to fundamentally change the way we do our jobs as communicators. Could it take over writing and messaging tasks and make our jobs obsolete? Probably not. But could it serve as a significant virtual helper in getting our tasks done faster? Most likely yes.
However, there’s one important business function that’s about as people-centric as it gets that’s poised for AI treatment —- HR. As counterintuitive as it might sound, machine learning applications and programs might hold the key to helping HR professionals focus on what really matters —- the people that make the organization what it is.
Of course, HR should be aware of some areas of concern, especially around sensitive matters like workplace wellness. When a mental health service recently tested out an AI-assisted chatbot on its users, the results were not accurate once people realized they were chatting with a machine. This is a reminder that comms and HR should be forthright and transparent with employees about how they are automating HR tasks—and evaluating vendors to ensure they are being transparent, too.
If HR pros are being transparent with employees, however, there’s no reason why AI can’t help streamline processes and workflows. We spoke to two HR professionals to learn how they’re incorporating AI into their workflows without sacrificing the human element.
A virtual administrative assistant
The HR professional has a wide range of tasks on their plate. From onboarding to recruitment to organizing companywide benefits, there’s a lot for the HR department to handle to keep an organization moving forward. Could generative AI help HR pros by automating some of the more rote tasks of the role and help HR put increased emphasis on the humans within the organization?
According to Traci Chernoff, senior director of employee engagement at Legion Technologies, the answer is a resounding yes.
“Generative AI can really help foster closer human connections,” Chernoff said. “We use AI to help us derive schedules from multiple data points that a human brain simply wouldn’t be able to do as quickly.”
She added that having generative AI to work on some HR tasks has allowed her and her team to focus on other parts of the role
“Generative AI allows me to save time and I can focus that saved time on the people within the company,” she said.

Curbing apprehension
There’s bound to be some natural fear when AI is applied to HR – it’s right in the name human resources! But when HR pros view AI’s capabilities with openness rather than fear, they can expand their own skillsets.
“That initial apprehension is natural,” Chernoff says. “But I believe if you have a tool that can help foster deeper connections, that apprehension can be overcome. In this case, generative AI can allow HR professionals time to focus on the more creative and personalized parts of their jobs.”
She went on to add that some of the duties that an AI can help with include drafting policies and procedures and career development guidelines, but stressed that people are still needed to perfect them.
Jason Lapp, founder and CEO of Beautiful.ai, said that HR professionals should try to familiarize themselves with what AI can do to help them to ease any potential fears.
“People should really seek to try out any potential AI programs that might be able to help them,” Lapp said. “The rise of AI has presented a major opportunity for people to think of this technology in a positive, helpful way.”
The recruiting role of AI
Think about the first time you interacted with HR at your current job. Chances are, it was during the recruiting process. The journey in which you find your job is a very personal process that prompts you to quantify your skills, match them to a role, and get to know others that you’d gel with professionally.
But what if that process was somewhat automated by an AI? Would it cheapen the employee experience at all?
According to Chernoff, AI doesn’t just help in the recruiting journey — it opens things up for a more personalized job hunt.
“AI can help us in our administrative tasks like scheduling interviews, but it doesn’t take away from the needed human connection in recruiting at all,” she said. “The company doesn’t just need to know all about the person they’re bringing on board — the candidate needs to know about the people within the organization they’re set to join.”
Chernoff added that the value AI adds to the recruiting journey isn’t subtracting from focus on people — just the opposite.
“The human connection in recruiting is critical and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon,” she said. “It’s so important to involve people at every stage of the employee lifecycle, and it will remain so.”

The business world was set on fire by the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, 2023 has shaped up to be the year of artificial intelligence. AI is gaining momentum everywhere, and it's starting to look like it could be the next industrial revolution.While businesses are indulging in innovative AI hand over fist, though, individuals are often at a loss as to how to handle the new tech. Rather than a boon, they see AI as a job-threatening menace with no practical use for their personal lives.Nothing could be further from the truth. From improved employment searches to accessible living spaces to amusing adventures in the kitchen, here are a few examples of how the average consumer can and should be taking advantage of the new AI revolution.



1. Use AI to improve your job searchOne of the most ironic (though legitimate) uses of AI amongst consumers is as a job search tool. Commonly seen as a job-killer, artificial intelligence can help individuals find better-paying, more rewarding work.Take ChatGPT as a relatable example. The sophisticated AI tool can generate lists of skills, attributes and requirements for a specific role you want to fill. You could also ask the tool to list keywords to help ensure an application will make it past an ATS (applicant tracking system). Career growth platform Teal lays out a step-by-step process to have the program help you write your resume and even your cover letter.


AI may help us eliminate grunt work from our lives, which may mean certain jobs disappear. But the tool is also a powerful way to ensure that those who find themselves looking for work can move their careers forward, not back, as they take their next step.Related: 10 Tips For Writing An Impressive Resume2. Use AI to make living spaces more accessibleSometimes, the use of AI is already well-established in our lives. All we need to do is find new ways to apply it. That's the case with personal assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.We may not think of something as simple and common as a personal assistant as an application of AI. But these programs use vast, increasingly complex cloud-based algorithms and software to provide answers for consumers.


Alexa, for example, uses conversational AI in what is commonly called VUI or ""voice user interface."" This enables users to speak to an AI system without the need to click a mouse, press a button, or touch a screen. They don't even have to be in physical proximity to a device.This allows an individual to control many items in an easily accessible manner. From playing music to answering questions to turning off the lights and even checking the security system, personal assistants are powerful applications of AI tech in our daily lives.Related: Everything You Can Do With Amazon Alexa3. Use AI to facilitate day-to-day creativityArtificial intelligence doesn't have to be practical or profitable to have value. On the contrary, its use as a recreational tool is also something to consider.


This can take a couple of different forms. For instance, you can use AI to make a recreational activity more convenient, like using a personal assistant to turn on a song or turn off the TV. But it goes further than that. There are many ways you can have AI get in on the creative action, too.All you need to do is input a meal idea, and the program sets to work coming up with a data-backed recommendation for your next meal. You can even specify the ingredients you have available. Once you have a recipe you like, the tool can store it for later use.There may be more important things to use AI tools for than culinary adventures. Even so, few of them will yield tastier results… or more intriguing ones.Related: Get Cooking With This Latest Feature On Google Home


Allowing AI to impact you for the betterArtificial intelligence may be all the buzz in the business world. The trend doesn't have to stop there, though. Consumers don't need to sit on the sidelines while corporations take advantage of the latest technology to superpower their daily activities.On the contrary, there are countless ways individuals can use AI to create life-changing alterations to their daily activities. From empowering their job searches to making their living spaces more accessible to igniting intriguing new hobbies, AI can impact life as we know it, even in the smallest ways.The best part? The party is just getting started.Don't let AI intimidate you. Just like every other major technological advancement, look for ways to harness the change and use it to impact your life and the lives of those around you for the better.

The addition of these features aims to assist in various tasks, including the drafting of job descriptions and employee performance goals.Generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, which can generate human-like responses to prompts, have become increasingly popular in the technology sector. Companies like Microsoft and Alphabet&#039;s Google have already incorporated such AI systems into their search engines.Track Budget 2024 updates real-time with BT&#039;s non-stop live streaming of India&#039;s most-important event from 8 am to 7 pm However, many businesses have approached generative AI technology with caution due to concerns about its ability to generate false information and provide unsettling responses.Oracle&#039;s human resources software is widely used by large enterprises for functions like hiring new employees and conducting performance evaluations. As part of the software update, Oracle will introduce a button feature in several fields, enabling the automatic generation of draft text for job listings, performance goals, and other related areas.Watch BT Visual Story 10 Hidden iPhone and Android Smartphone Features You Probably Didn&#039;t Know AboutThe decision to implement AI assistance in the form of a button, as opposed to a chatbot that responds to open-ended prompts from users, is intended to ensure that the generated text consistently delivers satisfactory and safe results. Rich Buchheim, Vice President of Product Management for Oracle Adaptive Intelligence Applications, highlighted that the text produced by the AI system would still require human approval.Buchheim explained, &amp;quot;We don&#039;t expect generative AI is going to write your goals for you. It&#039;s going to give you a starting place, and it&#039;s going to give you useful information that you can get going with.”These AI-driven features are expected to be available by the end of this year.Looking ahead, Oracle aims to explore the application of AI in more complex human resources tasks. For instance, the company plans to develop AI capabilities that can generate job requirement listings in compliance with local regulations across different markets. By streamlining such processes, Oracle hopes to significantly reduce the time taken for decision-making and implementation.Guy Waterman, Vice President of People Analytics and Human Capital Management Technology and Innovation at Oracle, expressed enthusiasm for the potential impact of generative AI. He said, &amp;quot;It may have taken a week or two weeks for someone to make a decision and then implement it. If we can change that to hours and minutes, that&#039;s where we&#039;re really seeing the difference with the possibilities of generative AI.&amp;quot;Also Read&#039;Buying Netflix at $4 billion would&#039;ve been better instead of...&#039;: Former Yahoo CEO Marissa MayerChatGPT beats top investment funds in stock-picking experiment","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202306/2023-06-28t201731z_1683105510_rc2js1aspk5b_rtrmadp_3_oracle-ampere-computing_0-sixteen_nine.jpg?size=1280:720', 'height': '720', 'width': '1280'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pranav Dixit', 'url': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/author/pranav-dixit'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Business Today', 'url': 'https://www.businesstoday.in', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt-schema-logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600'}}",,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', 'headline': 'Oracle blends generative AI features into HR software to streamline job descriptions, performance goals', 'url': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/oracle-blends-generative-ai-features-into-hr-software-to-streamline-job-descriptions-performance-goals-387552-2023-06-29', 'datePublished': '2023-06-29\\T10:56:59+05:30', 'author': {'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/author/pranav-dixit'}}]",https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/oracle-blends-generative-ai-features-into-hr-software-to-streamline-job-descriptions-performance-goals-387552-2023-06-29,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.headline', '.summary']}",,,,,,en_US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202306/2023-06-28t201731z_1683105510_rc2js1aspk5b_rtrmadp_3_oracle-ampere-computing_0-sixteen_nine.jpg?size=1280:720', 'caption': 'Oracle', 'width': '1200', 'height': '900'}","{'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/author/pranav-dixit', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pranav Dixit'}",

Oracle has announced the addition of generative AI-powered capabilities known as Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM) to boost their HR functions and productivity.

These capabilities will be embedded in their existing HR processes with the help of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) gen AI service. The aim is to enhance HR functions, drive faster business value, improve productivity, facilitate HR strategies, and enhance candidate and employee experience.Also Read:

Chris Leone, Executive Vice President for Applications Development and Oracle Cloud HCM shared, ""With the new embedded generative AI capabilities in Oracle Cloud HCM, our customers will be able to take advantage of large language models to significantly reduce the time required to complete tasks, improve the employee experience, enhance the accuracy of workforce insights, and ultimately increase business value.""
How will the generative AI capabilities of Oracle Cloud HCM be helpful?
Oracle Cloud HCM is designed to allow customers to utilize their data and filter models according to their business requirements. It runs on dedicated generative AI models in synchronisation with each customer's proprietary data. Furthermore, Oracle has declared that the control of data used by generative AI rests solely with the customers, ensuring protection from data theft for sensitive and proprietary information. Therefore, Oracle Cloud HCM will assist Oracle's HR processes for candidates, employees, managers, and recruiters in a streamlined and secure manner.
How will the Gen AI capabilities of Oracle HCM boost HR efficiency?
Deepa Param Singhal, Vice President of Applications at Oracle India, explained, ""Despite significant strides in the business landscape, several HR challenges persist in enterprises, hindering their ability to create an efficient work environment for their employees."" She added, ""As we move forward into an increasingly digital era, our generative AI-embedded Oracle Cloud HCM will emerge as an intelligent tool that is set to elevate the employee experience by equipping them with built-in modern, intelligent tools and features that automate mundane daily tasks.""
Furthermore, during a quarterly meeting for Oracle's Q4 2023 earnings, Larry Ellison, Chairman, and CTO, announced the launch of a new generative AI cloud service in partnership with Cohere, a Canadian startup specializing in large language models (LLMs). He added, ""Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models."" Oracle predicts that specialized LLMs will become a significant part of generative AI in the near future.

But amid the recent surge in AI's popularity suddenly, IBM's Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) Nickle LaMoreaux has revealed many positive developments that the company has witnessed in recent months.How AI Is Helping IBM                        indiatimesIBM's CHRO has revealed that internally, A.I. has freed employees from back-office administrative work, allowing them to perform more nuanced work requiring human touch points. LaMoreaux says that, in total, IBM’s HR department has saved close to 12,000 hours in the last 18 months by automating systems that previously required back-and-forth exchanges between managers and employees.The irony of IBM’s A.I. use case is that the same technology HR uses to expedite rote processes could ultimately put them out of work. In May, the company announced it would pause hiring for back-office roles—many in human resources performing duties like writing employment letters or overseeing cross-department employee transfers—A.I. could perform. LaMoreaux says the decision to freeze hiring for such roles was made intentionally and strategically.“We don’t want to bring in a bunch of people and then find out that large portions of their job are actually being transformed by A.I.,” she says. “We are being cautious. We are pausing in certain jobs, so we can shift the hiring focus to the revenue-generating, product-building pieces.”Also Read: ""Don't Rush Investments Into AI Just Because Its Cool"" Warns 'Father Of Internet' IBM Sees Ample Opportunity In AI                        gettyIt’s not an approach unique to IBM, but the company sees ample opportunity to leverage A.I. within its people operations and has invested heavily in it. IBM also uses A.I. during performance evaluation, automating the determination of which employees qualify for a raise or promotion. Its A.I. platform, LaMoreaux says, does the tedious work of culling through data, including past performance ratings, skills, whether employees are up to date on training and their length of employment. It then sends recommendations to managers to cross-check. Managers can ask the A.I. why an employee isn’t on the list. The tool may respond, for instance, that the employee hasn’t met a certification requirement, and provide dates for upcoming certification exams,  as per Fortune report.With the time saved, LaMoreaux says, managers can invest in coaching employees on how they can improve and career progression.“We’ve got over 280 different A.I. automations running inside HR right now,” LaMoreaux says. “That’s what is different here. It’s making HR more human because we’re spending time on things that matter.”  She adds: “Every company is a technology company right now. We’re all being impacted by A.I.”What IBM CEO Had Said About AI                        indiatimesEarlier this year in April, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna argued that A.I. helps employers “tackle the kind of tasks most people find repetitive, which frees up employees to take on higher-value work.” He pointed to IBM, noting that its A.I. use has cut the number of HR professionals performing manual work from 700 to fewer than 50. A.I.’s impact on the job market has long been a chief concern. The World Economic Forum had said in a report last month that A.I. could affect around 40% of all working hours, with clerical and secretarial roles likely to see a quick decline.Will AI Lead To Job Losses In IBM?The IBM boss had also noted earlier this year that he could ""easily"" see 30% of these positions substituted by AI over five years, implying about 7,800 jobs at the company are likely to be taken over by AI,On the other hand, IBM's CHRO LaMoreaux admits she’s thinking ahead to what happens if IBM terminates employees due to A.I. “The thing companies need to think about is how [they] can provide skilling and programs well ahead of time,” she says. “If you’re at the point of severance, you’re already too late.” She urges companies to be transparent about their A.I. strategy and train employees on the tools and skills needed to remain integral to the company’s hereafter, the report mentioned.Pausing hiring for certain positions seems to LaMoreaux like a sensical first step as IBM continues its A.I. experimentation, gathers data on job efficacy, and upskills talent to meet the A.I. demands of the future.                        ilr.cornell.edu“The real piece that we’ve got to get ahead of now is the 80% or 90% of jobs that aren’t going away, but that we all need to reskill on,” she says. “How can you provide skills and programs well ahead of time? Do you have a view 18 months from now? What portions of the job are going to change? Do people have access to training? That’s the pivot we need to make.”Reflecting on the change in landscape, IBM's CHRO further said “It used to be that you could get a degree, become an expert in something, and it would carry you for an entire decades-long career. The half-life of skills is now shrinking because of new technology. Whatever the next thing is, having the ability to continuously learn is the big differentiator for employees, regardless of what industry you’re going into, what job role you’re in, and if you’re early in your career or late in your career. This is going to be a defining skill.”Also Read: TCS Confirms Plan To Build Its Own ChatGPT-Like AI ToolFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

Inventors, creators, and IP lawyers in Canada and worldwide are currently grappling with the same question: How can statutory regimes, developed without artificial intelligence in mind, cope with the current torrent of AI-generated creative works?
“There’s an ongoing debate – and this is around the world,” says Aird & Berlis LLP partner Amy Grenon. “If you are using AI, how do you protect the inventions that the AI will come up with?”
One of the question’s most prolific askers is Stephen Thaler, who has posed it in jurisdictions worldwide. For example, he has been trying to register one of his AI creations – Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience (DABUS) – as a patent inventor but has been unsuccessful at the US Federal Court, the UK Appeals Court, the European Patent Office, the Federal Court of Australia, and the German Federal Patent Court.

In Thaler’s US case, he named DABUS as the sole inventor. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected the patent because its “plain reading” of the Patent Act referred to inventors as natural persons, says Charles Morgan, a partner at McCarthy Tétrault, national co-leader of the firm’s cyber/data group, and former leader of the technology law group. In May 2020, in Thaler v. Vidal, the US Federal Circuit Court agreed with the USPTO and held that an AI tool does not have the right to be an inventor of a patent.

Amy Grenon, Charles Morgan and Jim Holloway
The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) similarly issued Thaler a non-compliance notice for his DABUS patent application, noting that it does not appear possible for a machine to have legal rights in Canada nor transfer them to a human. CIPO’s notice added, however, that Thaler could try re-applying and include a statement on behalf of the AI tool identifying himself as the “legal representative of the machine,” says Morgan.
In Thaler’s attempts to date, almost all the courts have said that he needs a human inventor, says Grenon, adding that “there were different glosses put on that in the various jurisdictions.” The issue has yet to be litigated in Canada, she says.
“That’s the problem with all of these statutes. The statutes were developed in the context of having humans do this, and so aren’t necessarily contemplating AI. What do you do to try and get that protection?”













Artificial intelligence is raising similar questions about copyright and trademarks. These rapidly developing issues relate to the IP protection for output – what the AI tool produces – and the input – whether the tool infringes on other IP owners when it digests data to inform its processes.
In 2021, Heritage Canada launched a consultation to explore whether and how Canada should update its copyright framework in the face of AI and the internet of things. As the law stands, a piece of work generally requires a human author for copyright protection. But in two recent cases, applicants got creative and successfully copyrighted AI-produced works.
Ankit Sahni successfully registered an AI-generated painting named SURYAST with CIPO. Sahni, from New Dehli, India, listed himself as an author and the tool RAGHAV Artificial Intelligence Painting App as the co-author. Morgan says SURYAST is the first-ever Canadian copyright registration with an AI author. But he adds that it is unclear whether CIPO would have registered the work had Sahni not included himself as a co-author.
A BC man named Hugh Stephens also recently successfully registered a poem and accompanying image created by AI language and image-generating tools ChatGPT and DALL·E 2. Stephens listed himself as the author, but part of the title states that the work was “created entirely by AI programs” and involved “minimal skill and judgement on the part of the human claiming copyright.”
According to Morgan, the US Copyright Office recently formally rejected two attempted registrations of AI-generated work and released guidance on AI-related copyright registrations.












One was A Recent Entrant to Paradise, an image Steven Thaler’s algorithm Creativity Machine produced. The Copyright Review Board affirmed the denial of Thaler’s registration because the image lacked an element of human authorship.
The same was true for the graphic novel Zarya of the Dawn. The Copyright Office found that the images in the book that were produced using the AI system Midjourney were not protectable.
In March, the Copyright Office released its guidance on AI-generated work and confirmed that human authorship is required for copyright protection. The office will examine whether the work is “basically one of human authorship,” with the AI functioning as an “assisting instrument,” or whether a machine was responsible for the “traditional elements of authorship,” says Morgan. The office notes applicants should not list the AI as the author or co-author.
For generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney, before they can create something based on a user prompt, they must first crawl the internet, copy massive data sets, and use them for training their systems. The IP question is whether the entity using the AI model to train on the data set has the appropriate rights to do so, says Morgan. There have already been several class actions brought against generative AI toolmakers claiming they broke copyright in the mass copying of data.
One case is against Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI. Two anonymous plaintiffs seek to represent those who own the copyright to code on GitHub. They argue that Microsoft and its subsidiaries illegally reproduced their code and breached open-source licensing terms in training Copilot, an AI coding tool. The plaintiffs launched the suit in US District Court in California in November 2022.












In Andersen v. Stability AI, MidJourney & DeviantArt, the plaintiffs accuse the defendants of training their AI image-generating tools on billions of copyrighted artworks without the artists’ consent. In doing so, the plaintiffs say the companies have violated the rights of millions of artists.
The stock-image supplier Getty Images is suing Stability AI in the US and the UK. Getty claims that Stability unlawfully copied more than 12 million images from its database without permission or compensation and to establish a competing business.
The argument in defence of these actions will be based on “fair dealing” or “fair use,” says Morgan. Under Canadian copyright law, to reproduce a substantial portion of a copyrighted work, a person must obtain the licensed right from the copyright owner. But some contexts are an exception to that rule and fall under the category of fair dealing in Canada and fair use in the US. One example is when a copyrighted work is used for research purposes.
Morgan says that the case Authors Guild v. Google Inc. will have significant precedential influence for defendants employing the fair-use doctrine in defence of generative AI.
Google had scanned tens of millions of books, made digital copies, established a search function within the books, and made snippets of the books publicly available. The Authors Guild claimed copyright infringement, but the District Court for the Southern District of New York held it was non-infringing fair use. The court found that Google’s purpose in copying the material was “highly transformative,” the snippets revealed only a limited portion of the book, and all this did not “provide a significant market substitute” for the protected work.












“The output was not simply mimicking or mirroring or replacing or providing a market substitute for the original,” says Morgan. “There had been a significant transformation in the interim, and that was deemed to be a fair use.”
Jim Holloway, a partner at Baker McKenzie, predicts Canada will soon see amendments to the Copyright Act clarifying who owns the copyright on works produced by generative AI.  Holloway’s practice focuses on intellectual property law and technology, including disputes involving trademarks, copyright, patents, and trade secrets.
Holloway says intellectual property law generally aims to reward and incentivize human creativity and inventiveness. He says the law needs to determine how to nurture these virtues in non-humans.
“At some point down the road, there’s going to be a lot of new useful and important things that are created by machines, and you have to provide incentives and rewards in order to fuel that innovation.”
