The human contribution: How to balance advances in AI with the workforce

November 18, 2022













The era of artificial intelligence (AI) is here, and its importance cannot be underestimated. AI, machine learning and advanced analytics are transforming organizations around the world and failure to implement these technologies correctly is not an option for the c-suite. Research from Deloitte shows that 66% of executives believe that AI initiatives are important to remain competitive over the next five years.For organizations that get it right, these technological advancements are set to contribute to growth in a major way, accelerating productivity at a scale that many liken to the next industrial revolution. Vast increases in computer processing power and the amount of data available for algorithms to learn from have led to AI advancing rapidly over the past few years, with AI becoming increasingly sophisticated and many predicting the technology will transform the very nature of work itself.AI is capable of carrying out routine physical work more accurately, quickly and cost effectively than the human workforce, enabling businesses to improve productivity by reducing errors and improving quality and speed. In some cases, even achieving outcomes that go beyond human capabilities. According to World Economic Forum data, more than 80% of business executives are accelerating plans to digitize work processes and deploy new technologies, and 50% of employers are expecting to accelerate the automation of some roles in their companies. Creating a happier, more engaged workforce with AIAs a result of these advancements in automation, AI, and machine learning, we will likely see a seismic shift in the way many people work. While this notion may be scary to many, the reality is that many roles are set to change for the better. In fact, most of us are already reaping the benefits of AI-enabled technology — both in our workplaces and homes. From speaking with virtual assistants to using voice for search queries on web browsers and smart TVs. In the workplace, AI serves to relieve employees of mundane and repetitive tasks and make the workday more productive and efficient. For instance, in a customer service role, AI-powered chatbots are already commonplace, handling customer inquiries and reducing the number of cases that employees have to tend to, as well as reducing the time spent gathering information, allowing the customer service function to focus on more complex and time-consuming cases.In the security realm, automated and hassle-free visitor management processes can replace manual recording methods, freeing time for personnel to focus on more pressing matters. AI and machine learning also help power security monitoring services by analyzing real-time video and distinguishing between a potential threat, such as an unauthorized visitor attempting to enter the premises, and a nuisance alarm triggered by an animal. This, too, alleviates the burden from monitoring center personnel and helps enhance the overall security experience.These are just some examples where we can see AI and human intelligence work hand in hand, with AI making the future of work more efficient and enjoyable. Safeguarding the workforce with AIBy leveraging data-driven insights gained from AI, machine learning and advanced analytics, organizations can unlock insights that can not only drive efficiencies but also help protect the business.Survey data from the STANLEY Security 2022 Industry Trends Report revealed that 66% of business leaders would consider integrated analytics, which is driven by AI and machine learning to protect and optimize their business.Utilizing insights provided by AI-powered security technology can make it possible to identify where security risks lie and give cognizance over what those risks might be. This understanding can help organizations to be better prepared for when these threats do occur.For instance, AI can provide organizations with an understanding of access patterns within their buildings and can therefore identify anomalies such as unusual arrival or departure times or attempts to open the wrong doors. Once a risk is identified, guards can be notified; alerts on intercom systems can be triggered; or the restriction of access points can be implemented to prevent the issue from escalating, significantly decreasing the chance of security breaches.By leveraging AI, organizations can also identify patterns that could be predictive of future events. With this information, businesses are able to make changes and optimize security by allocating resources more effectively. These invaluable insights can bolster security, creating a more secure environment for an organization’s greatest asset: its people.We are entering a new world of work where striking the right balance between artificial and human intelligence is key. And if organizations can get it right, we are all set to benefit.This article originally ran in Security, a twice-monthly security-focused eNewsletter for security end users, brought to you by Security magazine. Subscribe here.

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. Nov 16, 2022, 9:00 AM ESTShare this story3 Comments / 3 NewNotion’s AI turns your prompt into blog posts, poems, to-do lists, and brainstorms. Image: Notion / David PierceSomeday soon, Notion will be able to write your notes for you. The company is starting to test a new feature today called Notion AI, which Notion CEO Ivan Zhao tells me could ultimately change the way people use the app — and do their jobs. With Notion AI, all you have to do is tell the app what you want (a blog post, a recruiting email template, a list of great business books to read), and the app actually creates the content right in front of your eyes.The first thing Notion AI is for, Zhao says, is writing. Lots of work requires writing, some of it repetitive (like creating new job descriptions) and some of it creative (like writing blog posts or brainstorming new ideas). Zhao thinks Notion AI can help in both cases. “For many users in this space, it solves the cold start problem. And even more than that, it saves time.” Notion AI won’t write you a publishable blog post, but it can help you skip the crappy first draft phase and go straight into improving and polishing.Notion is making use of the same large language models that companies like Google are starting to bake into search results and startups like Mem are using to structure your personal information. There are plenty of AI-powered writing tools out there, of course, like Grammarly and Jasper and Google’s new Wordcraft, and all are improving rapidly thanks to large language models. These models provide software with vastly more context so they can comprehend sentences and paragraphs rather than individual words, which makes them better at both understanding and writing text of all kinds.It’s all very early, the tech and Notion’s implementation, and Zhao reminds me of this fact several times. What’s launching today isn’t so much a new product as a private alpha of a new product: the company plans to roll it out slowly and carefully but wants to start getting it out into users’ hands now.I was the first person outside of Notion to get to try Notion AI. Here’s how it works so far: when you create a new page, you get a bunch of new options. In addition to “Empty page,” you get “Blog post,” “Pros and cons list,” “Outline,” “To-do list,” “Meeting agenda,” “Sales email,” and many others. Click on one, and it opens a prompt: “What should the blog post be about?” or “What do you want to make a pros and cons list about?” Type in your prompt, hit the blue “Generate” button, and Notion begins to fill out the page for you. If you like it, keep it. If not, try a new prompt, or just hit “Try Again” and watch it repopulate.Here’s what Notion AI came up with automatically when I asked it to make a pros and cons list for running a marathon:ProsIt’s a great way to get exercise.It’s a great way to challenge yourself.It’s a great way to meet new people.It’s a great way to raise money for charity.It’s a great way to see new places.ConsIt’s a lot of work.It’s very time consuming.It can be very expensive.It can be dangerous.It can be difficult to find the time to train.Not exactly groundbreaking, but not bad! Here are the first three paragraphs it spit back when I asked for a blog post about “the state of the smartwatch industry”:The smartwatch industry is booming. With new products being released all the time, it’s hard to keep up with the latest and greatest. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at the state of the smartwatch industry, including the latest products and trends.One of the latest smartwatches to hit the market is the Apple Watch Series 4. This watch has a larger display than previous models, and it also has new health features, such as the ability to take an electrocardiogram (ECG).Another new product is the Samsung Galaxy Watch. This watch runs on the Tizen operating system, and it has a lot of features, including the ability to track your fitness and sleep.In this case, Notion AI gets it directionally correct — it is indeed a blog post about the smartwatch industry — but it gets a lot of its facts wrong. This is where Zhao would remind me again that this is a private alpha with no set release date and that Notion is still learning as much as anyone. But clearly, the tech is a long way from finished.One more: I asked Notion AI to write a sales email about why everyone should read The Verge. Here’s what I got:Subject: Why You Should Read The VergeHi there!If you’re looking for a trusted source of tech news and information, look no further than The Verge. With a team of dedicated reporters, editors, and photographers, The Verge provides in-depth coverage of the latest happenings in the tech world.Whether you’re interested in the latest iPhone rumors or want to stay up-to-date on the latest in AI and driverless cars, The Verge has you covered. So why not give us a try? You won’t be disappointed.Sincerely,The Verge TeamI’m sold. In addition to automatic first drafts, Zhao says Notion AI can be a useful ideation machine. You can start brainstorming and then tell Notion AI to continue writing and have it fill out more possibilities. Or you can prompt it with something like “the three best documentaries about Formula One” and have it spit back a list you can work with. (In case you’re wondering: Senna, Drive to Survive, and 1. A pretty good list.)Ask Notion AI for some recommendations, and it’ll almost always deliver. Image: Notion / David PierceMost of the data in Notion AI’s model comes from the broader internet. Zhao says the company is partnering with AI providers but declines to say who. Ultimately, though, the company plans to personalize the model to companies, even individual pages, so the AI can write in a company’s voice and make use of its internal information. This raises some serious privacy questions, which, again, is why it’s a private alpha.Notion also imagines using AI for much more than just writing. “It can help you answer questions,” he says. “A lot of Notion users pay us because we’re a good knowledge base, and this is going to be a killer use case for knowledge bases.” You could just search for anything and Notion AI would paste the right information in place. Beyond even that, he says, “Connecting to your calendar, connecting to your task management — there’s crazy things we can do with this.”Zhao has often talked about modeling Notion after Douglas Engelbart, who worked for years on ways to use technology to augment human capabilities. “For us,” Zhao says, “this is almost the purest version of that. Software is awakened a little bit, to understand you better, to truly augment you. It’s no longer just words on the page, where you save some to-do lists — it’s no longer text, it’s meaning.”Zhao and his team are still figuring out what Notion AI can be good for and how to help users understand how to use the new tech. (One challenge of generative AI is that an empty text box can be overwhelming, but so can a thousand tips and pop-ups.) They’re opening the Notion AI wait list today, with plans to open Notion AI to some of the product ambassadors first, then more users over time. Zhao says he’s trying hard not to be in a hurry. But he’s convinced that now is the moment that generative AI goes from a nifty science project to a useful consumer tool. “I think this has on the order of internet or web-scale leverage, that you can feel in your life.” He’s been tracking the space for years, and the underlying tech is finally ready, he says. “And then just wait until next year.”Comments3 Comments / 3 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeApple’s Vision Pro: five months later | The Vergecast

The company is starting to test a new feature today called Notion AI, which Notion CEO Ivan Zhao tells me could ultimately change the way people use the app — and do their jobs. With Notion AI, all you have to do is tell the app what you want (a blog post, a recruiting email template, a list of great business books to read), and the app actually creates the content right in front of your eyes.

The first thing Notion AI is for, Zhao says, is writing. Lots of work requires writing, some of it repetitive (like creating new job descriptions) and some of it creative (like writing blog posts or brainstorming new ideas). Zhao thinks Notion AI can help in both cases. “For many users in this space, it solves the cold start problem. And even more than that, it saves time.” Notion AI won’t write you a publishable blog post, but it can help you skip the crappy first draft phase and go straight into improving and polishing.

Notion is making use of the same large language models that companies like Google are starting to bake into search results and startups like Mem are using to structure your personal information. There are plenty of AI-powered writing tools out there, of course, like Grammarly and Jasper and Google’s new Wordcraft, and all are improving rapidly thanks to large language models. These models provide software with vastly more context so they can comprehend sentences and paragraphs rather than individual words, which makes them better at both understanding and writing text of all kinds.

It’s all very early, the tech and Notion’s implementation, and Zhao reminds me of this fact several times. What’s launching today isn’t so much a new product as a private alpha of a new product: the company plans to roll it out slowly and carefully but wants to start getting it out into users’ hands now.

I was the first person outside of Notion to get to try Notion AI. Here’s how it works so far: when you create a new page, you get a bunch of new options. In addition to “Empty page,” you get “Blog post,” “Pros and cons list,” “Outline,” “To-do list,” “Meeting agenda,” “Sales email,” and many others. Click on one, and it opens a prompt: “What should the blog post be about?” or “What do you want to make a pros and cons list about?” Type in your prompt, hit the blue “Generate” button, and Notion begins to fill out the page for you. If you like it, keep it. If not, try a new prompt, or just hit “Try Again” and watch it repopulate.

Here’s what Notion AI came up with automatically when I asked it to make a pros and cons list for running a marathon:

Pros

* It’s a great way to get exercise.
* It’s a great way to challenge yourself.
* It’s a great way to meet new people.
* It’s a great way to raise money for charity.
* It’s a great way to see new places.

Cons

* It’s a lot of work.
* It’s very time consuming.
* It can be very expensive.
* It can be dangerous.
* It can be difficult to find the time to train.

Not exactly groundbreaking, but not bad! Here are the first three paragraphs it spit back when I asked for a blog post about “the state of the smartwatch industry”:

> The smartwatch industry is booming. With new products being released all the time, it’s hard to keep up with the latest and greatest. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at the state of the smartwatch industry, including the latest products and trends.
> One of the latest smartwatches to hit the market is the Apple Watch Series 4. This watch has a larger display than previous models, and it also has new health features, such as the ability to take an electrocardiogram (ECG).
> Another new product is the Samsung Galaxy Watch. This watch runs on the Tizen operating system, and it has a lot of features, including the ability to track your fitness and sleep.

In this case, Notion AI gets it directionally correct — it is indeed a blog post about the smartwatch industry — but it gets a lot of its facts wrong. This is where Zhao would remind me again that this is a private alpha with no set release date and that Notion is still learning as much as anyone. But clearly, the tech is a long way from finished.

One more: I asked Notion AI to write a sales email about why everyone should read The Verge. Here’s what I got:

> Subject: Why You Should Read The Verge
> Hi there!
> If you’re looking for a trusted source of tech news and information, look no further than The Verge. With a team of dedicated reporters, editors, and photographers, The Verge provides in-depth coverage of the latest happenings in the tech world.
> Whether you’re interested in the latest iPhone rumors or want to stay up-to-date on the latest in AI and driverless cars, The Verge has you covered. So why not give us a try? You won’t be disappointed.
> Sincerely,
> The Verge Team

I’m sold. 

In addition to automatic first drafts, Zhao says Notion AI can be a useful ideation machine. You can start brainstorming and then tell Notion AI to continue writing and have it fill out more possibilities. Or you can prompt it with something like “the three best documentaries about Formula One” and have it spit back a list you can work with. (In case you’re wondering: Senna, Drive to Survive, and 1. A pretty good list.)

[Image: Ask Notion AI for some recommendations, and it’ll almost always deliver. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXpSjXK3PulHVFi7FlRbLvPMpaY=/0x0:844x511/844x511/filters:focal(422x256:423x257)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24199644/CleanShot_2022_11_15_at_15.29.16.png]

Most of the data in Notion AI’s model comes from the broader internet. Zhao says the company is partnering with AI providers but declines to say who. Ultimately, though, the company plans to personalize the model to companies, even individual pages, so the AI can write in a company’s voice and make use of its internal information. This raises some serious privacy questions, which, again, is why it’s a private alpha.

Notion also imagines using AI for much more than just writing. “It can help you answer questions,” he says. “A lot of Notion users pay us because we’re a good knowledge base, and this is going to be a killer use case for knowledge bases.” You could just search for anything and Notion AI would paste the right information in place. Beyond even that, he says, “Connecting to your calendar, connecting to your task management — there’s crazy things we can do with this.”

Zhao has often talked about modeling Notion after Douglas Engelbart, who worked for years on ways to use technology to augment human capabilities. “For us,” Zhao says, “this is almost the purest version of that. Software is awakened a little bit, to understand you better, to truly augment you. It’s no longer just words on the page, where you save some to-do lists — it’s no longer text, it’s meaning.”

Zhao and his team are still figuring out what Notion AI can be good for and how to help users understand how to use the new tech. (One challenge of generative AI is that an empty text box can be overwhelming, but so can a thousand tips and pop-ups.) They’re opening the Notion AI wait list today, with plans to open Notion AI to some of the product ambassadors first, then more users over time. Zhao says he’s trying hard not to be in a hurry. But he’s convinced that now is the moment that generative AI goes from a nifty science project to a useful consumer tool. “I think this has on the order of internet or web-scale leverage, that you can feel in your life.” He’s been tracking the space for years, and the underlying tech is finally ready, he says. “And then just wait until next year.”

He’s staring at an image of a train locomotive on the screen of his school’s first computer. Wow, he thinks. Some of the magic wears off, however, when Lee learns that the image had not appeared simply by asking for “a picture of a train.” Instead, it had to be painstakingly coded and rendered—by hard-working humans.Now picture Lee 43 years later, stumbling onto DALL-E, an artificial intelligence that generates original works of art based on human-supplied prompts that can literally be as simple as “a picture of a train.” As he types in words to create image after image, the wow is back. Only this time, it doesn’t go away. “It feels like a miracle,” he says. “When the results appeared, my breath was taken away and tears welled in my eyes. It’s that magical.”Lessons from the History of PhotographyClassic WIRED Covers—Regenerated by AIOur machines have crossed a threshold. All our lives, we have been reassured that computers were incapable of being truly creative. Yet, suddenly, millions of people are now using a new breed of AIs to generate stunning, never-before-seen pictures. Most of these users are not, like Lee Unkrich, professional artists, and that’s the point: They do not have to be. Not everyone can write, direct, and edit an Oscar winner like Toy Story 3 or Coco, but everyone can launch an AI image generator and type in an idea. What appears on the screen is astounding in its realism and depth of detail. Thus the universal response: Wow. On four services alone—Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Artbreeder, and DALL-E—humans working with AIs now cocreate more than 20 million images every day. With a paintbrush in hand, artificial intelligence has become an engine of wow.Featured VideoPresident Barack Obama on How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect JobsBecause these surprise-generating AIs have learned their art from billions of pictures made by humans, their output hovers around what we expect pictures to look like. But because they are an alien AI, fundamentally mysterious even to their creators, they restructure the new pictures in a way no human is likely to think of, filling in details most of us wouldn’t have the artistry to imagine, let alone the skills to execute. They can also be instructed to generate more variations of something we like, in whatever style we want—in seconds. This, ultimately, is their most powerful advantage: They can make new things that are relatable and comprehensible but, at the same time, completely unexpected.So unexpected are these new AI-generated images, in fact, that—in the silent awe immediately following the wow—another thought occurs to just about everyone who has encountered them: Human-made art must now be over. Who can compete with the speed, cheapness, scale, and, yes, wild creativity of these machines? Is art yet another human pursuit we must yield to robots? And the next obvious question: If computers can be creative, what else can they do that we were told they could not?I have spent the past six months using AIs to create thousands of striking images, often losing a night’s sleep in the unending quest to find just one more beauty hidden in the code. And after interviewing the creators, power users, and other early adopters of these generators, I can make a very clear prediction: Generative AI will alter how we design just about everything. Oh, and not a single human artist will lose their job because of this new technology.It is no exaggeration to call images generated with the help of AI cocreations. The sobering secret of this new power is that the best applications of it are the result not of typing in a single prompt but of very long conversations between humans and machines. Progress for each image comes from many, many iterations, back-and-forths, detours, and hours, sometimes days, of teamwork—all on the back of years of advancements in machine learning.AI image generators were born from the marriage of two separate technologies. One was a historical line of deep learning neural nets that could generate coherent realistic images, and the other was a natural language model that could serve as an interface to the image engine. The two were combined into a language-driven image generator. Researchers scraped the internet for all images that had adjacent text, such as captions, and used billions of these examples to connect visual forms to words, and words to forms. With this new combination, human users could enter a string of words—the prompt—that described the image they sought, and the prompt would generate an image based on those words.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenScientists now at Google invented the diffusion computational models that are at the core of image generators today, but the company has been so concerned about what people might do with them that it still has not opened its own experimental generators, Imagen and Parti, to the public. (Only employees can try them, and with tight guidelines on what can be requested.) It is no coincidence, then, that the three most popular platforms for image generators right now are three startups with no legacy to protect. Midjourney is a bootstrapping startup launched by David Holz, who based the generator in an emerging community of artists. The interface to the AI is a noisy Discord server; all the work and prompts were made public from the start. DALL-E is a second-gen product of the nonprofit OpenAI, funded by Elon Musk and others. Stable Diffusion appeared on the scene in August 2022, created by Emad Mostaque, a European entrepreneur. It’s an open source project, with the added benefit that anyone can download its software and run it locally on their own desktop. More than the others, Stable Diffusion has unleashed AI image generators into the wild.ART IS HUMAN.

ILLUSTRATION BY: @auranova_ai + MIDJOURNEYWhy are so many people so excited to play with these AIs? Many images are being created for the same reason that humans have always made most art: because the images are pretty and we want to look at them. Like flames in a campfire, the light patterns are mesmerizing. They never repeat themselves; they surprise, again and again. They depict scenes no one has witnessed before or can even imagine, and they are expertly composed. It’s a similar pleasure to exploring a video game world, or paging through an art book. There is a real beauty to their creativity, and we stare much in the way we might appreciate a great art show at a museum. In fact, viewing a parade of generated images is very much like visiting a personal museum—but in this case, the walls are full of art we ask for. And the perpetual novelty and surprise of the next image hardly wanes. Users may share the gems they discover, but my guess is that 99 percent of the 20 million images currently generated each day will only ever be viewed by a single human—their cocreator.Like any art, the images can also be healing. People spend time making strange AI pictures for the same reason they might paint on Sundays, or scribble in a journal, or shoot a video. They use the media to work out something in their own lives, something that can’t be said otherwise. I’ve seen images depicting what animal heaven might look like, created in response to the death of a beloved dog. Many images explore the representation of intangible, spiritual realms, presumably as a way to think about them. “A huge portion of the entire usage is basically art therapy,” Holz, the Midjourney creator, tells me. “The images are not really aesthetically appealing in a universal sense but are appealing, in a very deep way, within the context of what’s going on in people’s lives.” The machines can be used to generate fantasies of all types. While the hosted services prohibit porn and gore, anything goes on the desktop versions, as it might in Photoshop.This article appears in the February 2023 issue. Subscribe to WIRED.Photograph: Peter YangAI-generated pictures can be utilitarian too. Say you are presenting a report on the possibility of recycling hospital plastic waste into construction materials and you want an image of a house made out of test tubes. You could search stock photo markets for a usable image made by a human artist. But a unique assignment like this rarely yields a preexisting picture, and even if found, its copyright status could be dubious or expensive. It is cheaper, faster, and probably far more appropriate to generate a unique, personalized image for your report in a few minutes that you can then insert into your slides, newsletter, or blog—and the copyright ownership is yours (for now). I have been using these generators myself to cocreate images for my own slide presentations.In an informal poll of power users, I found that only about 40 percent of their time is spent seeking utilitarian images. Most AI images are used in places where there were no images previously. They usually do not replace an image created by a human artist. They may be created, for example, to illustrate a text-only newsletter by someone without artistic talent themselves, or the time and budget to hire someone. Just as mechanical photography did not kill human illustrations a century ago, but rather significantly expanded the places in which images appeared, so too do AI image generators open up possibilities for more art, not less. We’ll begin to see contextually generated images predominately in spaces that are currently blank, like emails, text messages, blogs, books, and social media.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThis new art resides somewhere between painting and photography. It lives in a possibility space as large as painting and drawing—as huge as human imagination. But you move through the space like a photographer, hunting for discoveries. Tweaking your prompts, you may arrive at a spot no one has visited before, so you explore this area slowly, taking snapshots as you step through. The territory might be a subject, or a mood, or a style, and it might be worth returning to. The art is in the craft of finding a new area and setting yourself up there, exercising good taste and the keen eye of curation in what you capture. When photography first appeared, it seemed as if all the photographer had to do was push the button. Likewise, it seems that all a person has to do for a glorious AI image is push the button. In both cases, you get an image. But to get a great one—a truly artistic one—well, that’s another matter.Accessible AI image generators are not even a year old, but already it is evident that some people are much better at creating AI images than others. Although they’re using the same programs, those who have accumulated thousands of hours with the algorithms can magically produce images that are many times better than the average person’s. The images by these masters have a striking coherence and visual boldness that is normally overwhelmed by the flood of details the AIs tend to produce. That is because this is a team sport: The human artist and the machine artist are a duet. And it requires not just experience but also lots of hours and work to produce something useful. It is as if there is a slider bar on the AI: At one end is Maximum Surprise, and at the other end Maximum Obedience. It is very easy to get the AI to surprise you. (And that is often all we ask of it.) But it is very difficult to get the AI to obey you. As Mario Klingemann, who makes his living selling NFTs of his AI-generated artwork, says, “If you have a very specific image in mind, it always feels like you are up against a forcefield.” Commands like “shade this area,” “enhance this part,” and “tone it down” are obeyed reluctantly. The AIs have to be persuaded.Current versions of DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney limit prompts to about the length of a long tweet. Any longer and the words muddle together; the image turns to mush. That means that behind every fabulous image lies a short magic spell that summons it. It begins with the first incantation. How you say it matters. Your immediate results materialize in a grid of four to nine images. From that batch of pictures, you variate and mutate offspring images. Now you have a brood. If they look promising, begin to tweak the spell to nudge it in new directions as it births more generations of images. Multiply the group again and again as you search for the most compelling composition. Do not despair if it takes dozens of generations. Think like the AI; what does it like to hear? Whisper instructions that have worked in the past, and add them to the prompt. Repeat. Change the word order to see whether it likes that. Remember to be specific. Replicate until you have amassed a whole tribe of images that seem to have good bones and potential. Now cull out all but a select few. Be merciless. Begin outpainting the most promising images. That means asking the AI to extend the image out in certain directions beyond the current borders. Erase those portions that are not working. Suggest replacements to be done by the AI with more incantations (called inpainting). If the AI is not comprehending your hints, try spells used by others. When the AI has gone as far as it can, migrate the image to Photoshop for final tailoring. Present it as if you have done nothing, even though it is not uncommon for a distinctive image to require 50 steps.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenBehind this new magecraft is the art of prompting. Each artist or designer develops a way of persuading an AI to yield its best by evolving their prompts. Let’s call these new artists AI whisperers, or prompt artists, or promptors. The promptors work almost as directors, guiding the work of their alien collaborators toward a unified vision. The convoluted process required to tease a first-rate picture out of an AI is quickly emerging as a fine-art skill. Almost daily, new tools arrive to make prompting easier, better. PromptBase is a market for promptors to sell prompts that create simple images such as emoticons, logos, icons, avatars, and game weapons. It’s like clip art, but instead of selling the art, they sell the prompt that generates the art. And unlike fixed clip art, it is easy to alter and tweak the art to fit your needs, and you can extract multiple versions again and again. Most of these prompts sell for a couple bucks, which is a fair price, given how much trouble it is to hone a prompt on your own.AdvertisementAbove-average prompts not only include the subject but also describe the lighting, the point of view, the emotion evoked, the color palette, the degree of abstraction, and perhaps a reference picture to imitate. As with other artistic skills, there are now courses and guidebooks to train the budding promptor in the finer points of prompting. One fan of DALL-E 2, Guy Parsons, put together a free Prompt Book, jammed with tips on how to go beyond the wow and get images you can actually use. One example: If your prompt includes specific terms such as “Sigma 75 mm camera lens,” Parson says, then the AI doesn’t just create that specific look made by the lens; “it more broadly alludes to ‘the kind of photo where the lens appears in the description,’” which tends to be more professional and therefore yields higher-quality images. It’s this kind of multilevel mastery that produces spectacular results.For technical reasons, even if you repeat the exact same prompt, you are unlikely to get the same image. There is a randomly generated seed for each image, without which it is statistically impossible to replicate. Additionally, the same prompt given to different AI engines produces different images—Midjourney’s are more painterly, while DALL-E is optimized for photographic realism. Still, not every promptor wishes to share their secrets. The natural reaction upon seeing a particularly brilliant image is to ask, “What spell did you use?” What was the prompt? Robyn Miller, cocreator of the legendary game Myst and a pioneering digital artist, has been posting an AI-generated image every day. “When people ask me what prompt I used,” he says, “I have been surprised that I don’t want to tell them. There is an art to this, and that has also surprised me.” Klingemann is famous for not sharing his prompts. “I believe all images already exist,” he says. “You don’t make them, you find them. If you get somewhere by clever prompting, I do not see why I want to invite everybody else there.”Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenIt seems obvious to me that promptors are making true art. What is a consummate movie director—like Hitchcock, like Kurosawa—but a promptor of actors, actions, scenes, ideas? Good image-generator promptors are engaged in a similar craft, and it is no stretch for them to try and sell their creations in art galleries or enter them into art contests. This summer, Jason Allen won first place in the digital art category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Art competition for a large, space-opera-themed canvas that was signed “Jason Allen via Midjourney.” It’s a pretty cool picture that would’ve taken some effort to make no matter what tools were used. Usually images in the digital art category are created using Photoshop and Blender-type tools that enable the artist to dip into libraries of digitized objects, textures, and parts, which are then collaged together to form the scene. They are not drawn; these digital images are unapologetically technological assemblages. Collages are a venerable art form, and using AI to breed a collage is a natural evolution. If a 3D-rendered collage is art, then a Midjourney picture is art. As Allen told Vice, “I have been exploring a special prompt. I have created hundreds of images using it, and after many weeks of fine-tuning and curating my gens, I chose my top 3 and had them printed on canvas.”Of course, Allen’s blue ribbon set off alarm bells. To some critics, this was a sign of the end times, the end of art, the end of human artists. Predictable lamentations ensued, with many pointing out how unfair it felt for struggling artists. The AIs are not only going to take over and kill us all—they are, apparently, going to make the world’s best art while doing so.At its birth, every new technology ignites a Tech Panic Cycle. There are seven phases:Don’t bother me with this nonsense. It will never work.OK, it is happening, but it’s dangerous, ’cause it doesn’t work well.Wait, it works too well. We need to hobble it. Do something!This stuff is so powerful that it’s not fair to those without access to it.Now it’s everywhere, and there is no way to escape it. Not fair.I am going to give it up. For a month.Let’s focus on the real problem—which is the next current thing.Today, in the case of AI image generators, an emerging band of very tech-savvy artists and photographers are working out of a Level 3 panic. In a reactive, third-person, hypothetical way, they fear other people (but never themselves) might lose their jobs. Getty Images, the premier agency selling stock photos and illustrations for design and editorial use, has already banned AI-generated images; certain artists who post their work on DeviantArt have demanded a similar ban. There are well-intentioned demands to identify AI art with a label and to segregate it from “real” art.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenBeyond that, some artists want assurances that their own work not be used to train the AIs. But this is typical of Level 3 panic—in that it is, at best, misguided. The algorithms are exposed to 6 billion images with attendant text. If you are not an influential artist, removing your work makes zero difference. A generated picture will look exactly the same with or without your work in the training set. But even if you are an influential artist, removing your images still won't matter. Because your style has affected the work of others—the definition of influence—your influence will remain even if your images are removed. Imagine if we removed all of Van Gogh’s pictures from the training set. The style of Van Gogh would still be embedded in the vast ocean of images created by those who have imitated or been influenced by him.Styles are summoned via prompts, as in: “in the style of Van Gogh.” Some unhappy artists would rather their names be censored and not permitted to be used as a prompt. So even if their influence can’t be removed, you can’t reach it because their name is off-limits. As we know from all previous attempts at censoring, these kinds of speech bans are easy to work around; you can misspell a name, or simply describe the style in words. I found, for example, that I could generate detailed black-and-white natural landscape photographs with majestic lighting and prominent foregrounds—without ever using Ansel Adams’ name.There is another motivation for an artist to remove themselves. They might fear that a big corporation will make money off of their work, and their contribution won’t be compensated. But we don’t compensate human artists for their influence on other human artists. Take David Hockney, one of the highest-paid living artists. Hockney often acknowledges the great influence other living artists have on his work. As a society, we don’t expect him (or others) to write checks to his influences, even though he could. It’s a stretch to think AIs should pay their influencers. The “tax” that successful artists pay for their success is their unpaid influence on the success of others.What’s more, lines of influence are famously blurred, ephemeral, and imprecise. We are all influenced by everything around us, to degrees we are not aware of and certainly can’t quantify. When we write a memo or snap a picture with our phone, to what extent have we been influenced—directly or indirectly—by Ernest Hemingway or Dorothea Lange? It’s impossible to unravel our influences when we create something. It is likewise impossible to unravel the strands of influence in the AI image universe. We could theoretically construct a system to pay money earned by the AI to artists in the training set, but we’d have to recognize that this credit would be made arbitrarily (unfairly) and that the actual compensatory amounts per artist in a pool of 6 billion shares would be so trivial as to be nonsensical.In the coming years, the computational engine inside an AI image generator will continue to expand and improve until it becomes a central node in whatever we do visually. It will have literally seen everything and know all styles, and it will paint, imagine, and generate just about anything we need. It will become a visual search engine, and a visual encyclopedia with which to understand images, and the primary tool we use with our most important sense, our sight. Right now, every neural net algorithm running deep in the AIs relies on massive amounts of data—thus the billions of images needed to train it. But in the next decade, we’ll have operational AI that relies on far fewer examples to learn, perhaps as few as 10,000. We’ll teach even more powerful AI image generators how to paint by showing them thousands of carefully curated, highly selected images of existing art, and when this point comes, artists of all backgrounds will be fighting one another to be included in the training set. If an artist is in the main pool, their influence will be shared and felt by all, while those not included must overcome the primary obstacle for any artist: not piracy, but obscurity.As soon as 2D generative algorithms were born, experimenters rushed to figure out what was next. Jensen Huang, the ambitious cofounder of Nvidia, believes the next generation of chips will generate 3D worlds for the metaverse—“the next computing platform,” as he calls it. In a single week this past September, three novel text-to-3D/video image generators were announced: GET3D (Nvidia), Make-A-Video (Meta), and DreamFusion (Google). The expansion is happening faster than I can write. Amazing as frameable 2D pictures produced by AI are, outsourcing their creation is not going to radically change the world. We are already at peak 2D. The genuine superpower being released by AI image generators will be in producing 3D images and video.A future prompt for a 3D engine might look something like this: “Create the messy bedroom of a teenager, with posters on the wall, an unmade bed, and afternoon sunlight streaming through closed blinds.” And in seconds, a fully realized room is born, the closet door open and all the dirty clothes on the floor—in full 3D. Then, tell the AI: “Make a 1970s kitchen with refrigerator magnets and all the cereal boxes in the pantry. In full volumetric detail. One that you could walk through. Or that could be photographed in a video.” Games crammed with alternatively rendered worlds and full-length movies decked out with costumes and sets have eternally been out of reach for individual artists, who remain under the power of large dollars. AI could make games, metaverses, and movies as quick to produce as novels, paintings, and songs. Pixar films in an instant! Once millions of amateurs are churning out billions of movies and endless metaverses at home, they will hatch entirely new media genres—virtual tourism, spatial memes—with their own native geniuses. And when big dollars and professionals are equipped with these new tools, we’ll see masterpieces at a level of complexity never seen before.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenBut even the vast universes of 3D worlds and video are not vast enough to contain the disruption that AI image generators have initiated. DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion are just the first versions of generative machines of all types. Their prime function, pattern recognition, is almost a reflex for human brains, something we accomplish without conscious thinking. It is at the core of almost everything we do. Our thinking is more complex than just pattern recognition, of course; dozens of cognitive functions animate our brain. But this single type of cognition, synthesized in machines (and the only cognition we have synthesized so far), has taken us further than we first thought—and will probably continue to advance further than we now think.When an AI notices a pattern, it stores it in a compressed way. Round objects are placed in a “roundness” direction, red objects in another direction for “redness,” and so on. Maybe it notices “treeness” and “foodness” too. It abstracts out billions of directions, or patterns. Upon reflection—or training—it notices that the overlap of these four qualities produces “appleness,” yet another direction. Furthermore, it links all these noticed directions with word patterns, which can also share overlapping qualities. So when a human requests a picture of an apple via the word “apple,” the AI paints an image with those four (or more) qualities. It is not assembling bits of existing pictures; rather, it is “imagining” a new picture with the appropriate qualities. It sort of remembers a picture that does not exist but could.This same technique can be used—in fact, is already being used, in very early forms—to find new drugs. The AI is trained on a database of all the molecules we know to be active medicines, noticing patterns in their chemical structures. Then the AI is asked to “remember” or imagine molecules we have never thought of that seem to be similar to the molecules that work. Wonderfully, some of them actually do work, just as an AI image of a requested imaginary fruit can look remarkably like a fruit. This is the real transformation, and soon enough, the same technique will be used to help design automobiles, draft laws, write code, compose soundtracks, assemble worlds to entertain and instruct, and cocreate the stuff we do as work. We should take to heart the lessons we’ve learned so far from AI image generators because there will soon be more pattern-seeking AIs in all realms of life. The panic cycle we presently face is simply a good rehearsal for the coming shift.What we know about AI generators so far is that they work best as partners. The nightmare of a rogue AI taking over is just not happening. That vision is fundamentally a misreading of history. In the past, technology has rarely directly displaced humans from work they wanted to do. For instance, the automatic generation of pictures by a machine—called a camera—was feared in the 1800s because it would surely put portrait painters out of business. But the historian Hans Rooseboom could find only a single portrait painter from that time who felt unemployed by photography. (Photography actually inspired a resurgence of painting later in that century.) Closer to our time, we might have expected professional occupations in photography to fall as the smartphone swallowed the world and everybody became a photographer—with 95 million uploads to Instagram a day and counting. Yet the number of photography professionals in the US has been slowly rising, from 160,000 in 2002 (before camera phones) to 230,000 in 2021.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenInstead of fearing AI, we are better served thinking about what it teaches us. And the most important thing AI image generators teach us is this: Creativity is not some supernatural force. It is something that can be synthesized, amplified, and manipulated. It turns out that we didn’t need to achieve intelligence in order to hatch creativity. Creativity is more elemental than we thought. It is independent of consciousness. We can generate creativity in something as dumb as a deep learning neural net. Massive data plus pattern recognition algorithms seems sufficient to engineer a process that will surprise and aid us without ceasing.Scholars of creativity refer to something called Uppercase Creativity. Uppercase Creativity is the stunning, field-changing, world-altering rearrangement that a major breakthrough brings. Think special relativity, the discovery of DNA, or Picasso’s Guernica. Uppercase Creativity goes beyond the merely new. It is special, and it is rare. It touches us humans in a profound way, far beyond what an alien AI can fathom.To connect with a human deeply will always require a Creative human in the loop. This high creativity, however, should not be confused with the creativity that most human artists, designers, and inventors produce day to day. Mundane, ordinary, lowercase creativity is what we get with a great new logo design or a cool book cover, a nifty digital wearable or the latest must-have fashion, or the set design for our favorite sci-fi serial. Most human art, past and present, is lowercase. And lowercase creativity is exactly what the AI generators deliver.But this is huge. For the first time in history, humans can conjure up everyday acts of creativity on demand, in real time, at scale, for cheap. Synthetic creativity is a commodity now. Ancient philosophers will turn in their graves, but it turns out that to make creativity—to generate something new—all you need is the right code. We can insert it into tiny devices that are presently inert, or we can apply creativity to large statistical models, or embed creativity in drug discovery routines. What else can we use synthetic creativity for? We may feel a little bit like medieval peasants who are being asked, “What would you do if you had the power of 250 horses at your fingertips?” We dunno. It’s an extraordinary gift. What we do know is we now have easy engines of creativity, which we can aim into stale corners that have never seen novelty, innovation, or the wow of creative change. Against the background of everything that breaks down, this superpower can help us extend the wow indefinitely. Used properly, we can make a small dent in the universe.This article appears in the February issue. Subscribe now.Let us know what you think about this article.

Only this time, it doesn’t go away. “It feels like a miracle,” he says. “When the results appeared, my breath was taken away and tears welled in my eyes. It’s that magical.”
Our machines have crossed a threshold. All our lives, we have been reassured that computers were incapable of being truly creative. Yet, suddenly, millions of people are now using a new breed of AIs to generate stunning, never-before-seen pictures. Most of these users are not, like Lee Unkrich, professional artists, and that’s the point: They do not have to be. Not everyone can write, direct, and edit an Oscar winner like Toy Story 3 or Coco, but everyone can launch an AI image generator and type in an idea. What appears on the screen is astounding in its realism and depth of detail. Thus the universal response: Wow. On four services alone—Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Artbreeder, and DALL-E—humans working with AIs now cocreate more than 20 million images every day. With a paintbrush in hand, artificial intelligence has become an engine of wow.
Because these surprise-generating AIs have learned their art from billions of pictures made by humans, their output hovers around what we expect pictures to look like. But because they are an alien AI, fundamentally mysterious even to their creators, they restructure the new pictures in a way no human is likely to think of, filling in details most of us wouldn’t have the artistry to imagine, let alone the skills to execute. They can also be instructed to generate more variations of something we like, in whatever style we want—in seconds. This, ultimately, is their most powerful advantage: They can make new things that are relatable and comprehensible but, at the same time, completely unexpected.
So unexpected are these new AI-generated images, in fact, that—in the silent awe immediately following the wow—another thought occurs to just about everyone who has encountered them: Human-made art must now be over. Who can compete with the speed, cheapness, scale, and, yes, wild creativity of these machines? Is art yet another human pursuit we must yield to robots? And the next obvious question: If computers can be creative, what else can they do that we were told they could not?
I have spent the past six months using AIs to create thousands of striking images, often losing a night’s sleep in the unending quest to find just one more beauty hidden in the code. And after interviewing the creators, power users, and other early adopters of these generators, I can make a very clear prediction: Generative AI will alter how we design just about everything. Oh, and not a single human artist will lose their job because of this new technology.
AI image generators were born from the marriage of two separate technologies. One was a historical line of deep learning neural nets that could generate coherent realistic images, and the other was a natural language model that could serve as an interface to the image engine. The two were combined into a language-driven image generator. Researchers scraped the internet for all images that had adjacent text, such as captions, and used billions of these examples to connect visual forms to words, and words to forms. With this new combination, human users could enter a string of words—the prompt—that described the image they sought, and the prompt would generate an image based on those words.
Scientists now at Google invented the diffusion computational models that are at the core of image generators today, but the company has been so concerned about what people might do with them that it still has not opened its own experimental generators, Imagen and Parti, to the public. (Only employees can try them, and with tight guidelines on what can be requested.) It is no coincidence, then, that the three most popular platforms for image generators right now are three startups with no legacy to protect. Midjourney is a bootstrapping startup launched by David Holz, who based the generator in an emerging community of artists. The interface to the AI is a noisy Discord server; all the work and prompts were made public from the start. DALL-E is a second-gen product of the nonprofit OpenAI, funded by Elon Musk and others. Stable Diffusion appeared on the scene in August 2022, created by Emad Mostaque, a European entrepreneur. It’s an open source project, with the added benefit that anyone can download its software and run it locally on their own desktop. More than the others, Stable Diffusion has unleashed AI image generators into the wild.
Why are so many people so excited to play with these AIs? Many images are being created for the same reason that humans have always made most art: because the images are pretty and we want to look at them. Like flames in a campfire, the light patterns are mesmerizing. They never repeat themselves; they surprise, again and again. They depict scenes no one has witnessed before or can even imagine, and they are expertly composed. It’s a similar pleasure to exploring a video game world, or paging through an art book. There is a real beauty to their creativity, and we stare much in the way we might appreciate a great art show at a museum. In fact, viewing a parade of generated images is very much like visiting a personal museum—but in this case, the walls are full of art we ask for. And the perpetual novelty and surprise of the next image hardly wanes. Users may share the gems they discover, but my guess is that 99 percent of the 20 million images currently generated each day will only ever be viewed by a single human—their cocreator.
Like any art, the images can also be healing. People spend time making strange AI pictures for the same reason they might paint on Sundays, or scribble in a journal, or shoot a video. They use the media to work out something in their own lives, something that can’t be said otherwise. I’ve seen images depicting what animal heaven might look like, created in response to the death of a beloved dog. Many images explore the representation of intangible, spiritual realms, presumably as a way to think about them. “A huge portion of the entire usage is basically art therapy,” Holz, the Midjourney creator, tells me. “The images are not really aesthetically appealing in a universal sense but are appealing, in a very deep way, within the context of what’s going on in people’s lives.” The machines can be used to generate fantasies of all types. While the hosted services prohibit porn and gore, anything goes on the desktop versions, as it might in Photoshop.
AI-generated pictures can be utilitarian too. Say you are presenting a report on the possibility of recycling hospital plastic waste into construction materials and you want an image of a house made out of test tubes. You could search stock photo markets for a usable image made by a human artist. But a unique assignment like this rarely yields a preexisting picture, and even if found, its copyright status could be dubious or expensive. It is cheaper, faster, and probably far more appropriate to generate a unique, personalized image for your report in a few minutes that you can then insert into your slides, newsletter, or blog—and the copyright ownership is yours (for now). I have been using these generators myself to cocreate images for my own slide presentations.
In an informal poll of power users, I found that only about 40 percent of their time is spent seeking utilitarian images. Most AI images are used in places where there were no images previously. They usually do not replace an image created by a human artist. They may be created, for example, to illustrate a text-only newsletter by someone without artistic talent themselves, or the time and budget to hire someone. Just as mechanical photography did not kill human illustrations a century ago, but rather significantly expanded the places in which images appeared, so too do AI image generators open up possibilities for more art, not less. We’ll begin to see contextually generated images predominately in spaces that are currently blank, like emails, text messages, blogs, books, and social media.
This new art resides somewhere between painting and photography. It lives in a possibility space as large as painting and drawing—as huge as human imagination. But you move through the space like a photographer, hunting for discoveries. Tweaking your prompts, you may arrive at a spot no one has visited before, so you explore this area slowly, taking snapshots as you step through. The territory might be a subject, or a mood, or a style, and it might be worth returning to. The art is in the craft of finding a new area and setting yourself up there, exercising good taste and the keen eye of curation in what you capture. When photography first appeared, it seemed as if all the photographer had to do was push the button. Likewise, it seems that all a person has to do for a glorious AI image is push the button. In both cases, you get an image. But to get a great one—a truly artistic one—well, that’s another matter.
Current versions of DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney limit prompts to about the length of a long tweet. Any longer and the words muddle together; the image turns to mush. That means that behind every fabulous image lies a short magic spell that summons it. It begins with the first incantation. How you say it matters. Your immediate results materialize in a grid of four to nine images. From that batch of pictures, you variate and mutate offspring images. Now you have a brood. If they look promising, begin to tweak the spell to nudge it in new directions as it births more generations of images. Multiply the group again and again as you search for the most compelling composition. Do not despair if it takes dozens of generations. Think like the AI; what does it like to hear? Whisper instructions that have worked in the past, and add them to the prompt. Repeat. Change the word order to see whether it likes that. Remember to be specific. Replicate until you have amassed a whole tribe of images that seem to have good bones and potential. Now cull out all but a select few. Be merciless. Begin outpainting the most promising images. That means asking the AI to extend the image out in certain directions beyond the current borders. Erase those portions that are not working. Suggest replacements to be done by the AI with more incantations (called inpainting). If the AI is not comprehending your hints, try spells used by others. When the AI has gone as far as it can, migrate the image to Photoshop for final tailoring. Present it as if you have done nothing, even though it is not uncommon for a distinctive image to require 50 steps.
Behind this new magecraft is the art of prompting. Each artist or designer develops a way of persuading an AI to yield its best by evolving their prompts. Let’s call these new artists AI whisperers, or prompt artists, or promptors. The promptors work almost as directors, guiding the work of their alien collaborators toward a unified vision. The convoluted process required to tease a first-rate picture out of an AI is quickly emerging as a fine-art skill. Almost daily, new tools arrive to make prompting easier, better. PromptBase is a market for promptors to sell prompts that create simple images such as emoticons, logos, icons, avatars, and game weapons. It’s like clip art, but instead of selling the art, they sell the prompt that generates the art. And unlike fixed clip art, it is easy to alter and tweak the art to fit your needs, and you can extract multiple versions again and again. Most of these prompts sell for a couple bucks, which is a fair price, given how much trouble it is to hone a prompt on your own.
Above-average prompts not only include the subject but also describe the lighting, the point of view, the emotion evoked, the color palette, the degree of abstraction, and perhaps a reference picture to imitate. As with other artistic skills, there are now courses and guidebooks to train the budding promptor in the finer points of prompting. One fan of DALL-E 2, Guy Parsons, put together a free Prompt Book, jammed with tips on how to go beyond the wow and get images you can actually use. One example: If your prompt includes specific terms such as “Sigma 75 mm camera lens,” Parson says, then the AI doesn’t just create that specific look made by the lens; “it more broadly alludes to ‘the kind of photo where the lens appears in the description,’” which tends to be more professional and therefore yields higher-quality images. It’s this kind of multilevel mastery that produces spectacular results.
For technical reasons, even if you repeat the exact same prompt, you are unlikely to get the same image. There is a randomly generated seed for each image, without which it is statistically impossible to replicate. Additionally, the same prompt given to different AI engines produces different images—Midjourney’s are more painterly, while DALL-E is optimized for photographic realism. Still, not every promptor wishes to share their secrets. The natural reaction upon seeing a particularly brilliant image is to ask, “What spell did you use?” What was the prompt? Robyn Miller, cocreator of the legendary game Myst and a pioneering digital artist, has been posting an AI-generated image every day. “When people ask me what prompt I used,” he says, “I have been surprised that I don’t want to tell them. There is an art to this, and that has also surprised me.” Klingemann is famous for not sharing his prompts. “I believe all images already exist,” he says. “You don’t make them, you find them. If you get somewhere by clever prompting, I do not see why I want to invite everybody else there.”
It seems obvious to me that promptors are making true art. What is a consummate movie director—like Hitchcock, like Kurosawa—but a promptor of actors, actions, scenes, ideas? Good image-generator promptors are engaged in a similar craft, and it is no stretch for them to try and sell their creations in art galleries or enter them into art contests. This summer, Jason Allen won first place in the digital art category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Art competition for a large, space-opera-themed canvas that was signed “Jason Allen via Midjourney.” It’s a pretty cool picture that would’ve taken some effort to make no matter what tools were used. Usually images in the digital art category are created using Photoshop and Blender-type tools that enable the artist to dip into libraries of digitized objects, textures, and parts, which are then collaged together to form the scene. They are not drawn; these digital images are unapologetically technological assemblages. Collages are a venerable art form, and using AI to breed a collage is a natural evolution. If a 3D-rendered collage is art, then a Midjourney picture is art. As Allen told Vice, “I have been exploring a special prompt. I have created hundreds of images using it, and after many weeks of fine-tuning and curating my gens, I chose my top 3 and had them printed on canvas.”
Of course, Allen’s blue ribbon set off alarm bells. To some critics, this was a sign of the end times, the end of art, the end of human artists. Predictable lamentations ensued, with many pointing out how unfair it felt for struggling artists. The AIs are not only going to take over and kill us all—they are, apparently, going to make the world’s best art while doing so.

Don’t bother me with this nonsense. It will never work.
OK, it is happening, but it’s dangerous, ’cause it doesn’t work well.
Wait, it works too well. We need to hobble it. Do something!
This stuff is so powerful that it’s not fair to those without access to it.
Now it’s everywhere, and there is no way to escape it. Not fair.
I am going to give it up. For a month.
Let’s focus on the real problem—which is the next current thing.

Today, in the case of AI image generators, an emerging band of very tech-savvy artists and photographers are working out of a Level 3 panic. In a reactive, third-person, hypothetical way, they fear other people (but never themselves) might lose their jobs. Getty Images, the premier agency selling stock photos and illustrations for design and editorial use, has already banned AI-generated images; certain artists who post their work on DeviantArt have demanded a similar ban. There are well-intentioned demands to identify AI art with a label and to segregate it from “real” art.
Beyond that, some artists want assurances that their own work not be used to train the AIs. But this is typical of Level 3 panic—in that it is, at best, misguided. The algorithms are exposed to 6 billion images with attendant text. If you are not an influential artist, removing your work makes zero difference. A generated picture will look exactly the same with or without your work in the training set. But even if you are an influential artist, removing your images still won't matter. Because your style has affected the work of others—the definition of influence—your influence will remain even if your images are removed. Imagine if we removed all of Van Gogh’s pictures from the training set. The style of Van Gogh would still be embedded in the vast ocean of images created by those who have imitated or been influenced by him.
Styles are summoned via prompts, as in: “in the style of Van Gogh.” Some unhappy artists would rather their names be censored and not permitted to be used as a prompt. So even if their influence can’t be removed, you can’t reach it because their name is off-limits. As we know from all previous attempts at censoring, these kinds of speech bans are easy to work around; you can misspell a name, or simply describe the style in words. I found, for example, that I could generate detailed black-and-white natural landscape photographs with majestic lighting and prominent foregrounds—without ever using Ansel Adams’ name.
There is another motivation for an artist to remove themselves. They might fear that a big corporation will make money off of their work, and their contribution won’t be compensated. But we don’t compensate human artists for their influence on other human artists. Take David Hockney, one of the highest-paid living artists. Hockney often acknowledges the great influence other living artists have on his work. As a society, we don’t expect him (or others) to write checks to his influences, even though he could. It’s a stretch to think AIs should pay their influencers. The “tax” that successful artists pay for their success is their unpaid influence on the success of others.
What’s more, lines of influence are famously blurred, ephemeral, and imprecise. We are all influenced by everything around us, to degrees we are not aware of and certainly can’t quantify. When we write a memo or snap a picture with our phone, to what extent have we been influenced—directly or indirectly—by Ernest Hemingway or Dorothea Lange? It’s impossible to unravel our influences when we create something. It is likewise impossible to unravel the strands of influence in the AI image universe. We could theoretically construct a system to pay money earned by the AI to artists in the training set, but we’d have to recognize that this credit would be made arbitrarily (unfairly) and that the actual compensatory amounts per artist in a pool of 6 billion shares would be so trivial as to be nonsensical.
In the coming years, the computational engine inside an AI image generator will continue to expand and improve until it becomes a central node in whatever we do visually. It will have literally seen everything and know all styles, and it will paint, imagine, and generate just about anything we need. It will become a visual search engine, and a visual encyclopedia with which to understand images, and the primary tool we use with our most important sense, our sight. Right now, every neural net algorithm running deep in the AIs relies on massive amounts of data—thus the billions of images needed to train it. But in the next decade, we’ll have operational AI that relies on far fewer examples to learn, perhaps as few as 10,000. We’ll teach even more powerful AI image generators how to paint by showing them thousands of carefully curated, highly selected images of existing art, and when this point comes, artists of all backgrounds will be fighting one another to be included in the training set. If an artist is in the main pool, their influence will be shared and felt by all, while those not included must overcome the primary obstacle for any artist: not piracy, but obscurity.
A future prompt for a 3D engine might look something like this: “Create the messy bedroom of a teenager, with posters on the wall, an unmade bed, and afternoon sunlight streaming through closed blinds.” And in seconds, a fully realized room is born, the closet door open and all the dirty clothes on the floor—in full 3D. Then, tell the AI: “Make a 1970s kitchen with refrigerator magnets and all the cereal boxes in the pantry. In full volumetric detail. One that you could walk through. Or that could be photographed in a video.” Games crammed with alternatively rendered worlds and full-length movies decked out with costumes and sets have eternally been out of reach for individual artists, who remain under the power of large dollars. AI could make games, metaverses, and movies as quick to produce as novels, paintings, and songs. Pixar films in an instant! Once millions of amateurs are churning out billions of movies and endless metaverses at home, they will hatch entirely new media genres—virtual tourism, spatial memes—with their own native geniuses. And when big dollars and professionals are equipped with these new tools, we’ll see masterpieces at a level of complexity never seen before.
But even the vast universes of 3D worlds and video are not vast enough to contain the disruption that AI image generators have initiated. DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion are just the first versions of generative machines of all types. Their prime function, pattern recognition, is almost a reflex for human brains, something we accomplish without conscious thinking. It is at the core of almost everything we do. Our thinking is more complex than just pattern recognition, of course; dozens of cognitive functions animate our brain. But this single type of cognition, synthesized in machines (and the only cognition we have synthesized so far), has taken us further than we first thought—and will probably continue to advance further than we now think.
When an AI notices a pattern, it stores it in a compressed way. Round objects are placed in a “roundness” direction, red objects in another direction for “redness,” and so on. Maybe it notices “treeness” and “foodness” too. It abstracts out billions of directions, or patterns. Upon reflection—or training—it notices that the overlap of these four qualities produces “appleness,” yet another direction. Furthermore, it links all these noticed directions with word patterns, which can also share overlapping qualities. So when a human requests a picture of an apple via the word “apple,” the AI paints an image with those four (or more) qualities. It is not assembling bits of existing pictures; rather, it is “imagining” a new picture with the appropriate qualities. It sort of remembers a picture that does not exist but could.
This same technique can be used—in fact, is already being used, in very early forms—to find new drugs. The AI is trained on a database of all the molecules we know to be active medicines, noticing patterns in their chemical structures. Then the AI is asked to “remember” or imagine molecules we have never thought of that seem to be similar to the molecules that work. Wonderfully, some of them actually do work, just as an AI image of a requested imaginary fruit can look remarkably like a fruit. This is the real transformation, and soon enough, the same technique will be used to help design automobiles, draft laws, write code, compose soundtracks, assemble worlds to entertain and instruct, and cocreate the stuff we do as work. We should take to heart the lessons we’ve learned so far from AI image generators because there will soon be more pattern-seeking AIs in all realms of life. The panic cycle we presently face is simply a good rehearsal for the coming shift.
What we know about AI generators so far is that they work best as partners. The nightmare of a rogue AI taking over is just not happening. That vision is fundamentally a misreading of history. In the past, technology has rarely directly displaced humans from work they wanted to do. For instance, the automatic generation of pictures by a machine—called a camera—was feared in the 1800s because it would surely put portrait painters out of business. But the historian Hans Rooseboom could find only a single portrait painter from that time who felt unemployed by photography. (Photography actually inspired a resurgence of painting later in that century.) Closer to our time, we might have expected professional occupations in photography to fall as the smartphone swallowed the world and everybody became a photographer—with 95 million uploads to Instagram a day and counting. Yet the number of photography professionals in the US has been slowly rising, from 160,000 in 2002 (before camera phones) to 230,000 in 2021.
Instead of fearing AI, we are better served thinking about what it teaches us. And the most important thing AI image generators teach us is this: Creativity is not some supernatural force. It is something that can be synthesized, amplified, and manipulated. It turns out that we didn’t need to achieve intelligence in order to hatch creativity. Creativity is more elemental than we thought. It is independent of consciousness. We can generate creativity in something as dumb as a deep learning neural net. Massive data plus pattern recognition algorithms seems sufficient to engineer a process that will surprise and aid us without ceasing.
Scholars of creativity refer to something called Uppercase Creativity. Uppercase Creativity is the stunning, field-changing, world-altering rearrangement that a major breakthrough brings. Think special relativity, the discovery of DNA, or Picasso’s Guernica. Uppercase Creativity goes beyond the merely new. It is special, and it is rare. It touches us humans in a profound way, far beyond what an alien AI can fathom.
To connect with a human deeply will always require a Creative human in the loop. This high creativity, however, should not be confused with the creativity that most human artists, designers, and inventors produce day to day. Mundane, ordinary, lowercase creativity is what we get with a great new logo design or a cool book cover, a nifty digital wearable or the latest must-have fashion, or the set design for our favorite sci-fi serial. Most human art, past and present, is lowercase. And lowercase creativity is exactly what the AI generators deliver.
But this is huge. For the first time in history, humans can conjure up everyday acts of creativity on demand, in real time, at scale, for cheap. Synthetic creativity is a commodity now. Ancient philosophers will turn in their graves, but it turns out that to make creativity—to generate something new—all you need is the right code. We can insert it into tiny devices that are presently inert, or we can apply creativity to large statistical models, or embed creativity in drug discovery routines. What else can we use synthetic creativity for? We may feel a little bit like medieval peasants who are being asked, “What would you do if you had the power of 250 horses at your fingertips?” We dunno. It’s an extraordinary gift. What we do know is we now have easy engines of creativity, which we can aim into stale corners that have never seen novelty, innovation, or the wow of creative change. Against the background of everything that breaks down, this superpower can help us extend the wow indefinitely. Used properly, we can make a small dent in the universe.

Artificial Intelligence Won’t Take Your Job

Over the past few decades, a common concern has erupted: the robots are going to steal our jobs! With exponential advances in technology over the past few years, this fear has only grown in traction. And it makes sense. According to the World Economic Forum as many as 85 million jobs may become obsolete by 2025, as artificially intelligent computers replace the need for workers. While this statistic sounds dystopian, here’s why you can relax – why artificial intelligence won’t steal your jobs.Since the dawn of human history, the purpose of technology has been to make life more manageable and entertaining. Tasks that used to be arduous became easy with technological development. We let tools and machines do the boring and hard stuff, so we can concentrate human efforts in more rewarding and productive ways. In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has allowed us to make quantum leaps in technological progress, allowing us to perceive future realities that would have seemed utterly impossible a mere decade ago.Yes, it is true that AI has the potential to perform tasks that have traditionally been performed by humans. Fields such as human resources, customer support, retail services and more are predicted to be heavily disrupted by the integration of machine learning technology. “This is not helping me relax!” I hear you say, “the robots are taking over!”Not exactly.Whilst robots may well take many jobs from humans in the near future, the amount of jobs that AI will add to the workforce will far outweigh the amount we may lose. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that by 2025, 97 million new jobs will be opened in the fields of AI and machine learning. Again, we can see that machines will take the repetitive, gruelling jobs, and open up more opportunities for humans to do what humans do best – create and innovate.Currently, the world-wide market value of AI is over $136 billion, and some projections indicate that this value might grow by 13x in the next eight years. Here in Israel, there are a number of industry-leading companies that are heavily influencing the entire world of AI. These companies include Navina, Resonai, Ask-AI, Velotix, and Tensorleap.The most common positions in the world of AI include:Data Scientist jobs, who are people with expertise in the world of Data. They are able to collect, analyse, and integrate large amounts of data for a variety of purposes.Software and Machine Learning Engineer jobs who write code to create models and software that are able to process high amounts of data in real-timeResearch Scientists jobs, who are constantly in search of creative applications of AI technologyIt is also noteworthy to add that tech companies are also in constant search for people to be involved in other ways. Sales, marketing, copywriting, and business development are all essential for any tech company, and there is plenty of recruitment of these skills, too.“In the last four years alone, tech recruitment has jumped nearly 75%,” says Expoint CEO, Alon Aldi. “This trend only looks like it is growing. The amount of tech jobs in the world of AI is staggering. At Expoint, our mission is to streamline the recruitment process. Using our own algorithms, we help match recruiters with job searchers who have the right qualities and characteristics to be a reliable asset. Our CV building platform is already state of the art, providing candidates with an unparalleled user experience. We make sure to accentuate the most prominent skills needed in tech jobs, so that prospects can make sure they are drawing attention to the skills they have that are most sought after in the world of tech.”“But we are far from satisfied,” Alon added, “our team is always looking to improve our platform to make sure that candidates and recruiters are being linked in the most effective and mutually beneficial ways possible.”AI recruitment has a high demand for individuals with experience in coding and computing. This demand has created a chain reaction, in which people with expertise have started teaching on the side, resulting in the creation of hundreds of online courses in which people can learn to code from scratch, without university education. Many such courses can be found on platforms such as Udemy and Coursera. Whilst they may lack the academic rigour of university degrees or other standards of higher education, these courses provide individuals with valuable skills and experience, which can prove invaluable for employment opportunities.We humans are known for our adaptability. We aren’t simply products of our environment – we shape and mould that environment in ways that benefit us. Artificial intelligence is just another step on the cosmic journey of human innovation. Although concerns about an unpredictable workforce in the future are understandable, it is important to remember that change brings opportunity. It is not too late to jump on the bandwagon and acquire the necessary skills to succeed in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.This article was written in cooperaion with Expoint

After looking at his body of work—which has pioneered the use of artificial intelligence for years—you might also say that neural networks are his brushes. His latest exhibit at MoMA, Unsupervised, is the pinnacle of this philosophy and then more. Refik Anadol: Unsupervised [Image: Refik Anadol/courtesy MoMA]The colossal installation—a stunning 24- by 24-foot digital display that fills the entire MoMA lobby—renders an infinite animated flow of images, each of them dreamed up as you watch by an AI model fed by the museum’s entire collection of artwork. This flow is controlled by what happens around it, making the piece feel like it’s alive.It’s hard to describe the awe-inspiring effect of Unsupervised unless you see it in action. Anadol gave me a video tour using his phone as he was putting the finishing touches on the work in preparation for today’s opening. Even through the phone’s low resolution camera, I was completely blown away with what I saw. It wasn’t only Unsupervised‘s titanic size but its content that was so compelling: the stream of fantastic images materializing and morphing into each other felt like watching an interdimensional being, breathing, constantly evolving at the other side of a portal.For Anadol, that is what Unsupervised feels like: a portal to a new alternate universe created by some AI god that acts on its own volition (hence the name of the exhibit). To understand what Unsupervised means, you have to understand the two main methods with which current AIs learn to do their magic: Supervised AIs—like OpenAI’s Dall-E—are trained using data tagged with keywords. In broad strokes, these keywords (like “bald men with glasses” or “fluffy white dogs”) allow the AI to organize clusters of similar images. Then when you enter a prompt for an AI image generator (like “fluffy dog with glasses”), the AI creates noise and refines it until it reaches a sharp image, based on what it learned from all those fluffy dog clusters.Refik Anadol: Unsupervised [Image: Refik Anadol/courtesy MoMA]But Anadol’s unsupervised AI works differently. It had to make sense of the entire MoMA art collection on its own, without labels. Over the course of six months, the software created by Anadol and his team—along with the assistance of Nvidia engineers—fed on 380,000 extremely high resolution images taken from more than 180,000 artworks stored in MoMA’s galleries, including pieces by Pablo Picasso, Umberto Buccioni, and Gertrudes Altschul. The team created and tested different AI models to see which one produced the best results, then picked one and trained it for three weeks using a Nvidia DGX Station A100 (which is essentially an AI supercomputer in a desktop box that’s about 1,000 times more powerful than a typical laptop).Refik Anadol: Unsupervised [Image: Refik Anadol/courtesy MoMA][Image: courtesy Refik Anadol]“The [MoMA] curators were loving this idea of unsupervised learning,” Anadol tells me, so the plan was to put the entire collection into the training set and let the AI make its own mind, or as Anadol says, let it “look at it and create a new universe.” The results were stunning to everyone involved. “That part is so inspiring for curators,” says Anadol. “Because, when they see this 200-year artwork archive, when they see that the AI can create new worlds [from it] . . . you can see the [ensuing] amazement in their faces.”Even while he is the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, Anadol finds the results awesome. “It’s like its own entity,” he says. “We don’t know what kind of forms it can create.”It’s alive!Crafting the neural network and building the training model to create Unsupervised is only half of the story. The other half is how it breathes and creates its images in real time—a technological achievement on its own. Refik Anadol: Unsupervised [Image: Refik Anadol/courtesy MoMA]To start with, the resolution is stunning by today’s standards. At 3840 by 3960 pixels, it’s likely the highest resolution image synthesis neural network ever created. To compare, a typical Stable Diffusion image resolution is 512 by 512 pixels. Nvidia’s StyleGAN—the AI that forms the basis of Anadol and his team work—typically runs at 1024 by 1024.advertisement[Image: courtesy Refik Anadol]But the truly shocking thing is that Unsupervised produces these images in real time, flowing in constant motion. When you introduce a prompt into Stable Diffusion, it takes seconds or even minutes to output an image. But this AI does it on the fly with the fluidity you expect from an Industrial Light & Magic special effect.What Anadol and his team have achieved defies belief, as David Luebke—vice president of graphics research at Nvidia and one of the people behind StyleGAN—tells me over video conference: “I feel like Refik is very humble. He is very quick to express gratitude [toward Nvidia’s StyleGAN work and their assistance] but I don’t want to understate the technological savvy of Refik and the team he put together. They do amazing work.”Another layer of complexity in Unsupervised is how the AI decides to change the images in real time. To generate each image, the computer constantly weighs two inputs from its environment. First, it references the motion of the visitors, captured by a camera set in the lobby’s ceiling. Then, it plugs into Manhattan’s weather data, obtained by a weather station in a nearby building. Like a joystick in a video game, these inputs push forces that affect different software levers, which in turn change affect how Unsupervised creates the images. [Image: courtesy Refik Anadol]This constant self-tuning makes the exhibit even more like a real being, a wonderful monster that reacts to its environment by constantly shapeshifting into new art. For the next five months, this being will keep creating a new universe that will be constantly recorded as both video and in snapshots of its state of mind, as the machine’s decisions are saved in parallel to the film.And, who knows, maybe this artificial art beast will live forever. Anadol says that Unsupervised may perhaps become a permanent part of the MoMA collection, which seems to me like something the institution must do. After all, it’s a synthesis of all the art that lives in the museum, the embodiment of MoMA itself with a life on its own. As Luebke points out, Unsupervised uses data as pigment to create new art, but the data feeding it was always art unto itself. In other words, the art that lives in the museum feeds this artificial artist living beside it, adding something new to the museum’s collection every moment. The process is such a mind-bending loop, it may actually open a portal to a new universe.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!
