In May, Procore Technologies launched its IPO and the shares jumped by 31%. The company, which operates a leading cloud-based platform to manage construction projects, has over 800 customers and the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) is more than $400 million.


But if you look at the S-1 filing, there are some interesting details about the construction industry. For example, the investment in technologies has generally lagged (this is based on research from McKinsey) and the levels are only more than for agriculture and hunting. 

“The construction industry has historically been comprised of fragmented project teams which used complex work processes that were executed in siloed systems,” said Karthik Venkatasubramanian, who is the Global Vice President of Data Strategy and Development at Oracle Construction and Engineering. “Given the hands-on nature of construction work, the industry has traditionally relied on human experience and expertise to complete projects, and the potential benefits of adopting technologies were often overshadowed.”

PROMOTED
Yet things are starting to change. One of the biggest catalysts has been the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has meant much more urgency for adopting digital solutions. 

“Venture capital investment continues to flow into the space,” said Lauren Weston, who is an associate at Thomvest Ventures.
But COVID-19 is just one of the factors. Some of the others include the increase in infrastructure investments from governments, the chronic labor shortages, the need for sustainable solutions, and supply-chain disruptions.

Yet traditional software is likely not to be enough. If anything, AI is poised to play a critical role in the transformation of the construction industry.
“AI can compute massive volumes of data that traditional approaches have not been able to previously,” said Vamshi Rachakonda, who is the Vice President and Sales Lead for Manufacturing, Auto and Life Sciences at Capgemini Americas. “This is especially true for processing and mining unstructured data such as photos, videos, and text and converting them to insights and intelligence.”

Another key to AI is that it allows for more proactive approaches. “Most of the current reports and dashboards are being used to focus on ‘what has happened’ or ‘what is happening’ on projects, typically after an event or task has occurred,” said Venkatasubramanian.  “But with AI, you can ask ‘what might happen?’ This can be a total game-changer when done right, as it has the potential to help deliver projects ahead of time, improve profit margins, and reduce risks significantly.”

Innovative AI Startups
An interesting startup that is leveraging the power of AI in construction is OpenSpace. The company has a 360° camera—which attaches to a hardhat—that seamlessly collects data at a job site. The OpenSpace platform then processes the images to create a digital twin of the project, which makes it easier for tracking and collaboration. 
“The company also recently launched a new product called ClearSight that uses AI to overlay images of framing, drywall, paint and more to allow for efficient project progress tracking via machine vision,” said Shawn Carolan, who is a Managing Partner at Menlo Ventures.
Another company that is successfully using AI for construction is Measure Square, which is a leader in measure estimating technology. Its platform manages 40,000 to 50,000 floorplans a month. With this data, its AI system is able to interpret paper-based floorplans and make them interactive. 
“We have two key steps for this,” said Steven Wang, who is the CEO and founder of Measure Square. “First, we use takeoff data from the plans, which helps detect the walls, doorways and so on. Then we have a sophisticated computer vision model to improve the results.”
The Future
Again, AI is still in the early phases when it comes to the construction industry. But given the advances in this technology and the innovative ways to collect data, the prospects look bright for digital transformation.
“AI can help reduce or remove a very real tech barrier when working on one-off, bespoke projects,” said Paul Donnelly, who is the marketing director for engineering, procurement and construction for AspenTech. “By sorting through and leveraging data from previous projects and industry standards, AI can help streamline the tech set up for each new project. This makes the use of newer tech in construction viable compared to when the tech has to be set up manually for each project.”

Over the past two years, the World Economic Forum has been working with a multi-stakeholder group to advance ethics in technology under a project titled Responsible Use of Technology. This group has identified a need to highlight and share best practices in the responsible design, development, deployment and use of technology. To this end, we have embarked on publishing a series of case studies that feature organizations that have made meaningful contributions and progress in technology ethics. Earlier this year, we began this series with a deep dive into Microsoft’s approach to responsible innovation. In the second edition of this series, we focus on IBM’s journey towards ethical AI technology. The insights from this effort are detailed in a report titled Responsible Use of Technology: The IBM Case Study, which is jointly authored by the World Economic Forum and the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. Below are the key lessons learned from our research, along with a brief overview of IBM's historical journey towards ethical technology.1. Trusting your employees to think and act ethicallyWhen Francesca Rossi joined IBM in 2015 with the mandate to work on AI ethics, she convened 40 colleagues to explore this topic. The work of this group of employees set in motion a critical chapter of IBM’s ethical AI technology journey. Image: IBMInitially, the group researched and published a paper titled Learning to trust AI systems, in which the company makes a set of commitments to advance its understanding and to put into effect the ethical development of AI. One of these commitments is to establish an internal 'AI ethics board', to discuss, advise and guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems. With the leadership of Dr. Rossi and IBM’s chief privacy officer Christina Montgomery, this board is responsible for governing the company’s technology ethics efforts globally. However, a centralized ethics governance board is insufficient to oversee more than 345,000 employees working in over 175 countries. All employees are being trained in the 'ethics by design' methodology, and it is also a mandate for all of IBM's business units to adopt this methodology. The AI ethics board relies on a group of employees called 'focal points', who have official roles to support their business units on issues related to ethics. There is also a network of employee volunteers called the 'advocacy network', which promote the culture of ethical, responsible, and trustworthy technology. Empowering employees is an important part of making technology ethics work at IBM.  Image: IBM2. Operationalizing values and principles on AI ethicsTo operationalize ethics in an organizational setting, there must first be commitments made to values. To this end, IBM developed a set of 'principles and pillars' to direct its research and business towards supporting key values in AI. Implementation of these principles and pillars led to the development of technical toolkits so that ethics could penetrate to the level of code; IBM Research created five open-source toolkits, freely available to anyone: 1. AI Explainability 360: eight algorithms for making machine learning models more explainable2. AI Fairness 360: a set of 70 fairness metrics and 10 bias-mitigation algorithms3. Adversarial Robustness Toolbox: a large set of tools for overcoming an array of adversarial attacks on machine learning models.4. AI FactSheets 360: to make AI models transparent, factsheets collect data about the model in one place; this includes examples of FactSheets as well as a methodology for creating them.5. Uncertainty Quantification 360: a set of tools to test how reliable AI predictions are, which helps to place boundaries on model confidence.Any organization can make principles or other ethical commitments, but they have to be operationalized to become a reality. These toolkits help IBM fulfill its own ethical commitments, and by making them open-source IBM hopes to help other tech companies, and the machine learning community more broadly. 3. Aiming for broad impact on AI ethicsIBM recognizes that it is not separate from the tech industry or the world. Its actions will affect the reputation of the industry – and vice versa – and, ultimately, the entire tech industry together will affect human society. All this is to say that the stakes are high, so it is worth putting in the effort to get it right. One of the ways that IBM has been attempting to promote the broad positive impact of technology has been through partnerships with educational and research organizations and multistakeholder organizations. Within education, in 2011 IBM launched P-TECH, a programme that promotes career-applicable skill-building for high school students while working with an IBM mentor. Eventually, they can participate in paid summer internships at IBM and enroll in an associate’s degree programme at no cost.At the university level, IBM has several partnerships with schools, such as the Notre Dame - IBM Tech Ethics Lab, to support underrepresented communities in STEM subjects and their teachers, and to improve relevant curricula. By teaming up with research organizations, IBM is helping to train the next generation of technology professionals and creates communications channels, between academia and industry, which include promoting the discussion of ethical concerns from both sides.IBM is a founding member of several multistakeholders organizations, including the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (2017) and the Vatican’s 'Rome Call for AI Ethics' (2020). IBM also works on many World Economic Forum initiatives related to AI ethics, including the Global Future Council on AI for Humanity, the Global AI Council, and the Global AI Action Alliance. Besides these institutional partnerships, individual IBM employees are also involved in the IEEE’s Ethics in Action Initiative, the Future of Life Institute, the AAAI/ACM AI, Ethics, and Society conference, and the ITU AI for Good Global Summit. Have you read?How ethical, inclusive tech can help us create a better world9 ethical AI principles for organizations to followIt’s time to change the debate around AI ethics. Here's howIBM finds it worth its time and money to support these many initiatives for at least three reasons. First, IBM is committed to educating people and society about how technology and AI work. A better-educated society and especially better educated decision-makers are capable of making better decisions regarding the future role of AI in society.Second, IBM wants to gather input from society about the ways AI is affecting the world. In this way, IBM can be more responsive towards the social impact of AI and act more quickly to prevent or react to harms. This helps to make sure that AI is truly delivering on its promise as a beneficial technology.Third, IBM and its employees are committed to developing, deploying and using AI to benefit the world. By making sure that society is educated about AI and that tech companies know about the immediate impacts of AI on society, AI will be more likely to be directed towards good uses.More and more people are taking a longer look at ethics and responsible innovation – and in many cases, they and their organizations are making these ideas an integral part of their corporate culture. All of these efforts contribute to making AI a better – and therefore more trustworthy – technology.Looking aheadAlthough IBM’s size and scale allow it to invest significant resources in these important areas, the lessons learned from IBM’s journey around the ethical use of AI technology are relevant to any organization. As companies evolve and grow, it is unfeasible for leaders to oversee every aspect of their business. Leaders must trust and empower their employees to make ethical decisions. Leaders need to provide the principles, guidelines, training, tools and support that will enable their employees to feel empowered and ready to handle ethical issues. Lastly, the overall purpose of responsible technology is to deliver positive impacts to society. The scale and scope of the impacts will vary by organization, but the goal towards improving the state of society should be consistent. As more organizations share their experiences in adopting ethical technology practices, there is an opportunity to investigate the similarities and differences in their approaches. Over time, there might be ways to measure their successes and failures, while analyzing the paths that led them to such outcomes. This effort is in the hope that more organizations can learn from the experiences of others so that everyone is adopting methods and tools for the responsible use of technology.Don't miss any update on Artificial IntelligenceSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

CopyArtificial intelligence is transforming how we design and build. By 2050, the effects of AI adoption will be widely felt across all aspects of our daily lives. As the world faces a number of urgent and complex challenges, from the climate crisis to housing, AI has the potential to make the difference between a dystopian future and a livable one. By looking ahead, we're taking stock of what's happening, and in turn, imagining how AI can shape our lives for the better.+ 6

Save this picture!Courtesy of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG)Artificial intelligence is broadly defined as the theory and development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The term is often applied to a machine or system's ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Today, AI already utilizes algorithms to suggest what we should see, read, and listen to, and these systems have extended to everyday tasks like suggested travel routes, autonomous flying, optimized farming, and warehousing and logistic supply chains. Even if we are not aware of it, we are already feeling the effects of AI adoption.As Alex Hern explored at The Guardian, making predictions on the next 30 years is a mug's game. However, the act of following trend-lines to possible conclusions and imagining how we might live is a productive exercise. We're taking a closer look at how artificial intelligence will shape design by 2050. From air taxis and urban intelligence to construction and the Singularity, AI will continue to shape how we live, work and play.The Future of WorkSave this picture!© Iwan BaanAccording to The Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. These jobs will be lost as ""artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors replace the need for human employees."" Editorial Data & Content Manager Nicolás Valencia explored this idea two years ago and how automation will affect architects. The conclusion is that the most difficult jobs to replace require a high level of creativity and human interaction, and have a low percentage of repetitive activities. These will be the last to be replaced, but there will also be new jobs created that will become necessary to monitor and coordinate intelligent machines and systems.As we approach a time when the broad intelligence of AI exceeds human levels, existential questions arise. What should you study when any job can be programmed or replaced? Will universal income be adopted as a result? Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes so. “AI is just the latest in technologies that allow us to produce a lot more goods and services with less labor,” says Gates. How we work, and what we can work on, will begin to change at an increasingly faster rate. If half of all work can be done by robots or machines in the next 15 years, it's likely that all work will be shaped by AI before 2050.Urban Intelligence & Big DataSave this picture!© Foster + PartnersAI and the “Internet of Things” are changing how we live, and in turn, society at large. Architect Bettina Zerza has explored how data and intelligent systems will dramatically shape our cities. She gives the example of micro sensors and urban technology that will record air quality, noise pollution and soundscapes, as well as urban infrastructure at large. How people move, where emissions are worst, and how efficient city processes are represent just a few of these ideas. Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a number that will increase to 70% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. Here, AI can further analyze and monitor how we move about the city, work together, and unwind. In 30 years, we will also have entirely new versions of these modalities.TransportationSave this picture!Courtesy of Virgin Hyperloop OneHow we move is already undergoing widespread transformation. Transit is being reimagined on the street and in the air, from public transit transforming to more user-centric mobility services, to rethinking regulatory and organizational structures. Looking at the evolution of transportation, there have been new innovations and shifts in the status quo every 50 to 70 years throughout the last two centuries. From ships and trains to automobiles and airplanes, these advances have changed the way we communicate, trade and connect to one another. Today, there is a lot of talk about the Hyperloop systems, with Virgin Hyperloop One and HyperloopTT emerging as the leading teams rethinking transportation. The implications for 2050 are dramatic, where our current ideas and associations of cities, geography and resources will radically change. At the same time, companies like Uber and Volocopter are looking to the sky to design and develop the world's first vertiport and air taxi hubs around the world. Trying to anticipate the future of mobility, the Third Dimension will open up new possibilities for transit.ConstructionSave this picture!© Foster + PartnersConstruction has been one of the most challenging sectors for artificial intelligence. British multinational infrastructure company Balfour Beatty published their predictions for 2050 in their Innovation Paper. The report outlines a series of conclusions: robots will work in teams to build complex structures using dynamic new materials, while elements of a build will self-assemble. Drones flying overhead will scan the site, sending instructions to robotic cranes and diggers and automated builders with no need for human involvement. The result is a human-free construction process, one where the role of the builder moves to “overseer” and they are remotely managing projects.Moreover, if people are still on site before being phased out, they will be using robotically enhanced exoskeletons and neural-control technology to move and control machinery and other robots on site. These movements could eventually address the dangers of construction and make Zero Harm a reality. However, there are deeper ideological changes that come with human-free building. In terms of design and an appreciation for craft, we may begin to lose a “human touch” and the haptic qualities of construction. It is directly tied to the very meaning of tectonics; the science and art of construction, the activity of building, and the resulting details and connections.The SingularitySave this picture!© Dose Media on UnsplashLooking to the future, especially as far as 2050, there is a lot of discussion about the ""singularity"" moment in artificial intelligence. The Singularity is often defined as the point at which exponential technological advancements cross the threshold of “strong AI” and machines possess a broad intelligence that exceeds human levels. There is a very strong chance it will happen by 2050.The singularity also represents a point where human intelligence and AI merge. Human intelligence will undergo an extensive integration with AI, forming a symbiotic relationship where AIs are empowered by human talent for creative and lateral thinking. At the same time, humans could be empowered by AI’s memory and rapid computing. The design implications are, quite definitively, hard to grasp. To put it another way, we may begin to create designs we don't yet have the capacity to imagine.Save this picture!© ICD-ITKE, University of StuttgartArtificial intelligence will continue to inspire discussions on the precarity of work, our shared ethics, ideas like universal basic income and urban intelligence, as well as how we design. More than productivity gains, we can rethink the way we live and how we shape the built environment. By doing so, we can being to imagine new creative and social processes, and hopefully, work with AI to lay the foundation for a better future.",,,,,,,https://www.archdaily.com/937523/how-artificial-intelligence-will-shape-design-by-2050,1304.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept of artificial intelligence has been with us since 1955, when a group of researchers first proposed a study of “the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.” At the same time, it seems like not a day goes by without news about some development, making it feel very futuristic.
It’s also the purview of professors from a variety of fields at Fordham, such as Damian Lyons, Ph.D., a professor of computer science, R.P. Raghupathi Ph.D., a professor of information, technology and operations at Gabelli School of Business, and Lauri Goldkind, Ph.D., a professor at the Graduate School of Social Service.

FordhamNotes · The Promise and Peril of AI
Full transcript below:

Patrick Verel: Artificial intelligence is many things to many people, on the one hand, the concept has been with us since 1955 when a group of researchers first proposed a study of, “The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.” At the same time, it seems like there isn’t a day that goes by without news of some new development, making it feel very futuristic. Need to call your pharmacy, a chat bot will answer the call, approaching another car on the highway while in cruise control, don’t worry your car will slow itself down before you plow into it. Just this month, the New York Times reported that an Iranian scientist was assassinated in November by an AI assisted robot with a machine gun.
Damian Lyons
Here at Fordham, Damian Lyons is a professor of computer science on the faculty of arts and sciences. R.P. Raghupathi is a professor of information, technology and operations at the Gabelli School of Business. And Lauri Goldkind is a professor at the Graduate School of Social Service. I’m Patrick Verel, and this is Fordham News. 
Dr. Lyons, you’ve been following this field for 40 years and have witnessed some real ebbs and flows in it, why is this time different?
Damian Lyons: Well, the public perception of artificial intelligence has had some real ebbs and flows over the years. And while it’s true that humanity has been trying to create human-like machines almost since we started telling stories about ourselves, many would trace the official birth of AI as a field, to a workshop that occurred at Dartmouth University in the summer of ’56. And it’s interesting that two of the scientists at that workshop had already developed an AI system that could reason symbolically, something which was supposed to be only doable by humans up until then. And while there was some successes with those efforts, by and large AI did not meet the enthusiastic predictions of its proponents, and that brought on what has often been called the AI winter, when its reputation fell dramatically. In the 70s, things started to rise a little bit again, AI began to focus on what are called strong methods. Those are methods that make use of the main specific information rather than general-purpose information to do the reasoning.
So the domain expertise of a human expert could be embodied in a computer program, and that was called an expert system. For example, the MYCIN expert system was able to diagnose blood infections as well as some experts and much better than most junior physicians. So expert systems became among the first commercially successful AI technologies. The AI logistics software that was used in the 1991 Gulf War in a single application was reported to have paid back all the money that the government spent funding AI up until this point. So once again, AI was in the news and they were riding high, but expert systems again, lost their luster in the public eye because of the narrow application possibilities and AI reputation once again deemed, not as bad as before, but it deemed once again. But in the background coming up to the present date, there were two technology trends that were brewing.
The first was the burgeoning availability of big data via the web and the second was the advent of multi-core technology. So both of these together set the scene for the emergence of the latest round in the development of AI, the so-called deep learning systems. So in 2012, a deep learning system, not only surpassed its competitor programs at the task of image recognition but also surpassed human experts at the task of image recognition. And similar techniques were used to build AI systems to defeat the most experienced human players at games such as Go and chess and to autonomously drive 10 million miles on public roads without serious accidents. So once again, predictions about the implications of AI are sky-high.
PV: Now, of all the recent advances, I understand one of the most significant of them is something called AlphaFold. Can you tell me why is it such a big deal?
DL: AlphaFold in my opinion, is a poster child for the use of AI. So biotechnology addresses issues such as cures for disease, for congenital conditions, and maybe even for aging, I’ve got my fingers crossed for that one. So proteins are molecular chains of amino acids, and they’re an essential tool in biotechnology, in trying to construct cures for diseases, congenital conditions, and so forth. And the 3D shape of a protein is closely related to its function, but it’s exceptionally difficult to predict, the combinatorics in predicting the shape are astronomical. So this problem has occupied human attention as a grand challenge in biology for almost 50 years, and up until now, it requires an extensive trial and error approach to lab work and some very expensive machinery in order to do this prediction of shape. But just this summer Google’s DeepMind produced the AlphaFold 2 AI program, and AlphaFold 2 can predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino acid sequence with higher accuracy, much faster, and obviously much cheaper than experimental methods. This has been held in biology as a stunning breakthrough.
PV: R.P. and Lauri, do you have any thoughts on things that are unsung?
W.P. Raghupathi
R.P. Raghupathi: I would just add medicine is a good example, the whole space of medicine, and like Damian mentioned with the image recognition is one of the most successful in radiology. Where now radiologists are able to spend more time at a high level, looking at exception cases that are unusual as opposed to processing thousands and thousands of images, doing the busywork. So that’s been taken out, with a great deal of success. So Neuralink is another example, I’m just excited that we can hopefully solve some of our brain problems, whether through accidents or Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s with brain implants, chip implants, and that’s terrific progress. I mean, just more recently with drug discovery, extending what Damien said, vaccine development, drug development has accelerated with AI and machine learning. There’s of course, for me, the interest is also just quickly social and public policy and so Lauri will speak to that. I’m just looking at how even being data driven in our decision making in terms of the UN Sustainable Development Goals or poverty elevation or whatever, just looking at the data, analyzing it with AI and deep learning, give us more insight.
Lauri Goldkind: It’s funny R.P. I didn’t know that we were going to go in this direction in particular, but the UN has a research roadmap for a post-COVID world, which hopefully we’ll be in that world soon. But in this research roadmap, it talks a lot about using AI and it also talks about data interoperability and so data sharing at the country level in order to be both meet the sustainable development goals, but also to meet even possibly more pressing need. So pandemic recovery, cities recovering from natural disaster, and it definitely amplifies a need for data interoperability and deploying AI tools for these social good pieces and for using more evidence in policymaking. Because there’s the evidence and there’s advancements and then there’s the policymakers and building a bridge between those two components.
Lauri Goldkind
PV: Dr. Lyons, you mentioned this notion of talking about the advances for science or being a good thing and a positive thing. I know that there are also fears about AI that veer into the existential realm, on thinking of this notion that robots will become self-aware. And I’m gen X so of course, my frame of reference for everything is the Terminator movies and thinking about Skynet, which comes to life and endangers human existence, as we know it. But there’s also this idea within the field that the concept of silos will make that unlikely or not as likely as maybe people think. Can you explain it a little bit about that?
DL: Yeah, sure. That’s a very good point, Patrick. So games like chess and Go and so forth were an early target of AI applications because there’s an assumption there, there’s an assumption that a human who plays chess well must be intelligent and capable of impressive achievement in other avenues of life. As a matter of fact, you might even argue that the reason humans participate in these kind of games is to sharpen their strategic skills that they can then use to their profit and other commercial or military applications. However, when AI addresses chess, it does so by leveraging what I called previously, these strong methods, so they leverage domain expertise in chess. Despite its very impressive strategy at playing Go, the AlphaGo program from DeepMind, can’t automatically apply the same information to other fields. So for example, it couldn’t turn from playing, Go in the morning to running a multinational company effectively in the afternoon, as a human might, we learn skills which we can apply to other domains, that’s not the case with AI.
AI tools are siloed and I think an excellent warning case for all of us is IBM’s Watson. Where is Watson? Watson is a warning for hubris, I think in this regard, it has not remade the fortune of IBM or accomplished any of the great tasks foretold, they’ve tuned down their expectations, I believe in IBM and there are applications for which a technology such as Watson could be well used and profitable, but it was custom built for a quiz show, so it’s not going to do anything else very easily. AI tools and systems are still developed in domain silos, so I don’t believe that the sentient AI scenario is an imminent press. However, the domain-specific AI tools that we have developed could still be misused, so I believe the solution is educating the developers and designers of these systems to understand the social implications of the field. So we can ensure that the systems that are produced are safe and trustworthy and used in the public good.
PV: Dr. Raghupathi, now I know robots long ago replaced a lot of blue-collar jobs, I’m thinking for instance of car assembly lines, now I understand they’re coming for white-collar jobs as well. In 2019, for instance, a major multinational bank announced that as part of the plan to lay off 18,000 workers, it would turn to an army of robots as it were, what has changed?
RP: So I just go back to what Damien mentioned in the beginning. I mean, two trends have impacted organizations and businesses in general. So one is the rapid advances in hardware technologies, both storage as well as speed, so those have enabled us to do more complex and sophisticated things. And number two is the data, which also he mentioned, that all of a sudden corporations have found they’re sitting on mountains of data and they could actually use it with all this computing power. So those two trends confluence together to make it an ideal situation where companies are now using AI and other techniques to automate various processes. It is slow and we have a lot to learn because we don’t know how to handle displacement and layoffs and so on, so companies have started with basic robotic process automation, first automating routine and repetitive tasks. But we also see now more advanced work going on, like in the example you mentioned that banks, trading companies, hedge funds are using automated trading, algorithmic trading, that’s all machine learning and deep learning. So those are replacing traders.
PV: What kind of jobs do you think are going to be the most affected by AI going forward?
RP: Well, all at both ends, we know that the routine, for example, in a hospital admissions process or security checks or insurance crossing, all of those, any data-driven is already automated. And then from the prior examples, now you call your insurance company for good or bad, you’re going to go through this endless loop of automated voice recognition systems. Now the design of those is lacking quite a bit in terms of training them on different accents, they never understand my accent. So I just hit the zero button like five times and then I will have a human at the other end or I would say, blah, blah, blah and the system gets it and really it works.
Then we have now the more advanced, and so the financial trading is an example, but also in healthcare, the diagnosis, the diagnostic decision making like the example that was mentioned, reading MRI images and CT scan images and x-rays, that’s pretty advanced work by radiologists. And now the deep learning systems have taken over and they’re doing an excellent job and then the radiologists are there to supervise, keep an eye on outliers and exceptions for them.
PV: I’m glad to hear that I’m not the only one who, when I get an automated voice on the other end of the line that I just hit zero, just say, “Talk to a person, talk to a person, talk to a person.”
RP: Try blah, blah, blah, it works better, to cut to the chase.
LG: Even in my field in social work, automation, and chat is beginning to take over jobs. And so I’m working with a community partner, that’s using a chatbot as a coach for motivational interviewing, which is an evidence-based practice. And one of the challenges in evidence-based practices is how faithful the worker is to implementing the strategy of the practice. And we’re now seeing, instead of having a human coach to do technical assistance on implementing a particular practice, agencies are turning to chat because it’s efficient. So if I don’t have to pay a human coach, I can train three more workers using this chat strategy. And so we think in these highly professionalized settings that people have job security and job safety versus automation and that’s actually just not the case anymore.
PV: What implications do these advancements have for other countries?
DL: I think there are developed countries and undeveloped countries, one potential advantage that AI holds for the future is in my own area of research, which is the applications of AI and robotics. And that’s the area of what’s called precision agriculture, so the idea being that rather than spraying large areas with pesticides or covering areas with fertilizer, you use AI technology and the embodiment of AI technology in ground robots and robot drones to target specific areas, specific spatial areas. So that if you’ve got pests growing on a particular line of tomato plants or coffee plants, then you can target your pesticide to just those areas. You can even use mechanical means to pull up weeds just as people do rather than flying a plane overhead and spraying all kinds of nasty pesticides and other stuff which ruin the environment.
LG: I was thinking on the more positive side, the use of chat technologies in mental health and whole language processing in mental health and things like avatar therapy, in scenarios where there are no providers, the AI has a real possibility of benefit in order to serve people who might not otherwise be served. And so there’s a growing understanding that depression and social connection and wellbeing are interrelated and are mental health challenges that are certainly related to climate change and future work and all those other pieces. But one way to meet that growing mental health need is to use artificial intelligence to deliver services. And so on the positive side, I think there’s an opportunity to grow AI strategies in mental health.
RP: I think Patrick, some of these implications are not just for developing other countries, but even our country and the developed countries. I mean, take the retraining of the workforce that was alluded to, we don’t have any for even the transfer to clean technologies from the coal mines. I mean, what are those people going to do if we shut down the coal mines? Are we training them in the manufacture and use of advanced energy technologies? And likewise in the last election, there were some talk, Andrew Yang and others have had universal income, a lot of research is going on about it, the cost-benefit analysis, so some kind of safety net, some social policy as we handle this transition to an automated workforce is needed.
LG: I mean, let’s be really clear, the reason that Silicon Valley is interested in a universal basic income is because there’s a dramatic understanding about what the future of employment is going to look like. And as in the US is a global North country and we have a very strong ethos about work and a work identity. And when there are no jobs, it’s going to be really challenging even for traditional middle-class jobs to figure out their role with regard to working alongside AI.
PV: Now, Dr. Goldkind, this summer, you wrote a paper actually, and you said that social work must claim a place in the AI design and development, working to ensure that AI mechanisms are created, imagined and implemented to be congruent with ethical and just practice. Are you worried that your field is not as involved in decisions about AI development as it should be?
LG: I think that we have some catching up to do and I think that we have some deep thinking to do about how we can include content like AI and automated decision making and robotics and generalized intelligence versus specialized intelligence in AI into our curricula. And to Damien’s earlier point, I think that the same way that our engineering students should be trained with an ethical lens or minimally, a lens on who might be an end user of some of these tools and what those implications might be, that social work students and prospective social work professionals should also have a similar understanding of the consequences of AI use and AI mechanisms. And so I think that there’s a lot of room for growth in my discipline to catch up and to also be partners in how these systems are developed. Because social work is bringing this particular lens of an ecosystem model and a person in an environment approach and a respect for human dignity.
And by no means suggesting that a business student or a computer science student is not as un-respective of human dignity, but in social work, we have a set of core values that folks are opting into. And we are not, I think, preparing students to be critical about these issues and think deeply about the implications of when they’re seeing a client who’s been accessed by an AI or a robot, what are the tools and strategies we might use to help that person be synthesized back into their community in a way that’s meaningful, on one hand. And on the other hand in the AI world, there’s a huge conversation about fairness, accountability, and transparency, and ethics in AI, and social work has a code of ethics and has a long history of applying those codes. And so could be a real value add to the design and development process.
PV: Yeah. I feel like when we talked before this, you mentioned this idea of having graduates getting used to this idea of working alongside AI, not necessarily being replaced by it. Can you talk a little bit about that?
LG: Sure. I think the idea about AI augmentation rather than AI automation is whereas these pieces are evolving is where it seems to be headed. And I think it would be useful for us as social work educators to think about how are we helping our students become comfortable with an augmented practice that uses an AI in a positive light? And so, for example, in diagnosis, in the mental health world, AI can make a more accurate assessment than a human can, because the AI is built as to our peace point earlier about radiology, the AI is trained to do this one specific thing. And so similarly in mental health, it would be great if we were teaching students about how these tools can be deployed so they can work on higher-order decision making or alternative planning and strategies and use the AI in a complementary fashion as opposed to being just completely automated.
PV: I think about jobs, so much of this conversation revolves around jobs and oh, I’m going to lose my job to a robot. And in your field, it seems like that is never going to be the case because there’s such a huge demand for mental health services, that there’s no way the robots can physically replace all the people.
RP: Social services can be delivered, again, more effectively with now the AI, the technologies, but also the data-driven approaches. I mean, every agency is swamped with cases and workloads, sometimes it’s taking years to resolve whether it’s placing a child in a foster home or whatever. So I think these technologies will help process the data faster and more effectively and give that information, the insight to the counselors, to the managers, to the caseworkers. And so they could spend more time dealing with the high-level issues than with paper pushing or processing data, so there is really great benefit over there, again, to at least automate some of the routine and repetitive parts.
LG: Oh, absolutely. And also in terms of automated decision making and even operations research and bringing some of those strategies from predictive analytics and exploratory data analysis into mental health providers, or community health providers and other providers of human services. Where we could deploy resources in a really strategic way that the agencies don’t have the capacity to do in human decision making and AI or a good algorithm can make really efficient use of this data that people are already collecting.
DL: I just want to chime in on that. That’s such an interesting discussion and I guess I feel a little out of place because I’m going to say something I normally don’t say, which is that now you’re making me very worried about the application of AI. So we already know that there are lots of issues in the way people develop AI systems, engineers or computer scientists developing the systems don’t always take a great deal of care to ensure that their data is necessarily well-curated or represented from a public good perspective. But now if we’re going to use those systems to help to counsel, to interact with vulnerable humans, then there’s a tremendous opportunity for misuse, corruption, accidental mistake. So I’m a little worried. I think we have to be really careful if we do something like that, and I’m not saying that there isn’t an opportunity there, but I’m saying that that’s a case where the implications of the use of AI are pretty dramatic even with the current state of AI. So we probably want to be very careful how we do that.
LG: In a perfect world, I would have my social work students cross-trained with your CS students, because I do think that there’s a real value to having those interdisciplinary conversations where people become aware of unintended consequences, or possible biases that can be embedded in data and what that means for a particular application. But I also want to just note that the same way the universal basic income has been discussed as a bomb for future work type issues, predictive analytics, and automated decision making is in place in social services. And so it’s being used and not even tested, but really used in triaging cases in child welfare, as one could imagine, not without controversy. Allegheny County is probably the most developed county there in Pennsylvania, who’ve deployed automated decision-making to help triage cases of child welfare abuse and neglect. And it’s really another case of decision-making to support human workers, not supplanting human workers.
PV: Have any specific innovations in the field made you optimistic?
DL: Can you define what you mean by optimistic? So for example, if sentient AI was developed tomorrow, I’d be over the moon, I would think this would be great, but I would think that other people would say that this was the worst thing that could happen. So maybe you need to be a little more specific about what optimism means in this case.
PV: I guess the way I’m thinking about it is, when you think about the advances that we’ve made so far, and you see where things are going, in general, what do you feel is going to be the most positive thing we’ll be seeing?
RP: Medicine is I think one area, I mean, just so fascinating, the fact that we can give back people some of their lives in terms of Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s as a result of wars and strokes. And then combined with what Damien said about the biological aspect, decoding proteins, et cetera, it’s just, so drug discovery of solving health and medical problems, I think is one area, it’s just outstanding and then stunning, I would continue to follow that one.
LG: I also think in robotics specifically, which is underneath the broad umbrella of AI, there’s some real advances in caregiving. And I think that that has broad application as we’re an aging society and not just in the US, but internationally with not enough caregivers to offer support and daily living skills and daily living support to older adults in facilities and out, and keeping people in their homes. There’s so many advances to support independent living for older persons that will be automated, from caregiving robots, to smart homes and internet of things advances, that use the big data we’ve been talking about to help support somebody be independent in a community. And I think that those pieces show significant promise in a way that humans won’t be able to catch up fast enough.
RP: I must add to that. I mean, I’ve been following the remote monitoring of senior citizens experiments done in various countries. We are a little behind, but Japan has been just so way ahead, 20 years ahead, that once a picture of this wonderful old lady, 85 years old sitting in a bathing machine, like a washing machine, and she was going through all the cycles and the article stopped it when she got into the spin cycle, you probably need an attendant to switch it off.
DL: One of the things that does make me feel good about the progress of AI in societies, that there’s been already attention to understanding the restrictions that need to be placed in AI. For example, winding back to one of the very first examples you gave in this talk, Patrick, lethal autonomous weapons. So there’s been a number of attempts and conferences and meetings to understand how we’re going to deal with this issue of legal autonomous weapons. There have been organizations such as the Future of Life and its objective is to understand how technologies such as AI, which present an existential threat to human lives could be dealt with and could be used effectively, but constrained enough, and early enough, constrained early enough, that it was useful.
So with AI, I think we’re at that point, we can talk about trying to get folks to sign on to a lethal autonomous weapons pledge, which the Future of Life organization is trying to do. Or at least understand what the issues involved are and ensure that everybody understands that now before the lethal autonomous weapons are really at a serious stage, where we can no longer control the genie, it’s out of the bottle at that point. So that’s something that makes me feel optimistic.

While the COVID pandemic response added urgency to the development of agencies’ IT and AI capabilities, these technologies are rooted in agencies’ long-term IT and R&D strategic plans.The Federal Artificial Intelligence Landscape, 2022 report, produced by Deltek’s Federal Market Analysis team, examines the major budgetary, policy, acquisition and workforce issues influencing federal AI priorities. That research has found that as government mission requirements grow, federal agencies are seeking ways to maximize the use of the vast data sets they collect and store.Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have emerged as key solutions enabling agencies to improve mission effectiveness, stretch workforce capacity, combat waste, fraud and abuse and drive operational efficiencies. The maturation of AI technology, a growing list of AI use cases and applications and the growth in commercial solutions, have all contributed to pushing AI beyond the R&D work at scientific agencies such as NASA and the Department of Energy to a broader pool of agencies.The convergence of mission requirements, legislation, policy and technology advances is driving federal agencies to explore AI and machine learning capabilities as data volume and mission complexity grow. Barriers to the broader deployment of AI technology still remain, such as questions about transparency, ethics and responsible AI. But trust and understanding in the technology is steadily beginning to increase, as shown by the growth in AI investment across federal government agencies.Here are three key findings from Deltek’s most recent artificial intelligence research:Federal AI spending is accelerating. Identifiable federal spending on artificial intelligence rose to nearly $1 billion in FY 2020, up 50 percent from FY 2018, making it one of the fastest growing emerging technology investment areas.The presence of small businesses is growing. Although federal customers spend more with large businesses, AI-related small business obligations grew 177 percent from $129 million in FY 2018 to $357 million in FY 2020.Legislation and policy are driving a focus on AI. Legislation and executive branch policies are key drivers of federal artificial intelligence investment. Recognizing the need for U.S. competitiveness in AI, Congress, the White House and agencies have all developed directives to encourage the implementation of AI and machine learning capabilities.On the whole, AI technologies hold a great deal of potential to transform industries such as national security, agriculture, transportation and healthcare, and they could also create an improvement in overall government operations. It’s safe to say that in both the short- and longer-term government spending on AI technology is going to remain a significant part of agencies’ strategic planning.Share:In Other NewsFederal watchdog investigates Secret Service handling at Trump rallyPresident Joe Biden already had directed an independent review of the security at the rally.Ask Kevin: What’s the legal basis for the Part B late enrollment fee?A reader asks if the enrollment penalty is statutory.Ask Reg: Can I negotiate my federal salary offer?Departments and agencies vary in the latitude they give their supervisors and managers to vary the step they offer to a prospective employee.Ask Kevin: Why am I paying IRMAA on top of my Medicare Part B premium?A reader asks why they are subject to a Medicare Income-Related Monthly Adjustment AmountAsk Reg: How long does it take to be vested for federal pension?A reader asks if their military service counts toward their retirement eligibility.Load More",,Thought Leadership,Federal Times,,,,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/thought-leadership/2021/09/28/why-the-government-market-for-artificial-intelligence-technology-is-expanding/'}",,/resources/img/federal-logo-white.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/FederalTimes', 'https://twitter.com/federaltimes']",https://www.federaltimes.com/#publisher,https://www.federaltimes.com/thought-leadership/2021/09/28/why-the-government-market-for-artificial-intelligence-technology-is-expanding/,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last in order of time, is a publication, edited by the Department of Science and Technology (S&T) of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), relative to the “Strategic Plan for Artificial Intelligence and Automatic Learning”.The purpose of the August work is, in the words of Under Secretary for Science and Technology, Kathryn Coulter Mitchell, to be proactive because: ‘Artificial intelligence is a revolutionary capability that offers substantial opportunities for DHS to more efficiently and effectively achieve our mission of protecting the homeland. Effective implementation will also require significant expertise, coordinated research and development, and targeted investment.”In fact, this Plan outlines three primary objectives, with related declinations:GOAL 1: Promote next-generation AI/ML technologies for cross-cutting internal security functionalitiesThree further objectives have been identified here, which run through:- Advance Trustworthy AI (interdisciplinary effort to research and provide actionable solutions for issues such as explainable AI, privacy protection, countering bias/bias and countering machine learning in hostile environments),- Advance Human Machine Teaming (optimising human-machine interactions by limiting their weaknesses) and- Leverage AI/ML for Secure Cyberinfrastructure (search for capabilities enabling data sharing and processing across systems, effective management of AI/ML models and AI/ML capabilities enabling threat detection and response).GOAL 2: Facilitate the use of proven AI/ML capabilities in homeland security missions, including by advancing capabilities that can be used by non-specialists to curate and process large data sets.GOAL 3: Build an interdisciplinary AI/ML-trained workforce by recruiting experts and training current personnel to improve AI/ML proficiency throughout the domestic workforce to more effectively achieve S&T missions.But what would be the missions of the Department of Homeland Security? They include, for example, managing cyber and physical risks to critical infrastructure, protecting US borders while facilitating legitimate trade and travel, preventing and investigating criminal activity, and responding to natural and man-made disasters.Created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Department’s S&T mission is to “safeguard the nation by responding to tomorrow’s threats and today’s needs through science, technology, and innovation.”The S&T AI/ML Strategy Working Group, led by the Technology Centers Division and including a matrix of members from across S&T, met in the summer of 2020 to identify and define key areas of research and development activity that will serve to inform, educate, and improve the program areas and Department activities impacted by this disruptive technology. This group responds to the principles set forth in Executive Order 13859 “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” (February 11, 2019) and Executive Order 13960 “Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government” (December 3, 2020), and ultimately in the National Institute of Science and Technology’s U.S. Leadership in AI Report: Plan for Federal Engagement in the Development of Technical Standards and Related Tools (August 9, 2019). In addition, S&T acts in accordance with the Artificial Intelligence Principle advanced by member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and adopted by the G20.The December 2020 strategy set five primary objectives / GOALS:(i) Assess the potential of AI in the homeland security enterprise;(ii) Invest in DHS AI capabilities;(iii) Mitigate AI risks to DHS and the United States as a whole;(iv) develop a DHS AI workforce; and(v) improve public trust and engagement.accompanied by three other goals to be achieved:(1) Promote next-generation AI/ML technologies for cross-cutting homeland security capabilities;(2) Facilitate the use of proven AI/ML capabilities in DHS missions; and(3) create an interdisciplinary workforce with AI/ML training.The first declination of GOAL 1, noted above, focuses on Advancing Trustworthy AI, a broad area of research that examines how to ensure trust in AI/ML systems. This research area is crucial for multiple reasons:- To enable DHS leaders and managers to effectively assess the performance of AI/ML systems against both technical and mission metrics, as well as to meet applicable legal and policy requirements;- Provide critical decision-makers with an appropriate level of confidence and trust in any AI/ML systems embedded in their mission; and- Inspire public confidence in AI/ML systems implemented by DHS.“Effective use of AI/ML requires understandable and meaningful explanations of how the systems work for DHS stakeholders, including oversight stakeholders. This requires technical research on how to effectively control an AI/ML system to understand how it arrived at its results. It also requires research into how humans understand and interpret explanations. This includes ensuring that the technical audit incorporates social, behavioural and ethical considerations, as well as legal, policy and privacy requirements.”Second declination is advanced human-machine collaboration, conducting research on how humans and AI/ML can work together more effectively to perform their assigned missions, through the fusion of technical research with social sciences, and optimising the human-in-the-Loop architecture.The last declination is fundamental as it relates to the exploitation of AI/ML for secure computing infrastructure, by continuously updating detection and defence systems and increasing the speed of reaction and response to threats, aiming at real-time reaction.The results, which will be indicative of progress in the DHS, will be through the curation and optimisation of collected data, security mechanisms that mitigate reverse engineering, as well as shifting human attention towards cognitively engaging tasks, delegating purely mechanical tasks to AI systems, freeing humans and directing them towards tasks requiring the comfort of judgement!In GOAL 3, related to building an interdisciplinary workforce, care will be taken to activate through an expansion of DHS fellowship programmes, which promote the development of AI/ML talent by offering faculty, PhDs, graduate students, and undergraduate students direct exposure to unique homeland security challenges.The need for the United States to “catch up”, or at least not lose international technological leadership, through studies and initiatives such as this one seems very evident. This will be followed by a subsequent S&T AI/ML implementation plan, which will describe, in detail, how this strategic plan will be made operational, which you can find at the following link.https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/21_0730_st_ai_ml_strategic_plan_2021.pdfAll Rights ReservedRaffaella Aghemo, Lawyer",,,Recent Strategic Plan on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by the US Department of Homeland Security,,,['Raffaella Aghemo'],https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/recent-strategic-plan-on-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-by-the-us-department-of-835065b56e6a,,,,,,2021-09-30T08:17:24.742Z,835065b56e6a,,,,,,,,,,

The world runs on data, and humans alone could never monitor or safeguard all of it. 
When applied thoughtfully, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced cybersecurity can add essential layers of protection for modern enterprise networks. 
AI in cybersecurity today
Research firm Technavio expects the AI-based cybersecurity market to grow by $19 billion from 2021 to 2025. The company cites the increased complexity of enterprise networking environments, which often include a mix of legacy, on-premises infrastructure, and cloud resources, all of which need to be accessed remotely. AI approaches add efficiency and accuracy and reduce the impact of the ongoing worker shortage in this field. 
As organizations have become more comfortable with autonomous applications that help streamline workflows and reduce human error, it’s only natural that we would see more AI in cybersecurity adoption as well. These five trends in cybersecurity underscore the overall shift toward AI business applications across many fields:
5 trends: AI in cybersecurity
1. AI will reduce burden of cybersecurity worker shortage
As workers around the world were sent home from their offices to work remotely in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals were already lying in wait, ready to exploit vulnerabilities widened by the mass influx of unsecure network connections. Those same tactics have played out across the SecOps field, which has been dealing with a significant skilled worker shortage for several years. 
(ISC)2 estimates the cybersecurity market is in need of about 3 million qualified workers, according to its 2020 Cybersecurity Workforce report. Additionally, the report shows 64% of the cybersecurity professionals surveyed said their organization is impacted by the cybersecurity skills shortage. 
When SecOps teams are lacking in staffing, vulnerabilities naturally increase. No human could keep up with every viable threat, as cybercriminals know. 
AI is playing a role in these situations. Sophisticated AI-driven algorithms can recognize patterns of attacks, suspicious email activity, and identify the most vulnerable network endpoints. AI can also tackle repetitive, error-prone tasks, like data labeling, and generate automated reports for human analyst review. All of these features will help to reduce SecOps teams’ bandwidth, so team members can focus on other security functions. 
2. AI will automate identity and access management security measures
Identity and access management (IAM) is becoming more important than ever with the increased adoption of zero-trust security frameworks, which require every network user to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated. 
AI can greatly reduce the amount of manual labor required to carry out these goals by introducing smart automation into security systems. AI can monitor and analyze user activities, including typing and mouse movements. It can also power supervised algorithms and unsupervised learning, both of which help SecOps teams identify anomalous behavior. 
AI can improve security across the customer authentication experience as well, from the point of account creation and login to interacting with service accounts. AI monitoring of these activities helps organizations to assign risk scores related to potentially suspicious events, instead of simply locking users out or terminating their connections mid-session. This more nuanced approach improves efficiency and helps analysts zero in on genuine threats.

3. AI will improve blockchain
Blockchain adoption has been increasing dramatically, as cryptocurrencies have become more widely understood. Grandview Research values the global blockchain technology market size at around $3.67 billion in 2020 and expects that figure to skyrocket, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 82.4% from 2021 to 2028.
Bitcoin and other crypto coins are built on blockchain solutions that keep transactions secure and decentralized. Blockchain is also used within the medical field to better secure and monitor access to electronic records. 
Advances in AI-powered blockchain have reduced the need for time-consuming secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) “handshake” methods that involve verification keys. Instead, newer systems can analyze data chains in bulk using high-powered AI, which is a much faster and far more secure process overall.   
4. AI will enhance regulatory compliance efforts
AI can apply regulatory rules and requirements to data across complex networks, which is a quicker, more foolproof compliance method versus manual search processes.
AI-based data processing will be critical as over 300 million new regulations are expected over the next decade, according to LogicGate.
Enterprises can use AI to track regulatory agencies worldwide to help monitor and maintain ongoing compliance, as rules change and new rules are adopted, LogicGate says.
Regulatory compliance enhanced with AI is a smart investment, considering the financial ramifications of being found out of compliance with broad data laws, like GDPR and HIPAA.
5. AI will improve cloud network security
As more organizations move portions of their data to the cloud, cybersecurity has become more complex. Many legacy systems are incapable of monitoring cloud data, but newer AI-enhanced cybersecurity is specifically designed for the cloud. 
Hybrid cybersecurity solutions involving AI that are able to monitor and analyze data across multiple environments will become a must. Many organizations have been getting by with an ad hoc approach, where enterprise data is pulled from various architectures, compiled, and then analyzed by a software platform. Not only are these approaches complicated and expensive, they are also prone to missing important data.

The National Gallery’s Prized Peter Paul Rubens Painting Is Actually a Fake, New Artificial Intelligence Testing Has Found
Some critics have questioned the painting's authorship for decades.

A series of tests using artificial intelligence have found that the Peter Paul Rubens masterpiece Samson and Delilah (ca. 1609/10) at the National Gallery in London is most likely a fake.
After comparing the work against 148 uncontested Rubens paintings, the algorithm came to the “astonishing” conclusion that there was a 91 percent chance that the it was inauthentic.
The A.I. was powered by a “convolutional neural network” that analyzed brushstroke patterns and other aspects of Rubens’s known work and compared them to the National Gallery painting, the authorship of which has long been the subject of controversy.
“I was so shocked,” Carina Popovici, a scientist who cofounded the Swiss firm Art Recognition, which conducted the study, told the Guardian. “We repeated the experiments to be really sure that we were not making a mistake, and the result was always the same. Every patch, every single square, came out as fake, with more than 90 percent probability.”
The result lends credence to scholars who have doubted the work’s authenticity since the institution acquired it for £2.5 million ($5.4 million) in 1980. At the time, it was the third-most expensive work of art ever sold, according to the New York Times.
Frans Francken the Younger, Supper at the House of Burgomaster Rockox (ca. 1630–1635). The painting shows Peter Paul Rubens’s Samson and Delilah. Because Francken included Samson’s full foot, some people believe that the National Gallery in London’s painting of the same name, which crops out his toes, must be a copy. Collection of the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, Germany.
But the painting crops Samson’s toes—which appear in full in two 17th-century copies, a Jacob Matham engraving and a Frans Francken the Younger painting that shows the work on display in the home of its original owner. Detractors claim the truncated composition in the National Gallery picture proves the work to be a copy of a lost original.
Concerns about the work made headlines in 2005, when the National Gallery staged a blockbuster survey of the artist’s work, “Rubens: A Master in the Making.” (The show omitted both contemporary copies of the painting.)
“When I first saw the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah in 1987, immediately I thought it could not have been painted by Rubens and I supposed that it was a copy—a 20th century copy,” artist and independent scholar Euphrosyne Doxiadis told Spiegel International at the time. (She had submitted a report with her concerns to the museum in 1992, and still maintains an entire website dedicated to debunking the picture.)
Samson and Delilah skeptics also question the painting’s quality, as well as its style and color palette—though the museum claims the work represents a period of experimentation for Rubens. His best-known work from the same period, The Raising of the Cross, bears the more-familiar hallmarks of his style.
Peter Paul Rubens, The Raising of the Cross (ca. 1610/11). Collection of Onze Lieve Vrouwe-Kerk, Antwerp.
Even more damning is the painting’s provenance from the 20th century. A city official in Antwerp named Nicolaas Rockox was said to have commissioned the painting around 1609, after Rubens returned to the country following an eight-year stint in Italy. It disappeared following Rockox’s death in 1640.
When the work resurfaced in Paris in 1929, it was attributed to Gerrit van Honthorst. Then, Ludwig Burchard, an expert on Rubens, signed a certificate of authenticity attesting to his authorship. When Burchard died in 1960, it came to light that he had falsely authenticated work for his own commercial benefit.
“Over 60 Burchard Rubens attributions… ha[ve] subsequently been demoted in the Corpus Rubenianum itself,” according to ArtWatch UK, which has been following the Samson and Delilah saga for years.
Despite the controversy, the National Gallery continues to stand behind the work, and still features it as one of the 30 highlights in the museum’s collection.
“The gallery always takes note of new research,” the museum told the Guardian. “We await its publication in full so that any evidence can be properly assessed. Until such time, it will not be possible to comment further.”
Another Rubens work in the museum collection, A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning, fared better under the A.I. analysis, which found there was a 98.8 percent chance it was actually done by the artist.

Expo 2020 Dubai, postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic and set to open Friday, is expected to attract 25 million guests from around the world, and is a prototype for smart cities — communities that make use of IoT (internet of things) and other emerging technology such as AI and NLP (natural language processing) to enhance services such as energy, transportation and utilities.
The expo opens at a time when a broad range of enterprises and public administrations are deploying IoT and AI applications. The value of economic activity in AI, for example, is expected to grow 20% to 34% per year across the Middle East through the decade, with the fastest growth in UAE, followed by Saudi Arabia, according to a PWC report.
Accenture, one of the official technology partners of the Expo, was given the job of  building integrated AI systems for Expo teams, country pavilions, vendors and suppliers. “These intelligent systems support various Expo teams from employee to participants and from visitors to partners,” Accenture’s Managing Director and Expo 2020 Client Account Lead Angelo Lorusso said.











 
 
 
The Participant Portal, developed for Expo, is a one-stop shop for the more than 190 participating countries and partners to submit their pavilion designs, themes and content on an interactive platform that integrates authorizations, supply chain management and workforce licensing functions. The platform is based on a private cloud provided by UAE-based telecom operator Etisalat.

Accenture also developed the Services Delivery Platform, which integrates data from more than 80 different applications, including third-party solutions and government authorities. 
Leveraging AI, NLP for personalization

While many of the platforms address the needs of organizers and enterprises, Accenture has developed several visitor-facing digital platforms as well, including the Expo’s official mobile app, virtual assistant, and website. 











 
 
 
“The suite of digital channels leveraged AI, NLP and analytics, to ensure an accessible and relevant experience for all,” Lorusso said. 
All these emerging technologies were utilized in Amal, an AI-based digital assistant developed by Accenture and Smart Dubai, the Dubai government’s smart city initiative. The virtual assistant will gather information on shows and attractions and give feedback throughout the six months of the Expo. 
For Amal, Accenture has leveraged the Smart Dubai Government platform (Rashid) based on IBM Watson technology. 











 
 
 
“The main objective of leveraging this robust AI platform was to capitalize on the investment done at a government level for other virtual agent platforms already in use from other government entities,” an Accenture spokesperson said.

Ask




Amal, which will analyze volumes of information to answer visitors’ questions, has been designed to learn and improve responses through natural language processing. Accenture said it had “heavily trained” the AI NLP model on multiple interactions and conversations and on many topics. 
NLP — the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software — is a potentially huge area of growth for technology enterprises, particularly in the healthcare sector. The global market for the technology was valued at $10.72 billion in 2020, and is expected to be worth $48.46 billion by 2026, according to a Mordor Intelligence report.











 
 
 
Multicloud, 5G infrastructure hosts services

Accenture has been working alongside Etisalat Digital, a unit of the telecom operator, on the digital initiatives. Both companies were picked as joint ‘Premier Digital Services Partners’ in 2017 to develop the infrastructure required to make the Expo site ‘smart’.
Etisalat, which has deployed a 5G network in the Expo area, is also managing the event’s multicloud hosting infrastructure through its digital solutions arm (Etisalat Digital). Smart services and solutions have been deployed across the site to facilitate site operations and security through CCTV cameras with live feeds over the 5G network.
With the pandemic raging on, Accenture had to figure out a way to continue working on Expo projects. “Our entire team worked remotely, and we established new ways of working with Expo 2020 stakeholders to ensure business continuity,” Lorusso said.











 
 
 
The company clarified that the ‘new ways of working’ included adopting a hybrid work model, going to a client’s site or even working from home.
Remote working has become extremely popular in the wake of the pandemic. A recent Michael Page survey showed that more than 60 percent of UAE’s workforce would like to have the possibility of working remotely full time; In Abu Dhabi, that percentage is a high 70 percent, but also in Dubai (63%) and the other emirates (60%) where a vast majority of people would like to have the choice to work full time from home.
Expo is proving ground for IoT
MindSphere, a cloud-based IoT operating system from Siemens that stores operational data from connected devices, plays a big role in connecting devices and services throughout Expo. Mindshpere is a platform as a service (PaaS), on which IT managers can run analytics and other applications. For developers, it offers open APIs and development tools.











 
 
 
The IoT network will help to connect 137 buildings, and play a part in the operation of applications designed to maximize show-goer comfort and building energy performance. For example, Navigator is a cloud-based energy and systems performance platform that integrates data and analytics to control energy systems performance.
Expo 2020 is, in a sense, a prototype for smart cities – communities that make use of IT and operational technology such as IoT to optimize energy, transportation and utility services. For Expo 2020 show-goers, a trip to the Dubai fair will offer a glimpse into the future of cities around the world.

Video editing software is one example of a shift. When it comes to operating simple applications like video editing software, AI technology is starting to engage and even replace workers in some situations. The fundamental notion is that AI will learn from its mistakes and make more precise choices than a human ever could. For individuals who rely on their employment as video editors, this may seem frightening, but there are still numerous ways humans can help in the management that cannot be handled by an algorithm just yet..What is AI Video Editing?.AI video editing is a technique that will make novices and those who have never used video editing software more compatible with the industry's major guns..It promises to solve all of your issues and provide you with immediate pleasure without you having to bother about finding music or other tools! That's right, you'll never have to worry about exporting or uploading anything to the internet again..AI in Video Editing.Even if most people aren't aware of it, AI algorithms are behind most of today's most amazing YouTube videos. A unique piece of software built by Alphabet's AI-focused Jigsaw group is meant to automatically modify YouTube videos so that they are understandable to people from diverse areas..The program gathers information about who could be watching the movie and which portions, such as references or labels, they might not comprehend. It can then rearrange visual content to offer more context for people who are unfamiliar with the language or who originate from cultures other than the original speakers..Benefits of Using AI in Video Editing.AI can assist you in determining the optimal angles, shots, and edits.It may also help you apply filters and transitions to your movies.To utilize AI's editing tools, you don't need to know how to edit video.AI editing is more effective than human editing since it organizes your footage for you.AI may learn from your videos and make adjustments based on what it has learned.With AI's help, video editing gets faster and more efficient.In a shorter length of time, you'll be able to edit more film.It's simple to use and will take care of the majority of the work for you.AI may make a video more interesting by proposing changes that the user may not have considered.Colour correction and scene identification are automated, resulting in a better visual experience.Face detection in films aids in the creation of tailored messages.AI can edit videos more quickly than humans.Video editing may be sped up with artificial intelligence.AI can make a clip more engaging and interesting to watch by editing it. AI is less expensive than employing an editor, so you save money over the long term.AI can assist you in locating the most appropriate video clips and pictures for your film..Automatically Curating Video Footage.In 2016, IBM utilized its Watson supercomputer to curate material and produce a trailer for the horror-thriller Morgan, which was one of the first uses of AI in video editing. Watson essentially utilized machine learning to evaluate prior trailers, then used what it learned to curate and choose sequences from the movie that it thought would be appropriate for the trailer..That presentation demonstrated the influence AI might have on video content curation. A human editor would typically spend hours, days, or even weeks watching and curating all of the video material, but an AI might do it in a fraction of the time depending on specified characteristics. The human editor may then concentrate on creating the final film using the AI-curated clips..Since then, AI has been increasingly employed to assist with video curation. In certain situations, such as Google Clips, where the AI picks short and fascinating clips to shoot on its own and progressively learns and improves its decisions depending on how the user reacts to the clips it generates, it may even work fully on its own..More Intelligent and Automated Tools.Video curation isn't the only aspect of editing that may benefit from AI's automation; there is a slew of other tools that might benefit from AI in the same way..Because AI can 'interpret' films, it may be used in almost any type of editing tool, from color calibration to object elimination, visual effects, picture stabilization, and much more. Many of the technologies now used in these jobs seek to evaluate films using sophisticated algorithms, which AI might ultimately replace..Many platforms, like Adobe's Sensei platform, are already beginning to offer more intelligent AI-assisted editing capabilities. Other editors are beginning to implement their own AI solutions..In the not-too-distant future, it's predicted that more smart video editing tools will emerge, utilizing AI to understand and give recommendations for video editing. Video editing should be a lot easier for newbies with such tools, while more expert users will be able to reduce their effort significantly by having AI perform much of the heavy work..The Future of Fully Automated Video Editors.As you may have seen, while AI is revolutionizing video editing, it is only doing it as a tool to aid and support a human editor. Automatic video editing ignores your preferences and the topic of your video clips, whereas a video editing service cuts material to your specifications. The truth is that, while AI may be able to totally automated video editing, it is still a far way from being able to do it successfully..For the time being, consider AI as a useful tool that may help you simplify video editing and cut down on the time it takes to do it. Given that AI and machine learning are still in their infancy, it's impossible to predict what they'll become..Conclusion.Artificial intelligence is reshaping the video editing environment, and now is the moment for organizations to seize the opportunity. For decades, Hollywood has employed AI-driven technology in its films. Nonetheless, any business that wants to make compelling films with amazing images may now make use of this game-changing invention. How do you feel about artificial intelligence?
