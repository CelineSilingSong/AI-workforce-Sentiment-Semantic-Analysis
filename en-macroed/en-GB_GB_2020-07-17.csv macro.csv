She’s what fashion likes to call “one to watch,” with a Balmain campaign in 2018, a feature in Vogue Australia on changing the face of fashion, and a red carpet appearance at the 2019 BAFTAs in a custom Swarovski gown.
I’m also a model. I’m from Canada, although I live in New York City now. Unlike Shudu, who’s considered a “new face,” I’ve been in the business for almost five years. I am also a futurist; I spend a lot of time researching emerging technologies and educating young people about the future of work through my startup WAYE. Also unlike Shudu, I’m a real model, and by that I mean I’m a real person. Shudu’s not. She’s a 3D digital construction.
Digital models and influencers are successfully breaking into the fashion industry from every angle. Some have even been signed to traditional modeling agencies. Take Miquela Sousa, a 19-year-old Brazilian American model, influencer, and now musician, who has amassed a loyal following of more than 2 million people on Instagram. She’s collaborated with Prada and Givenchy, has been featured in a Calvin Klein video with Bella Hadid, and she just released a song with singer-songwriter Teyana Taylor this past spring.
Impressive stuff, but there’s one thing that’s keeping real-life me at ease: Miquela, like Shudu, is a computer-generated image (CGI), not artificial intelligence (A.I.). That means that Miquela and Shudu can’t actually do anything on their own. They can’t think or learn or offer posing variations independently. But that won’t be the case for much longer.
DataGrid is a Japanese tech outfit whose A.I. algorithms directly threaten my job. The company uses generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is a type of machine learning, a subset of A.I. I’ll spare you the specifics of the algorithmic details, but in summary, these digital models can offer a vast array of posing options that mimic exactly what we do in e-commerce and commercial modeling. For models like myself, that’s how we make most of our money. The German e-commerce giant, Zalando (for which I have modeled almost a dozen times), has published research papers on this technology. It would seem to be only a matter of time until fashion giants jump on board.
A point of tension that is emerging with CGI models is that their creators aren’t just designing them as avatars, but also giving them entire backstories, personalities, and causes to champion. Take Blawko, a digital male model and self-proclaimed “sex symbol” with tattoos and a sarcastic sense of humor. He referenced being “hungover” in an interview with Dazed Digital. Or consider right-wing, pro-Trump Bermuda, whose bio describes her as “unapologetic” and representing a breakthrough in “modern political thought.” Then there is Shudu Gram, who “hopes to champion diversity in the fashion world, collaborate with creators from emerging economies and under-represented communities, and get together with up-and-coming designers.”
There are major issues of transparency and authenticity here because the beliefs and opinions don’t actually belong to the digital models, they belong to the models’ creators. And if the creators can’t actually identify with the experiences and groups that these models claim to belong to (i.e., person of color, LGBTQ, etc.),  then do they have the right to actually speak on those issues? Or is this a new form of robot cultural appropriation, one in which digital creators are dressing up in experiences that aren’t theirs?
I connected with Cameron-James Wilson, the creator behind Shudu Gram, to talk more about this and ask whether he sees the ethical implications of it all. Wilson is white and male. Shudu is Black and identifies as female. “I absolutely do [see the ethical implications], which is why I work alongside writer Ama Badu, who is a woman of color. It’s important to have that voice.” He went on to say that being a former fashion photographer allows him to create beautiful imagery, but when it comes to developing her story and her background, authenticity was needed. “I want Shudu’s story and her background to be just as authentic as the way she looks.”
But we human models have worked really hard to have our stories heard and our authentic experiences considered, and we’ve fought to change the perception that we are just a sample size or a prop for clothes. We’ve mobilized in groups, such as the Model Mafia network that I am a part of, to advocate for social issues and push back on exclusivity in the fashion industry. In some cases our activism has even cost us jobs. But now that we are finally starting to see changes in the industry, digital models can just land the jobs that we took risks for. Or worse, brands can just create CGIs that champion causes instead of actually having to invest in those causes themselves.
Those issues aside, digital models do have their advantages, some of which are hard to argue against. For one thing, digital models drastically reduce the environmental footprint associated with photo shoots and bringing clothes to market. It’s not uncommon for a model to shoot more than 50 outfits in a single day for an e-commerce shoot, and many of those samples end up in the landfills. Using 3D models would eliminate all of that. I spoke to Anastasia Edwards-Morel, a 3D fashion design expert at the design company CLO, who explained that by using 3D avatars and her company’s design software, a significant portion of the supply chain can now happen in a computer. An argument can also be made for efficiency and cost effectiveness. Digital models can work on multiple “shoots” at the same time, and they require a significantly smaller team to bring a shoot to life—only the digital creator needs to be “present.”
Perhaps the most compelling reason that digital models may become the standard is that they are the ultimate symbol of individuality and inclusivity. What if every time you shopped online you could see yourself in the clothes? Literally. If the algorithms were fed enough data about us as individuals they could generate content featuring us, each one of us, as models. Or less radically, what if the algorithms started to learn which models we tended to click on the most and digitally customized campaigns to always include those characters?
The COVID-19 pandemic has directly highlighted the need for these types of digital solutions. Anifa Mvuemba, a fashion designer and creative director for Hanifa, a contemporary ready-to-wear apparel line for women, recently made headlines when she launched her collection on Instagram Live using 3D models on a virtual catwalk. She posed the question to her Twitter followers: “Could this be the future of fashion?” Wilson, the creator behind Shudu, told me that his agency of digital models has experienced “a massive increase in inquiries since the lockdown.” He explained that the role of digital models and the 3D fashion industry “has become something that is necessary and needed.”
So what does all of this mean for living and breathing models? It’s safe to say that we will have to prepare for a changing workforce just like everyone else. We will have to exercise skills such as adaptability and creative intelligence to ensure that we too can sustain the shift to digital. Edwards-Morel, the 3D fashion design expert, advised me to look into creating a digital avatar of myself. “It’s just creating more assets that you can use and it’s where the industry is going.” It’s certainly something to consider. In the meantime, I am going to continue to build and share my uniquely human story, something a robot could never do, and take comfort in knowing that we could be on a path to a more inclusive fashion world. Which is not only better for everyone, but also something that I have advocated for.

Eye autofocus, insanely fast burst rates, 8K raw video, and more. There is no doubt that camera features are getting better and better at a crazy pace. But the thing I am most excited for is not on a camera, it is in post-processing: artificial intelligence.




Photoshop is an incredibly powerful program, no doubt, and it has been moving toward higher levels of automation in recent years, but for the most part, more intricate procedures still require mostly manual control and thus, fair amounts of time investment. I certainly do not mind that sort of investment for passion projects, but on the other hand, for purely work-related projects, I have always been ready to embrace whatever levels of automation that could be found. Such automation has been around for a while, but it has not been until the last few years that it has made major steps forward, and now, I think we are on the cusp of an AI-powered revolution.
Luminar 4 and PortraitPro 19
I will admit that until just a few days ago, PortraitPro was never seriously on my radar. After seeing a few ads for it many years ago, it just looked like the sort of software that overly smoothed skin and produced unrealistic results. I honestly forgot about it until another Fstoppers writer raved about it to me a few days ago. I trust his opinion, and I am always looking to try new things, so I grabbed my credit card and bought a copy. Suffice to say that I am truly impressed. A typical headshot edit takes me about 20 minutes in Photoshop — 15 if I am really hyperfocused. After spending 10 minutes learning the ropes of PortraitPro, I loaded in an unedited headshot and had a finished image that was just as good as a manual edit in about 90 seconds. And for the occasional blemish it missed, I could open the exported version in Photoshop and run the healing brush over it in maybe 20 seconds. No doubt, the increase in efficiency was impressive.
Working in Luminar 4 with sky replacement.

Luminar 4 has been another fantastic addition to my arsenal. I have been particularly fond of the automated sky replacement feature. If you have ever replaced a sky in Photoshop before, you know that for anything but the simplest horizons, it is a rather involved process. Luminar 4 does an impressive job of automating the process and gives you enough granular control to tweak it to increase its believability. The thing that I love about it, though, is that it invigorates my creativity. Replacing a sky is not something I would do on a whim manually in Photoshop. But when I can just cycle through different options with a single click, all of a sudden, I can explore all sorts of creative avenues, and photos that might have gone straight to the trash bin before suddenly have new life.
You Aren't Going to Lose the Chance to Be Creative
A common counterargument against this is that using automation removes the creative touch of the artist, and there is certainly validity to that. But it is also important to remember that you do not have to use it. I certainly enjoy the manual process and prefer it to automation for passion projects and personal work. Rather, the usage of these tools falls into two categories for me.
Alleviating Tedium
Let's be honest: a lot of post-processing is not a magical creative process; it is just plain tedium. Working on a landscape can be a really special thing, but I doubt many photographers will say how much they enjoy editing 200 corporate headshots. 
We already have batch processing to a certain degree in lots of applications, but I have to admit that I was truly impressed by the capabilities of PortraitPro 19. I could establish a certain edit and style I wanted, then batch-process an entire set of photos in just a few clicks; that includes things like blemish removal and the like — everything that you would normally do for a complete edit. After that, I just double-checked all the exported files and touched up the occasional missed blemish in Lightroom. 
Working in PortraitPro 19.

This sort of capability has the potential to revolutionize workflows for a lot of photographers. A photographer doing multiple days of corporate headshots and coming home with hundreds of images to edit could see post-processing of that massive set drop from multiple days to just a couple of hours. Wedding photographers, who typically shoot on the weekends and spend weekdays post-processing, who have to touch up dozens of formal portraits and the like, could free up large amounts of their weekdays for other tasks or personal time. Furthermore, this has potential to ensure greater consistency. 
Similarly, consider a real estate photographer. They can't wait until a day with partly cloudy weather for the perfect complement to whatever house they are shooting. Still, upper-level clients will expect that complete look to show their properties in the best possible light. Like the portrait sets, AI sky replacement can save a lot of time. And it can also set your work apart when you can put every single property against a nice sky. 
Increasing Creativity and Inspiration
I look at it as augmenting creativity and inspiration. You are not obligated to use this technology. But when I am stuck on where to take a shot that I know has potential, being able to cycle through a variety of editing options in just seconds can shake me out of that creative rut and give me an idea of where I want to go with the post-processing. 
Conclusion
In the last few years, AI software for post-processing has made some real leaps forward. And not only does that have the potential to enable new creative routes for photographers, it also has the potential to significantly streamline workflows by alleviating majorly tedious and repetitive tasks. 
There will always be room for taking whatever level of manual control you want to have. Have you integrated any artificial intelligence tools into your workflow? Do you find they have become advanced enough to make a significant difference? Tell me about your experience in the comments.

I'll take AI when it comes to finding/ tracking subjects and objects. I just started to play around with Topaz DeNoise AI and as long as I keep the ""Recover Original Detail"" up and ""Remove Noise"" to a minimum it seems to a good job. Better in shadows than Lightroom. Although when you go crazy with Remove Noise setting it basically just starts to fill in whatever it wants and looks like a painting. That's what I don't want. You can see a bit of that on phones when it comes to night modes.

Change always brings on the discussion regarding how it will negatively affect ""us"" or in this case, the skills and creativity of the photographer...as much as we may desire to wish it away...it's here to stay. Until something even better comes along. As a university teacher, I used to look unkindly towards students always being on their smartphones until I considered how different generations embrace technologies. This was simply how they communicated with each other and how many of them completed their daily tasks. Just because it is different from how I would do it doesn't necessarily make it wrong. AI isn't going away anytime soon and will most likely become a more prominent part of our lives...it always comes down to choices. I too use Luminar to edit some of my photos and find the AI features to be quite a time-saver. Does it affect one's creativity? I'm not claiming to be the ""expert"" on the use of AI, but I do embrace it as a tool...an option. Even after clicking on that feature, you still have sliders available to tweak it to be just the way you envision your final product to be.

Actually I've read somewhere that AI is a thing that doesn't really exist and what we call AI is just a number of automatic tools aimed at enhancing the picture without giving a photographer a chance ti be creative in post-processing. It's just an opinion that I don't really share, since this article provides completely different info: a full opportunity to be creative while doing post-processing, etc. I remember Fstoppers itself wrote about an automatic photo editor packed with AI ( https://fstoppers.com/originals/automatic-photo-editor-photoworks-refres... ), so probably this really does make sense. Anyway, I'm not sure this tool is perfect so it may need some more development.

I'm no more than a hobbyist photographer and don't actually see there's much point in professional photography these days since everyone and his dog is walking around with cameras on their phones. Aside from corporate publicity and advertising (which increasingly people don't look at anyway because of adblockers and even when they do most of it doesn't work) and sport photography (now largely on high quality video from which good stills can be extracted), where is the market?
So what we're left with is photography on the same level as sketching or watercolours - art for its own sake. And in that what is the photographer still doing? The fast high resolution camera means you miss little, the software means you don't need to get it right first time, and increasingly the camera and the software do it all for you. The photographer is just there to bring the camera to the location, and even then a drone can do it now.
Which is why I like messing about with film and trying to get it right first time in the camera. Which is what it's about, as far as I'm concerned, since it requires thinking and a bit of creativity.
My next experiments will be HDR using stacked scans from a £10 charity shop SLR and perhaps capturing water drops on an ancient Bronica.

For me, there is a point in professional photography. Just because everyone is walking around with a camera on their phone doesn't mean they can take a picture. Sure there are people who do well with an iPhone, and with all the accessories geared to iPhoneography they're even better. All the people who want ""professional looking"" pictures of their weddings, engagements, bar mitzvahs, newborns, graduations, etc and are unable to do it themselves, they hire a pro. A drone cannot tell someone how to pose, where to look or direct one person, let alone a group of people.

The above example ""Working in PortraitPro 19"" is anything but convincing. And the example ""Working in Luminar 4 with sky replacement."" has changed the colour tone of the photo. Not a fair comparison to the original if it is about replacing the sky. Would like to see an enlargement of the border of the buildings on the horizon.

The modern tendency to remove blemishes from portraits may please the sitter but they look flat, bland and boring.
The interest in a face is the imperfection and the blemish. Remove them and you do not have a more beautiful/handsome subject, you've got something that may as well be injection-moulded in plastic.
This pursuit of megapixellated and recoloured artificial perfection is incredibly boring. The technical capability of the camera and software has eliminated the warts-and-all beauty of the natural world and indeed the skill of the photographer as an artist in rendering it.

Sadly, that is very true!  I would only retouch injuries and temporary skin blemishes, but pepper spots and birthmarks only if the customer insists.
Additionally with the above example: Her skin tone is awful and there are blown out high lights on her body.

There would be no need for this AI retouching if the shot was properly lit instead of trying to simulate it in post, also as you said that skin tone is terrible, if you want less work to do in post then you need to spend time setting your camera and lighting up properly.

Nailed it with ""Increasing Creativity and Inspiration"". Even cycling through presets, it can be incredibly helpful in finding which direction you might take an image. AI might not have the subtlety of a seasoned pro, but it can definitely give you a quick preview of something resembling a finished product.

The increase in productivity creates a competitive advantage. New technologies require new business models.
The performance of a photographer consists in the individual interpretation of the photographed.
The AI mentioned here is based on learning by watching.
A new business model is therefore to train an own AI. This AI will then learn your own style from your own pictures.
This is possible. Take for example Google Tensorflow, a freeware. With it you can build your own AI. The learning curve is quite steep, but feasible. For this you need a powerfull PC. Or you can rent computer time at Google or Amazon.
Do it, or leave.

Actually the subject aware, algorithmic software have a good place in post production. I use captur one pro and luminar 4. If c1p allows you to select a tree or building and apply corrections, it will be awesome. It will get rid of masks for most of your need.

Sorry but I just have to say this: none of this image processing software incorporates ""artificial intelligence"" because no such thing currently exists. The marketing people just decided it does, because the world got tired of waiting.
It may be great code that uses new algorithms and data structures, including ""neural nets"".  But it's just doing the single task it was designed to do.
I'll sit down now.

It's wonderful!  You make a photo of a pig under a boring sky and change it and in the next version you will change the pig for a beautiful naked blond! And you call that photography... :-)

It seems everybody is jumping on the AI bandwagon. If you use Adobe software, AI is used - Sensei. AI today is just an all encompassing term and every man and his dog now want to market this.
AI is the best thing since sliced bread!

I am waiting for a interactive AI voice to occupy my photo library. So just imagine an Alexa or Siri like entity, that lives in a program like Capture One.  Every time time you upload new images into your catalog, your AI friend will create the meta-data, learn to identify shapes and familiar sites, or faces immediately.  One could ask their AI to perform basic modifications, all in real time, but with voice commands. I’m preparing images for a book and I am reducing the ink levels for CMYK printing, and it would be great if I could get Photoshop to do this with voice interaction. In the future, an AI photo-friend could continue to manage all one’s work on a cloud, after one passes away.

The 10 Best AI And Data Science Master’s Courses For 2021Adobe Stock

Some of the world’s best tech-led colleges and universities offer specialized Master’s Degree courses in these subjects, and often they are also world leaders in research, partnered with Silicon Valley businesses on cutting-edge projects.

Studying data science and AI at this level will mark you out to employers as someone whose technical expertise is likely to exceed that of candidates who only have a computer science bachelor's degree. It might also be a step towards a Ph.D.

PROMOTED
If your interest isn't technical but business-oriented, there are also MBA courses appearing with specializations in AI that may be worth considering.


MIT – Master of Business Analytics
MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor
A course focused on practical applications of data and machine learning, from one of the world's leading technology schools, would be a great place to start your advanced level education in this field. For any master's course, you will generally be expected to have either an undergraduate degree in a related field – for example, computer science or mathematics – but there is often some flexibility around these precise requirements. The other route that can qualify you is if you have gained extensive work experience in the field. MIT's Master, in line with most others, takes 12 months to complete, and aims to give students the knowledge and experience to start working with businesses and solving their problems.

Stanford is another world-leading US university with a very strong track record in AI research with global significance, as well as equipping students with strong practical skills and AI leadership potential. This course specializes in ""data science with a computational focus,"" so could be considered more theoretical than a business-focused Master's, with courses covering advanced software development for scientists and engineers, multi-core computing, and statistical theory. However, electives can be taken in applied fields, including data-driven medicine, neuroimaging techniques, geostatistics, and social media analytics.

Carnegie Mellon – Master of Computational Data Science
Carnegie Mellon is another US institution that is world-famous for its research and accomplishments in AI and data science. Don't worry, this list isn't solely US-focused, but there's no denying that when it comes to data science and AI, a good number of the world's top-ranked universities are there. Studying here, you'll be standing on the shoulders of giants such as Herbert Simon and Allen Newell – two of the great pioneers of modern-day AI development.

Frequently ranked among the world's top 10 universities, this flexible program is offered through the business school as either a one-year, full-time course or a two-year part-time course that can be studied remotely. Topics of study include big data management, analytic algorithms, and data visualization techniques. Students also have the chance to complete part of the course at a work placement as well as train to act in a consulting capacity on data science matters in business.

University of Bath – MSc Data Science
Another UK university that is fast developing a reputation as a center of data science excellence. This course teaches the fundamental software skills needed to work with machine learning and advanced analytical algorithms. The focus is on core competencies and fundamentals, rather than the more practical aspects covered in other courses, but students can choose to work in an applied field during their second-semester research task. The software skills for data science module also covers the evaluation of packages and programming languages for their suitability for real-world tasks. 

University of Toronto – Master of Science in Applied Computing: Data Science
Students working towards the MSc in applied computing at this leading Canadian technical university can focus on this data science track. As part of the course, you have the chance to take an eight-month industrial internship where you will start putting the knowledge you are developing to use in solving real-world problems with big data, AI, and analytics.

University of Helsinki – Masters Degree in Data Science
Finland has invested heavily in training its people to be ready to capitalize on the AI and data science explosion, and much of that effort is focused through the University of Helsinki. Students can choose to specialize in technical fields relating to machine learning, computer vision, and advanced analytics, or in practical applications of these technologies. Students will learn to assess data science and AI techniques and practices in order to match them to suitable tasks, and will boost their employment prospects greatly with an advanced degree from a world-class European institution.

École Polytechnique – MSc in Data Science for Business 
This leading Paris business and technology school offers a two-year master’s program focused on filling the needs of global businesses for trained data science professionals. Its stated aim is to turn out dual-skilled graduates with both the technical and business knowledge to lead on data and smart computing initiatives in industry. The first year focuses on statistics, mathematics, and computer programming before students move on to practical problem-solving skills, involving use of data and algorithms to solve business challenges.  

Tsinghua University – Master in Advanced Computing
China is a world leader in the development of artificial intelligence right now, and this Beijing university's Master’s degree is one of the best-regarded in the country for AI and data science. Don't worry; the language barrier won't be a problem as all courses are taught in English. Explore and gain an in-depth understanding of topics including machine learning, big data and human/computer interaction from some of the country’s most prominent experts, and work alongside major companies including Microsoft and IBM that are partnered with the university’s researchers.

University of Hong Kong – Master of Data Science

However, some businesses (such as law and insurance firms) are still dealing with the cabinets jam-packed with vendor agreements, contracts, employees’ credentials, and other documents.According to reports, workers spend approximately 11 hours in a week to deal with documents related issues, which leads to low productivity and poor quality of the customer service. By harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning, businesses can revamp the traditional document management system.It might seem unbelievable at this moment, but after reading this article, you would know how these two technologies can make the workflow smarter, faster, and better. Here, we have highlighted some of the ways how AI and ML are reshaping the document management system:Data ExtractionUsing an AI-powered DMS,businesses can modernize the way data is extracted. Wondering how? Well, such an advanced system can read the information accurately to understand its intent. On the basis of specific patterns, the AI-enabled DMS system analysis and retrieve only useful information to accomplish a particular job.Like AI, machine learning can also be a powerful tool in data extraction. Using this technology, businesses can develop a way to help its employees to extra only the relevant data without creating any mess. This artificial intelligence document management and extraction helps in saving a lot of time and effort.Document ClusteringA DMS powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning can analyze documents to group them by topics. This further facilitates in understanding the nature of a document and how it is related to some other document.Artificial Intelligence JobsAutomatic Classification and ProcessingWith the help of optical character recognition, artificial intelligence technology can make a DMS to read what’s written on a document to categorize it rightly. It further helps in automating workflows on the basis of that categorization. Just like AI, machine learning also plays a major role in data classification and processing. The technology improves the capability of a DMS to identify and process information.Improved Data QualityAI-powered DMS can help businesses to minimize data redundancy, prevent the occurrence of various input errors, and protect files misplacement. It can also help them to make efficient decisions and process business by offering useful insights.Data Analyticshttps://unsplash.com/photos/qwtCeJ5cLYsTop 4 Most Popular Ai Articles:1. Natural Language Generation: The Commercial State of the Art in 20202. This Entire Article Was Written by Open AI’s GPT23. Learning To Classify Images Without Labels4. Becoming a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Financial Analyst and Research AnalystOne of the biggest roles of artificial intelligence in the document management system is data analytics. Analyzing the data correctly and flawlessly can contribute to your business growth. Using various techniques (data visualization and predictive analysis) involved in ML and AI, businesses can make better decisions.Document SecurityAlong with document management, it is also imperative to secure documents and data, especially confidential ones. AI-powered DMS offers high-level document security by detecting the sensitive as well as personally identifiable information in documents. The technology then marks such documents so that a user can handle them carefully.Structuring the Unstructured DataWith the advancement of technology, we can now generate data from multiple sources; however, this data needs to be processed and structured to fetch useful information out of it. It is estimated that out of all the data collected by an organization, approx. 80% of it is unstructured. An AI-enabled document management system can help businesses to make the most out of this data by automatically analyzing files, fetch technical data, and connect files with relevant information.In fact, most of the companies are leveraging AI and ML to look into emails, messages, and other ways of communication to know semantics, words, sentiments, and more to predict information related to products and services.Content Support and ManagementThe advanced DMS with the potential of AI and ML helps in supporting content as well as document management. It can also simplify document development workflow. Grammarly, a popular grammar check and proofreading software, is a sheer proof of how AI can be implemented to edit documents without the need of a human being.Modernize Document ManagementWhen we talk about document management machine learning and artificial intelligence, it would be no wrong to say that these technologies have brought a big revolution into this field. Industries that rely heavily on documents can make the most AI for data discovery, streamlining the workflow, increase productivity, and make more data-driven decisions.Bottom LineWith the rapid adaption of artificial intelligence and machine learning by various businesses, it has become easier to categorize and manage documents. With AI document analysis, data extraction, machine learning in content management, and other advantages given in this article, these businesses are managing documents effectively and efficiently. Moreover, they can store, process, and extract data in seconds. . If you too want to lift your business processes by integrating AI and ML, then reach out to a reliable AI development company or hire ML developers.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",,2020-07-21T07:22:58.332Z,,['Gautam Raturi'],How AI and ML are Transforming Document Management?,,,,,,,,,,,6f8bcfddb62d,,

It also will give UF the fastest artificial intelligence supercomputer in higher education, officials said.The discipline is a branch of computer science that has brought the world products like self-driving cars, food delivery robots and computers that engage humans in a game of chess. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to perform human-like tasks by learning from experience and making adjustments.Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was present for the Zoom announcement, said the initiative would attract students to UF from across the nation.“I think it’s going to help the state of Florida modernize our workforce,” he said. “I think we’ll have an added boost as we seek to become an economic powerhouse and internally as we bounce back from the pandemic.”Provost Joseph Glover said more than 600 faculty and staff members have been involved so far in conversations on how to incorporate the subject of artificial intelligence into their disciplines.“We believe this is so important to our future and our students’ futures that every student who graduates from the University of Florida, no matter what their major is, should have the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, the training and the tools of artificial intelligence and data science,” Glover said. “This is not only important to our students but the nation.”Glover said the partnership will help “catapult the University of Florida to the forefront of AI” and “create the next generation of AI-enabled workforce in this country.”The announcement laid out the financial details of the partnership: a $25 million gift from Chris Malachowsky, co-founder of NVIDIA and an alumnus of UF’s Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering; $25 million in hardware, software, training and services from NVIDIA; and a $20 million investment from UF.The supercomputer is expected to be installed by November. It’s an upgrade from the existing UF supercomputer known as HiPerGator. Malachowsky said the machine will be among the world’s top 10 supercomputers, capable of processing vast amounts of data that can be used across many fields, including climate research and medicine.In explaining why the company brought the partnership to Florida, Malachowsky described the state as a “living laboratory for some of the really big problems of today for society,” with its long coastline, large population, varied demographics and “a workforce in need of upscaling to deal with the growing digital divide.”UF is in the process of infusing artificial intelligence into its curricula, Glover said. And, while not everyone will be expected to become a programmer, everyone will have exposure to it and the opportunity to be certified in that area, he said.Certifications will include courses on ethics, bias and how artificial intelligence applies to certain disciplines. By spring, Glover said, he expects a survey course to be offered, and by next summer the school may offer more specific boot camps in artificial intelligence.Cammy Abernathy, dean of the College of Engineering, said artificial intelligence is already being applied across disciplines to finding solutions for diabetes and as a means to combat climate change and red tide. Broadening access to the topic can lead to a more equitable society, she said.“Philosophers, lawyers and computer scientists are working together to ensure that AI does not further enforce the biases that are present in our society and does not intrude on the privacy and rights of the public,” Abernathy said. “These issues of fairness and access are important, so much so that they will be at the heart of this initiative.”Glover said the university will work to provide access to businesses, the K-12 education system, historically black colleges and universities and state and community colleges.“The population in Florida will have opportunities to train on this,” Glover said.Malachowsky said he hopes wealthy alumni in each state consider investing in artificial intelligence at their universities.Rep.
