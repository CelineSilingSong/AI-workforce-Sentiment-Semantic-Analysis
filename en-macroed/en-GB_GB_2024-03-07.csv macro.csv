It is not news to say the UK employment market is set for a seismic shock as a result of the rise of AI, but it may not be the one many of us were expecting. The usual narrative around disruptive technologies is that they disproportionately impact lower-income jobs. However, Pearson’s new Skills Outlook has found that white collar workers will be impacted more by generative AI than their blue collar counterparts, with up to 41 per cent of the tasks in some roles predicted to be affected. The white collar roles that are set to be most affected are those that rely on repetitive, technical tasks like scheduling appointments and handling calls: the medical secretary at your local GP, for example. On the flipside, if you’re on the lookout for a generative AI-proof career, then a role as a gardener, painter or dry cleaner might be for you. With many blue collar roles such as these, it is their ‘human led’ manual labour and customer service elements that make them more resilient.So what does this mean for the HR and people management world? While it is natural for employers and employees to feel some degree of uncertainty about the impact on jobs, it is not simply a case of these white collar roles becoming obsolete. However, we need to act quickly and decisively to adapt and upskill in anticipation of the major transformation in the future of work.Productivity in the not-too-distant future is going to be increasingly shaped by the best of AI and the best of human skills together. I believe that employers should create a more holistic view of jobs and their constituent tasks, determining where employees can reskill and retrain, as well as where AI can augment more repetitive work. 
The key is understanding the core skills and tasks that underpin each role, how long they take and how efficiently this time is spent. In some cases, particularly with admin-led tasks, generative AI can perform the same function much more efficiently. This creates the opportunity to free employees up for work that is more creative, collaborative and customer-focused – helping us push established boundaries, in all fields, to previously unimagined levels.A recent experiment from Harvard Business School gave us a fascinating look at what the dynamics of the office might look like with generative AI thrown into the mix. It monitored the impact of GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest tool, when offered to employees at Boston Consulting Group.Consultants using AI were significantly more productive (they completed 12.2 per cent more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1 per cent more quickly) and produced significantly higher-quality results (more than 40 per cent higher quality compared to a control group). However, in a more nuanced task, AI-assisted consultants fared worse than their peers who weren’t using the technology. GPT-4 missed the subtleties and couldn’t replicate the qualitative analysis performed by humans.Without question, organisations are going to have to adapt their learning development strategies to equip their workforce with the tools to thrive in the age of generative AI, and this is particularly true for those in white collar industries. We believe the most successful businesses will be those that not only train employees to work productively hand in hand with AI, but also lean into developing the skills that make us uniquely human. By investing in critical thinking, creativity and collaboration, we can deepen the ties between customers and the brands that serve them, and ultimately make work more rewarding and enriching for employees.We could also see the balance of demand between white collar and blue collar work in the employment market shift in coming years. This requires a whole system rethink, with governments and policymakers needing to adapt curricula, access, funding and pathways to prepare for change too.Generative AI is arguably the most significant technological shift we’ve seen in recent years, and I believe it can have a positive impact on how people understand and prepare for the changing world of work. However, we need to act fast to adapt, upskilling and evolving to ride the wave of change.One of the best ways for the government, employers and employees to get ahead of this transformation and stay relevant is to understand the skills that will be needed for the future, so that they can prepare for the changes to come. While generative AI may be on the rise, the need for inherently human skills has never been greater.Oliver Latham is VP of strategy and growth at Pearson Workforce Skills

There is no doubt about it: generative AI is a transformative technology – a revolutionary tool that will change how we work. However, adopting any transformative technology requires careful thought. It's not just a case of ""futz around and see.""


If there's one thing I've learned from my long career consulting with organizations, it's that transformation never starts with the technology itself. You can't just tell everyone in your business to start experimenting with ChatGPT right away because there are very real challenges and limitations. (For example, you can't have your sales team uploading customer data to a tool like ChatGPT because that could potentially expose people's personal data.)

So, yes, you want people to be using these sorts of tools as quickly as possible, but thoughtfully. Thoughtfully, carefully, and with all the support they need to get the best out of new technology. With that in mind, here are my tips for successfully implementing generative AI in your business.

PROMOTED
1. Remember, Generative AI Is A Tool (Not A Substitute For Humans)
Generative AI won’t do our jobs for us. Instead, we will use generative AI to do our jobs more effectively. To automate or streamline the more repetitive and mundane tasks. And to free up time for more value-adding tasks. As such, generative AI will not replace the need for very human talents like creativity, problem-solving, and relationship building (more on skills coming up) – but it will hopefully make work better for humans.

2. Cultivate The Right Culture And Mindset 
Adopting generative AI successfully requires a shift in culture and mindset. It requires a mindset that embraces curiosity, humility, adaptability, and collaboration – what I call the generative AI mindset.
MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributor
The generative AI mindset has to start at the top and filter down across the organization. This means you need an organizational culture where people continually challenge the status quo, are comfortable with change (and failure), are not afraid to experiment, and are open to learning new things. I’m talking about a culture where people constantly ask questions like, “How can we create more value for customers?” “How can we create more value for the world?” and “How can we use technology to do that?”

3. Invest In The Right Skills And Talent
In terms of skills and talent, AI delegation – the art of working out what we still need to do for ourselves and what's best left to machines – will become a crucial skill. AI delegation, whether by managers or individuals, can vastly increase efficiency by automating routine elements of work such as data entry, processing and analysis, reviewing documents, scheduling and time management. And as with any form of delegation, the value lies in what can be done with the time saved – more time for tasks that require original thought, strategic thinking, decision making and relationship building.

What about other skills for success? You essentially want people to cultivate complementary skills that help the organization get the best out of both machines and humans. This will increasingly place an emphasis on softer human skills like empathy, complex decision-making, collaboration, and critical thinking – basically, the areas where humans have the edge over machines.
Of course, you will also need to build AI knowledge and skills across the organization. But this doesn’t necessarily mean recruiting AI talent. For the average business, upskilling your existing people and partnering with technology companies are likely to be the most accessible ways to tap into AI talent.
4. Consider Appointing A Chief AI Officer (CAIO)
I strongly recommend organizations appoint a chief AI officer (CAIO) – a board-level position that promotes a better awareness of AI across the business (especially the leadership team), oversees the organization’s AI strategy, and ensures AI is being used ethically and effectively.
What if appointing a CAIO isn’t an option in your organization? Some organizations are appointing AI experts as non-executive directors to help the board understand AI technologies and how to implement them. In fact, this is a role I perform for a number of companies, and it’s a great option if you don’t have (or can’t have) in-house knowledge.
5. Take A Good Look At Your Data Needs
AI is nothing without data, so if you don’t already have a data strategy in place, now is the time to create one. And if you do have one, it will no doubt need updating.
When considering the data that will help you harness generative AI, I recommend focusing on the data that will solve your biggest business problems and help you accomplish your strategic goals. Also, think about the shelf-life of that data. While it's useful to understand what happened in your business last week or last year, it’s even more important to understand what’s happening in your business right now. So be sure to think about how you can capture and act on information as it happens – or as close to that as possible.
Consider also the balance between internal and external data. Proprietary data is obviously incredibly valuable because, by its very nature, only your business has that information. However, external data (such as social media data) can be very useful.
6. Be Strategic
Generative AI has big implications for businesses. As such, you will need to review your overarching business strategy to ensure it's still relevant and update it in line with the amazing possibilities of generative AI. This means you will need to carefully examine the potential impact of generative AI on your business operations, your products and services, and maybe even your underlying business model – and then update your business strategy accordingly.
7. Get Your Technology Building Blocks In Place
There are three fundamental elements that will help you leverage generative AI successfully: the first is fast, secure networks and connectivity (not just in your offices but also on the go); the second is data infrastructure (i.e., the technology to collect, store, and access the data you need); and the third is cybersecurity (the technology to keep your business safe from threats like ransomware, phishing, and breaches).
Your generative AI tools then sit atop that bedrock. You can tap into readily available tools like ChatGPT or its underlying GPT-4 language model, but you’ll have to consider the potential privacy implications. (At the very least, always be aware of whether the information you enter will be used for training language models and potentially shared with other users.) Lots of organizations that I work with choose to create their own secure version of GPT-4, but that may not be feasible, depending on your budget and expertise.
The great thing about generative AI is there are so many options for different companies - those on a shoestring and those with deep pockets. If you need in-house knowledge to help you decide which tool or tools are right for your business, it's well worth consulting with an AI expert.

Generative AI is on the rise



When people refer to artificial intelligence (AI) tools, they may be referring more specifically to generative AI which is exploding in popularity and usage.
What is generative AI?
Generative AI is a term used to encompass deep-learning language models that generate text, images, videos, and other content using external prompts. They use the datasets they learn from to create various forms of content, ranging from short poems to long articles.
The topic of generative AI came to the fore with the wide release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool, bringing generative AI to the general public at large. While this might have been the first form of generative AI that many people had come into contact with, it certainly wasn’t the only one to hit the market.
There are now dozens of different ways that generative AI can be accessed, with almost every major tech company releasing its own versions, whether that’s Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s massive investment in OpenAI, Github’s GitHub Copilot, and plenty more besides.
Before generative AI became synonymous with chatbots, it was also being used in statistics. It is an enormously helpful tool for analyzing numerical data, being able to quickly read through and identify patterns and trends. It was the growing strength of deep learning that made it possible to use the same technology for images, speech, and other complex data types.
The very first type of this new class of generative AI was introduced in 2013, known as variational autoencoders VAEs). These were widely used for generating realistic images and speech. Over time, the tools were fine-tuned to create ever more realistic images, sounds, and writing.


How does generative AI work?
The definition of generative AI means that the tool is turning raw data (which can be anything from a quick prompt to scanning the entirety of a Wikipedia page) into output. The machine learning element means that the AI is learning what kind of output would be most likely, based on the data that it has access to. It cannot truly create anything new; genuine creativity still remains with living creatures alone.
However, it can create fresh pieces of output that are inspired by or similar to what it’s learned from, without it being a direct copy. Generally speaking, a prompt is given in any format, whether that’s text, an image, a video, a webpage, or any other input that the AI system has learned to process. It then uses its internal AI algorithms to create new content in response to the prompt, based off patterns it’s learned.
Digging into the deeper technology required, generative AI tools will usually combine several algorithms to process content. The input given will then be transformed into raw characters, such as turning paragraphs into basic letters, punctuation, and words or images into distinct visual elements. These basic characters are then encoded as vectors, something that the AI can use to create fresh output.

Bias in generative AI
It’s worth noting when explaining generative AI that this process of teaching language models can expose the possibility of teaching AI models human biases. If there is bias in the original data, whether unconscious or otherwise, that bias will show up in the output later created.
In real-world terms, this has resulted in AI creating images or text that have inaccurate identities or references in them. As just one example, Google recently had to shut down its image-generation tools within Gemini because of historical inaccuracies showing up in its results.


Generative AI criticism
This is not the only form of criticism leveled at generative AI. Artists of various different disciplines have complained that deep-learning models are ‘stealing’ from human-made art. After all, as established above, generative AI can’t learn from anything.
The data used to ‘teach’ AI models is usually sourced from artistic work. Legally, this must be artwork that is open to the public, but that hasn’t stopped people from resenting the fact that AI images can other forms of output can be created instantaneously, seemingly off the backs of human artists.
How to generate AI images
If you want to try out AI image generation for yourself, there are plenty of tools to choose from. Many graphic design tools, including Adobe, Pixlr, and Canva have incorporated generative AI into their offerings, but some dedicated tools get the job done as well. These include:

Open AI’s DALL-E 2
Imagine
Midjourney
Stable Diffusion

Of course, tools like these aren’t free, with all requiring a paid subscription in order to use them. Midjourney is included in ChatGPT’s $20 monthly subscription, DALL-E with the ChatGPT Plus plan for $20 per user, Stable Diffusion’s Basic plan starting at $27 per month, and Imagine starting from as low as $3 a month.
Once you have access to your tool of choice, you can start straight away. Most generative AI tools appear much like a chatbot, with a dialog box where you can type in your prompt. Getting the best out of your tool requires some nifty prompt use but it’s worth noting that the model will quite literally learn as it gets to know you.
You can ask it to tweak images as you go, remaking the same image in different styles or altering specific areas of the image. Every tool is different in the level of changes you can make, but most offer some sort of tool where you can pick out individual elements that can be altered in different iterations.

Artificial Intelligence is one of the biggest technological waves that has hit the world of technology. According to The Enterprisers Project, AI will be offering about 133 million new jobs in the coming years. Dun & Bradstreet also stated that 40 percent of the respondent organizations are offering more jobs because of implementing artificial intelligence technology. With the growing demand for artificial intelligence, several individuals are considering artificial intelligence career option.  
Essential steps to boost your AI job prospects 
Step 1 
One of the essential requirements for an individual, who is looking for a career in the field of AI must good at numbers, i.e. they should polish their math skills. This will help in writing better code.  
Step 2 
One must strengthen their basics, on the following concepts that play an important part in this field.  

Linear algebra, probability, and statistics  

Mathematics is an integral part of AI. And if an individual wants to make a growing career in it, then they must have good knowledge of these basic concepts. They are vectors, matrices, statistics, and dimensionality. Probability concepts like Bayes Theorem. 

 Programming languages  

An individual should be learning programming languages because they play a prominent role in AI. One can enroll in an artificial intelligence certification to learn programming languages. There are several programming languages, an individual should well-versed at least one among the following: 

Python 
Java 
C 
R 


Data structures 

Enhance the way to solve problems involving data, create an analysis of data more accurately so one can build their own systems with minimum errors. Learning the various parts of programming languages will be fruitful in getting an understanding of data structures like stacks, linked lists, dictionaries, and many more. 

 Regression  

Regression is highly useful for predictions making in real-time applications. It is very crucial to have a good understanding of the concepts of regression.  

 Machine learning models 

Gain knowledge on the various ML concepts such as Decision trees, Random Forests, KNN, SVM, etc. Learn the ways to apply these by acquiring knowledge of the algorithms as they are quite useful in solving the problems. 
Step 3 
If an individual wants to enhance their artificial intelligence career, then they must learn more in-depth concepts, which are a complex part of AI. If one masters these concepts, then they can excel in their career.  

Neural networks 

It is a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system, which works by incorporating data through an algorithm it is developed on. The concepts of neural networks are the foundations for developing AI machines, it is better to have a deep understanding of its functionalities.  
There are different types of neural networks, which are used in various ways. A few of the common neural networks are: 

Perceptron 
Multilayer perceptrons 
Recurrent neural network 
Sequence to sequence model 
Convolutional neural network 
Feed forward neural network 
Modular neural network 
Radial basis functional neural network 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  


Domains of AI 

After gaining knowledge about the concepts and various types of neural networks, learn about the different applications of it, and start building one’s own applications. Every application in the AI field demands a different approach, and it is very tough to master all the fields of AI. Start with a specific domain, and then proceed further to the other domains. 

Big data 

Though it is not considered an essential aspect for gaining expertise in AI, understanding the basic concepts of big data will be quite helpful mainly to climb up the AI career ladder. 
Step 4 
Boost your expertise in the AI space by mastering the following aspects: 

Optimization techniques 

By learning optimization of algorithms is very useful to maximize or minimize the error function. These functions are based on the models internal learnable parameters that play a crucial role in the accuracy and efficiency of results. Learning this will be useful to implement optimization techniques and algorithms to model parameters that are useful to acquire optimum values and accuracy of such parameters.  

Publish research papers  

One of the best ways to establish one’s own credibility in the field of artificial intelligence is by going a step ahead by reading research papers in this field and publishing research papers. Begin your own research and understand the cases that are developing.  

Develop algorithms 

After completing the process of learning and research, begin working on building algorithms. You might bring a new revolution with the knowledge you have.  
Conclusion  
Undoubtedly, mastering AI concepts can be a difficult task. But one can achieve it with hard work, continuous practice, consistency and doing the right kind of Ai certification that ensures knowledge based on the current industry standards.

Write a short prompt, and an instant later, lucid paragraphs or realistic images appear on the screen (joined, possibly soon, by convincing video). Those first impressions can be electrifying, as though your computer had been touched by a thunder god’s spark.But there is another version of the Greek tale that paints Zeus less as a creator and more as a regurgitator. He eats his pregnant wife, Metis, who has done the labor of carrying Athena and has also forged her armor. Athena bursts forth only after Metis gives birth in Zeus’s mind. Generative AI systems can’t produce anything unless they, too, feed on what already exists. First, they atomize sentences, artwork and other content made by humans, and then they make connections among those digested bits. To learn how to generate text, for instance, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, which powers the free version of the company’s popular ChatGPT, was trained on some 300 billion words that were scraped from posts on Wikipedia and other websites.Several AI companies have argued that it is fair to train models this way without consulting or paying writers, photographers or other human creators. “AI development is an acceptable, transformative and socially beneficial use of existing content that is protected by fair use,” wrote Stability AI, which makes the popular image generator Stable Diffusion, in an October 2023 statement to the U.S. Copyright Office. A representative of the company told Scientific American that this remains Stability AI’s position.This fair use view is far from universal. Disagreement with it is the basis for disputes such as the New York Times’ lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, which alleges that the technology companies unlawfully used the newspapers’ stories to make chatbots. The issue also motivated computer scientist Ed Newton-Rex to quit his job at Stability AI last November. He has since launched a nonprofit organization called Fairly Trained, which certifies companies that only train their generative AI models on copyrighted material when they get a license to do so.“There is this divide emerging between companies that train, as I would say, fairly and those that don’t,” Newton-Rex says. But it can be difficult to discern how AI models were developed, he adds. For instance, within a given company, developers of an AI audio system might seek licenses, for instance, while their colleagues behind a text-generating large language model (LLM) might not.Fairly Trained aims to make those distinctions clearer. Models from nine companies have obtained its annual certification so far, including Bria, an Israel-based AI firm that recently received $24 million in Series A funding. (The company says its image-making models are trained only on pictures that are licensed from sources such as the stock photography giant Getty Images.) Scientific American spoke with Newton-Rex to understand what criteria Fairly Trained uses to certify Bria and other companies and models—and why, despite his criticisms, he remains excited by AI’s future.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]Last November you wrote on X that you had left your job at Stability AI because the company hadn't sought artists’ permission to use copyrighted material. As you left, were you thinking of making something like Fairly Trained?I left Stability without a plan. After I’d left, there was more attention on my resigning than I anticipated. When I was talking to people, including journalists, after leaving, one of the things I was keen to point out was that the approach that Stability and many other companies take—training on work without consent—is not the approach everyone takes.... One thing that people were asking me about was: “Okay, if you say there are companies and models training in a different way, training in a fairer way, on work they’d license, where are those companies?”Curated by Our EditorsAI Chatbot Brains Are Going Inside Robot Bodies. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?David BerrebyArtists Are Slipping Anti-AI ‘Poison’ into Their Art. Here’s How It WorksLauren LefferTougher AI Policies Could Protect Taylor Swift--And Everyone Else--From DeepfakesBrian ContrerasNew AI Circuitry That Mimics Human Brains Makes Models SmarterAnna MattsonI thought it would be relatively simple to put in place something that makes this more transparent. The easiest way of doing that, and the quickest way of doing that, would be to release a certification for companies who train on licensed data.How does the Fairly Trained certification work?Our first certification is what we’re calling the Licensed Model Certification. This can be acquired by any company that has trained a generative AI model without relying on copyrighted work that they haven’t gone and licensed or that they don’t have the rights to.How you get the certification is by a written submission. We have a list of questions that you answer that addresses, primarily, two things: One, what is the training data for your model? And secondly, what are your internal processes that make sure you’re actually adhering to only using these training data and that your employees are using these training data...? Once we feel confident that we understand your processes and that we understand what's going into this model and that you have the [necessary] licenses in place..., we give you the certification.A lot of this is trust-based right now. We don’t come in and dive into your systems.... But we think that’s an adequate mechanism, for now, to make a division between the kinds of companies taking what we think is the right approach and the companies who aren’t—because, honestly, the companies that don’t take this approach are pretty open about it.There are plenty of generative AI models out there, and some of them are made by the largest tech corporations in the world. You've certified nine of them—all from relatively small companies. Why is that?I intentionally went with smaller AI companies because, in general, for this kind of thing, they can move faster. You don’t have the kind of red tape that you have at some of the bigger companies.Having said that, of course, clearly, many of the largest generative AI companies out there today couldn’t get certified because they don’t live up to this standard.All of the first models you’ve certified involve music, audio or images. None generate text. Is there something inherent in the process of developing an AI chatbot that makes it more difficult to certify?I don’t know of any large language model right now that could get certified. No one has even come close to releasing a model where all of the text is licensed or public domain or under the right sort of open license. There is a school of thought among generative AI proponents that this is all fair use, and they should get as much data as they can. And that involves scraping the Internet and getting all the text they can.Unfortunately, in the past year and a half or couple of years, that has been the way that text generation and much generative AI has gone—partly because it’s been a race to develop the biggest and best models as quickly as possible, to get as much funding as possible, to become the big player in the space. And frankly, it’s because people feel they can get away with it.In 2022 you used an LLM to create a choral accompaniment for piano, which you’ve called the first piece of published classical music set to generative AI text. (It was performed by the ensemble Voces8 in a London concert that was broadcast last August.)

At the time everything was very experimental. No one really knew what was going on.I should say: I am a proponent of generative AI. I think generative AI is a great thing. I would probably use it for one of the things that I think it’s very useful for, which is as a creative spark, as inspiration.Describe to me the future of generative AI in which it can peacefully coexist alongside human artists and acts of creation.There’s a big part of the world that got very excited about creating material from scratch—all of the people using Midjourney on Twitter [now known as X] to, you know, reimagine some painting in the style of Grand Theft Auto. I think that’s all a waste of time.The exciting future is in this technology’s functionality as an assistive technology.... You actually can democratize creativity when you start to imagine the applications of this tech within the education system, if you can start to give people essentially personalized tutors—scalable, cheap, personalized tutors to teach them how to make things—especially in fields like music while music education has been on the decline in terms of funding in the U.K., where I come from.But I think this should be done in a way that respects the creators behind the training data. Training data are one of the key three resources you need to build these systems: you need training data, you need GPUs [graphics processing units, chips that excel at running multiple computations simultaneously], and you need AI talent. People are coming in and spending millions of dollars on the latter two. I don’t see how it can be justified trying to get for free the other key resource, without which these systems would not work.Rights & PermissionsBen Guarino is an associate technology editor at Scientific American.

But first... Three things you need to know today:• Discord will offer  rewards for gamers as CEO considers an IPO• Apple will  face questions from EU regulators over its treatment of Epic Games• The FCC is conducting a  “thorough” investigation into AT&T outageUsing AI to rank resumesFor years, companies have relied on automated screening systems to help hiring managers vet job candidates. That’s sparked numerous blog posts telling candidates how to use keyword tricks to get their cover letters and resumes past these application trackers. But in the wake of ChatGPT’s viral success, a new set of AI systems have been added into the hiring process — with potential risks for job seekers.As we reported for our investigation into artificial intelligence and hiring, there’s now a cottage industry of services using AI chatbots to interview and screen potential candidates. LinkedIn, arguably the most popular platform for job seekers and professionals, recently introduced a new AI chatbot that recruiters can prompt in order to “find that short list of qualified candidates — faster,” the company said in a blog post. Last April, HR tech company SeekOut launched a recruiting tool called SeekOut Assist, which uses generative AI to create a ranked list of candidates for a particular job description.These services might help companies sift through a glut of candidates, but there’s a significant concern: bias. Generative AI has a well-documented history of perpetuating stereotypes that are baked into the online data used to train it. Ask an AI image generator to show you a CEO, for example, and it may be more likely to assume it’s a man. Understanding how those biases play out in a high-stakes scenario like hiring, however, is a challenge. Job applicants don’t have the means to audit an employer’s hiring processes themselves and AI systems are typically black boxes, even to those who build them. To crack open the black box, we designed an experiment that could systematically test for potential embedded bias in one of these AI models in a hiring context. We decided to focus on names in resumes, which have proven time and again to carry weight in the hiring process. We also chose to focus on OpenAI’s GPT, the best-known generative AI tool and a technology that has already been used by services like SeekOut Assist. We replicated a simplified version of a hiring workflow by feeding a set of eight fictitious resumes into GPT – keeping all the qualifications equal, and only changing the fictitious names topping the resumes. Then we asked the tool to tell us who the best candidate was for a particular job listing. We asked GPT to evaluate these would-be candidates against four real job listings from Fortune 500 companies: an HR business partner, a senior software engineer, a retail manager and a financial analyst.We did this 1,000 times each for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, using 800 demographically-distinct names: 100 names each for males and females that are associated with being either Black, White, Hispanic or Asian. Each fictitious resume representing a specific demographic had an equal chance of being ranked as the top candidate each time we asked GPT for the best person for a particular job.Crucially, we had to ensure that each name was more likely than not to map onto a specific intersection of race and gender. Borrowing methods from well-established social science research, we computed the 100 most popular first names and 20 most distinct last names unique to each demographic from North Carolina voter registrations and the US decennial census, respectively. From there, the first and last names were randomly paired up for each group, resulting in 800 demographically-distinct names.Researchers studying discrimination and bias frequently use racially distinctive names to signal race or ethnicity, according to Evan Rose, one of the authors of a National Bureau of Economic Research study on hiring discrimination, which we drew inspiration from. This method has for years found consistent evidence of racial discrimination in the US labor and housing markets, Rose told us. “That’s why names are really useful as a signal,” he said.In our own experiment, we found clear signs of name-based discrimination. When asked to rank the resumes 1,000 times, GPT 3.5 favored names from some demographics more often than others, to an extent that would fail benchmarks used to assess job discrimination against protected groups. We found at least one adversely impacted demographic group for every job listing we tested, except for retail workers ranked by GPT-4.OpenAI, for its part, said the results of using GPT out-of-the-box may not be reflective of how its customers use the tools. Businesses using the technology have the option to fine-tune the AI model’s responses further, for example. AI companies have generally tried to find ways to reduce bias in their systems, and OpenAI is no different. But the problem persists — and in the meantime, generative AI only continues to find its way into more and more vital gatekeeping services. — Davey Alba and Leon YinThe big storyMicrosoft has created a technologically sophisticated censorship system in China, centered on an expanding blacklist of thousands of websites, words and phrases, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees.One to watchBloomberg News goes under the hood of Project Titan to reveal what the company was planning and explain why it ultimately fell apart.BloombergGet fully chargedA Salesforce exec says  diversity is key to building AI models.Apple sank about  $1 billion a year into a car it never built.

AI Drives Work on Pulmonary Fibrosis Drug from Target Discovery to Phase II






March 11, 2024

Some say that AI’s potential in drug development is overstated. Others say that it is, if anything, understated. Who is right? Only time will tell. In the meantime, both sides—and the undecided—eagerly await news of AI successes and failures. For those who suspect that AI’s potential is understated, a piece of news has just appeared that will no doubt be taken as confirmation, however partial or contingent it may seem to AI’s doubters.
The news is the appearance of a paper in Nature Biotechnology describing how AI not only enabled the discovery of an antifibrotic target, but also generated a small molecule inhibitor of the target. The inhibitor’s potential was then confirmed in multiple in vivo studies and in a Phase I trial.




The paper, titled “A small-molecule TNIK inhibitor targets fibrosis in preclinical and clinical models,” describes how scientists at Insilico Medicine and their collaborators leveraged predictive AI technology to bring a drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) to the threshold of Phase II development.
“We identify TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) as an antifibrotic target,” the article’s authors wrote. “[We] generated INS018_055, a small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, which exhibits desirable drug-like properties and antifibrotic activity across different organs in vivo through oral, inhaled, or topical administration.”
“This work,” the scientists reported, “was completed in roughly 18 months from target discovery to preclinical candidate nomination and demonstrates the capabilities of our generative AI-driven drug-discovery pipeline.”







Besides disclosing raw experimental data, the scientists described how they first trained PandaOmics, the target identification engine of Insilico’s AI platform Pharma.AI, on a collection of omics and clinical datasets related to tissue fibrosis. PandaOmics proposed a potential target list using deep feature synthesis, causality inference, and de novo pathway reconstruction. After that, the natural language processing models of PandaOmics analyzed millions of text files, including patents, publications, grants, and clinical trial databases to further assess the novelty and disease association.
After selecting TNIK as a primary target, the scientists utilized Chemistry42, Insilico Medicine’s generative chemistry engine, to generate novel molecular structures using a structure-based drug design workflow. Chemistry42 combines over 40 generative chemistry algorithms and over 500 pretrained reward models for de novo compound generation, and it can optimize both generation and virtual screening based on expert human feedback.
After multiple iterative screens were run, one promising hit candidate demonstrated activity with nanomolar IC50 values. The scientists further optimized the compound to increase solubility, promote a good ADME safety profile, and mitigate unwanted toxicity while retaining the compound’s affinity for TNIK. Ultimately, this work produced the lead molecule INS018_055, with less than 80 molecules synthesized and tested.
In subsequent preclinical studies, INS018_055 demonstrated significant efficacy in vitro and in vivo studies for IPF and showed promising results in pharmacokinetic and safety studies across multiple cell lines and multiple species. Furthermore, INS018_055 showed panfibrotic inhibitory function, attenuating skin and kidney fibrosis in two additional animal models. Based on these studies, INS018_055 achieved preclinical candidate nomination in February 2021.
“From my perspective, the progress of INS018_055 has significant implications for the drug discovery field,” said Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine. “It not only serves as a proof-of-concept for Pharma.AI … but sets a precedent for the potential of generative AI to accelerate drug discovery. Using the publication as a guide, one can extrapolate how generative AI drug discovery tools may streamline early discovery efforts.”




At present, two Phase IIa clinical trials of INS018_055 for the treatment of IPF are being conducted in parallel in the United States and China. The studies are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the lead drug. In addition, the trials will assess the preliminary efficacy of INS018_055 on lung function in IPF patients. As this drug continues to advance, it drives hope for the roughly five million people worldwide suffering from this deadly disease.
Comments about the paper from Bud Mishra, PhD, professor of computer science at New York University, emphasized how the study’s different parts—target selection and drug design—employed different kinds of AI technology: “The first part uses heuristics that are based on the scientific experiences accumulated in the past (the target must be novel, easy to understand in terms of interactions with known pathways, and follow the approaches used by others in guiding drug discovery and clinical trials in the past) and hence ideal for NLP using LLMs. The second part uses randomized heuristics to search and optimize over complex combinatorial spaces using DNNs, capable of dealing with naturally occurring ‘easy instances of hard problems.’”
“Speculatively,” he continued, “the first part will become more difficult over time (hallucination vs. true novelty) and the second part, simpler, as Moore’s law will continue to improve the computational power exponentially.”

Generative AI, as many of you will already know, is a technology that can create new content, like text, imagery, audio, and more, using natural language prompts. It uses data to build models (Large Language Models) that recognise patterns in the data to produce new original content.
While we’re still at the early stages in the generative AI evolution, we wanted to understand how organisations in Ireland are currently positioned in order to share a nationwide cross-industry assessment of readiness for AI transformation,.
Produced by Trinity College Dublin’s Business School, on behalf of Microsoft Ireland, the report involved a survey of 400 senior managers across both the public and private sectors in Ireland. It assesses the uptake, sentiment, and future trends of generative AI at this early stage of its evolution.
Key Insights:
Our Microsoft Ireland report reveals that 49% of organisations are already using generative AI in some form at this early stage of availability.
47% of organisations believe the technology will enhance productivity, contrasting with only 17% holding opposing views.
Those with a generative AI-first policy (company-wide approach) feel there are more benefits, such as productivity increases, from generative AI (71%) compared to firms that prohibit generative AI use.
A shadow generative AI culture is emerging – 27% of leaders are using publicly available or free generative AI in their role and 25% believe their employees are doing the same – while 8% are aware employees use free generative AI software in direct contravention of their organisation’s policy.
A key takeaway by Trinity College Dublin’s Business School suggests Ireland is at a crossroads, and first mover advantage is now crucial to capitalise on its position as a global technology hub and drive competitiveness through AI innovation.
Irish organisations have a unique opportunity to tap into our status as a multinational hub and become leaders in generative AI to deliver local economic growth.
Growing adoption
Today’s publication points to rising adoption rates of generative AI solutions within Irish workplaces – with 49% highlighting generative AI being used in some form within their organisation.
The survey showed that the sectors with the highest planned adoption rates are technology, science, and media, while the agriculture, transport, and utilities sectors appear to be further behind in their generative AI adoption journey.
Importantly, the research also indicates that indigenous Irish organisations might be falling behind multinational organisations based in Ireland, who use 30% more generative AI. This is only the start, however, there’s still time to be early adopters and harness the innovative potential of AI.
Shadow AI workplace culture emerging
Interestingly, the report points to an emerging phenomenon, a shadow AI Culture, that leaders need to be cognisant of. A quarter of leaders say they are aware that some employees within their organisations are using publicly available generative AI tools, and 27% admit to doing so themselves, rather than using enterprise-grade solutions with in-built content safety controls and data protection.  Additionally, 8% of respondents highlighted awareness of employees knowingly using generative AI software in contravention to the organisation’s policy. This trend will only continue to grow, with employees seeking workarounds and using publicly available tools that are not aligned to company policy and that don’t have privacy, security, and data protection controls.
Potential for Ireland to leverage generative AI innovation and advance its position as a digital leader in Europe
Elsewhere, the report concludes that organisations that have been first movers in the space of generative AI and use a generative AI-first policy see many more benefits and productivity increases (71%) compared to firms that prohibit generative AI (42%). These firms also see higher productivity and innovation potential in their employees, in addition to providing higher training, internal resources, and finances to support the transition.
The report identifies that a proactive approach underscores the critical importance of embracing transformative innovation as a means to surpass competitors, reach sustainability goals, explore untapped markets, and reshape industry norms. This is believed to be crucial for Ireland to leverage AI innovation and become a leading digital economy in Europe and beyond.
Beyond the Insights: To deliver sustainable value from generative AI investments, organisations in Ireland should consider the following recommendations:
Address the skills gap: A strategic approach to generative AI requires not only technology, data, and expertise, but also calls for business domain knowledge and change management skills. The report highlights that more education and support is required for organisations, especially SMEs.
Transformative versus incremental innovation: Organisations can innovate and transform using generative AI — but they will only invest if AI moves the needle on metrics that matter in the short-term. However, a visionary approach, and a deeper assessment of the benefits of AI to transform an organisation and shape their digital destiny is required, particularly in the public sector which is under pressure to provide higher quality public services to citizens.
Leverage platforms and providers that take responsibility and security seriously: Train and educate decision-makers around the issues of data privacy and legal issues related to the use of generative AI. Our research indicates this to be an area of concern for many business leaders. Leverage platforms that take responsibility for data storage and with enterprise-grade security to prepare for possible future regulations, customer data security, and allay fears of business leaders.

In a refrain that feels almost entirely too familiar by now: Generative AI is repeating the biases of its makers.A new investigation from Bloomberg found that OpenAI's generative AI technology, specifically GPT 3.5, displayed preferences for certain racial in questions about hiring. The implication is that recruiting and human resources professionals who are increasingly incorporating generative AI based tools in their automatic hiring workflows — like LinkedIn's new Gen AI assistant for example — may be promulgating racism. Again, sounds familiar. The publication used a common and fairly simple experiment of feeding fictitious names and resumes into AI recruiting softwares to see just how quickly the system displayed racial bias. Studies like these have been used for years to spot both human and algorithmic bias among professionals and recruiters.

""Reporters used voter and census data to derive names that are demographically distinct — meaning they are associated with Americans of a particular race or ethnicity at least 90 percent of the time — and randomly assigned them to equally-qualified resumes,"" the investigation explains. ""When asked to rank those resumes 1,000 times, GPT 3.5 — the most broadly-used version of the model — favored names from some demographics more often than others, to an extent that would fail benchmarks used to assess job discrimination against protected groups.""

The experiment categorized names into four categories (White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian) and two gender categories (male and female), and submitted them for four different job openings. ChatGPT consistently placed ""female names"" into roles historically aligned with higher numbers of women employees, such as HR roles, and chose Black women candidates 36 performance less frequently for technical roles like software engineer.ChatGPT also organized equally ranked resumes unequally across the jobs, skewing rankings depending on gender and race. In a statement to Bloomberg, OpenAI said this doesn't reflect how most clients incorporate their software in practice, noting that many businesses fine tune responses to mitigate bias. Bloomberg's investigation also consulted 33 AI researchers, recruiters, computer scientists, lawyers, and other experts to provide context for the results.

The report isn't revolutionary among the years of work by advocates and researchers who warn against the ethical debt of AI reliance, but it's a powerful reminder of the dangers of widespread generative AI adoption without due attention. As just a few major players dominate the market, and thus the software and data building our smart assistants and algorithms, the pathways for diversity narrow. As Mashable's Cecily Mauran reported in an examination of the internet's AI monolith, incestuous AI development (or building models that are no longer trained on human input but other AI models) leads to a decline in quality, reliability, and, most importantly, diversity. And, as watchdogs like AI Now argue, ""humans in the loop"" might not be able to help.

Business leaders looking to harness generative AI – the technology made famous by ChatGPT – are facing some major strategic questions. What are the best ways to use generative AI within the organization? Where can the technology add the most value? And how can you find a delicate balance between human expertise and machine intelligence?


Online personal styling service Stitch Fix is a business that all organizations can learn from. The company was built on data and AI from the ground up, allowing it to provide a personalized styling service and ship clothes directly to customers’ doors – clothes that they know clients will love based on their style preferences and previous choices. But what makes Stitch Fix really special is its ability to strike that perfect balance between human knowledge and machine capabilities. Here’s how Stitch Fix is harnessing generative AI to streamline processes and provide a better service to customers.

A Data Goldmine
Stitch Fix is sitting on a goldmine of nearly 4.5 billion text data points that clients have shared with the company. This data may include a client's style preferences or feedback on how an item fits them, for instance. It's valuable data for understanding each customer’s style, but it’s often in the form of freeform text – making it tricky data to work with. Generative AI helps Stitch Fix leverage this complex, messy data because generative AI excels at quickly making sense of and summarizing vast amounts of text data.

PROMOTED
Stitch Fix uses large language models from OpenAI, combined with their own deep learning recommendation algorithms, to interpret the feedback that clients share and then use that information to inform future recommendations. In other words, generative AI translates customer feedback into a format that Stitch Fix recommendation algorithms can understand more easily.

Let’s explore some specific use cases in a little more detail.

Creating Clothing Recommendations
One of the ways Stitch Fix uses generative AI is to surface a selection of clothing items based on feedback the client has shared about their style preferences and fit. These recommendations are shared with a human stylist, who will then curate the final pieces for the individual client.

Supporting Text Generation
Generative AI isn’t just about interpreting text. It can also create text (and images, and video, and more). Stitch Fix uses this ability to produce engaging ad copy that communicates the benefits of signing up for Stitch Fix’s service. All copy generated by AI is quality checked by human copywriters (with a 77 percent pass rate at the time of writing).
Generative AI also helps Stitch Fix create informative product descriptions that give clients details about an item’s features, specifications, and benefits. Writing descriptions for thousands of items is, as you can imagine, a time-consuming task. But having trained OpenAI’s GPT-3 on previous product descriptions (written by copywriters), plus feedback from clients, the model can now quickly create descriptions for copywriters and merchandisers to review. Stitch Fix says the model can generate 10,000 product descriptions every 30 minutes, with each description only needing a quick one-minute review by an expert before approval.
Automatically Styling Outfits
Another interesting use is Stitch Fix’s Outfit Creation Model (OCM), which uses generative AI to generate millions of new outfit combinations per day. OCM, which was trained on millions of outfits created by stylists, picks items from Stitch Fix’s current inventory, as well as from customers’ previous purchases, to compile personalized outfit suggestions for clients. This shows clients how to style items they might be interested in purchasing (or already own) with other items available from Stitch Fix. This is done through personalized emails and ads and through the customer’s personalized shopping feed.
Key Takeaways
In short, Stitch Fix uses generative AI to better understand what customers want – and, importantly, to strike a balance between automation and human skills. By letting AI systems automate the time-consuming, repetitive tasks, Stitch Fix frees up human experts to focus on their uniquely human capabilities like creativity, judgment, and building awesome relationships with clients. This is why I think all organizations can learn from Stitch Fix's approach.

Hiring AI-skilled talent is a priority for nearly four in five employers in the region, but 75% are struggling to find the AI talent they need.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the workforce in Asia-Pacific (APAC)—from how organisations operate to how work gets done. Despite the varying levels of AI adoption across countries in the region, the technology will be a game-changer over the next five years.AI taps into the power of computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. As smart algorithms and automation sweep through industries, the APAC employment landscape is evolving, with humans and machines collaborating like never before. AI is pushing both employers and workers to adapt for a more dynamic workforce and greater productivity.

To better understand emerging AI usage trends and where workplaces might be headed, Amazon Web Services (AWS) commissioned global research firm, Access Partnership, to conduct an Asia-Pacific AI skills survey. Almost 15,000 employees and nearly 5,000 employers were surveyed across Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand.The study, titled Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Asia-Pacific Workforce for Jobs of the Future, shows that AI transformation is happening at a rapid pace, with the majority of APAC employers expecting to use AI solutions and tools in their organisations by 2028.Here are the five key takeaways:1.  AI skills could boost pay and accelerate career growth for workers







With considerable potential to improve operational efficiency, worker productivity, and decision-making, surveyed employers in APAC indicated that they are willing to pay higher salaries to workers with AI skills and expertise beyond the IT department. While employers are willing to pay 44% more for IT workers with AI skills on average across the nine APAC countries, they would also pay a salary premium to skilled workers in research and development (41%), sales and marketing (39%), business operations (39%), finance (37%), legal (33%), and human resources (33%).On top of significant salary bumps, four in five (83%) surveyed APAC workers indicated an interest in developing AI skills to accelerate their careers, and the study found that this interest transcends generations. While 87% of Generation Z, 88% of millennial, and 79% of Generation X workers want to get equipped with AI skills, 68% of baby boomers—a demographic usually contemplating retirement—say they would enroll in an AI upskilling course if employers offered it. Overall, 93% of workers anticipate that having AI skills would have a positive impact on their careers, including increased efficiency, higher job satisfaction, and faster career progression.2.  The productivity payoff from an AI-skilled workforce could be immense







The productivity payoff refers to the tangible benefits the APAC region stands to gain from the full adoption and integration of AI tools by workers.Surveyed employers expect their organisation’s productivity to increase by 51% as AI technology automates repetitive tasks (64%), improves workflow and outcomes (60%), and enhances communication (59%). Workers believe AI could raise their productivity by as much as 50%.3. Most organisations will be AI-enabled by 2028 and expect to benefit from it







Over the next five years, the speed of AI transformation across APAC will be remarkable, with 92% of employers envisioning their organisations to be AI-driven by 2028. While most employers (91%) believe their IT departments will be the biggest beneficiary, they also expect business operations (89%), finance (88%), research and development (88%), sales and marketing (87%), legal (82%), and human resources (81%) to benefit too.Delving into key industries in the region, the research shows the IT and Telecommunications sector is leading the charge on AI adoption, with 97% expecting to use AI tools by 2028, followed closely by the Banking & Financial Services industry (95%), and the Public Sector (91%).4.  Generative AI tools will become commonplace at work over the next five years







Generative AI—a type of AI that can create new content and ideas quickly, including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and more—has captured the attention of the general public in the past year, and will transform how people work. So, it’s not surprising that nine in 10 APAC employers (93%) and workers (90%) expect to use generative AI tools on the job within the next five years. 67% of employers highlighted increasing innovation and creativity as the top benefit of generative AI, followed by automating repetitive tasks (61%), improving outcomes (58%), and supporting learning (56%).  5.  Bridging the AI skills gap through training is mission-critical







Hiring talent with AI skills and expertise is a priority for 79% of surveyed APAC employers, of which 75% can’t find the AI talent they need. The research also uncovered a training awareness gap, whereby 79% of employers indicated that they don’t know how to implement an AI workforce training program.On the workers’ side, 71% don’t know what AI skills they need, 74% lack knowledge about available training programs, and 74% aren’t sure about the relevant career paths where AI skills would be useful.While employers consider technical skills essential for using AI, they also rank creative thinking (57%), critical thinking (53%), and ethics (36%) as important soft skills for working with AI. Ethics and risk management are vital for guarding against potential AI risks, including algorithmic bias, lack of accountability, compliance challenges, and the need for transparency and safety measures.Building an AI-ready workforce is everyone’s responsibility for future prosperity across APACOverall, this important research on AI and the future of work reveals a looming AI skills gap across APAC that must be bridged so the region is well-positioned to unlock the full benefits of AI. This calls for greater collaboration between governments, industries, and educators to help employers implement AI training programs and guide workers in matching their AI skillsets to the right roles to harness their newly acquired AI capabilities, and make the most of this evolving technology.In November 2023, Amazon launched the ‘AI Ready’ initiative that complements AWS’s commitment to provide free cloud computing skills training to 29 million individuals globally by 2025. Through ‘AI Ready,’ we now offer a suite of free AI and generative AI training courses, aligned to both technical and non-technical roles, so that anyone can build AI skills.AWS also announced new generative AI innovations at AWS re:Invent 2023, including Amazon Q—a new generative AI assistant designed for work that can be tailored to businesses. This highlights the need for workers to be equipped with AI skills, in order to unleash the full potential of generative AI innovations.AWS is proud to have trained more than 8.3 million people across Asia-Pacific and Japan with cloud skills since 2017. With the rapid adoption of cloud-enabled technologies like generative AI, more work needs to be done to build an AI-skilled workforce to unleash a culture of innovation and drive productivity in this dynamic region of the world.Learn more about the Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Asia-Pacific Workforce for Jobs of the Future report.
