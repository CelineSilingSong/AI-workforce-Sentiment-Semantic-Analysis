Organizations need to consider many factors when building or enhancing an artificial intelligence infrastructure to support AI applications and workloads .







These are not trivial issues. A company's ultimate success with AI will likely depend on how suitable its environment is for such powerful applications. While the cloud is emerging as a major resource for data-intensive AI workloads, enterprises still rely on their on-premises IT environments for these projects.

Big data storage: Infrastructure requirements for AI
One of the biggest considerations is AI data storage, specifically the ability to scale storage as the volume of data grows. As organizations prepare enterprise AI strategies and build the necessary infrastructure, storage must be a top priority. That includes ensuring the proper storage capacity, IOPS and reliability to deal with the massive data amounts required for effective AI.
Figuring out what kind of storage an organization needs depends on many factors, including the level of AI an organization plans to use and whether it needs to make real-time decisions.
For example, for advanced, high-value neural network ecosystems, traditional network-attached storage architectures might present scaling issues with I/O and latency. Similarly, a financial services company that uses enterprise AI systems for real-time trading decisions may need fast all-flash storage technology.
Many companies are already building big data and analytics environments designed to support enormous data volumes, and these will likely be suitable for many types of AI applications.
Another factor is the nature of the source data. AI applications depend on source data, so an organization needs to know where the source data resides and how AI applications will use it. For instance, will applications be analyzing sensor data in real time, or will they use post-processing?
You also need to factor in how much AI data applications will generate. AI applications make better decisions as they're exposed to more data. As databases grow over time, companies need to monitor capacity and plan for expansion as needed.



The amount of data collection and type of AI deployed should motivate big data storage architecture decisions.







AI networking infrastructure
Networking is another key component of an artificial intelligence infrastructure. To provide the high efficiency at scale required to support AI and machine learning models, organizations will likely need to upgrade their networks.
Deep learning algorithms are highly dependent on communications, and enterprise networks will need to keep stride with demand as AI efforts expand. That's why scalability must be a high priority, and that will require high-bandwidth, low-latency and creative architectures.
Companies should automate wherever possible. For example, they should deploy automated infrastructure management tools in their data centers.
Network infrastructure providers, meanwhile, are looking to do the same. Software-defined networks are being combined with machine learning to create intent-based networks that can anticipate network demands or security threats and react in real time.








Artificial intelligence workloads
Also critical for an artificial intelligence infrastructure is having sufficient compute resources, including CPUs and GPUs.
A CPU-based environment can handle basic AI workloads, but deep learning involves multiple large data sets and deploying scalable neural network algorithms. For that, CPU-based computing might not be sufficient.



Creating an AI-optimized hardware stack starts with analyzing CPU and GPU needs.





To provide the necessary compute capabilities, companies must turn to GPUs. Deploying GPUs enables organizations to optimize their data center infrastructure and gain power efficiency.
Numerous companies create AI-focused GPUs and CPUs, giving enterprises options when buying AI hardware. Nvidia, for example, is a leading creator of AI-focused GPUs, while Intel sells chips explicitly made for AI work, including inferencing and natural language processing (NLP).
Meanwhile, more recently established companies, including Graphcore, Cerebras and Ampere Computing, have created chips for advanced AI workloads.


Preparing AI data
Organizations have much to consider. Not only do they have to choose where they will store data, how they will move it across networks and how they will process it, but they also have to choose how they will prepare the data for use in AI applications.
One of the critical steps for successful enterprise AI is data cleansing. Also called data scrubbing, it's the process of updating or removing data from a database that is inaccurate, incomplete, improperly formatted or duplicated.
Any company, but particularly those in data-driven sectors, should consider deploying automated data cleansing tools to assess data for errors using rules or algorithms. Data quality is especially critical with AI. If the data feeding AI systems is inaccurate or out of date, the output and any related business decisions will also be inaccurate.


AI data management and governance
Another important factor is data access. Does the organization have the proper mechanisms in place to deliver data in a secure and efficient manner to the users who need it?



Creating an ethical AI infrastructure will aid in a company's fight against bias, reduce risk and ensure accountability.





As such, part of the data management strategy needs to ensure that users -- machines and people -- have easy and fast access to data. It should be accessible from a variety of endpoints, including mobile devices via wireless networks.
Access also raises a number of privacy and security issues, so data access controls are important. Companies need to look at technologies such as identity and access management and data encryption tools as part of their data management and governance strategies.


AIoT
No discussion of artificial intelligence infrastructure would be complete without mentioning its intersection with IoT. The artificial intelligence IoT (AIoT) involves gathering and analyzing data from countless devices, products, sensors, assets, locations, vehicles, etc., using IoT, AI and machine learning to optimize data management and analytics. AIoT is crucial to gaining insights from all the information coming in from connected things.
Business data platform Statista forecasted there will be more than 10 billion connected IoT devices worldwide in 2021. Furthermore, Statista expects that number to grow to more than 25 billion devices by 2030.
Imagine the staggering amount of data generated by connected objects, and it will be up to companies and their AI tools to integrate, manage and secure all of this information.
From an artificial intelligence infrastructure standpoint, companies need to look at their networks, data storage, data analytics and security platforms to make sure they can effectively handle the growth of their IoT ecosystems. That includes data generated by their own devices, as well as those of their supply chain partners.


AI training
Last but certainly not least: Training and skills development are vital for any IT endeavor and especially enterprise AI initiatives. Companies will need data analysts, data scientists, developers, cybersecurity experts, network engineers and IT professionals with a variety of skills to build and maintain their infrastructure to support AI and to use artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning, NLP and deep learning, on an ongoing basis.
They will also need people who are capable of managing the various aspects of infrastructure development and who are well versed in the business goals of the organization. Putting together a strong team is an essential part of any artificial intelligence infrastructure development effort.

Tweet Share Post Email Print LinkFont Size:A A A Federal agencies increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) tools to do their work and carry out their missions. Nearly half the federal agencies surveyed for a recent report commissioned by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) employ or have experimented with AI tools. The agencies used AI tools across an array of governance tasks, including adjudication, enforcement, data collection and analysis, internal management, and public communications.Agencies’ interest in AI tools is not surprising. These tools promise improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of certain government functions, as they yield improvements in sectors ranging from regulatory enforcement to benefits adjudication. But AI tools also present potential problems for governance. If used extensively and without care, AI tools could hollow out agencies’ human expertise. Agency personnel might grow too trusting of AI tools or defer too readily to the tools’ determinations in fields that call for the exercise of human discretion. Artificial intelligence tools might also increase opacity in public decision-making when agencies rely on tools they cannot adequately explain. And AI tools might sometimes exacerbate human biases, whether because of their designs or the data on which the tools rely. Moreover, AI tools pose potential problems for agencies when it comes to considerations such as privacy, data security, developing technical capacity, procurement, data usage, oversight, and accountability.For scholars and students of AI, these are not new concerns. They have been discussed and debated for years. Despite the consideration they have received, however, problems persist. For instance, a 2018 study by researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru measured the accuracy of three commercial gender classification algorithms. Buolamwini and Gebru found that all three algorithms misclassified lighter-skinned males less than 1 percent of the time but misclassified darker-skinned females between 21 percent and 35 percent of the time. The stark discrepancy revealed by Buolamwini and Gebru’s research illustrates the need for care in deploying AI tools, particularly when federal agencies’ uses of such tools are rapidly expanding.For that reason, late last year ACUS convened a committee to identify issues agencies ought to consider when adopting, procuring, or modifying AI tools and when developing procedures for their use and regular monitoring. The committee included dozens of ACUS members, along with experts from academia and the private sector with relevant knowledge in different aspects of agency use of AI. The committee drew on two ACUS commissioned reports to inform the committee’s research: one report by law professors Daniel Ho, David Freeman Engstrom, Catherine Sharkey, and Supreme Court of California Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and the other report by University of Pennsylvania law professor Cary Coglianese. The committee convened four times, worked through several draft statements, and ultimately produced a ten-page statement that ACUS adopted during its December plenary session. The ACUS statement provides a series of factors for agencies to consult when making decisions about AI tools. ACUS divided the statement into nine subsections: transparency, harmful bias, technical capacity, obtaining AI systems, data, privacy, security, decisional authority, and oversight. Each section covers a different set of issues agencies will confront in many decisions about AI tools. Within each of the nine subsections, the statement identifies specific risks, and suggests strategies for mitigating them.Recognizing the various types of AI tools and the wide array of uses, the statement stops short of instructing agencies about specific tools or methods to employ in addressing particular problems. It respects that agencies might reasonably emphasize different considerations in making decisions about whether or how to use AI tools. Agencies may, for example, have different priorities and constraints, or need to employ the technologies for different purposes.For instance, in the section on decisional authority, ACUS does not prescribe a definitive test for ascertaining when an agency has delegated too much decision-making responsibility to an AI tool. Instead, it highlights the real risks that come with relying on an AI tool to make certain decisions. Those risks include the possibility that human operators will devolve too much responsibility to, or place too much trust in, the digital tools. The public in some instances might react negatively to having certain decisions made by AI tools instead of humans. The ACUS statement is clear that agencies ought to consider these risks when making decisions about what AI tools to deploy and how to deploy them, but it is silent about how agencies ought to balance those risks against countervailing considerations such as efficiency and predictability in decision-making. The “right” way to manage those tradeoffs is, ultimately, a question of policy, to be decided on an agency-by-agency basis. ACUS’s goal in adopting its statement is simply to make it more likely that agencies will resolve the policy questions related to their use of artificial intelligence with a more comprehensive understanding of the many different values at stake in decisions about AI tools.There will be those who wish the statement provided more precise and tailored guidance about the right and wrong ways to use specific AI tools or even the circumstances in which they should be deployed. But the committee made a conscious choice to avoid those questions. Agencies’ uses of AI tools are developing rapidly, as are the tools themselves. Recommendations aimed at specific practices or existing technologies would have a comparatively short shelf life. By contrast, ACUS grounded its statement in familiar administrative law principles—such as transparency, accountability, and reason-giving—and familiar objectives of agency administration—such as ensuring privacy and security and building institutional capacity. ACUS intends the statement to remain relevant and useful for as long as those key principles and objectives do.If agencies are attentive to the considerations laid out in the statement, they will make better and more informed decisions about AI tools, be more alert to the many considerations and values at stake in selecting, obtaining, and deploying AI tools, and be better equipped to monitor and understand the consequences of deploying AI tools in different environments. The statement should help agencies use artificial intelligence tools in ways that maximize their potential benefits and reduce the attendant risks. Given the growing ubiquity of AI in federal agencies, that is an outcome everyone should hope for. Mark Thomson is a deputy research director at the Administrative Conference of the United States.

DURHAM, N.C. --  An artificial intelligence tool being developed by Duke scientists can be added to the standard toilet to help analyze patients’ stool and give gastroenterologists the information they need to provide appropriate treatment for chronic issues such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
The work is being done by Duke University’s Center for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Infectious Disease (WaSH-AID), and was presented Saturday at the virtual conference Digestive Disease Week 2021.
“Typically, gastroenterologists have to rely on patient self-reported information about their stool to help determine the cause of their gastrointestinal health issues, which can be very unreliable,” said Deborah Fisher, MD, associate professor of medicine at Duke University and one of the lead authors on the study.
“Patients often can’t remember what their stool looks like or how often they have a bowel movement, which is part of the standard monitoring process,” Fisher said. “The Smart Toilet technology will allow us to gather the long-term information needed to make a more accurate and timely diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal problems.” 
For example, a flare of IBD could be diagnosed using Smart Toilet and response to a drug or diet treatment could be monitored. If the technology were installed in bathrooms in a long term care facility, initial diagnosis of acute conditions could be improved.
The technology can be retrofitted within the pipes of an existing toilet. Once a person has a bowel movement and flushes, the toilet will take an image of the stool within the pipes. The data collected over time will provide a gastroenterologist a better understanding of a patient’s stool form (i.e., loose, normal or constipated) and the presence of blood, allowing them to diagnose the patient and provide the right treatment for their condition.
To develop the artificial intelligence image analysis tool for the Smart Toilet, researchers analyzed 3,328 unique stool images found online or provided by research participants. All images  were reviewed and annotated by gastroenterologists according to the Bristol Stool Scale, a common clinical tool for classifying stool. Using a convolutional neural network, a type of deep learning algorithm that can analyze images, researchers found that the algorithm accurately classified the stool form 85 percent of the time and gross blood detection was accurate in 76 percent of the images.
“We are optimistic about patient willingness to use this technology because it’s something that can be installed in their toilet’s pipes and doesn’t require the patient to do anything other than flush,” said Sonia Grego, PhD, founding director of the Duke Smart Toilet Lab and a lead researcher on the study. “This could be especially useful for patients who may not be able to report their conditions, such as those who live in a long-term care facility.”
The prototype has promising feasibility, but it is not yet available to the public. Researchers are developing additional features of the technology to include stool specimen sampling for biochemical marker analysis that will provide highly specific disease data to meet the needs of patients and gastroenterologists.

It’s an order of magnitude larger than the largest previous language models. GPT-3 was trained with almost all available data from the Internet, and showed amazing performance in various NLP (natural language processing) tasks, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, even surpassing state-of-the-art models.One of the most powerful features of GPT-3 is that it can perform new tasks (tasks it has never been trained on) sometimes at state-of-the-art levels, only by showing it a few examples of the task.

A storm cell near Oklahoma City was likely to turn into a thunderstorm around the time Flight 1405 took off, and the airspace north of Amarillo would be closed for military exercises. Better to reroute, the young colleague said, suggesting an alternative that Ward admitted was safer and more efficient. The entire conversation lasted just seconds and passed without a word being spoken: a red box lit up on Ward’s computer screen when the colleague, an artificial intelligence program he has affectionately nicknamed Algo, had an idea. “This is the smartest person in the room,” says Ward, a solidly built man with the corner desk who has been a flight dispatcher for 21 years, responsible for planning flight routes and submitting them to air traffic control for approval. He gestures to the program running silently on his computer. “It’s smarter than me.”Read more: Airlines’ Emissions Halved During the Pandemic. Can the Industry Preserve Some of Those Gains?Algo’s formal name is Flyways, and it’s the product of a Silicon Valley company called Airspace Intelligence, which is hoping to make air travel more efficient and safer as airlines try to recover from a year in which the pandemic ravaged the travel industry. The idea of AI setting paths for jets streaking through the skies at hundreds of miles per hour might sound terrifying, but Flyways does not dictate—it advises, and humans always have the final say. This is a job Ward used to do alone by flipping through tabs on his computer screen and guessing where a flight would be when it encountered rough weather or other conditions. Now he has Algo, who dispenses advice, never gets tired, doesn’t get sick and is always in the office. Its machine learning enables Flyways to spot weather threats and other potential problems before humans are aware of them, which helps dispatchers and pilots avoid stressful last-minute changes. Once, when a government website showing restricted airspace went offline, Algo remembered which areas were usually closed to commercial flights at certain times and planned routes accordingly.Alaska Airlines dispatcher Brad Ward at work at his monitor at Alaska Airlines' Network Operations Center in Seattle on May 14, 2021. Ward is one of dozens of flight dispatchers trained to work alongside a new artificial intelligence program designed to make flights more efficient.Chona Kasinger for TIMEFor all the fears that artificial intelligence will replace our jobs, the more common application of AI in the workplace today is as a colleague, like Algo is to Ward. It can search CT scans for early signs of lung cancer, alerting radiologists to lesions they may have overlooked. It can come up with millions of possible designs for a chair working within parameters provided by designers. It can analyze an applicant’s body language and voice tone in interviews, speeding up the hiring process. A growing number of workers are interacting with multiple forms of AI as they go about their jobs every day.“A man/machine collaboration will do better than just a man or just a machine,” says Pedro Domingos, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington. Deep Blue, an IBM program, may have beaten Gary Kasparov at chess, he says, but “centaur chess teams,” in which humans worked with AI, beat both humans and machines. “It’s not that people will be out of jobs, it’s that they will use computers to do their jobs more,” Domingos says.The sky is really the big untapped opportunity.Of course, as workers become more productive, companies may need fewer of them doing the same job. Transport aircraft used to have as many as five people in the cockpit in the 1940s; now commercial planes have two. Some workers will have to learn new skills as their jobs change. Companies closed call centers during the pandemic and deployed AI chatbots, for example, in many cases leaving customer service agents to deal with complicated questions that the chatbots couldn’t answer; they were also needed to train and supervise the chatbots.Phillip Buckendorf, the 30-year-old CEO and co-founder of Airspace Intelligence, came up with the idea for Flyways after visiting a flight dispatch center. Like most people, he figured it would look something like Star Trek, with complicated computer systems helping dispatchers guide planes through the skies. Buckendorf instead found that many dispatch centers looked like accounting firms from the 1990s. Dispatchers often relied on paper printouts to see weather forecasts and figured out wind speeds by decoding strings of letters and numbers on a federal website.Phillip Buckendorf, Airspace Intelligence CEO and co-founder and Pasha Saleh, Alaska Airlines flight operations strategy and innovation director.Chona Kasinger for TIMEBuckendorf, a lanky German who had been working for a self-driving car company, liked the idea of applying to planes in flight the same kind of technology that teaches cars to avoid traffic jams or double-parked vehicles. “You have this incredibly dynamic environment where you want to predict— where are you going to be in the airspace? And what does the environment look like? And how do you optimize for that?” says Buckendorf, who camped out at the Alaska Airlines dispatch center in Seattle for months alongside his co-founders, collaborating with dispatchers like Brad Ward to build Flyways. He approached various airlines with his idea but says Alaska was the quickest to agree to a trial, and in May 2020 it began using Flyways on all of its continental flights for a six-month trial. During that time, the AI found an opportunity to reduce flight times and fuel on 64% of the flights, says Pasha Saleh, Alaska Airlines’ director of strategy and innovation. It cut an average of 5.3 minutes off each Alaska Airlines flight, saving a total of 480,000 gallons of fuel and avoiding 4,600 tons of carbon emissions. (Aircraft fuel consumption varies and has improved over the years, but large jetliners can burn anywhere from 600 to 750 gallons of fuel an hour. According to one study, a person flying on a round-trip trans-Atlantic flight accounted for about 1.6 tons of carbon emissions.) The airline, which gave TIME an exclusive look at how the system operates from the dispatchers’ and pilots’ point of view, is now rolling out Flyways to all of its flights, including the ones that go to Alaska and Hawaii, and while it would not say how much it pays for the program, the reduced flight times and fuel consumption seen in the trial could translate to millions of dollars in savings in the long run. In terms of places to improve efficiency, “the sky is really the big untapped opportunity,” says Saleh.Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis with the iPad containing the kind of data pilots once had to cart around in heavy suitcases filled with paper.Chona Kasinger for TIMEOn a recent Friday, Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis scrolled through an iPad outside Gate D4 at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, reviewing the route for Flight 1258 to San Francisco. Pullis, who was wearing small airplane stud earrings, wanted to be sure the Airbus 321 she was piloting wasn’t going to encounter bad weather. Flyways, working in tandem with Ward, had found the most efficient route, which would take Pullis west of the Puget Sound, past waypoints ETCHY and PYE near Point Reyes, and into San Francisco from the west.This is just a huge enhancement to what we do.Pullis climbed into the cockpit, a silver shell of panels, switches and levers, and uploaded the route into the plane’s system, using an iPad in a rose-colored case. It’s a far cry from just 10 years ago, when pilots like Pullis dragged around 35-pound suitcases filled with paper flight manuals. Ward texted her a greeting, using the ever-evolving technology that would enable him to stay in touch with Pullis throughout the trip and offer assistance if needed.“This is just a huge enhancement to what we do,” says Ward, whose desk looks out onto a parking garage, a Silver Dollar casino, and the Seattle airport a mile away, where Pullis was preparing for flight.Read more: Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic. AI and Robots Are Replacing Them Faster Than EverNot every human/AI relationship is as harmonious as Ward’s and Algo’s, either. A warehouse worker who is told where to walk and what packages to pick by an AI algorithm may find that AI makes the job more physically grueling and stressful. And assuming that AI will be a good colleague has repercussions. Experts said as early as 2017 that AI could diagnose pneumonia better than a radiologist could, which led to a shortage of radiologists being trained, says Gary Marcus, a NYU professor who co-wrote the book Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust. Yet that AI software is still years from being deployed on a large scale. Companies that use AI to screen loan or mortgage applications often incorporate bias, making it more expensive for Black and Latino families to get loans. Police departments that use AI for facial recognition have wrongfully arrested Black men when the software mistakenly identified them as suspects. Because humans design AI, they can feed their own biases into the algorithms, such as when an AI recruiting tool designed by Amazon discriminated against female applicants.Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis boards Flight 1258, heading from Seattle to San Francisco.Chona Kasinger for TIMEBut AI is here to stay, and an AI colleague or colleagues can be an advantage as pandemic-era cutbacks force employees to take on extra tasks, all the while dealing with the distractions—think Slack, emails, instant messaging and video meetings—of the modern workplace. AI transcribed the interviews I did for this story, replied to emails scheduling those interviews, and alerted me to spelling errors in my draft. In the transportation industry in particular, automation and AI could help address impending labor shortages; as people venture out of lockdown and air traffic picks up, experts predict a pilot shortage. The trucking industry is already experiencing driver shortages. That’s before drones and unmanned aircraft make the airspace even more crowded, necessitating more dispatchers and air traffic controllers.Each time you board a commercial flight in the U.S., there is a flight dispatcher somewhere who has plotted your route. Commercial airplanes must pass over a number of “waypoints”—essentially geographic coordinates with names like IKPIF or KUJEF—as they go from Point A to Point B. The dispatcher chooses which waypoints a flight should hit, then submits the plan to air traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), who either approve or deny the route.There's no way humans can grasp how to handle 20 or 30 airplanes going into one place at one time.The algorithm from Flyways draws on data from past flights and current and predicted conditions to run through millions of route possibilities, and it reruns the process every few minutes for every flight. A red box lights up on the dispatcher’s screen if Flyways suggests a flight should be rerouted because of weather or safety issues; a green box lights up if a re-route is suggested for fuel efficiency; purple means a flight needs to be routed around restricted airspace.The predictive nature of Flyways can help dispatchers avoid things that they can’t see. If it knows that a storm cell in a geographic area usually grows or moves in a certain direction, it can find a new path before that storm shows up on weather maps. If many pilots have reported turbulence on their flights, it can map that turbulence and route other flights to avoid it. If it knows that many flights are planning to approach Seattle from the north later in the day, it may suggest approaching the airport from the south to avoid congestion. “There’s no way humans can grasp how to handle 20 or 30 airplanes going into a place at one time,” says Ward, who stands, in khakis and a green polo shirt, in front of the four monitors he uses to do his job. “You can have everyone on what you think is an optimal route, but then you create a traffic jam.”Network Operations Center at Alaska Airlines Hub in SeaTac, Wash. on May 14, 2021.Chona Kasinger for TIMEFlyways also shows Ward flights that can be slowed down for “network efficiency,” indicating how making one flight arrive later could help four other flights land earlier.Sometimes, Flyways suggests routes that Ward would never have tried. That’s when his judgement comes in handy. The FAA prefers that most flights from the east coast to the northwest go over Cleveland, for example, because this avoids traffic jams. If Flyways suggests a different route, Ward will often reject it because he knows that the FAA won’t accept it. If Flyways decides a flight can go close to a storm because there’s a strong chance the storm will dissipate, Ward may reject that route as too risky. Dispatchers accepted 32% of Flyways recommendations during the Alaska Airlines trial period, but that is expected to increase as Flyways memorizes dispatchers’ choices. Algo is already learning to plot more routes over Cleveland.“Humans will always be better at making the decisions. And the computer will always be better at supporting those decisions with good information.” says Ward, a self-described nerd who used to spend countless hours trying to find the best routes for his flights.Read more: Artificial Intelligence Could Help Solve America’s Impending Mental Health CrisisAlaska hopes to eventually use Flyways to figure out which flights have a lot of passengers making connections when they land, and to slow down other flights so that the connecting passengers can land on time. It could eventually tell Ward which planes have passengers transferring from one flight to another, so he can put them at adjoining gates. Alaska has 67 full-time dispatchers, and all are now trained to use Flyways. Airspace Intelligence says it is actively working with “multiple U.S. airlines” to deploy Flyways in their operations centers. Over time, if AI helps Ward make customers’ flight experiences more pleasant and less expensive, more people will fly, Domingos says, creating the need for more dispatchers.That’s what happened in the banking industry initially when ATMs were introduced. More people started using banks, so more branches were opened. The number of tellers increased, and their jobs evolved as they spent less time doling out cash and more time offering financial advice to customers. Now, the number of bank tellers is falling, but the number of financial advisors is projected to grow over the next decade.Flight 1258 to San Francisco International Airport via the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport prepares to depart on May 14.Chona Kasinger for TIMEAI has long been creeping into airspace. So many parts of piloting an airplane are done by computers that some pilots spend as little as three minutes actually “flying” the plane, says Mary “Missy” Cummings, a Duke professor who directs the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke Robotics and who was one of the Navy’s first female fighter pilots. Manufacturers are talking about designing passenger planes for only one pilot. As companies add drones and autonomous vehicles to the airspace, artificial intelligence will become more essential, Cummings says. There are already “near-misses” at airports because of heavy traffic, and that’s before drones begin flying at different speeds and levels, she says. “We’ll never be able to integrate unmanned vehicles without automation,” she says. That doesn’t mean humans won’t be needed, though—in aviation, there are always times when something unexpected like a thunderstorm or a flock of geese requires a human reaction. Besides, passengers want to know there is a human involved who will share their fate if something happens to the plane, says Cummings. There’s a reason it is comforting to walk by the cockpit when you board a plane. As Captain Pullis prepared to take off for San Francisco, she came on the plane’s loudspeaker, introducing herself and telling the passengers that their flight would be an hour and 33 minutes and they’d be cruising at 33,000 feet.

Technology advances faster each day, and it has a significant impact on many spheres. One of the biggest steps in technical development is artificial intelligence (AI). With AI’s help, many processes can be automatized, and it simplifies the work for difficult trades such as metallurgy, building, book printing, and others. When students learn artificial intelligence, they often like to describe their understanding of this subject in academic works. 
But when it comes to the process of writing about AI it becomes confusing. Writing an essay about AI takes a lot of time and effort. That is why a lot of students eventually prefer to buy college essay in order to get a clear, understandable, and engaging piece of writing. The difficulties of writing about AI come with its widespread use. Artificial intelligence is gradually coming to all branches of human activity, making ordinary software complexes intelligent: medicine and health care, online retail, politics, industry, gaming, education, and more.
Indeed, the field is interesting. But students might have trouble engaging the audience and presenting their ideas clearly. Thus, many of them are looking for a paper service out of fear of not meeting academic standards. After all, one has to structure their paper logically and adhere to certain formatting guidelines. 
Moreover, each student should avoid plagiarism and provide enough supporting details for their essay.
Often they don’t know how to do it properly and ask special writing services like WritingCheap for assistance. Otherwise, they can research online for more information or read our article with prominent tips on how to write an essay on AI effortlessly.
1. Choose a topic.
Firstly, you must research where AI is used and why it is beneficial for humanity. This helps you select the most interesting topic for your project and come up with a central idea. There are many fields AI is used in today, so go through the various aspects to choose the most engaging topic for your essay. Believe it or not, but when you write an essay on a subject you are barely engaged in, readers will also not be interested in the content. You can consider one of these themes and develop them with your imagination:
Applications of AI.Emotions, awareness, and consciousness in AI machines.Decision-making systems.Chess programs and their method of reacting to situations.AI and transport.Popular AI-based software.Natural language processing (NLP) and AI usage.How AI can be used in healthcare.Will AI replace human resources in all industries?AI and language: how can AI technologies be helpful for people worldwide?
2. Provide an engaging introduction.
Beginning your essay, consider writing it with your whole heart. Make sure you’ve chosen an interesting topic so you can engage your reader. Try to start from a general fact or unique idea that came to your mind while brainstorming. Like any academic essay, the starting point of an introduction on AI consists of a hook, thesis statement, and three key points which reveal your research method. An essay introduction about AI should have five-six sentences maximum and be a length of 100-150 words. Indeed, it depends on the overall volume, so remember that the introduction is no more than 10-20% of the entire essay.
3. Write a valuable body.
The body is 80% of the entire essay, so it should have enough ground for discussion. Include such elements as topic sentences and reveal them with evidence from sources. While researching, note down important information you can add during the writing process. Even if you are writing an essay on AI for the first time, remember that the first draft always matters.
Create three body paragraphs that are relevant to your topic and thesis statement. In the first one, you can reveal the first position toward the thesis. Provide strong support from valuable sources such as a book, scientific article, or video. Make sure you format all quotes correctly to avoid plagiarizing content. Indeed, your essay can contain more than three paragraphs, but we are providing the most common academic writing requirements.
4. Conclude logically.
Coming up with a concise and meaningful conclusion for an AI essay is sometimes more overwhelming than it seems at first sight. For instance, students can step away from the main idea and start to discuss something new. We caution not to begin any new conversation at the end of your essay because it only distracts the readers and makes your teacher lower your grade.
The summary is the final point of your essay that should confirm the content you’ve written in the essay and present the last thoughts concerning it. While writing an argumentative essay on artificial intelligence, tell your readers why your work is valuable and what your opinion means to other scholarly researchers.
5. Edit as if you are doing it for the last time.
Imagine that you have only one chance to improve your issues, so you spend your time editing more productively. When you focus on your text, you have a better understanding of what you’ve written about. With this attitude, you can see better which parts suit the overall context and which ones you should consider cutting. Concentrate on grammatical, punctuation, and spelling issues to prevent misunderstandings.
Indeed, the subject of AI represents a solid scientific discipline where students need to sort out different technological definitions. Still, you don’t need to depict complex statements which you don’t get yourself. Explain everything as simply as you would teach a first-grade kid from elementary school, and the reader will evaluate your diligence.
6. Format your essay according to the instructions.
As with any essay on computing science or technology, your work on AI should be formatted according to strict requirements. Formatting style includes instructions on fonts, title page, indents, margins, additional elements (picture, tables, graphs, figures, calculations, code, etc.), citations, and references list. Try to check everything before sending it to your teacher; otherwise, your essay could be rejected.
When you reference all quotes correctly and redirect the reader to cited works in the list, you save your AI essay from plagiarism. A reader can distinguish your opinion from evidence taken by different authors, so consider formatting seriously.
7. Keep it simple.
Instead of trying to connect yourself to the smart researchers’ community (we are sure you are smart), try to avoid long sentences and big words. Usually, it looks like the student pretends to be more serious, and it spoils everything. Let your reader understand your outlook even if you have to explain a complex subject with simple words. As we said earlier, try to speak to your reader through the lens of an elementary school teacher. Sometimes it is better to sound simpler but confident than smarter but vague. Anyway, if you have a perfect essay idea and individual approach, it doesn’t matter which definitions you use to deliver information to your reader. The main thing is it should be easy to understand.
8. Make it unique.
Don’t repeat after others because AI is an excellent field for new findings! As we said in the previous tip, if your essay maintains an original idea, it would be interesting for the reader to get into it. Think about AI as a field that is new to all humankind. It is actually new to us, so describe it in your essay. Having a first draft is a great point to analyze where you have borrowed content and your own personal outlook. It is not bad if you rely on someone’s works or cite other scientists, but it is more valuable to include unique findings in your project.
9. Read more literature and watch other researchers.
Check your essay one more time concerning repeated thoughts and hypotheses. You can compare the literature you’ve used to write an AI essay with other documents, articles, videos, and books that you haven’t included yet. It doesn’t mean you should rewrite your essay; you can always understand where to move forward.
An essay about AI is not only about training your writing skills and checking your knowledge, but it is a great first step to a practical scientific career. Find out how others explore the topic you work on and see how you can improve your approach. Try not to add like/dislike opinions towards someone’s findings; note down valuable quotes from discussions to place them in your further research.
10. Finally: make it happen!
Anyway, every student dreams of being recognizable in the scientific community, so try to write your AI essay like you are the first person to explore this discipline. At this last stage, we recommend turning back to the very first tip, where you should choose an engaging topic. Don’t underestimate this advice because you can significantly simplify your writing process if you choose a subject you are interested in. Show your work to a tutor, peer, or find an AI expert who works in this field. Ask for their advice and consider them while continuing work on your project.

May 25, 2021 - Healthcare is ripe for innovation and disruption through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and revenue cycle management might be one of the strongest use cases for this type of technology.
Revenue cycle management is a complex and oftentimes manual process. But even when provider organizations tap technology to streamline their revenue cycles, staff are generally hindered by fragmented systems and a lack of enterprise solutions, according to a recent KLAS and Center for Connected Medicine survey of health system leaders.
But revenue cycle management was one of the most cited responses when asked about areas for planned AI use, second only to virtual assistant applications.
Healthcare organizations have attempted to implement AI to streamline key revenue cycle tasks.
“Integrating artificial intelligence into an RCM solution allows us to have data driven approaches to automate each step in the process, whether it's when that first letter is going out, that first contact is happening, or that payment is going into a payment plan. Each step, there's a model supporting that decision which helps a person to take the right action at the right time,” says Greg Allen, senior director of data science and product management at Ontario Systems.
The technology has proven to work with revenue cycle tasks, such as prior authorizations, claim status verifications, and claims denial management, to name a few. However, the use of this technology in revenue cycle management is still maturing. Strong use cases now include innovative AI solutions that optimize accounts receivable management by identifying and directing account follow-up, finding patterns that maximize success. But the potential for AI in revenue cycle management is rapidly expanding.
Perhaps the strongest case for AI in revenue cycle management being used today is the capability to understand people to optimize collections in the era of high deductibles.
AI for patient financial responsibility
Patient financial responsibility is at an all-time high. Kaiser Family Foundation recently reported a 111 percent increase in the burden of deductibles across all covered workers. Meanwhile, over half of patients responding to a 2020 HealthCareInsider.com survey said they worry about out-of-pocket healthcare costs leading to household bankruptcy.
The growing burden of patient financial responsibility is having a major impact on healthcare, even preventing people from accessing the care they need. Revenue cycle leaders are also finding that they do not have the tools to address this growing burden, which is also slowing the entire collections process.
AI technology is poised to help providers accelerate patient collections while ensuring a positive experience for patients.
“Using data to understand people is a very strong use case because when you can understand a person and their financial position, you can help them and work with them all while providing a positive experience when they are in a difficult position,” says Allen.
“Maybe it's to understand when you should be contacting someone or what kind of individualized payment plan they should be provided based on their unique situation.”
But creating consumer profiles to optimize the patient financial experience is very difficult at scale, Allen adds.
“That's why we’ve leveraged technology to be able to do assist,” Allen says.
AI technology can create and analyze personalized consumer profiles at scale—a capability many organizations do not have because of resource restraints. By pulling data from disparate data sources, including third-party sources, the technology can identify patterns of behavior for every patient and direct staff to create a personalized financial experience for them, whether it be calling them in the morning because they work nights, emailing them a secure link to a digital statement because they prefer electronic communications, or even not contacting them at all because they frequently use the patient portal on their own to pay medical bills.
“From a data science perspective, if I can't understand my consumer and closely replicate the world around them, then I can't succeed,” adds Allen.
AI has the potential to increase revenue through collections while improving the patient experience and aligning it more with the customized billing solutions available across other industries, such as banking and retail. These patient experience improvements also carry their own financial benefits, if only provider organizations overcome privacy and security concerns.
Misunderstanding, trepidation, and concern about patient privacy have been barriers to AI implementation in the data-heavy world of healthcare. But they don’t have to be anymore.
Overcoming the challenges of AI implementation
Three-quarters of healthcare insiders are worried about the data security and privacy aspects associated with implementation of AI and machine learning tools, a 2020 KPMG survey shows. However, 86 percent of respondents to the survey said they are taking steps to protect patient privacy as they implement AI. Furthermore, the technology is evolving from “black box” technologies, which lack the ability to understand how decisions are made, into transparent and explainable solutions, providing deeper insight and accountability for the revenue cycle.
“We practice something called ‘explainable AI’ or ‘xAI’ to create auditability into our models and into the decision-making process so that we can reproduce our results and provide feedback, along with a clear explanation for why a decision was made,” Allen says.
“That is incredibly important in order to create widespread adoption across this industry, and others, as well, because we can't have a black box solution or hide behind the veil of proprietary technology. Being able to explain what we're doing in a digestible way is another way we combat the existing lack of transparency.”
Building customer profiles for optimized patient collections and experience carries its own risk since many solutions pull from credit bureaus and other third-party data sources containing personally identifying information (PII). This PII significantly increases the risk of a data breach, putting both providers and patients at risk of a costly security event.
AI technologies can pull from alternative data sources, reducing the risk of data misuse and expanding the methods in determining a patient’s propensity to pay, preferred payment methods, and more.
Future of AI in revenue cycle management
With explainable AI, technology has the potential to foster patient relationships, not take away from the human experience in healthcare. AI empowers human decision-making, enabling technology to take over redundant tasks so staff can get to know patients and their preferences. And revenue cycle management is ripe for this type of innovation.
“By having people spend less time on an individual account, by providing more information and insight in order to be more productive, we are able to save costs,” Allen states. “And it doesn't need to be through the reduction of personnel.”
In addition to privacy and security, many stakeholders fear AI will replace humans in the workplace. However, the technology is actually helping revenue cycle staff work more efficiently by supporting their workflows and allowing them to tackle accounts needing more human intervention.
In a world of falling margins and high-deductible health plans, increasing efficiency in revenue cycle management is paramount. And AI can be leveraged to drive business intelligence to communicate more effectively with patients.
“By incorporating AI into the backend financial aspect of the patient experience, providers have the opportunity to create a better business for themselves while simultaneously improving the patient experience, allowing all parties to benefit without losing sight of their human sides,” Allen states.

 Is Nigeria ready for Artificial Intelligence in schools? 


                            23rd May 2021                        









                                By  Jesusegun Alagbe 


Kindly share this story:

  








 

        In the past, artificial intelligence was just something relegated to science fiction propagated by books and movies.
Self-driving cars, a toothbrush that tells you the best way to brush your teeth, a voice recognition software that unlocks your phone, your face unlocking your laptop and other devices – all these were only scenes from sci-fi books and movies.
By way of definition, the American technology giant International Business Machines Corporation defines AI as referring to any human-like intelligence exhibited by a computer, robot, or other machines.
In popular usage, AI refers to the ability of a computer or machine to mimic the capabilities of the human mind – learning from examples and experience, recognising objects, understanding and responding to language, making decisions, solving problems – and combining these and other capabilities to perform functions a human might perform, such as greeting a hotel guest or driving a car. 






IBM notes that the surge in AI development is made possible by the sudden availability of large amounts of data and the corresponding development and wide availability of computer systems that can process all that data faster and more accurately than humans can.
Today, AI is completing our words as we type them, providing driving directions when we ask, vacuuming our floors, and recommending what we should buy or binge-watch next. AI is driving applications that help skilled professionals do important work faster and with greater success.
AI has come to life and is part of our everyday lives. It has disrupted and will continue to have tremendous impacts across sectors, including education.        
Speaking of AI and education, it is said that AI educational solutions are continuously maturing, filling the gaps in learning and teaching and allowing schools and teachers to do more.
According to Market Research Engine, a global market research and consulting organisation based in the United States, the global AI in the education market will reach $5.8bn by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of 45 per cent.
The following are, therefore, five ways AI is changing the education industry as well as how institutions and educators can benefit from it.
Task automation
According to Ideamotive, a software company based in Warszawa, Poland, AI has shown great potential in automating administrative work and making the tasks of schools and teachers easier.
Normally, teachers have to manage numerous administrative and organisational tasks besides managing the classroom environment. They need to evaluate homework, mark tests/exams, manage teaching materials, and make periodic progress reports, and more.
In fact, a survey by Ideamotive reveals that teachers spend only about 43 per cent of their time on real teaching and the rest on non-teaching tasks.     
This is where AI can be quite handy as it has the power to grade tests and manage administrative work, taking a huge load off of teachers’ shoulders.
Smart content
Smart content refers to different types of virtual content, including digitised guides of textbooks, video conferencing, and video lectures.
Robots can now improve the learning experience by creating customisable learning interfaces and digital content that apply to students of different grades.
The robots are able to make the content easily digestible by dividing it into comprehensible chunks, highlighting important lesson stuff, summarising key points, and more.
Personalised learning
A study by Rand Corporation, a global policy think tank shows that customised learning can improve student performance no matter what their starting level is.  
As every student has a different approach to learning and teachers don’t have the time to personalise their teaching methods and provide one-on-one sessions for every student, AI can be of great help.
AI can do much more than making content easily digestible. It is also capable of giving recommendations to students and teaching them based on the difficulties they are facing in different lectures.

Such tools can also help teachers track each student’s progress and provide data that can help to create materials that are relevant for each student.
24/7 assistance
In the traditional environment, students have to wait until they are in class to ask their teachers any questions. Not anymore!
Now, there are various AI-powered chatbots created specifically for the education sector.
These chatbots serve as round-the-clock assistants that students can consult with anywhere and at any time. This allows the students to get quick and relevant answers or solutions without having to wait for the next class or office hours.     
Secure online exams
Today, many institutions and universities around the globe use AI-powered assessment tools to carry out tests or exams online.
AI can allow limiting the availability and creating different groups with a selection of random questions for each student so as to prevent cheating. This saves teachers lots of time and avoids the risk of human error.
Is Nigeria ready?
With the COVID-19 pandemic, the deployment of AI infrastructures is now much more inevitable as face-to-face meetings are being largely discouraged.
However, a Professor of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computing and Engineering Sciences, Babcock University, Ogun State, Oludele Awodele, says the infrastructures required to support AI are not yet available.
Awodele says there is a need for “intentional” efforts in creating an enabling environment for AI to work.        
He says, “Talking about education, with the new order (in terms of COVID-19 pandemic), one of the impacts is that people now know that they don’t need to meet face-to-face before they deliver or listen to lectures, and some of the tools being used relate to the concept of artificial intelligence. For example, if I give my students an assignment or an exam, machines can mark it.
“But the problem we are facing as a country is infrastructure, which cuts across every other sector. The infrastructures required to support AI generally are not available. I’m not sure we even have a standard AI laboratory, though we have people in this field who are ready to put in their efforts to ensure we get there. I think the government may have seen that, which is why they came up with the communication and digital economy initiative.”
Also speaking with Sunday PUNCH, the acting Head, Department of Computer Science at the University of Ibadan, Dr Ibiyinka Ayorinde, says AI will definitely impact education in Nigeria.
“With AI, you can trace the activities of your students and know who comes to class and who is absent; who has done your assignment and who hasn’t; when a student logs into the system. AI helps you know if your students are participating in class,” she says.
However, when asked if Nigeria is ready for AI’s disruption of the education sector, Ayorinde says the country is not fully ready.
She says, “We are both ready and unready when it comes AI’s role in education. We are in-between in the sense that it depends on a lot of factors. For instance, more than 70 per cent of students cannot adjust to the technology right now because of the level of poverty in Nigeria. Many students are indigent and cannot afford smartphones. For those who have access to smartphones, what about data availability?
“We have to be sincere, the infrastructures are not on the ground for both teachers and students. Let’s say they struggle to buy devices and data, what about network issues? Sometimes during learning, you have to switch between various networks and yet you get frustrated.”    ,,
