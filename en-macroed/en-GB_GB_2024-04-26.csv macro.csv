Businesses have sought different forms of automation and intelligent data processing for years, but generative AI has opened the floodgates of investment and enterprise interest.Formed on the back of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), which have been in the enterprise wheelhouse for many years, generative AI entered the public eye through the popularity of ChatGPT and has since come to dominate discussions in the tech sector.The relatively new approach to AI is already being used to generate detailed text and image outputs using simple user input and is increasingly integrated within business environments to automate a range of menial tasks. Generative AI has sparked interest across the business world because of the degree to which it can be personalized. With the right approach, the technology can radically improve worker productivity and help companies provide customers with far more intuitive user experiences.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProHow does generative AI work?Generative AI’ is a term that refers broadly to AI systems that are capable of producing outputs based on a prompt. These come in a few different forms that work in subtly different ways. The most popular models in use today rely on a complex artificial neural network (ANN) architecture known as a transformer.In simple terms, transformers take a prompt and output a response based on statistics and the exhaustive training process to which they have been subjected.Transformers convert inputs into context, by breaking words down into mathematical values that are used to inform a model’s output. For example, when a user inputs “Where is Microsoft’s HQ?” into a model, the transformer converts the words into ‘tokens’ of data which are combined to form a coherent ‘vector’ of context used to produce a statistically relevant output.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

The two main forms of neural networks at play here – GANs and transformers – work in slightly different ways. By and large the former is involved in creating visual and multimedia content from images and text, while the latter uses information on the internet to generate textual output.What are some examples of generative AI?Although generative AI became popular in 2022, experts have been working on the technology in theoretical and practical applications for many years.Dutch researchers wrote about the philosophical underpinnings of generative AI as far back as 2012. Indium Software, too, released a white paper [PDF] less than three years ago which highlighted not just how generative AI could be used creatively, but also in high-friction workplaces like healthcare.Transformer models rose to prominence through the research paper Attention Is All You Need and quickly became prized for the efficient and performant way in which they could be used to produce coherent AI output. This was a significant breakthrough, which fed directly into subsequent products at OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and other firms.Examples of generative AIThe generative AI market has grown incredibly quickly, to the extent that there are now innumerable LLMs and tools that rely on the technology. For many businesses and consumers alike, the standout example will still be OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Microsoft users also now have access to Copilot, the company’s AI productivity assistant, across a wide range of apps in the 365 suite, as well as within Bing search.Google’s Gemini AI family powers the company’s AI product offerings, including Google Cloud’s new Vertex AI Agents. AWS has also invested heavily in AI tools, having rolled out solutions such its chatbot for enterprise Amazon Q.AI pair programmers such as Code Llama, Gemini Code Assist, or GitHub Copilot can provide code suggestions based on a company’s private codebase or make existing cod emore efficient. These tools can also analyze code to provide user-friendly explanations of its function and produce comments, or translate it from one programming language into another.Open-source AI models are also growing in popularity. These include models from AI community Hugging Face, with models in the space rapidly approaching the sophistication of some proprietary models.In recent months, however, experts have questioned whether these models are truly open, as developers continue to impose usage restrictions on some models in their licenses. For example, open models from developers Meta and Databricks come with clauses that prohibit their use by firms with more than 700 million active monthly users, without express permission from the developers.The latest flagship models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, Meta’s Llama 3, and Anthropic’s Claude 3 are multimodal. This means they can process text, images, video, or audio as inputs and produce outputs in a variety of formats.Gemini 1.5 Pro also uses an architecture known as ‘mixture-of-experts’ (MOE), in which multiple ANNs dubbed ‘experts’ are assigned inputs based on which expert will most effectively process the input to produce an output.The MoE approach has been hailed as a cost-effective route for training compared to prohibitively expensive traditional methods. It allows for models to increase in size and effectiveness, especially for multimodal processing, and is likely to become more widely-used in future models.What are the benefits of generative AI?RELATED WHITEPAPER(Image credit: Getty Images)Discover the leading service providers in enterprise supply chain innovationPart of the reason that generative AI has seen such a boom in popularity is its ease of use relative to its power and potential. Generative AI has opened the door to far more detailed responses to natural language inputs, with LLMs able to unpick meaning from user queries and provide informed responses on its own.Through generative AI-powered chatbots, businesses can provide customers with personalized answers based on questions to improve the overall digital experience of their website.Using generative AI, enterprises can automate manual tasks such as drafting text, collating data from across different sources, or identifying anomalous details in a file or image.Summarization stands out as a major benefit of major AI, particularly when used across a company’s estate. The chief appeal of products such as Microsoft Copilot or Google’s Vertex Agents is that they can provide users with accurate answers to specific questions grounded in their company’s data. For example, a user could ask for a summary of an internal medical policy.AI code generation is another major use case for generative AI. Using an AI pair programmer, developers can speed up their workflows and focus on problems that require expert attention rather than sinking time into simpler work. The capability for these tools to translate code from one language to another has massive applications for legacy codebases, which may be written in obscure languages like COBOL. Easy code translation could save companies time and money down the line or even prevent critical outages, as experts with firsthand experience of these old languages are harder and harder to find.More recent developments have allowed generative AI models to be used for tasks such as live video analysis through computer vision, which has applications from accessibility in tech to more autonomous robots in a manufacturing environment.What are the concerns surrounding generative AI?Widespread use of generative AI has been matched with concerns over its potential risks and harms. From the earliest models in public use, it has been clear that AI has drawbacks such as ‘hallucinations’ – the term used to describe incorrect statements confidently reported by an LLM.Hallucinations are just one problem with generative AI. Leaders will need to keep up to date on the latest issues and remedies in the space as they seek to integrate it within their tech stacks, not least because of an anticipated increase in regulatory oversight of AI similar to the GDPR.Generative AI legal risksThe rapid growth of the generative AI market has led to widespread discussions over the importance of ethical AI. One of the most basic concerns when it comes to generative AI models is who owns the data used to train the models – with some developers already facing lawsuits from artists, writers, and publishing houses over the alleged use of copyrighted material for training LLMs.This is the tip of the iceberg for the legal issues of generative AI and governments around the world are progressing AI legislation to control the risks and harms that AI could pose.The AI Bill of Rights was drafted in the US in 2022, as a framework for shaping future regulation. But the US has fallen behind on AI since, having lagged behind the EU and UK's AI approach.The EU AI Act seeks to regulate AI models – inclusive of generative AI – according to their assessed risk. Businesses will need to know how their AI is being used and have a good understanding of the data used to train the models they use, or face hefty fines. Generative AI job lossesAI-linked job cuts are a major point of concern for employees and the speed and sophistication of generative AI has fanned anxieties in this space.In 2023, IBM’s CEO Arvind Krishna was forced to go into damage control mode after stating that generative AI would benefit productivity at firms at the expense of human roles. However, Microsoft found that more workers care about AI benefits than its job impacts in its 2023 Work Trend Index, emphasizing how the benefits of generative AI are being increasingly weighed up against its downsides.Job losses due to generative AI are not a given. Leaders can pursue upskilling to prevent AI cuts, insulating workers with AI skills that keep them in their roles longer.Generative AI security risksGenerative AI threats, those specifically linked to attackers misusing generative AI to launch more sophisticated attacks on victims, are a major focal point for security teams as the technology becomes widespread. Though the One risk of generative AI that’s already been widely discussed is the potential to exacerbate the rise of deepfakes. These images or videos are created in such a way that renders a lifelike imitation of a person, often a celebrity but also potentially a prominent business leader, in such a way that it can trick others.Real-time deepfakes are now becoming a more serious threat, while voice cloning tools such as Microsoft’s VALL-E or OpenAI’s Voice Engine can reproduce realistic copies of people’s voices using less than a minute of sample audio. Both could be effective weapons in a new era of social engineering.At the same time as attackers are figuring out how to use AI to enhance their attacks, AI cyber security is being used by defense teams to counter these threats in more sophisticated ways. Tools such as Microsoft Security Copilot or Gemini in Security Command Center can help identify and summarize threats, or suggest actions for effectively responding to threats.While it’s tempting to see generative AI as a malign force, given the early chaos it has sewn in the creative industries and across parts of the economy, that doesn’t mean it can’t be tamed and channeled into productive use cases. That said, there are many questions that need to be addressed first, with regulation a hot topic at the moment.

Generative artificial intelligence can help federal employees do their jobs better in certain cases, but there are risks to watch out for, according to the Office of Personnel Management.The federal HR shop issued guidance today on the Responsible Use of Generative AI, which points out some key pitfalls — as well as benefits — of using the emerging technology in federal work, such as document drafting, coding, translation, data analysis and more.First, it's important to make sure your agency has cleared employees to use GenAI apps in the workplace. Agencies have different policies about onboarding tools that assist in writing, computer coding and image generation. While these tools are often freely available over the open internet, it's up to agencies to authorize access. Some agencies may have their own enterprise GenAI tools. In any case, OPM notes, feds should ""expect that your use of GenAI technology may be logged and monitored.""Even approved tools can generate outputs that aren't suitable for public-facing or even internal use, because of the potential for copyright infringement and plagiarism, as well as the release of personal information contained in training materials used by these large language models. Additionally, OPM notes the risk ""to agency credibility if content is inaccurate, unreliable or discriminatory.""OPM urges feds to impose human checks on AI outputs before any publication or dissemination of written materials or AI-generated images. It is especially important to ""review AI-generated material for potentially biased, harmful, stereotypical, or otherwise offensive language or images,"" the guidance states. Additionally, some agencies may require some disclaimer or watermark that identifies AI-generated material. The guidance comes 180 days after the release of the Biden administration's executive order on AI. The White House noted separately that all federal agencies completed the 180-day deliverables contained in the order on schedule. These include, on the government operations front, guidance from the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs on deploying AI in the workplace, as well as multi-agency guidance on the responsible and equitable use of GenAI in public benefits programs.

The history of technology is the story of human progress. Every big advance opens up wonderful possibilities and poses pivotal questions. We all sense what a leap forward artificial intelligence (AI) could be. We’re optimistic about its potential but wary of any unintended consequences.
At first glance, music may not be the obvious place to look for signposts of AI’s future. But think of the new worlds unlocked by the inventions like the printing press, phonograph, radio and internet. Each pushed music further and faster as an art form, and proved its power to drive the adoption of new technology. Music has often been the canary in the coal mine. 


  

AI is no different. Music has already given us glimpses of what this incredible technology can do when artists are on board — whether it’s musicians permitting fans to create new songs using replicas of their voices, artists’ estates empowering posthumous biopics featuring perfect replicas of late stars, or singers who have lost their voice to illness miraculously recording again. 
At the same time, we’ve witnessed the specter of AI’s possible downside for artists: vast scraping and copying of creative works, and the rise of deep fakes where artists’ voices, faces and identities are appropriated without their consent, to depict them doing, saying, and singing things that never happened.
The starkly different positive and negative uses of AI that music is grappling with today represent two alternate versions of the future — with artists at the tip of the spear. 
Every person’s voice and image are as individual as their fingerprints and lie at the very core of their identity and livelihood. This issue of misleading deep fakes is starting to impact everyone — politicians impersonated in deep fake videos, families defrauded by voice clones pretending to be relatives, people placed into pornography without consent, and even schoolchildren victimized with their faces inserted into humiliating scenes. 
Surprisingly, there currently is no federal law that fully protects our identities from use without permission. And that must change as soon as possible.
With my experience at YouTube and Netflix and now Warner Music Group, innovation is in my DNA. However, responsible AI will depend on human beings being able to protect their identities. In order to achieve that, we need four things:


  


Consent: The use of people’s likeness and voice rights to train AI models and create output from them requires consent
Monetization: The grant of likeness and voice rights must be subject to free-market licenses

In order to operationalize consent and monetization at scale, we need: 

Attribution: AI models must identify outputs through labels and watermarks, which in turn must be recognized by all distribution platforms.
Provenance: AI developers must be required to keep sufficiently detailed, publicly available records of the material used to train their models to enable the enforcement of rights.

I am honored to be testifying on April 30 before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to offer ideas related to Sens. Chris Coons’s (D-Del.) and Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) NO FAKES Act proposal — which is aimed at defending the unique human identities of every American. It’s very encouraging that the No AI FRAUD Act, introduced by Reps. María Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), enjoys bipartisan support in the House. 
These proposals would establish clear ground rules, helping to prevent a world where AI can appropriate a person’s identity without their permission. This would also have a “halo effect,” helping to curb misinformation, identity theft and hate-fueled content.



Critics will try to muddy the waters by raising supposed implications for news reporting or parodies. And any proposed legislation should expressly acknowledge the First Amendment’s broad protections — while also forbidding serious harms that fall outside them. As always, the music community will stand up for freedom of speech. 
I am excited to see what the future holds; it’s a road we need to travel thoughtfully but swiftly. Ultimately, the question isn’t where AI is taking humanity, it’s where humanity will take AI. Together, we share in that opportunity and responsibility.

",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://thehill.com/opinion/4631751-four-rules-to-make-artificial-intelligence-work-for-humans/'}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://thehill.com/search/{search_term_string}/', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","The history of technology is the story of human progress. Every big advance opens up wonderful possibilities and poses pivotal questions. We all sense what a leap forward artificial intelligence (AI) could be. We’re optimistic about its potential but wary of any unintended consequences. At first glance, music may not be the obvious place to look for signposts of AI’s future. But think of the new worlds unlocked by the inventions like the printing press, phonograph, radio and internet. Each pushed music further and faster as an art form, and proved its power to drive the adoption of new technology. Music has often been the canary in the coal mine.&nbsp; AI is no different. Music has already given us glimpses of what this incredible technology can do when artists are on board — whether it’s musicians permitting fans to create new songs using replicas of their voices, artists’ estates empowering posthumous biopics featuring perfect replicas of late stars, or singers who have lost their voice to illness miraculously recording again.&nbsp; At the same time, we’ve witnessed the specter of AI’s possible downside for artists: vast scraping and copying of creative works, and the rise of deep fakes where artists’ voices, faces and identities are appropriated without their consent, to depict them doing, saying, and singing things that never happened. The starkly different positive and negative uses of AI that music is grappling with today represent two alternate versions of the future — with artists at the tip of the spear.&nbsp; Every person’s voice and image are as individual as their fingerprints and lie at the very core of their identity and livelihood. This issue of misleading deep fakes is starting to impact everyone — politicians impersonated in deep fake videos, families defrauded by voice clones pretending to be relatives, people placed into pornography without consent, and even schoolchildren victimized with their faces inserted into humiliating scenes.&nbsp; Surprisingly, there currently is no federal law that fully protects our identities from use without permission.&nbsp;And that must change as soon as possible. With my experience at YouTube and Netflix and now Warner Music Group, innovation is in my DNA. However, responsible AI will depend on human beings being able to protect their identities. In order to achieve that, we need four things: In order to operationalize consent and monetization at scale, we need:&nbsp; I am honored to be testifying on April 30 before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to offer ideas related to Sens. Chris Coons’s (D-Del.) and Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) NO FAKES Act proposal — which is aimed at defending the unique human identities of every American. It’s very encouraging that the No AI FRAUD Act, introduced by Reps. María Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), enjoys bipartisan support in the House.&nbsp; These proposals would establish clear ground rules, helping to prevent a world where AI can appropriate a person’s identity without their permission. This would also have a “halo effect,” helping to curb misinformation, identity theft and hate-fueled content. Critics will try to muddy the waters by raising supposed implications for news reporting or parodies. And any proposed legislation should expressly acknowledge the First Amendment’s broad protections — while also forbidding serious harms that fall outside them. As always, the music community will stand up for freedom of speech.&nbsp; I am excited to see what the future holds; it’s a road we need to travel thoughtfully but swiftly. Ultimately, the question isn’t where AI is taking humanity, it’s where humanity will take AI. Together, we share in that opportunity and responsibility.&nbsp; Robert Kyncl&nbsp;is the CEO of Warner Music Group.","['Opinion', 'Technology']","[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': ""The Hill's Headlines – April 30, 2024"", 'description': 'EDUCATION\r\nAnti-War\xa0protesters take over\xa0a building on the campus of\xa0Columbia University\r\n\xa0\r\nCOURT BATTLES\r\nTestimony resumes in\xa0Hush money\xa0trial as\xa0judge rules Trump violated gag order, warns of jail time\r\n\xa0\r\nCAMPAIGN\r\nPoll: President Biden trails Donald Trump in Seven Swing States\r\n\xa0\r\nSTATE WATCH\r\n4 officers killed, 4 others wounded in shootout at Charlotte, NC, home\r\n\xa0\r\nECONOMY\r\nHigher-than-expected wages, benefits in Q1 could delay Fed rate cuts', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://c104216-ucdn.mp.lura.live/expiretime=2082787200/17724041bf1cdc242b8950fd8ac7540335bdae2d6d273e1b119c3a44fcea5f96//hill/vupl_lin/FAD/8BD/FAD8BD6E44CA60E63FE681800E6E6299-0-1714497767297_160x90.jpg', 'contentUrl': '', 'uploadDate': '2024-04-30T12:22:00-04:00', 'duration': 'P0DT0H1M0S'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From automating complex analysis to simulating scenarios that assist in decision-making, GenAI use cases are making a big impact across a broad swath of industries, including financial services, consultancies, information technology, legal, telecommunication and more.Certainly, organizations recognize GenAI's potential with the increasing adoption of AI within organizations. According to a PWC survey, 73% of U.S. companies have adopted AI in some areas of their business. Yet, discussion persists about GenAI’s role within the workplace, given fears over job displacement, bias, decision-making transparency and more. Despite this, GenAI has made AI technology much more accessible to employees within organizations, regardless of their specific roles.In fact, a LexisNexis Future of Work survey showed that 72% of professionals anticipate a positive impact from GenAI, and only 4% see it as a threat to job security. GenAI can automate mundane tasks, allowing users to focus on more specialized, impactful and strategic tasks. This, in turn, can increase employee productivity and job satisfaction while ensuring human ambition and innovation walk hand in hand.AI’s Productivity BoostGenAI's rapid rise marks a crucial shift in how organizations must operate and strategize to augment every role. GenAI applications are as diverse as they are impactful. It’s not just hype; GenAI is already poised to increase labor productivity by 0.1 to 0.6% annually through 2040.GenAI has also created value across multiple sectors and industries. Significant business functions, including Sales, Marketing, Customer Operations and Technology have leveraged GenAI to increase productivity. In technology, for example, GenAI-based coding assistants are a massive help to software developers in suggesting code snippets, refactoring code, fixing bugs, understanding complex code, writing unit tests, documentation and creating complete end-to-end applications.As employees experiment and explore with GenAI tools, their comfort level with the technology increases. Eighty-six percent of professionals ‘agree' or ‘strongly agree' with a willingness to embrace GenAI for both creative and professional work. Sixty-eight percent of employees plan to use GenAI tools for work purposes, while 69% are already using these tools to assist with daily tasks. The data makes it clear that organizations that adopt GenAI can boost productivity, and employees are willing to use it to accelerate efficiency.Productivity Gains Are a Given, But Also AI Helps with Job SatisfactionOne of the most significant opportunities around GenAI lies in its power to help with job satisfaction. While professionals have fairly balanced expectations on how far adoption will go, 82% expect generative AI to take over a range of repetitive administrative tasks by automating routine tasks and data analysis, freeing them to focus on more strategic aspects of their work.When asked how they perceive GenAI's role in the work environment, more than two-thirds of professionals see it as a ‘helpful tool' or ‘supportive co-worker.' As a result, they recognize AI's potential to enhance, not hinder, job performance and are embracing it with a positive mindset toward eliminating repetitive tasks and freeing up time for more rewarding, higher-value work.Most professionals do not see generative AI as a detriment to job satisfaction, either. Over half (51%) say job satisfaction has improved significantly or moderately thanks to GenAI, while only 10% felt that it decreases job satisfaction. A fundamental rethink is necessary where and how organizations implement GenAI tools within the workplace.Recommendations to Improve Engagement and Job SatisfactionOrganizations need to consider employee engagement throughout the adoption process of GenAI tools. Here are some recommendations to improve engagement and thereby increase job satisfaction:Engage your employees to identify the use cases that are most impactful for a particular role or group. Pick tasks that are most time-consuming and tedious, such that solving them would free up time to focus on more critical items.Identify the GenAI tools and large language models (LLMs) that are most effective for solving the identified use case. Take the time to experiment, test and validate the output. Ensure that you account for a diverse set of inputs for the use case and measure the output quality, including the hallucination rate, to help build trust within your employee base using the solution.Provide training to your team. Take advantage of the vast information available on the web, with videos, code samples, tool vendor resources and tutorials on using the specific tool, LLM, associated prompts and guardrails. Create mentors and experts within the team to help coach the rest. Showcase examples of lessons learned and success stories to inspire team members who may not see the value.Identify and measure KPIs. These could include adoption, productivity gains, costs saved or repurposed, employee satisfaction, quality improvement and other KPIs that may be specific to the team or business.Gen AI isn't just for technologists anymore; it's making potent tools accessible to everyone. Most business professionals who once viewed these technologies with skepticism now accept and even welcome them. And it's no secret why, given GenAI's power to present organizations and employees alike with unprecedented opportunities toward the future of work.

With both established tech enterprises and smaller AI startups vying for the next generative AI breakthrough, future prospects for generative AI are changing as rapidly as the technology itself. For better understand its future, this guide provides a snapshot of generative AI’s past and present, along with a deep dive into what the years ahead likely hold for generative AI.

Generative AI’s Future: 8 Predictions
Looking ahead, expect to see generative AI trends focused on three main pools: quick and sweeping technological advances, faster-than-expected digital transformations, and increasing emphasis on the societal and global impact of artificial intelligence. These specific predictions and growing trends are most likely on the horizon:
1. Growth in Multimodality
Multimodality — the idea that a generative AI tool is designed to accept inputs and generate outputs in multiple formats — is starting to become a top priority for consumers, and AI vendors are taking notice.
OpenAI was one of the first to provide multimodal model access to users through GPT-4, and Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude 3 are some of the major models that have followed suit. So far though, most AI companies have not made multimodal models publicly available; even many who now offer multimodal models have significant limitations on possible inputs and outputs.
In the near future, multimodal generative AI is likely to become less of a unique selling point and more of a consumer expectation of generative AI models, at least in all paid LLM subscriptions.
Additionally, expect multimodal modeling itself to grow in complexity and accuracy to meet consumer demands for an all-in-one tool. This may look like improving the quality of image and non-text outputs or adding better capabilities and features for things like videos, file attachments (as Claude has already done), and internet search widgets (as Gemini has already done).
ChatGPT currently enables users to work with text (including code), voice, and image inputs and outputs, but there are no video input or output capabilities built into ChatGPT. This may change soon, as OpenAI is experimenting with Sora, its new text-to-video generation tool, and will likely embed some of its capabilities into ChatGPT as they have done with DALL-E.
Similarly, while Google’s Gemini currently supports text, code, image, and voice inputs and outputs, there are major limitations on image possibilities, as the tool is currently unable to generate images with people. Google seems to be actively working on this limitation behind the scenes, leading me to believe that it will go away soon.
With my free Google Gemini account, I can generate fairly accurate image results based on my prompts. I can also attach images to my prompts and have Gemini explain the image or frame its responses around the image and text I submit. GPT-4, Gemini, and a growing number of other generative AI models are offering multimodal content generation capabilities to their customers; expect this to be more commonplace in the coming months. Source: Shelby Hiter via Gemini.
The first image Gemini generated was accurate but somewhat incomplete. With further prompting, I was able to get a more accurate assortment of images to choose from. As image and multimodal models continue to mature, I expect this level of results — or better — to come through in the first round of prompting in most cases. Source: Shelby Hiter via Gemini.
2. Wider Adoption of AI as a Service
AI as a service is already growing in popularity across artificial intelligence and machine learning business use cases, but it is only just beginning to take off for generative AI.
However, as the adoption rate of generative AI technology continues to increase, many more businesses are going to start feeling the pain of falling behind their competitors. When this happens, the companies that are unable or unwilling to invest in the infrastructure to build their own AI models and internal AI teams will likely turn to consultants and managed services firms that specialize in generative AI and have experience with their industry or project type.
Specifically, watch as AI modeling as a service (AIMaaS) grows its market share. More AI companies are going to work toward public offerings of customizable, lightweight, and/or open-source models to extend their reach to new audiences. Generative AI-as-a-service initiatives may also focus heavily on the support framework businesses need to do generative AI well. This will naturally lead to more companies specializing and other companies investing in AI governance and AI security management services, for example.
3. Movement Toward AGI and Related Research
Artificial general intelligence, which is the concept of AI reaching the point where it can outperform humans in most taskwork and critical thinking assignments, is a major buzzword among AI companies today, but so far, it’s little more than that.
Google’s Deepmind is one of the leaders in defining and innovating in this area, along with OpenAI, Meta, Adept AI, and others. At this point, there’s not much agreement on what AGI is, what it will look like, and how AI leaders will know if they’ve reached the point of AGI or not.
So far, most of the research and work on AGI has happened in silos. In the future, AGI will continue to be an R&D priority, but much like other important tech and AI initiatives of the past, it will likely become more collaborative, if for no other reason than to develop a consistent definition and framework for the concept. While AI leaders may not achieve true AGI or anything close to it in the coming years, generative AI will continue to creep closer to this goal while AI companies work to more clearly define it.

4. Significant Workforce Disruption and Reformation
Most experts and tech leaders agree that generative AI is going to significantly change what the workforce and workplace look like, but they’re torn on whether this will be a net positive or net negative for the employees themselves.
In this early stage of workforce impact, generative AI is primarily supporting office workers with automation, AI-powered content and recommendations, analytics, and other resources to help them get through their more mundane and routine tasks. Though there is some skepticism both at the organizational and employee levels, new users continue to discover generative AI’s ability to help them with work like drafting and sending emails, preparing reports, and creating interesting content for social media, all of which saves them time for higher-level strategic work.
Even with these more simplistic use cases, generative AI has already shown its nascent potential to completely change the way we work across industries, sectors, departments, and roles. Early predictions expected generative AI would mostly handle assembly line, manufacturing, and other physical labor work, but to this point, generative AI has made its most immediate and far-reaching impacts on creative, clerical, and customer service tasks and roles.
Workers such as marketers, salespeople, designers, developers, customer service agents, office managers, and assistants are already feeling the effects of this technological innovation and fear that they will eventually lose their jobs to generative AI. Indeed, most experts agree that these jobs and others will not look the same as they do now in just a couple of years. But there are mixed opinions about what the “refactored” workforce will look like for these people — will their job simply change or will it be eliminated entirely?
With all of these unknowns and fears hanging in the air, workplaces and universities are currently working on offering coursework, generative AI certifications, and training programs for professional usage of AI and generative AI. Undergraduate and graduate programs of AI study are beginning to pop up, and in the coming months and years, this degree path may become as common as those in data science or computer science.
5. Increasing Regulatory, Ethical, and Societal Pressures
In March 2024, the EU AI Act that had been discussed and reviewed for several years was officially approved by the EU Parliament. Over the coming months and years, organizations that use AI in the EU or in connection with EU citizen data will be held to this new regulation and its stipulations.
This is the first major regulation to focus on generative AI and its impact on data privacy, but as consumer and societal concerns grow; don’t expect it to be the last. There are already state regulations in California, Virginia, and Colorado, and several industries have their own frameworks and rules for how generative AI can be used.
On a global scale, the United Nations has begun to discuss the importance of AI governance, international collaboration and cooperation, and responsible AI development and deployment through established global frameworks. While it’s unlikely that this will turn into an enforceable global regulation, it is a significant conversation that will likely frame different countries’ and regions’ approaches to ethical AI and regulation.
6. Bigger Emphasis on Security, Privacy, and Governance
More tools like Watson’s OpenScale are likely to pop up independently or as part of generative AI solutions packages as a growing number of business leaders and consumers demand improved AI explainability, transparency, privacy, and overall governance. Source: IBM.
With the regulations already in place and expected to come in the future, not to mention public demand, AI companies and the businesses that use this technology will soon invest more heavily in AI governance technologies, services, and policies, as well as security resources that directly address generative AI vulnerabilities.
A small number of companies are focused on improving their AI governance posture, but as AI usage and fears grow, this will become a greater necessity. Companies will begin to use dedicated AI governance and security platforms on a greater scale, human-in-the-loop AI model and content review will become the standard, and all companies that use generative AI in any capacity will operate with some kind of AI policy to protect against major liabilities and damage.
7. Greater Focus on Quality and Hallucination Management
As governments, regulatory bodies, businesses, and users uncover dangerous, stolen, inaccurate, or otherwise poor results in the content created through generative AI, they’ll continue to put pressure on AI companies to improve their data sourcing and training processes, output quality, and hallucination management strategies.
While an emphasis on quality outcomes is part of many AI companies’ current strategies, this approach and transparency with the public will only expand to help AI leaders maintain reputations and market share.
So what will generative AI quality management look like? Some of today’s leaders are providing hints for the future.
For example, with each generation of its models, OpenAI has improved its accuracy and reduced the frequency of AI hallucinations. In addition to actually doing this work, they’ve also provided detailed documentation and research data to show how their models are working and improving over time.
On a different note, Google’s Gemini already has a fairly comprehensive feedback management system for users, where they can easily give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down with additional feedback sent to Google. They can also modify responses, report legal issues, and double-check generated content against internet sources with a simple click.
These features provide users with the assurance that their feedback matters, which is a win on all sides: Users feel good about the product and Google gets regular user-generated feedback about how their tool is performing.
In a matter of months, I expect to see more generative AI companies adopt this kind of approach for better community-driven quality assurance in generative AI.
8. Widespread Embedded AI for Better Customer Experiences
Many companies are already embedding generative AI into their enterprise and customer-facing tools to improve internal workflows and external user experiences. This is most commonly happening with established generative AI models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which are frequently getting embedded as-is or are being incorporated into users’ preexisting apps, websites, and chatbots.
Expect to see this embedded generative AI approach as an almost-universal part of online experience management in the coming years. Customers will come to expect that generative AI is a core part of their search experiences and will deprioritize the tools that cannot provide tailored answers and recommendations as they research, shop, and plan experiences for themselves.

Generative AI’s Recent Past Suggests Its Future
With how much has happened in the world of generative AI, it’s hard to believe that most people weren’t talking about this technology until OpenAI first launched ChatGPT in November 2022. Many of generative AI’s greatest milestones were reached in 2023, as OpenAI and other hopeful AI startups — not to mention leading cloud companies and other technology companies — raced to develop the highest-quality models and the most compelling use cases for the technology.
Below, we’ve quickly summarized some of generative AI’s biggest developments in 2023, looking both at significant technological advancements and societal impacts:

Continued growth and reshuffling of AI startups: Dozens of generative AI startups opened, closed, rebranded, or partnered with larger tech companies. This constant shuffling continues today.
AI virtual assistants and copilots: Though GitHub Copilot has been around in some form since 2021, most of the Microsoft Copilot technology and other copilots that are being released today first emerged in 2023. These built-in work assistants can help with content generation, enterprise search, coding, data analysis, and more.
LLM-driven search and content generation: Though large language models did not first appear in 2023, the variety and capabilities that we see now mostly developed in 2023. Throughout this past year, vendors have continued to improve models’ transparency, explainability, accuracy, and connectivity with the internet for better and more comprehensive results.
User-friendly and affordable interfaces: A growing number of AI vendors have released free or low-cost versions of their generative AI tools in packages that are not just for business use. For example, Inflection released Pi — a generative AI companion that focuses on human-like conversational AI — in May 2023. Additionally, vendors continue to expand their tools’ usability in mobile and lightweight interfaces that all users can access.
High-powered models with a new focus on multimodality: ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are all top examples of generative AI models that came out with new versions in 2023 that could handle multimodal requests.
Increasing noise about regulations on the horizon: The EU AI Act was first brought forward in 2021, but as it moved through committees and was discussed over the following years, it increased discussions about generative AI regulations and ethics throughout the course of 2023.

Generative AI: The Current Landscape
The generative AI landscape has transformed significantly over the past several months, and it’s poised to continue at this rapid pace. What we’ve covered below is a snapshot of what’s happening with generative AI in early 2024; expect many of these details to shift or change soon, as that has been the nature of the generative AI landscape so far.
Though it has not been widely adopted in many industries, generative AI continues to build its reputation and gain important footholds with both professional and recreational user bases. These are some of the main ways generative AI is being used today:

Personal and recreational LLM usage for simple questions, conversational AI, research support, etc.
Coding and software development, with an emphasis on code completion and quality assurance reviews.
E-commerce and inventory management.
Customer and online experience management (shopping, travel planning, research support, etc.).
Marketing, sales, and general content creation in text and multimedia formats.
Voice and audio synthesis.
Project management, office assistance, and workflow automation.

Consumer Trust and Ethical Considerations
According to Forrester’s December 2023 Consumer Pulse Survey results, “only 29% agreed that they would trust information from gen AI” and “45% of online adults agreed that gen AI poses a serious threat to society.” In the same results, though, 50% believed that this technology could also help them to find the information they need more effectively.
Clearly, public sentiment on generative AI is currently very mixed. In North America, in particular, there’s excitement and interest in the technology, with more users experimenting with generative AI tools than in most other parts of the globe. However, even among those with enthusiasm for generative AI, there is a general caution about data security, ethics, and the general trust gap that comes with a lack of transparency, misuse and abuse possibilities like deepfakes, and fears about future job security.
To earn consumer trust, more ethical AI measures must be taken at the regulatory and company levels. The EU AI Act, which recently passed into law, is a great step in this direction, as it specifies banned apps and use cases, obligations for high-risk systems, transparency obligations, and more to ensure private data is protected. However, it is also the responsibility of AI companies and businesses that use AI to be transparent, ethical, and responsible beyond what this regulation requires.
Taking steps toward more ethical AI will not only bolster their reputation and customer base but also put in place safeguards to prevent harmful AI from taking over in the future.

Strategies for Navigating the Future of Generative AI
Generative AI is clearly here to stay, regardless of whether your business chooses to incorporate this technology. The key to working with generative AI without letting it overrun your business priorities is to go in with well-defined effective AI strategies and clear-cut goals for using AI in a beneficial way. Some of these strategies may help:
Create an AI Strategy Specific to Your Business
This strategy should explain what technologies can be used, who can use them, how they can be used, and more. Keep strategies and policies both flexible and iterative as technologies, priorities, and regulations change.
Support Employees Through Role and Workplace Transitions
At the rate generative AI innovation is moving, there’s little doubt that existing jobs will be uprooted or transformed entirely. To support your workforce and ease some of this stress, be the type of employer that offers upskilling and training resources that will help staffers — and your company — in the long run.
Think Globally and Collaboratively
If you’re in a position of power or influence, consider doing work to mitigate the increasing global inequities that are likely to come from widespread generative AI adoption.
Partner with firms in developing countries, work toward generative AI innovations that benefit people and the planet, and support multilingual solutions and data training that are globally unbiased.
In general, partnering with leaders in other countries and organizations will lead to better technology and outcomes for all.
Embrace AI Innovations With Caution
Especially in the pursuit of AGI, be cautious about how you use generative AI and how these tools interact with your data and intellectual property. While generative AI has massive positive potential, the same can be said for its potential to do harm. Pay attention to how generative AI innovations are transpiring and don’t be afraid to hold AI companies accountable for a more responsible AI approach.
Bottom Line: Preparing for the Future of Generative AI
Generative AI has already proven its remarkable potential to reshape industries, economies, and societies even more than initially thought. Research firms and technology companies are continually adjusting their predictions for the future of generative AI, realizing that the technology may be able to take on more of the physical taskwork and cognitive work that human workers do — and by a much earlier date — than previously assumed.
But with this incredible technological development should come a heavy dose of caution and careful planning. Generative AI developers and users alike must consider the ethical implications of this technology and continue to do the work to keep it transparent, explainable, and aligned with public preferences and opinions for how this technology should be used. They must also consider some of the more far-reaching consequences — such as greater global disparities between the rich and the poor and more damage to the environment — and look for creative ways to create generative AI that truly does more good than harm.
So what’s the best way forward toward a hopeful future for generative AI? Collaboration. AI leaders, users, and skeptics from all over the globe, different lines of work, and different areas of expertise must collaboratively navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by generative AI to ensure a future that benefits all.

How can MIT’s community leverage generative AI to support learning and work on campus and beyond?
At MIT’s Festival of Learning 2024, faculty and instructors, students, staff, and alumni exchanged perspectives about the digital tools and innovations they’re experimenting with in the classroom. Panelists agreed that generative AI should be used to scaffold — not replace — learning experiences.
This annual event, co-sponsored by MIT Open Learning and the Office of the Vice Chancellor, celebrates teaching and learning innovations. When introducing new teaching and learning technologies, panelists stressed the importance of iteration and teaching students how to develop critical thinking skills while leveraging technologies like generative AI.
“The Festival of Learning brings the MIT community together to explore and celebrate what we do every day in the classroom,” said Christopher Capozzola, senior associate dean for open learning. “This year's deep dive into generative AI was reflective and practical — yet another remarkable instance of ‘mind and hand’ here at the Institute.”

            2024 Festival of Learning: Highlights        

    



Incorporating generative AI into learning experiences 
MIT faculty and instructors aren’t just willing to experiment with generative AI — some believe it’s a necessary tool to prepare students to be competitive in the workforce. “In a future state, we will know how to teach skills with generative AI, but we need to be making iterative steps to get there instead of waiting around,” said Melissa Webster, lecturer in managerial communication at MIT Sloan School of Management. 
Some educators are revisiting their courses’ learning goals and redesigning assignments so students can achieve the desired outcomes in a world with AI. Webster, for example, previously paired written and oral assignments so students would develop ways of thinking. But, she saw an opportunity for teaching experimentation with generative AI. If students are using tools such as ChatGPT to help produce writing, Webster asked, “how do we still get the thinking part in there?”
One of the new assignments Webster developed asked students to generate cover letters through ChatGPT and critique the results from the perspective of future hiring managers. Beyond learning how to refine generative AI prompts to produce better outputs, Webster shared that “students are thinking more about their thinking.” Reviewing their ChatGPT-generated cover letter helped students determine what to say and how to say it, supporting their development of higher-level strategic skills like persuasion and understanding audiences.
Takako Aikawa, senior lecturer at the MIT Global Studies and Languages Section, redesigned a vocabulary exercise to ensure students developed a deeper understanding of the Japanese language, rather than just right or wrong answers. Students compared short sentences written by themselves and by ChatGPT and developed broader vocabulary and grammar patterns beyond the textbook. “This type of activity enhances not only their linguistic skills but stimulates their metacognitive or analytical thinking,” said Aikawa. “They have to think in Japanese for these exercises.”
While these panelists and other Institute faculty and instructors are redesigning their assignments, many MIT undergraduate and graduate students across different academic departments are leveraging generative AI for efficiency: creating presentations, summarizing notes, and quickly retrieving specific ideas from long documents. But this technology can also creatively personalize learning experiences. Its ability to communicate information in different ways allows students with different backgrounds and abilities to adapt course material in a way that’s specific to their particular context. 
Generative AI, for example, can help with student-centered learning at the K-12 level. Joe Diaz, program manager and STEAM educator for MIT pK-12 at Open Learning, encouraged educators to foster learning experiences where the student can take ownership. “Take something that kids care about and they’re passionate about, and they can discern where [generative AI] might not be correct or trustworthy,” said Diaz.
Panelists encouraged educators to think about generative AI in ways that move beyond a course policy statement. When incorporating generative AI into assignments, the key is to be clear about learning goals and open to sharing examples of how generative AI could be used in ways that align with those goals. 
The importance of critical thinking
Although generative AI can have positive impacts on educational experiences, users need to understand why large language models might produce incorrect or biased results. Faculty, instructors, and student panelists emphasized that it’s critical to contextualize how generative AI works. “[Instructors] try to explain what goes on in the back end and that really does help my understanding when reading the answers that I’m getting from ChatGPT or Copilot,” said Joyce Yuan, a senior in computer science. 
Jesse Thaler, professor of physics and director of the National Science Foundation Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, warned about trusting a probabilistic tool to give definitive answers without uncertainty bands. “The interface and the output needs to be of a form that there are these pieces that you can verify or things that you can cross-check,” Thaler said.
When introducing tools like calculators or generative AI, the faculty and instructors on the panel said it’s essential for students to develop critical thinking skills in those particular academic and professional contexts. Computer science courses, for example, could permit students to use ChatGPT for help with their homework if the problem sets are broad enough that generative AI tools wouldn’t capture the full answer. However, introductory students who haven’t developed the understanding of programming concepts need to be able to discern whether the information ChatGPT generated was accurate or not.
Ana Bell, senior lecturer of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MITx digital learning scientist, dedicated one class toward the end of the semester of Course 6.100L (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python) to teach students how to use ChatGPT for programming questions. She wanted students to understand why setting up generative AI tools with the context for programming problems, inputting as many details as possible, will help achieve the best possible results. “Even after it gives you a response back, you have to be critical about that response,” said Bell. By waiting to introduce ChatGPT until this stage, students were able to look at generative AI’s answers critically because they had spent the semester developing the skills to be able to identify whether problem sets were incorrect or might not work for every case. 
A scaffold for learning experiences
The bottom line from the panelists during the Festival of Learning was that generative AI should provide scaffolding for engaging learning experiences where students can still achieve desired learning goals. The MIT undergraduate and graduate student panelists found it invaluable when educators set expectations for the course about when and how it’s appropriate to use AI tools. Informing students of the learning goals allows them to understand whether generative AI will help or hinder their learning. Student panelists asked for trust that they would use generative AI as a starting point, or treat it like a brainstorming session with a friend for a group project. Faculty and instructor panelists said they will continue iterating their lesson plans to best support student learning and critical thinking. 
Panelists from both sides of the classroom discussed the importance of generative AI users being responsible for the content they produce and avoiding automation bias — trusting the technology’s response implicitly without thinking critically about why it produced that answer and whether it’s accurate. But since generative AI is built by people making design decisions, Thaler told students, “You have power to change the behavior of those tools.”

EU and Japan strengthen joint work on digital identity, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence






Thierry Breton @ThierryBreton 








The EU and Japan held their second Digital Partnership Council in Brussels on April 30. Thierry Breton, the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Taro Kono, the Japanese Minister for Digital Transformation, co-chaired the Council along with Takeaki Matsumoto, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, and Taku Ishii, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry.
During the meeting, the EU and Japan reaffirmed the significance of their strategic partnership to promote shared values and a vision for digital transformation that prioritises people and fundamental rights. Both parties also acknowledged the successful implementation of the Digital Partnership and reviewed the progress made since the first Digital Partnership Council in 2023. They agreed on a list of new deliverables to further cooperate on core digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, 6G, semiconductors, high-performance computing (HPC), and quantum technology. The two countries also aim to strengthen data and platform economy collaboration, submarine cables, eID, and cybersecurity.
The EU and Japan are among the most significant digital economies in the world. They launched the first-ever Digital Partnership on May 12 2022, during the 29th Japan-EU summit in Tokyo. The partnership aims to advance Cooperation on digital issues primarily through collaborative research on cutting-edge technologies, regulatory dialogue and convergence, and shaping common positions in international fora. The EU-Japan Digital Partnership is part of the EU’s strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, which aims to strengthen the EU’s partnerships in Asia. 
The EU and Japan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation
The European Union and Japan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to collaborate on digital identities and trust services. The agreement will promote a shared understanding of digital identity initiatives between the two countries, which will benefit e-commerce and business opportunities by increasing efficiency and reducing bureaucracy. The Memorandum aims to facilitate data-free flow with trust through Cooperation and use cases based on the EU Digital Identity Wallet and trust services. It is expected to be presented as a “joint best practice” at the next OECD Ministerial meeting scheduled for May 2-3, 2024.
Furthermore, in semiconductors, the EU and Japan established a team of experts to develop a research programme to implement the Memorandum of Cooperation signed in July 2023. They are also preparing an administrative arrangement to foster the exchange of information on public support schemes. 
The EU and Japan will continue their joint work on high-performance computing (HPC) and have identified hybrid quantum-HPC applications to further cooperate. They will also consider topics for joint projects in basic quantum research. The two partners are also exploring Cooperation on cybersecurity, including standards and ways to address the skills gap. 
Regarding 6G technologies, the EU and Japan have launched collaborative research projects and intend to support global standardisation initiatives, which are crucial in developing 6G technologies. Both parties reaffirmed their shared vision for open and resilient networks.
The EU and Japan also announced their intention to enhance Cooperation between the EU AI Office and Japan’s AI Safety Institute. They will continue supporting the G7 Hiroshima AI Process and Code of Conduct to shape trustworthy AI global governance. The EU also encouraged Japanese companies to participate in the AI Pact launched by the Commission to foster early compliance with key provisions of the AI Act voluntarily before it enters into force and becomes generally applicable. 
The EU and Japan confirmed the importance of deploying secure and resilient submarine cable infrastructures in line with the Memorandum of Cooperation on submarine cables for secure, resilient, and sustainable global connectivity signed on July 3, 2023, between the European Commission and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Both parties will continue Cooperation on developing direct connectivity links between Europe and Japan, such as via the Arctic, to bring forward commercial opportunities, trusted cross-border data flows, and oceanographic research.
Lastly, to ensure a safe online environment where freedom of expression is guaranteed, the EU and Japan agreed to explore establishing a regular information-sharing channel on online platform regulations, such as the European Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts. 
The parties will meet in Tokyo, Japan, 2025 for the next Digital Partnership Council.

At AWS re:Invent 2023, we previewed Amazon Q Business, a generative artificial intelligence (generative AI)–powered assistant that can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in your enterprise systems.
With Amazon Q Business, you can deploy a secure, private, generative AI assistant that empowers your organization’s users to be more creative, data-driven, efficient, prepared, and productive. During the preview, we heard lots of customer feedback and used that feedback to prioritize our enhancements to the service.
Today, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon Q Business with many new features, including custom plugins, and a preview of Amazon Q Apps, generative AI–powered customized and sharable applications using natural language in a single step for your organization.
In this blog post, I will briefly introduce the key features of Amazon Q Business with the new features now available and take a look at the features of Amazon Q Apps. Let’s get started!
Introducing Amazon Q Business Amazon Q Business connects seamlessly to over 40 popular enterprise data sources and stores document and permission information, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Microsoft 365, and Salesforce. It ensures that you access content securely with existing credentials using single sign-on, according to your permissions, and also includes enterprise-level access controls.

Amazon Q Business makes it easy for users to get answers to questions like company policies, products, business results, or code, using its web-based chat assistant. You can point Amazon Q Business at your enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search across all data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog with users.
With Amazon Q Business, you can build secure and private generative AI assistants with enterprise-grade access controls at scale. You can also use administrative guardrails, document enrichment, and relevance tuning to customize and control responses that are consistent with your company’s guidelines.
Here are the key features of Amazon Q Business with new features now available:
End-user web experience With the built-in web experience, you can ask a question, receive a response, and then ask follow-up questions and add new information with in-text source citations while keeping the context from the previous answer. You can only get a response from data sources that you have access to.

With general availability, we’re introducing a new content creation mode in the web experience. In this mode, Amazon Q Business does not use or access the enterprise content but instead uses generative AI models built into Amazon Q Business for creative use cases such as summarization of responses and crafting personalized emails. To use the content creation mode, you can turn off Respond from approved sources in the conversation settings.

To learn more, visit Using an Amazon Q Business web experience and Customizing an Amazon Q Business web experience in the AWS documentation.
Pre-built data connectors and plugins You can connect, index, and sync your enterprise data using over 40 pre-built data connectors or an Amazon Kendra retriever, as well as web crawling or uploading your documents directly.
Amazon Q Business ingests content using a built-in semantic document retriever. It also retrieves and respects permission information such as access control lists (ACLs) to allow it to manage access to the data after retrieval. When the data is ingested, your data is secured with the Service-managed key of AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

You can configure plugins to perform actions in enterprise systems, including Jira, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. Users can create a Jira issue or a Salesforce case while chatting in the chat assistant. You can also deploy a Microsoft Teams gateway or a Slack gateway to use an Amazon Q Business assistant in your teams or channels.
With general availability, you can build custom plugins to connect to any third-party application through APIs so that users can use natural language prompts to perform actions such as submitting time-off requests or sending meeting invites directly through Amazon Q Business assistant. Users can also search real-time data, such as time-off balances, scheduled meetings, and more.

When you choose Custom plugin, you can define an OpenAPI schema to connect your third-party application. You can upload the OpenAPI schema to Amazon S3 or copy it to the Amazon Q Business console in-line schema editor compatible with the Swagger OpenAPI specification.

To learn more, visit Data source connectors and Configure plugins in the AWS documentation.
Admin control and guardrails You can configure global controls to give users the option to either generate large language model (LLM)-only responses or generate responses from connected data sources. You can specify whether all chat responses will be generated using only enterprise data or whether your application can also use its underlying LLM to generate responses when it can’t find answers in your enterprise data. You can also block specific words.
With topic-level controls, you can specify restricted topics and configure behavior rules in response to the topics, such as answering using enterprise data or blocking completely.

To learn more, visit Admin control and guardrails in the AWS documentation.
You can alter document metadata or attributes and content during the document ingestion process by configuring basic logic to specify a metadata field name, select a condition, and enter or select a value and target actions, such as update or delete. You can also use AWS Lambda functions to manipulate document fields and content, such as using optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.

To learn more, visit Document attributes and types in Amazon Q Business and Document enrichment in Amazon Q Business in the AWS documentation.
Enhanced enterprise-grade security and management Starting April 30, you will need to use AWS IAM Identity Center for user identity management of all new applications rather than using the legacy identity management. You can securely connect your workforce to Amazon Q Business applications either in the web experience or your own interface.

You can also centrally manage workforce access using IAM Identity Center alongside your existing IAM roles and policies. As the number of your accounts scales, IAM Identity Center gives you the option to use it as a single place to manage user access to all your applications. To learn more, visit Setting up Amazon Q Business with IAM Identity Center in the AWS documentation.
At general availability, Amazon Q Business is now integrated with various AWS services to securely connect and store the data and easily deploy and track access logs.
You can use AWS PrivateLink to access Amazon Q Business securely in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment using a VPC endpoint. You can use the Amazon Q Business template for AWS CloudFormation to easily automate the creation and provisioning of infrastructure resources. You can also use AWS CloudTrail to record actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service in Amazon Q Business.
Also, we support Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) endpoints, based on the United States and Canadian government standards and security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information.
To learn more, visit Security in Amazon Q Business and Monitoring Amazon Q Business in the AWS documentation.
Build and share apps with new Amazon Q Apps (preview) Today we are announcing the preview of Amazon Q Apps, a new capability within Amazon Q Business for your organization’s users to easily and quickly create generative AI-powered apps based on company data, without requiring any prior coding experience.
With Amazon Q Apps, users simply describe the app they want, in natural language, or they can take an existing conversation where Amazon Q Business helped them solve a problem. With a few clicks, Amazon Q Business will instantly generate an app that accomplishes their desired task that can be easily shared across their organization.
If you are familiar with PartyRock, you can easily use this code-free builder with the added benefit of connecting it to your enterprise data already with Amazon Q Business.
To create a new Amazon Q App, choose Apps in your web experience and enter a simple text expression for a task in the input box. You can try out samples, such as a content creator, interview question generator, meeting note summarizer, and grammar checker.
I will make a document assistant to review and correct a document using the following prompt:

You are a professional editor tasked with reviewing and correcting a document for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and inconsistencies in style and tone. Given a file, your goal is to recommend changes to ensure that the document adheres to the highest standards of writing while preserving the author’s original intent and meaning. You should provide a numbered list for all suggested revisions and the supporting reason.


When you choose the Generate button, a document editing assistant app will be automatically generated with two cards—one to upload a document file as an input and another text output card that gives edit suggestions.

When you choose the Add card button, you can add more cards, such as a user input, text output, file upload, or pre-configured plugin by your administrator. If you want to create a Jira ticket to request publishing a post in the corporate blog channel as an author, you can add a Jira Plugin with the result of edited suggestions from the uploaded file.

Once you are ready to share the app, choose the Publish button. You can securely share this app to your organization’s catalog for others to use, enhancing productivity. Your colleagues can choose shared apps, modify them, and publish their own versions to the organizational catalog instead of starting from scratch.

Choose Library to see all of the published Amazon Q Apps. You can search the catalog by labels and open your favorite apps.

Amazon Q Apps inherit robust security and governance controls from Amazon Q Business, including user authentication and access controls, which empower organizations to safely share apps across functions that warrant governed collaboration and innovation.
In the administrator console, you can see your Amazon Q Apps and control or remove them from the library.

To learn more, visit Amazon Q Apps in the AWS documentation.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword when it comes to cybersecurity — and will be a core driver of demand for new cybersecurity professionals, according to the keynote speaker at an event organized by the Washington State Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.
Generative AI, said Jim Reavis, CEO of the nonprofit Cloud Security Alliance, is “the change dynamic that’s sort of the elephant in the room.”
“Generative AI creates a lot of work for us in that it creates all these new, different attack vectors,” said Reavis, ranging from potentially more effective phishing emails to more rapid, automated vulnerability scanning. “It’s going to create all these zero day vulnerabilities.”
But Reavis said simultaneously, the cybersecurity profession has taken notice of generative AI’s potential.
“Every cybersecurity company is trying to figure out how they leverage generative AI to actually make their solutions better,” he said, including using it to scale up solutions and “automate things that you didn’t think you could automate before.”
Reavis’ keynote was part of an afternoon-long public event last Wednesday in Bellingham, Wash., called, “Securing the Next Generation of Technology Workers.” 
The focus, however, was directly on cybersecurity since the venue — Whatcom Community College — hosts several state or federal cybersecurity initiatives, including both the National Cybersecurity Training & Education Center (NCyTE), funded by the National Science Foundation, and the state’s Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (CCoE).
More need for more pros
Brent Lundstrom, director of CCoE, said AI is just one of several developments spurring demand for more professionals and new positions. He said, in talking with industry in his role directing the statewide cybersecurity information hub, that the move to “cloud-first” infrastructure is another factor.
“People used to be running their own servers and owning those servers and now they’re doing that in a public cloud environment,” he said. “It brings in a lot of different complications.”
Another trend contributing to demand? Growing organization concerns about “governance, risk and compliance,” the types of regulation and policy matters that can also overlap with AI. 
“There’s a concern about your privacy and what you put into the AI technologies and how that information is stored,” he said.
All told, Lundstrom estimated there were more than 7,500 unfilled jobs in cybersecurity across the state and the CCoE, founded in 2022, was continuing to work to bring employer needs and cybersecurity workforce education into better alignment. 
Reavis cited estimates that, in total, there were 5.5 million cybersecurity professionals today. He compared that to the roughly 12 million police officers at work. 
“When you understand and think about technology enveloping us like never before, and more and more of our life depends upon it, you can easily make the case that that 5 million cybersecurity professionals is a drop in the bucket,” Reavis said.
Advice to students and industry

About 100 employers, educators and students — including those from Whatcom Community College’s cybersecurity program — attended the afternoon forum. 
As part of the event, a panel of cybersecurity leaders from Boeing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, TIRO Security, the Washington State Auditor’s Office and the Cloud Security Alliance offered career advice to the students and potential students in the audience.
One repeated theme: Students should network, whether it’s in person at inexpensive regional BSides cybersecurity conferences or virtually with professionals on LinkedIn. And industry should reach out to education programs to get involved with students’ capstone projects and create more internships.
“I’d also love to see more industry internships turn into full-time jobs,” said Jessica Lewallen, IT security auditor in the Washington State Auditor’s Office. She described her earlier career progression from an internship role to full-time work with the City of Anacortes as “let’s find somebody here who can at least mostly do the job and we’ll train them from there.”
“That was amazing for my career,” she said. “I’d love to see more of those opportunities.”
All the recent developments lead to a future cybersecurity workforce that keynoter Reavis said will have to be able to knowledgeably apply a broad and likely AI-enhanced tool set.
“The amount of creativity, the amount of patience, the amount of thinking outside of the box, the amount of not just following instructions, but having real creativity, using all the different skill sets you have, become really important in how we’re able to be cyber warriors,” he said. “How we’re able to protect things.”

It was revealed that there is currently no direct correlation nor is this something to change “at least in the short run,” due to limitations of the technology. The report said:“It is not yet able to reliably do multi-step work that involves planning, reasoning, or memory.”The study cited previous work in 2023 that administered hundreds of questions requiring the aforementioned skills to both humans and top-performing AI systems. On average, humans scored 92% correct answers, while machines came in at only 15%.Nonetheless, the study said that generative AI is on track to improve quickly with “intense research” to understand how to troubleshoot its weaknesses. Related: OpenAI hit with privacy complaint in Austria, potential EU law breachIt used an example of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 system, the version released in late 2022 that was a major catalyst for the current AI frenzy, performing better than only 10% of humans on the United States bar exam. Its successor, GPT-4, performed better than 90% only a year later.It concluded that “there is no shortage of important work to be done in every society. A great deal of this work… can’t be done by the robots and AI of today, as powerful as they are.” The new Industrial RevolutionThe Google-released study called AI a “general purpose technology” and likened it to the steam engine, which was the spark that ignited the global Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s.Unlike the gradual spread of technology during the Industrial Revolution, the impacts of generative AI are anticipated to manifest more swiftly.The study highlighted primarily that this is due to the existing infrastructure being largely in place, allowing for swift global implementation of improvements and because it is easily accessible for people to begin working with.“Most generative AI’s users don’t have to master a new user interface or programming language… It requires time and practice to become proficient at interacting with generative AI, but it doesn’t require many ‘computer skills.’”Transforming the workforce According to the study, while the technology may not cause “massive technological unemployment,” there is enough evidence that it could contribute to “hollowing out” the labor force among higher-paying jobs.“For all the work done in a modern economy finds that generative AI affects more of the tasks done by college graduates than by high-school only graduates.” There is also potential for the technology to disrupt the way competition between businesses plays out. The report states that generative AI could further empower a small group of “superstars” in a given industry in a way that would allow them outpace their rivals. “Fading incumbents will conduct layoffs, and the number of people who need to find new jobs and acquire new skills will increase,” it said. However, according to research, companies that had invested heavily in machine learning were not the ones conducting layoffs.

After being named an AI2050 Early Career Fellow, Wharton Assistant Professor of Operations, Information, and Decisions Daniel Rock discussed his goals and plans for the position and the potential implications of AI with The Daily Pennsylvanian.

The AI2050 initiative focuses on addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with artificial intelligence, and has developed a working list of these problems that it can help researchers in solving. Rock, by joining the second cohort of young researchers named to the position, will receive up to $300,000 from Schmidt Sciences, a philanthropic organization dedicated to fostering the advancement of science and technology.

Following individuals' nominations for the honor, fellows are required to submit a proposal to help articulate how they hope to solve a problem related to AI2050’s central motivating question — if AI is ""hugely beneficial"" to society in 2050, what happened and what were the most important problems solved along the way?

In his interview with the DP, Rock spoke about the implications of AI beyond its scientific technicalities. He described AI as not ""just about algorithms and computer science, [but] about social impact, economic impact, and so on.”

Rock highlighted the program’s ability to support researchers doing interdisciplinary work that may be otherwise difficult to fund, specifically focusing on the $300,000 award to fellows.

“They [Schmidt Sciences] are committed to enabling work that is difficult to otherwise enable,” he said. 
	






Professor Rock’s research has previously focused on the economic effects of digital technologies, emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence. He said that he will build upon his experience with labor driven data sets to make a new toolkit, which will analyze unstructured economic data of labor market trends to measure the impact of artificial intelligence on “job creation and technological dissemination,” according to Schmidt Sciences. 

Rock also said that he aims to pave the way for future economic research by creating open-sourced large language model encoders, which will enable other researchers to use the data sets for distinct research areas. 

“The impact of this kind of work can be much bigger if we can bring in lots of people to bring their creativity and intelligence to it, too,” he said.

Rock added that his previous inquiries into questions regarding how technology will change workers’ position within the workforce will help inform his future research agenda, which focuses on identifying and measuring long term trends. 

Although fellows do not typically collaborate with each other and focus on their area of expertise, Professor Rock will work alongside numerous other colleagues on the project. This includes Stanford researcher Erik Brynjolfsson, Chapman researcher Sarah Bana, Boston College researcher Sebastian Steffen, and other Ph.D. students and faculty at Wharton.

Rock told the DP that he looks forward to continuing to collaborate with colleagues to execute this project and is “very grateful to be part of [the] program.”

Outsizing the city states’ limited manpower, AI is increasing Singapore’s manufacturing output, optimizing customs facilitation, creating new jobs, and spurring innovation. Though many in Singapore are poised to benefit from the adoption of AI technologies, including automation and robotization, some will not. Low-wage migrant workers, who have long played a critical role in the country’s economy and relationships with its neighbors, are extremely vulnerable to job displacement. As AI automation shifts conceptions of value and expertise, challenges may compound for workers long treated as expendable in the world’s most expensive city. Concerns about job security in the age of artificial intelligence are ubiquitous. However, Singapore’s ambitions for global leadership in AI have fueled efforts to upskill and future-proof the workforce from these anxieties. Since 2015, Singapore’s proactive SkillsFuture Initiative has provided citizens and residents over the age of 25 subsidized access to thousands of courses and job transition support. In 2023 alone, about 520,000 individuals participated in training programs supported by the initiative. Singapore’s workforce has been the world’s fastest in adopting AI skills. Singapore’s lifelong learning initiatives have been lauded as an example of inclusive workforce development. Notably, SkillsFuture subsidies are increased for those more traditionally disadvantaged in digital adoption, including older professionals and people with disabilities. However, the exclusion of migrant workers from these programs challenges Singapore’s expressed commitment to inclusivity. Many of these workers already accrue substantial debt from basic training and certification fees needed to work in Singapore, let alone additional expenses to develop digital skills. Without careful regulations, artificial intelligence will exacerbate socioeconomic divides between workers in Singapore and across the region. Singapore must evaluate its responsibilities to the transnational division of labor as it sets an example for AI adoption. To start, the challenges that AI poses to the region’s low-wage workers must be included in Singapore’s domestic and foreign policy discussions. Of the city-state’s 1.4 million foreign workers in 2019, 999,000 were low-wage work permit holders. With the prospect of higher wages in Singapore, workers from South and Southeast Asia move to the city state for roles in construction, manufacturing, shipping, services, and domestic work. Migrant workers fill crucial gaps for jobs that resident Singaporeans see as undesirable, accounting for about one out of three low-wage service jobs in Singapore. This relationship allows Singapore to hold its unemployment rate steady even as labor demand ebbs and flows — taking in migrant laborers when they are needed and sending them home when they are not. The COVID-19 pandemic was a harrowing display of the exploitative nature of this cycle. With economic uncertainty, border closures, and spikes in xenophobic sentiment, foreign workers were the hardest hit by country-wide unemployment. In total, 181,500 foreigners in Singapore lost their jobs at the height of the pandemic — far exceeding foreign unemployment during prior financial crises. With tightened restrictions on foreign work permits, many migrant workers suddenly had to uproot their lives and leave the country. During this period, those classified as “low-skilled” foreign workers made up 76 percent of job losses. Technological adoption spurred by the pandemic may render some job losses permanent. A joint survey by Microsoft and IDC Asia Pacific found that nearly three quarters of Singapore's firms accelerated their pace of digitalization due to COVID-19. At the same time, Singapore increased its deployment of AI-powered robots, particularly in sectors normally occupied by migrant workers. To keep up with these changes, it is estimated that Singapore needs 1.2 million additional digitally skilled workers to join its workforce by 2025. As a result, many more may be forced to leave Singapore’s workforce. Oxford Economics estimates that each new industrial robot wipes out 1.6 manufacturing jobs, with the least-skilled regions of a country doubly as affected as higher-skilled regions. As the second most robot-dense country in the world, the socioeconomic impacts of robotization are substantial. Singapore now has 730 industrial robots per every 10,000 employees, with an average 27 percent increase each year since 2015. During this same period, employment in Singapore’s manufacturing sector decreased every year, even as Singapore’s manufacturing industry grew. The seemingly inverse correlation between employment rate and economic output underscores a shifting valuation of manual labor in Singapore. Artificial intelligence may exacerbate the dehumanization and devaluation of migrant worker contributions to Singapore. For workers, this may result in lower wages and worse standards of living and employment. Conditions for migrant workers in Singapore are already subpar. Migrants from India and Bangladesh make one-sixth of the average Singaporean salary, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, segregated dormitories for Singapore’s foreign workers received international attention for their deplorable state. Singapore’s changing labor demands also impact neighboring countries. According to Singapore University of Social Sciences economist Walter Theseira, when jobless migrant workers return home, they bring the societal costs of unemployment with them. These challenges are exacerbated for even poorer populations in source countries. Working experience in Singapore could give former migrant workers an advantage for employment in their home countries, which might displace those who never had the funds or opportunity to leave. Singapore undermines its commitments to narrowing the development gap among member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and leading inclusive AI adoption if it does not address its role in the looming wave of transnational unemployment. The global push for AI regulation-setting is an opportune time for Singapore to introduce reforms for ethical, responsible, and mutually empowering labor migration. The first change is sociocultural. With AI automation redefining productivity, it is more important than ever for Singapore to distinguish an individual’s economic contributions from their personal skill and success. After all, one in five migrant workers are employed as foreign domestic workers, making invaluable contributions to the care of Singaporean families despite little economic acknowledgment or compensation for reproductive labor. The language of “low-skilled” to describe work that requires little to no professional training devalues social and vocational contributions of Singapore’s lowest paid workers. A preoccupation with efficiency may distort conceptions of what it means to be human and what it means to be Singaporean in the digital age. A notable example is Singapore’s centuries-old hawker culture, which is at high risk of disappearing as more youth aspire to become professionals, managers, executives, or technicians (PMETs) in Singapore. Rethinking Singapore’s “low-skilled,” “semi-skilled,” and “high-skilled” labels can reverse dehumanizing perceptions and practices toward foreign workers as well as foster a more constructive society-wide relationship with artificial intelligence. Second, Singapore should push to safeguard rights for AI-affected migrant workers in Southeast Asia. One worker rights organization proposes that Singapore establish a buffer period for displaced workers to find a new job before facing deportation. Setting an ASEAN-wide standard could help protect workers on every level of the intraregional labor market. Additionally, Singapore should lead research efforts to examine how AI will influence job displacement and skill demands in the region. Regular reports on these trends can prepare the integrated economies for potential labor supply shocks, while also informing working-age individuals on how to enhance their competitiveness in line with the bloc’s longer-term digital economy goals. While these initiatives might offer greater benefits to worker-sending nations than to Singapore, taking leadership on ASEAN-wide labor rights could signify that Singapore recognizes the contributions of foreign workers to the city-state’s success story. This generates potential to enhance Singapore’s relationships with its neighbors, address past controversies regarding worker rights violations, and position Singapore as a leader in both AI and its ethical adoption. As Singapore integrates artificial intelligence technologies across its economy, the rights and future of Singapore's low-wage migrant workers will become an increasingly pressing issue for Southeast Asia. The international community must pay attention to how Singapore’s decisions set a precedent for AI in the global landscape of labor.

<p><em>By</em> <strong>Zahid Lone </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked both awe and apprehension. While hailed for its potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes, there's a growing concern that AI could pose a significant threat to employment generation. This sentiment has ignited a fervent debate among experts and policymakers worldwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proponents of AI argue that it has the capacity to enhance productivity, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. From automated manufacturing processes to intelligent customer service systems, AI applications promise to streamline operations and unlock new avenues for growth. Advocates often highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities, particularly in specialized fields such as data science, machine learning, and robotics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, amidst the optimism, skeptics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of widespread AI adoption. One of the most pressing apprehensions revolves around the displacement of human labour by intelligent machines. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there's a looming threat that they could render certain jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and economic upheaval. The manufacturing industry serves as a poignant example of this phenomenon. With the rise of automated assembly lines and robotic technologies, traditional manufacturing roles have dwindled, leaving many workers displaced. Similar trends are observed across various sectors, including retail, transportation, and customer service, where AI-powered solutions are increasingly replacing human workers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, the integration of AI into white-collar professions is raising concerns about the future of knowledge-based jobs. Advanced algorithms and machine learning are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once exclusive to human intellect, such as data analysis, legal research, and even creative endeavors like content generation. This shift poses a significant challenge for workers whose livelihoods depend on cognitive skills and expertise. Critics caution that unless proactive measures are taken to address the potential socio-economic ramifications of AI, the widening gap between technological advancement and employment opportunities could exacerbate inequality and social unrest. As AI continues to reshape the labour market, policymakers face the daunting task of navigating the delicate balance between innovation and job preservation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response to these challenges, calls for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment are gaining traction. Investing in education and training is paramount for preparing individuals for an AI-driven economy. This involves prioritizing lifelong learning programs that impart technical skills like data science and programming, as well as nurturing critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity. By prioritizing education, societies can ensure their workforce remains agile and equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reskilling and upskilling initiatives are vital to help workers transition into new roles that complement AI technologies. Governments and businesses should invest in tailored programs catering to diverse industries and demographics, ensuring inclusivity and preventing anyone from being left behind due to automation. Empowering individuals through reskilling and upskilling opportunities enables them to adapt to changing job requirements and seize new employment prospects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ethical AI deployment and robust social safety nets are essential components in shaping a future where AI augments human capabilities while safeguarding against negative impacts on employment. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks ensures responsible AI deployment, mitigating unintended consequences like bias and discrimination. Implementing social safety nets such as universal basic income and healthcare coverage provides support for workers facing job displacement, fostering economic stability and facilitating retraining for alternative employment opportunities. Embracing these strategies fosters a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility, leading to a more resilient and equitable society for all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the debate over the impact of AI on employment rages on, one thing remains clear: the need for a proactive and inclusive approach to harnessing the potential of this transformative technology. While AI undoubtedly holds the promise of unparalleled progress, its implications for the future of work must be carefully considered to ensure a sustainable and equitable society in the age of automation. Thus, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges for employment generation. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity and innovation across various sectors, there are legitimate concerns about its impact on job displacement and economic inequality. To navigate this complex landscape, proactive measures such as investing in education, reskilling initiatives, ethical AI deployment, and robust social safety nets are crucial. By embracing these strategies, societies can harness the transformative power of AI while ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all in the age of automation.</p>

Top 10 Generative AI Tools You Need to Know
1. ChatGPT
ChatGPT is the most well-known AI chatbot on the market and is extremely easy to use. Simply enter a written query or prompt and press enter, and the solution will use natural language processing (NLP) to scan your input and generate a written response.Advertisements




This tool is a general-purpose AI assistant, meaning the user can ask questions as part of a back-and-forth conversation or use it to create written content such as articles, emails, lists, poems, songs, code, and stories.
To start using it, visit https://chat.openai.com, sign up, and begin asking your new AI friend any questions you like, and start to experience the power of AI.
It’s worth noting that ChatGPT can hallucinate or make up facts, so it’s essential to fact-check any information it gives you.
2. Microsoft CoPilot
Microsoft CoPilot is Microsoft’s search-engine chatbot based on the GPT-4 LLM, available via a sidebar in the Edge web browser, as well as on desktop on Windows 11. With CopIlot, you can enter search queries with text or images or conduct a voice search, and CoPilot, with an assist from Bing, will respond with a written response or image, depending on your query.
One of CoPilot’s main selling points is its capabilities as a search tool. It uses training data connected to the Internet, which means you can ask it questions about current events and news like a search engine.
When responding, it also includes a list of sources and relevant links so that you can conduct further research into a given topic. The chatbot can also create AI-generated images upon request.
3. Google Gemini
Google Gemini, previously known as Bard, is Google’s conversational chatbot and AI assistant, built on the PaLM2 LLM.
The user interface is simple and easy to use. Just enter a query via text or voice, and Gemini can respond with text, images, and videos based on content from Google Search.
Gemini will respond to each prompt with three drafted responses, which you can change between to get the most comprehensive response for your needs. It’s also connected to the Internet, meaning you can use it to summarize other online content and current events.
The chatbot’s integration with Adobe Firefly also means it can be used to create AI-generated images.
4. Jasper
Jasper is an AI-driven copywriting assistant that uses a proprietary AI model alongside third-party models like GPT-3 to help users create brand-conscious content.
This chatbot is designed to generate text replicating a brand’s tone of voice to create content for marketing collateral such as web pages, emails, adverts, sales listings, and blogs.
By entering a written command, you can create new documents or scratch or use existing templates. The assistant will respond with text output. You can craft the output response by entering a content description or brief and providing details on your tone of voice and keywords.
The key difference between Jasper and other tools, like ChatGPT and Bard, is that it focuses on producing marketing content rather than conversational text output.
5. DALL-E 3
DALL-E 2 is an AI tool released by Open AI, which uses GPT-3 and deep learning to convert text prompts into images. To use it, create an account on the OpenAI website, enter a prompt into the search bar, and DALL-E 2 will generate an image.
If the design isn’t quite right, you can choose other variations. Once you find the right design, you can share and save it.
The image output quality will largely depend on the depth of your initial prompt, so it’s worth trying to give as much detail as possible for DALL-E 2 to process.
DALL-E 2 is a popular image generation tool because it is easier to use than more complex ones like Midjourney.
While DALL-E 3 exists, it is only available as a premium model, although some third-party services such as Microsoft CoPilot allow you to use it for free.
6. Quillbot
Quillbot is an AI assistant that uses natural language processing to paraphrase a piece of text.
Essentially, the user enters a piece of text into a prompt box located on the Quillbot AI website, and then the chatbot will check the content for grammar and suggest ways to improve it.
Users can choose between paraphrasing text, summarizing written content, checking grammar, and generating citations based on their needs.
Quillbot is helpful for those who want to produce and proofread fluid, easy-to-read personal and commercial content.
7. Reclaim
Reclaim is an AI scheduling app that can identify the best time for meetings, tasks, or breaks. Users can connect to Google Calendar and automatically schedule meetings while blocking time for rest and even travel if necessary.
Users can also integrate to-do lists created with third-party tools, including ClickUp, Todoist, Asana, Jira, Linear, and Google Tasks. Users can also create and add tasks to the calendar directly via Slack messages.
This app is a good fit for users and teams that want to optimize their calendar availability with automated scheduling while preserving their work-life balance with regular break periods. Techopedia has also recently explored other AI scheduling assistants.
8. Ada
Ada is an AI-powered medical assistant that checks symptoms. It has been trained on clinical evidence to help users track their symptoms. For example, users can grade the severity of their symptoms and view medical guidance on the treatment options available.
The solution includes a condition library, which provides a central repository of health conditions that users can refer to for further information.
One peer-reviewed study found that Ada was significantly more accurate in recognizing inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) than physicians, scoring 70% compared to 54%, and was even more accurate than physicians in suggesting the final diagnosis.
That being said, it’s important to highlight that assistance from generative AI apps is no substitute for support from a trained and licensed medical professional. As such, these tools are best used alongside guidance from a qualified physician.
9. Fireflies
Fireflies is an automated note-taking app that can automatically transcribe and summarize virtual meetings in over 69 languages. Simply invite Fireflies.ai Notetaker to meetings on your calendar, and you can start creating transcriptions of meetings on platforms including Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meets, and Webex.
Once you’ve created a recording, you can use an AI-powered search to filter for keywords and talking points. Users can also add comments, pins, and reactions to transcriptions and share them with other users via third-party apps like Slack, Notion, and Asana.
10. Clara
Clara is an AI virtual assistant for scheduling meetings. It can be given a custom email signature and job title and used by adding the chatbot to an email via the cc option.
Once added to the conversation, the chatbot will schedule a meeting with your contact in natural language on your behalf. This includes automated follow-up emails.
After organizing the meeting, Clara can send you an invite with the event details. This helps to save a lot of back and forth when arranging the meeting with other recipients.
In addition, you can also issue commands to Clara to help manage meetings. For instance, you can tell Clara to automatically send a reminder to all participants 24 hours before scheduled meetings or enter codewords to notify them when a meeting is urgent.

								OPM issues generative AI guidance, competency model for AI roles required by Biden order							

								The guidance was among several actions required by the federal workforce agency within 180 days of President Joe Biden’s executive order on the technology.							


By
Madison Alder



April 29, 2024






 
											U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Headquarters, Washington, D.C.										





Guidance on generative AI and a competency model for AI roles are among the latest actions that the Office of Personnel Management has completed under President Joe Biden’s executive order on the technology, an agency spokesperson said.
In a statement provided to FedScoop ahead of the Monday announcement, OPM disclosed it would issue guidance on use of generative AI tools for the federal workforce; a competency model and skills-based hiring guidance for AI positions to help agencies find people with the skills needed for those roles; and an AI competency model specifically for civil engineering. 
All of those actions were among those the agency was required to complete at the 180-day mark of the October executive order, which would have been over the weekend. The spokesperson also noted that the agency established an interagency working group for AI, as required by the order. 
OPM was given multiple actions under the sweeping order, most of which were aimed at helping agencies attract and retain a federal workforce prepared to address AI. That role is important as the government is working to rapidly hire for 100 AI positions by this summer. The latest actions from OPM give federal agencies a better roadmap for hiring workers in those positions.

They also add to OPM’s existing work under the order, which has included authorizing direct hire authority for AI-related positions and outlining incentives for attracting and retaining AI workers in the federal government. 
Notably, OPM’s action on the responsible use of generative AI comes as agencies across the government have been developing their own unique approaches to those tools for their workforces. Those policies have ranged from banning the use of certain third-party tools to allowing use across the workforce with guidelines. 
The OPM guidance, which was posted publicly Monday, outlines risks and benefits of the technology along with best practices for implementing it in work. 
Though it ultimately directs employees to consult their agency’s policy, the guidance provides examples of uses and specific considerations for those uses, such as summarizing notes and transcripts, drafting content, and using generative tools for software and code development. 
“GenAI has the potential to improve the way the federal workforce delivers results for the public,” the guidance says. “Federal employees can leverage GenAI to enhance creativity, efficiency, and productivity. Federal agencies and employees are encouraged to consider how best to use these tools to fulfill their missions.”

Under the order, OPM was required to create that guidance in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. 
In addition to the competency models and guidance, the OPM spokesperson also disclosed that the agency issued an AI classification policy and talent acquisition guidance. While those actions support the rest of OPM’s work, they weren’t required by Biden’s executive order but rather the 2020 AI in Government Act. The spokesperson described those actions as addressing “position classification, job evaluation, qualifications, and assessments for AI positions.”
OPM is seeking feedback on that policy and guidance in a 30-day comment period ending May 29. 
This story was updated April 29, 2024, with additional information and links from OPM released Monday.

In the fast-paced realm of supply chain and logistics, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has stirred both excitement and apprehension. While businesses are eager to harness its potential, concerns loom large among workers, fearing the specter of obsolescence or undervaluation of their skills.


Recent insights from Gartner underscore this contrast, warning that failure to bridge this gap could spell trouble for supply chain functions. A survey of 822 business executives involved in their organization’s generative AI strategy revealed that 81% of supply chain executives intend to leverage the technology to trim headcounts by 2025.
However, cautionary notes accompany these aspirations. Gartner urges supply chain leaders to temper their expectations regarding labor cost reduction and instead focus on empowering their existing workforce for heightened productivity. According to Sam Berndt, senior research director at Gartner’s supply chain practice, “Gen AI should be an opportunity for chief supply chain officers to make good on many of their talent aspirations, including freeing their teams up for higher-value work and attracting top-tier technical talent.”
Crucially, transparency emerges as a cornerstone for navigating this transformative terrain. Supply chain leaders are advised to communicate openly about their plans for generative AI to dispel unfounded anxieties and foster an environment of trust. Berndt emphasizes, “Even a skeptical CSCO with minimal plans for Gen AI should provide clear communications about the organization’s plans for the technology and how it will affect the future of work.”


Moreover, the onus lies on leaders to identify diverse use cases for generative AI beyond conventional applications like chatbots. By fostering a culture of experimentation, organizations can discern new roles necessitated by this technology and pivot accordingly. Equally important is the imperative to equip employees with the requisite skills to engage with generative AI, capitalizing on the prevailing interest in cultivating proficiency in this domain.
In essence, the rise of generative AI presents a pivotal juncture for the supply chain and logistics. Navigating this landscape demands a strategic blend of foresight, transparency, and investment in human capital, ensuring that the workforce emerges as a potent ally in harnessing the full potential of this transformative technology.

During a technology conference session about generative AI governance on Monday, Connecticut Chief Information Officer Mark Raymond outlined the many steps his office is taking to ensure that artificial intelligence is used ethically and responsibly. But amid his warnings, he said it’s important for leaders to impart an optimistic and “hopeful” attitude about AI that won’t discourage agencies from pursuing powerful uses of the technology.
Raymond said that Connecticut, which published its AI governance policy in February, has since been briefing agency staff on how they should be integrating AI and introducing them to the state AI board members who can provide guidance when it’s unclear how state policy applies to their projects. Governance, Raymond said, shouldn’t be about shutting down ideas or discouraging potentially constructive work.
“You want to be seen as being hopeful and doing this in a safe manner,” he told the National Association of State Chief Information Officers midyear conference in National Harbor, Maryland. “Because the other perspective is not a good one regularly.”
Raymond and his co-presenter, New Jersey Chief Technology Officer Chris Rein, said they’ve been exploring how to use AI in domains that are considered “low risk.” In New Jersey, Rein said, the state has undertaken a handful of projects that use generative AI, including with the state’s Economic Development Authority, Motor Vehicle Commission and Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

Rein said one project is testing how generative AI can reduce the amount of time it takes for staff to field incoming calls from residents asking about their benefits. He said that complex procedure manuals make fielding requests a ponderous affair, which AI can accelerate while improving outcomes for residents. He said one project improved the number of resolved calls by 50%.
But across all the state’s generative AI work, Rein said, projects are being approached in a careful and controlled manner.
“We’re definitely focusing on some internal uses at agencies first,” he said. “It’s easier to turn off something when it’s controlled internally and [used by] smaller groups. Only one of our use cases goes right out to the public and we’re taking a long, hard look at that.”
The encouraging-but-careful approach is common among state CIOs, but not all public officials have been so measured in recent weeks. New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently defended to the press his decision to keep online a chatbot that is delivering false information to the public. “You can’t live in a lab,” he said at a press conference this month after a reporter criticized a chatbot that was providing the public with faulty information about tenant and worker rights.
After his session, Raymond told StateScoop government should be using generative AI to understand what the public wants to know about, but not necessarily to generate responses on the fly.

“We shouldn’t be using [generative AI] to create new content and responses, because we have to curate that, we have to make sure that that’s good,” Ramond said. “One of the really powerful things large language models can do is you can implement that in a chatbot to understand the question and get them to already-curated content, instead of providing hallucinated content. That’s a great use case that helps improve government in ways that you would really have a difficult time to do on our own.”
Rein said he is also holding generative AI output to a high standard.
“In one of our first implementations, we had an 80-85% accuracy rate, and that’s far too inaccurate to let something go out to the public when you’re a state government,” Rein said.
Before generative AI use in government can mature, Raymond said, there are numerous steps officials should take, including creating an inventory of AI assets that note whether each tool is involved in making decisions and whether it underwent an “impact assessment.” Raymond said Connecticut uses cybersecurity scanning tools that don’t include a “human in the loop” but in most other cases, humans supervise Connecticut’s AI.
During his presentation, Raymond also directed advice to the many technology vendor representatives in the audience, including an admonition against pitching tools without disclosing information about their data’s provenance.

“You’ve got to give it the ingredient label,” he said. “You gotta say: Where did your egg come from? How did you train it? How do you test it? How do you make sure the bias isn’t in there? Because we have to answer all those questions, and then after you help us implement it, we still have to continue testing.”
Raymond also told tech companies not to present agreements that would require the state government to engage in ethically questionable acts. He recalled an incident in which a vendor wanted him to sign an agreement for a “standard” AI model that would train itself on the public’s data.
“One of the things that we’re seeing quite a bit is AI sneaking into people’s products. I don’t want to have to pull the plug on the entire system because we don’t like something that’s happening with your AI,” he said. “So give us the ability to say ‘I’m operating without the AI.’ Our law says if we find something that is some kind of bias that’s against what we need to do, we’re required to stop using it, and if our only option is to shut off the whole thing, that’s bad for you, that’s bad for us.”

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced at a White House event today that the agency is launching a project to overhaul the Federal government’s hiring process for the IT management job series – transitioning to a fully skills-based approach by the summer of 2025. 
OPM also issued new guidance for skills-based hiring in AI-related roles today – as mandated by the Biden administration’s October AI executive order (EO). 
During the White House Convening on Good Paying Jobs in Cyber event today, OPM Deputy Director Rob Shriver announced that the agency has launched a comprehensive project to transition the government’s Information Technology Management job series to a skills-based approach for hiring. 
“In collaboration with our agency partners, we chose to focus on the 2210 series because that reflects the majority of the technical hires across the Federal government, including, of course, a whole lot of cybersecurity professionals,” Shriver said. “It accounts for nearly 100,000 current Federal employees and it is also one of our most in-demand roles in government, so that 100,000 is growing.”  
“Of course, with the emergence of new technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, skills-based hiring becomes ever more critical to finding and onboarding people who have gained these skill sets through whatever pathway,” he continued. “We need these skills in government – we can’t be fussy about how people got them and in fact, we’ve got to honor these alternative paths.”  
Speaking at the same event today, National Cyber Director Harry Coker – who has publicly said the cyber workforce is his top priority – highlighted that the government is leading by example.   
“For the first time, the Biden-Harris administration is committing to converting an entire series of technical employees that work in every Federal agency and represent a majority of the Federal IT workforce to skills-based hiring,” Coker said. “This is a major milestone in our national effort to move to skills-based hiring.”  
“It represents an important commitment and vital work ahead. This process will take time, but we’ll get it done by the summer of 2025,” he said. “You’ll hear us making a similar commitment to skills-based hiring with Federal contractors, employees that work shoulder to shoulder with Federal employees to advance our mission. And you’ll hear about new commitments being made by private sector companies representing more than a dozen industries.” 
OPM said it is currently reviewing Federal agency skill qualification requirements, including the 2210 IT Specialist Qualification and Classification Standard, and will use this pilot to expand the use of competency-based hiring more broadly across the Federal Government in fiscal year 2025. 
OPM’s announcements came on the 180-day mark of the AI EO, and the White House announced today that all Federal agencies have completed their assigned tasks on schedule. 
The agency unveiled the new skills-based hiring guidance and competency model for AI work today, aiming to empower agencies to “shift towards a skills-centric paradigm” that emphasizes practical skills over educational pedigrees or past titles and prioritizes talent with “AI proficiencies tailored to organizational objectives,” OPM said in its memo.  
“For new or rapidly evolving fields, such as those associated with AI, data, and technology, it is crucial that agencies adopt this skills-based hiring approach,” the agency said. “This ensures the Federal workforce can readily adapt to the changing landscape and integrate innovative skills that may not yet be captured in traditional education or certification frameworks.”  
Today’s guidance supports Biden’s AI EO as well as the Trump-era AI in Government Act of 2020.  
In July, OPM issued general and technical competencies to support agencies’ efforts to target AI skills needed to fill positions to expand AI capabilities governmentwide. Since its issuance, OPM consulted with subject matter experts from Federal agencies and conducted environmental scans, focus groups, and governmentwide surveys. 
Today’s guidance includes 43 general competencies and 14 technical competencies found to be important for performing AI work. It also expands on OPM’s July memo by including competencies by grade.  
“When assessing job applicants based on competencies and proficiency levels, rather than just minimum qualifications, agencies are required to use validated (that is, job-related) assessment tools,” the guidance section of the memo states. “Use of validated assessment tools, such as cognitive tests and structured interviews, is critical when assessing job applicants to validate competency-based qualifications.”  
OPM Announces More AI Workforce Guidance, Progress 
OPM also issued new guidance on the responsible use of generative AI for the Federal workforce to support Federal employees in learning about the new tool’s potential benefits and risks, exploring best practices for safely, securely, and responsibly using generative AI in work, and finding ways to learn more about generative AI.    
The guidance states that agencies should practice basic cyber hygiene, like ensuring they don’t input any information into generative AI tools that’s not allowed. It also tasks employees to follow their individual agency guidelines for using the tool.  
It does offer examples and recommendations for generative AI uses, including summarizing information, creating communication materials, and developing code.  
Among its other announcements today, OPM highlighted its contribution to the “Increasing AI Capacity Across the Federal Government: AI Talent Surge Progress and Recommendations” report to the president. The report was submitted by the AI and Tech Talent Task Force, which includes OPM. 
The April 26 report offers insight into the progress of the Federal government’s AI Talent Surge, noting that programs hiring through the surge saw an average 288 percent increase in AI applications compared to previous periods, and some tech talent programs saw up to 600-2,000 percent increases in AI applications.  
“Moreover, public interest in Federal AI roles remains high. From January through March 2024, applications for AI and AI-enabling roles have doubled as compared to similar periods in 2022 and 2023,” the report says. “The message is clear: the public is ready and motivated to join the Federal Government to work on AI priorities.”  
As for hiring, the report notes that more than 172 new AI hires have been made within the Federal government since the AI EO was unveiled in October.  
The report notes that AI capacity gaps across agencies remain – like insufficient data, compute, and technical infrastructure. To help increase AI capacity, the AI and Tech Talent Task Force made 10 recommendations, including to increase funding for AI and tech talent; launching a Federal AI scholarship-for-service program; and exploring AI talent with global partners.

More from At WorkWorker fired after X-rated reply-all emailWin for glam banker facing 120 fraud chargesHow some Aussies will get $21k super bumpLeading experts have revealed the jobs most likely to become obsolete thanks to the rapid rollout of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence technology.Last week, news.com.au reported that a major fast food chain in the United States had replaced its drive-through staff with AI voice recognition, with machines now taking orders in place of humans.Experts in Australia said that type of technology could be implemented here within the year – and warned major disruptions in the food service sector would be just the start of things to come across many industries.A major fast-food chain has replaced its drive-through workers with an AI assistant that can take orders in a matter of seconds.A major fast-food chain has replaced its drive-through workers with an AI assistant that can take orders in a matter of seconds.Automation driven by AI, coupled with the country’s ageing population and a transition to a net-zero emissions goal, will have a significant impact, according to analysis by consulting giant McKinsey.In a recent report, it warned 1.3 million Australian workers might need to transition out of their current jobs and into new professions between now and 2030.That equates to about nine per cent of the nation’s total workforce.Occupations set to be hit hardest including office support, customer service and sales, and food services, McKinsey forecast.Research by workplace technology firm Pearson and AI solutions provider ServiceNow warned any jobs that include a lot of repetitive and technical duties will be significantly impacted.It too forecasted the total number of job losses to be in the vicinity of 1.3 million over the next several years.Job losses in the food services sector will be just the beginning, experts warn. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Andrew HenshawAbout a quarter of jobs in the retail sector alone could be replaced by AI, in what the Pearson research described as a “tectonic shift”.It also estimated that almost 46 per cent of banking roles, 28 per cent of accounting positions and 36 per cent of finance bookkeeping jobs could be automated by 2027.Niusha Shafiabady, an associate professor in Charles Darwin University’s Faculty of Science and Technology, and an expert in machine learning, intelligent modelling and systems design, has researched the industries and roles most at risk.Some face major upheaval over the coming years, with the pace of change set to be rapid in certain areas.Admin gigs going fastIn the scheme of things, programmatic and AI technology is relatively cheap and easy to implement in some businesses, and it’s those that will be among the first to see job losses.“Jobs that rely on humans following pre-existing instructions and don’t need many or any analytical thinking skills will be impacted relatively quickly,” Professor Shafiabady said.“I’m talking about clerical or secretary roles, and jobs in administration, for example.”In a report on labour market changes last year, the World Economic Forum predicted there would be 26 million fewer admin jobs globally by 2027.Positions overseeing data entry, basic accounting, bookkeeping and payroll, ticketing and cashiering, and executive secretarial services will be decimated, the WEF report warned. Professor Shafiabady concurred and said after identifying six of the most at-risk roles in Australia, she found they all sat within the admin realm.Call centre workers were near the top of the list, she said.“The tasks for this type of job can be replicated by an AI computer system, so it will be displaced,” she said.Also at risk are those working as secretaries and foreign language interprets, with advanced technologies able to replicate many of those functions.Even secretaries working in healthcare, such as a GP clinic receptionist, could be “relatively easily replaced”.“A bookkeeper’s job could also be displaced relatively quickly, since the information flow can be captured by software systems,” she said. “At the very least, the number of required positions for this role are likely to decrease.”The Pearson research forecasts a quarter of jobs in retail could be lost due to AI tech implementation. Picture: istockAnd those Aussies whose job requires them entering some kind of data into a computer system should brace for an imminent disruption, she said.As demonstrated in a viral video last week, those taking orders at chain restaurants in Australia could become obsolete relatively quickly because the existing technology has been proven to be effective.Finance industry ripe for disruptionOne of the first AI systems Professor Shafiabady ever designed was for a bank, with the purpose of conducting financial audits.Technologies have come a long way since then, she noted, and much of the “logic” of auditing could be coded into software and many essential tasks might be automated.Another role that could see some of its tasks automated is accounting, which might not lead to humans in those jobs replaced entirely, but could streamline workflows and see a reduction in the number of positions needed.The same goes for financial analysts, she said, with decision-making logic potentially able to be replicated by technology. Huge number of Aussies affectedWhile new tech jobs will be created as a result of mass AI adoption, there won’t be enough on offer to replace those lost.For example, the Pearson research suggests some 80,000 tech roles could be created in the retail sector when AI is adopted, but some 250,000 positions are likely to be impacted.In addition, the adoption of AI could streamline positions by absorbing responsibilities in professions like system administrator, telecommunications engineers and hardware technicians, the Pearson research found.AI has the potential to disrupt a number of industries, leading to heavy job losses. Picture: istockSo significant are the consequences that Professor Shafiabady said parents with young children should start thinking about the futures that await them.“If you have a kid who’s around seven or so, I’d start thinking about the implications of these changes to help them decide what kind of career they might have. You want to think about whether it will exist in the future.“If we allow technology to take over occupations, many people will lose their jobs and this will have economic implications that will change our society.”Jobs that are robustBroadly speaking, any job that requires physical labour is likely to avoid major disruption for some time, given replacing them would require costly advanced robotic solutions.Among them are manual roles in mining – the largest industry in the country.“Take a driller,” Professor Shafiabady said. “Since this skill set requires hardware, its being displaced would require building a smart robot and could be costly.”Jobs that require physical labour tend to be at much lower risk.Similarly, many jobs in the construction sector, from painters to bricklayers and site supervisors, have a significantly lower risk of being replaced.“The fact is the cost of hiring for a position such as a construction labourer globally, versus manufacturing and maintaining a robot to do the same thing, means this type of role is unlikely to be displaced soon.”With risk comes opportunityA report about the future of work by professional networking site LinkedIn found a surge in job advertisements demanding AI expertise.“Companies are looking to hire professionals with AI skills across both technical and non-technical roles,” the report said.The top five industries looking for job candidates with AI expertise are professional services, administrative and support services, government administration, manufacturing and retail, it found.Demand for AI skills in technical roles, like data scientist and software engineer, has been on the rise since December 2022, the report noted.The World Economic Forum's projections on industries set to see the largest growth in jobs.However, companies are increasingly looking to hire professionals with AI literacy into non-technical positions too, like sales and supply chain.“The diffusion of AI talent and skills across global economies will continue to increase as more companies embrace AI across their workflows,” it said. “While many AI jobs require AI skills like machine learning, deep learning and data structures, most of those roles require a mix of AI and non-AI skills (people and digital skills). People skills include communication, leadership, and organisational skills.”So, it seems very human qualities remain useful across most industries – for now.Big global ramificationsIn January, the International Monetary Fund released a report that forecast 40 per cent of all jobs globally will be impacted by the rollout of AI.But in advanced economies, like Australia, that figure could be as high as 60 per cent, the IMF warned.“Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.“We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jump-start productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. “Yet it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality.”On a scale of most prepared to least prepared countries, Australia fell roughly in the middle, the IMF report revealed.In a similarly gloomy outlook last year, finance giant Goldman Sachs created a stir when it released a report predicting 300 million jobs globally could be lost to AI automation.Read More
