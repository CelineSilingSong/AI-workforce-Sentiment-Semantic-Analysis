MIT SMR editor in chief Paul Michelman recently spoke with authors Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson to discuss the research that went into their (and coauthor Nicola Morini Bianzino’s) 2017 article “The Jobs That Artificial Intelligence Will Create” and to find out what new developments in this space have their attention. 
Listen to the full conversation here:

Key takeaways from the discussion include:
Soft skills will be crucial for collaborating with smart machines.
A major focus of the Daugherty and Wilson article is what kinds of skills will enable job transformation in the age of AI. Surprisingly, they’ve found that STEM skills, while important, are certainly not a prerequisite for transformation. In fact, their research shows that four soft skills are becoming much more valuable as human-machine collaboration advances. These skills include complex reasoning, creativity, social and emotional intelligence, and sensory perception.

Training for AI will require shifts in learning.
Humans have never trained for many of the new jobs that AI will create — so the question becomes, how do companies develop their workforce? Daugherty and Wilson cite the importance of experiential learning through hands-on apprenticeships and using technology to advance skills in new categories of jobs. In addition, the burden for skilling and reskilling must shift from the individual employee to the collective institution or organization. If learning is going to become a core competency for global businesses, then organizations will need to step up to help build learning platforms for employees. 
Responsible AI marks a new frontier.
Daugherty and Wilson point out that responsible AI, which was hinted at in their original research and spelled out in more detail in their recent article “Using Artificial Intelligence to Promote Diversity,” has become a much more important question. Thinking about bias, transparency, and accountability will be crucial in the future development of AI systems. As the authors describe, “These are going to be really important issues for businesses and organizations to grasp and to make sure that as we have increasing numbers of people working in AI and more powerful solutions delivered with the AI, how do we make sure we deliver the right outcomes in all cases?”

Hi Paul / James, I am curious to learn more about ""trainer"", ""explainer"" & ""sustainer"" from the context of AI/ML. I have read that ML/AI algorithms becomes a black box once it starts learning and improving based on raw data fed to the algorithm. After sometime, even developers and model engineers would not be able to fully comprehend why algorithm produced a decision? In that case, how ""explainer"" would possibly able to perform his/her job? I appreciate your insights here ...

                        Artificial intelligence gets a bad rap as a job killer and human-worker replacer. In some areas this is true, but in others, particularly surrounding how data are cleaned and processed, AI is spearheading new jobs.
Data labeling and annotation is a burgeoning industry born from AI. Unstructured datasets from sources like cameras and social media data or structured sources, like databases, are labeled, marked, colored, or highlighted to show differences, similarities by people. To train a machine to learn what a stop sign is, a person must go into camera footage of a street and mark up all the stop signs in the photo. The machine is then fed data identifying thousands of these images. Overtime the system can more accurately identify what a stop sign is by processing the labeled data. This type of machine learning, where a system gets more accurate by being fed more data, is termed deep learning. 

As this process is essential for algorithms to accurately perform core parts of its function, the data labeling industry is set to take off over the next five years. In 2018, the market for AI and machine learning data preparation, a process that relies heavily on people to manually label data, stood at $500 million. According to Cognilytica, that is expected to more than double, reaching $1.2 billion by 2023. Third-party providers an expect to see a significant uptick in that growth, going from $150 million of the market to $1 billion over that same time frame. Data labeling is particularly essential for AI that deals with object and image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and text and image annotation.

Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun — sometimes called the ‘godfathers of AI’ — have been recognized with the $1 million annual prize for their work developing the AI subfield of deep learning. The techniques the trio developed in the 1990s and 2000s enabled huge breakthroughs in tasks like computer vision and speech recognition. Their work underpins the current proliferation of AI technologies, from self-driving cars to automated medical diagnoses. deep learning powers many contemporary applications of AIIn fact, you probably interacted with the descendants of Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun’s algorithms today — whether that was the facial recognition system that unlocked your phone, or the AI language model that suggested what to write in your last email. All three have since taken up prominent places in the AI research ecosystem, straddling academia and industry. Hinton splits his time between Google and the University of Toronto; Bengio is a professor at the University of Montreal and started an AI company called Element AI; while LeCun is Facebook’s chief AI scientist and a professor at NYU. “It’s a great honor,” LeCun told The Verge. “As good as it gets in computer science. It’s an even better feeling that it’s shared with my friends Yoshua and Geoff.”Jeff Dean, Google’s head of AI, praised the trio’s achievements. “Deep neural networks are responsible for some of the greatest advances in modern computer science,” said Dean in a statement. “At the heart of this progress are fundamental techniques developed by this year’s Turing Award winners, Yoshua Bengio, Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun.” The techniques of deep learning that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun developed underpin many technologies, like self-driving cars.  Photo: AevaThe trio’s achievements are particularly notable as they kept the faith in artificial intelligence at a time when the technology’s prospects were dismal. AI is well-known for its cycles of boom and bust, and the issue of hype is as old as the field itself. When research fails to meet inflated expectations it creates a freeze in funding and interest known as an “AI winter.” It was at the tail end of one such winter in the late 1980s that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun began exchanging ideas and working on related problems. These included neural networks — computer programs made from connected digital neurons that have become a key building block for modern AI. “There was a dark period between the mid-90s and early-to-mid-2000s when it was impossible to publish research on neural nets, because the community had lost interest in it,” says LeCun. “In fact, it had a bad rep. It was a bit taboo.”“It had a bad rep. It was a bit taboo.”The trio decided they needed to rekindle interest, and secured funding from the Canadian government to sponsor a loose hub of interrelated research. “We organized regular meetings, regular workshops, and summer schools for our students,” says LeCun. “That created a small community that [...] around 2012, 2013 really exploded.” During this period, the three showed that neural nets could achieve strong results on tasks like character recognition. But the rest of the research world did not pay attention until 2012, when a team led by Hinton took on a well-known AI benchmark called ImageNet. Researchers had so far only delivered incremental improvements on this object recognition challenge, but Hinton and his students smashed the next-best algorithm by more than 40 percent with the help of neural networks.“The difference there was so great that a lot of people, you could see a big switch in their head going ‘clunk,’” says LeCun. “Now they were convinced.” The deep learning framework that the trio created was later fueled by abundant processing power and data.  Photo: Vjeran PavicCheap processing power from GPUs (originally designed for gaming) and an abundance of digital data (given off by the internet the same way a car gives off fumes), offered fuel for these little cognitive engines. And since 2012, the basic techniques that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun pioneered, including backpropagation and convolutional neural networks, have become ubiquitous in AI, and, by extension, in technology as a whole.  LeCun says he is optimistic about the prospects of artificial intelligence, but he’s also clear that much more work needs to be done before the field lives up to its promise. Current AI systems need lots of data to understand the world, can be easily tricked, and are only good at specific tasks. “We just don’t have machines with common sense,” says LeCun. If the field is to continue on its upward trajectory, new methods will need to be discovered that are as foundational as those developed by the godfathers of AI. “Whether we’ll able to use new methods to create human-level intelligence, well, there’s probably another 50 mountains to climb, including ones we can’t even see yet” says LeCun. “We’ve only climbed the first mountain. Maybe the second.” Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: ring any bells?

Cheap processing power from GPUs (originally designed for gaming) and an abundance of digital data (given off by the internet the same way a car gives off fumes), offered fuel for these little cognitive engines. And since 2012, the basic techniques that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun pioneered, including backpropagation and convolutional neural networks, have become ubiquitous in AI, and, by extension, in technology as a whole.  

LeCun says he is optimistic about the prospects of artificial intelligence, but he’s also clear that much more work needs to be done before the field lives up to its promise. Current AI systems need lots of data to understand the world, can be easily tricked, and are only good at specific tasks. “We just don’t have machines with common sense,” says LeCun. 

If the field is to continue on its upward trajectory, new methods will need to be discovered that are as foundational as those developed by the godfathers of AI. 

“Whether we’ll able to use new methods to create human-level intelligence, well, there’s probably another 50 mountains to climb, including ones we can’t even see yet” says LeCun. “We’ve only climbed the first mountain. Maybe the second.”

Computers have become so smart during the past 20 years that people don't think twice about chatting with digital assistants like Alexa and Siri or seeing their friends automatically tagged in Facebook pictures.





But making those quantum leaps from science fiction to reality required hard work from computer scientists like Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. The trio tapped into their own brainpower to make it possible for machines to learn like humans, a breakthrough now commonly known as ""artificial intelligence,"" or AI.
Their insights and persistence were rewarded Wednesday with the Turing Award, an honor that has become known as technology industry's version of the Nobel Prize. It comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, a company where AI has become part of its DNA.
The award marks the latest recognition of the instrumental role that artificial intelligence will likely play in redefining the relationship between humanity and technology in the decades ahead.
""Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,"" said Cherri Pancake, president of the Association for Computing Machinery, the group behind the Turing Award.

Although they have known each other for than 30 years, Bengio, Hinton and LeCun have mostly worked separately on technology known as neural networks. These are the electronic engines that power tasks such as facial and speech recognition, areas where computers have made enormous strides over the past decade. Such neural networks also are a critical component of robotic systems that are automating a wide range of other human activity, including driving.






Their belief in the power of neural networks was once mocked by their peers, Hinton said. No more. He now works at Google as a vice president and senior fellow while LeCun is chief AI scientist at Facebook. Bengio remains immersed in academia as a University of Montreal professor in addition to serving as scientific director at the Artificial Intelligence Institute in Quebec.
""For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,"" Hinton said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what are doing is silly.""
Now, some people are worried that the results of the researchers' efforts might spiral out of control.

While the AI revolution is raising hopes that computers will make most people's lives more convenient and enjoyable, it's also stoking fears that humanity eventually will be living at the mercy of machines.
Bengio, Hinton and LeCun share some of those concerns—especially the doomsday scenarios that envision AI technology developed into weapons systems that wipe out humanity.
But they are far more optimistic about the other prospects of AI—empowering computers to deliver more accurate warnings about floods and earthquakes, for instance, or detecting health risks, such as cancer and heart attacks, far earlier than human doctors.
""One thing is very clear, the techniques that we developed can be used for an enormous amount of good affecting hundreds of millions of people,"" Hinton said.

CytoSMART, the Eindhoven-based company that develops and manufactures digital microscopes for monitoring live cell cultures, has received €5.2 million to fund the growth of their business. New investor Eindhoven Venture Capital Fund II joined existing investors Holland Capital and BOM Brabant Ventures. The funding will be used by CytoSMART to further develop its microscopes and to expand its international sales and marketing strategies.






Innovative microscopes
CytoSMART has created three highly innovative microscopes that scientists can use to digitally and remotely count, screen, check, and film their cell cultures. CytoSMART’s latest microscope is the Omni, the world’s fastest live-cell imager. The company has also created a wide range of options for using the collected images to conduct experiments in its own cloud service. The additional funding will be used for product innovation, expanding product functions, and upscaling the company’s international sales and marketing.
“Since the series A round in 2016, our sales have shot up by over 300 percent,” says Joffry Maltha, CEO of CytoSMART. “In order to continue growing, it is important that we keep innovating with our products and increase our investment in marketing and sales activities in the next few years. That means we will be focusing strongly on new image-analysis applications and continued hardware development.”

Artificial Intelligence and cloud technology
CytoSMART Technologies develops and manufactures smart microscope systems for life science labs. The company was founded in 2012 by a team of biologists and engineers who were convinced that a new generation of miniaturised microscopes, powered by artificial intelligence and cloud technology, would allow biologists to make more easily reproducible discoveries more quickly, which would be of benefit to humanity. CytoSMART’s microscopy solutions are already used in over a thousand laboratories around the world.

The three recipients of the Association for Computing Machinery’s 2018 Turing Award, known as the “Nobel Prize of computing,” are sharing the $1 million award for their pioneering work with artificial neural networks — but that’s not all they share.
Throughout their careers, the researchers’ career paths and spheres of influence in the field of artificial intelligence have crossed repeatedly.
Yann LeCun, vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, conducted postdoctoral research under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton, who is now a vice president and engineering fellow at Google. LeCun also worked at Bell Labs in the early 1990s with Yoshua Bengio, who is now a professor at the University of Montreal and an adviser for Microsoft’s AI initiative.
All three also participate in the Learning in Machines and Brains program sponsored by CIFAR, previously known as the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
In Wednesday’s award announcement, ACM credited the trio with rekindling the AI community’s interest in deep neural networks — thus laying the groundwork for today’s rapid advances in machine learning.
“Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science, and one of the most-talked-about topics in society,” said ACM President Cherri Pancake, a professor emeritus of computer science at Oregon State University. “The growth of and interest in AI is due, in no small part, to the recent advances in deep learning for which Bengio, Hinton and LeCun laid the foundation.”
And you don’t need to work in a lab to feel their impact.
“Anyone who has a smartphone in their pocket can tangibly experience advances in natural language processing and computer vision that were not possible just 10 years ago,” Pancake said.
ACM called the three awardees the “Fathers of the Deep Learning Revolution.”
The current approach to machine learning, championed by Hinton starting in the early 1980s, shies away from telling a computer explicitly how to solve a given task, such as object classification. Instead, the software uses an algorithm to analyze the patterns in a data set, and then apply that algorithm to classify new data. Through repeated rounds of learning, the algorithm becomes increasingly accurate.
Hinton, LeCun and Bengio focused on developing neural networks to facilitate that learning. Such networks are composed of relatively simple software elements that are interconnected and weighted in ways inspired by the connections between neurons in the human brain. Fine-tuning the connections helps programmers build deep learning networks, with layers upon layers of artificial neurons.
All three continue to play leading roles in AI research:

In addition to his work with the Google Brain team and CIFAR, Geoffrey Hinton is chief scientific adviser at Canada’s Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a university professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.
In his role as vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, LeCun built up the social-media platform’s network of AI research labs — including its recently established Seattle lab. He’s also a professor at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
Yoshua Bengio is a computer science professor at the University of Montreal and the scientific director of Mila, Quebec’s AI institute, as well as the Institute for Data Valorization, or IVADO. He and LeCun are co-directors of CIFAR’s Learning in Machines and Brains program. Bengio’s connection to Microsoft dates back to the company’s acquisition of a Montreal-based AI startup called Maluuba in 2017. Bengio was an adviser to Maluuba, and took on that role for Microsoft after Maluuba was acquired.

Previous Turing Awards have gone to the likes of Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web; and Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, who are reckoned among the internet’s founding researchers. Oren Etzioni, CEO of Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, argued that this year’s Turing Award could also be seen as “nothing short of historic, because it underscores a paradigm shift in AI.”
“Today, in vision, natural language processing and machine learning research, it’s essentially ‘all deep learning, all the time,’ and the Turing Awards winners pioneered this paradigm,” Etzioni told GeekWire in an email. “Looking to the future, deep learning has benefited immensely from Moore’s Law, but that exponential is finally slowing down — what will happen over the next decades?”

Google Vice President Geoffrey Hinton, Facebook’s Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, were jointly awarded the Turing Award for 2018 for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning, work that has led to everything from news aggregators to Netflix and the modern boom in practical artificial intelligence development.
“Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,” said Cherri Pancake, president of the computing society, in a statement on the Award. “The growth of and interest in AI is due, in no small part, to the recent advances in deep learning for which Bengio, Hinton and LeCun laid the foundation.”
Specifically, the three were cited for creating the “conceptual foundations” of deep neural networks, the kind of algorithms that powers how artificial intelligence systems learn new things. A system’s ability to learn something is crucial in artificial intelligence since a system cannot be programmed for every eventuality it will confront in real-world applications, it must be able to train to recognize patterns and act appropriately in response to what it has learned.
The Turing Award is presented every year by the Association for Computing Machinery and includes a monetary prize of $1 million, which this year will be split between the three recipients.
Recognition for the Conceptual Foundation of Neural Networks
Neural networks, inspired by the web of neurons that make up the human brain, had been the subject of research for decades, but no one had made much progress in making them do anything of value. Then, in 2004, Hinton used the support of the Canadian government to organize a community of researchers, including LeCun and Bengio, that would turn neural networks into the powerful computing tools that they are today.
[see-also]
Hinton first began pursuing neural networks as a graduate student in the 1970s, and then later at AT&T’s Bell Laboratories where he built a neural network that could learn to read handwriting. Then, after a grant of $400,000 by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio developed the algorithms that first powered speech recognition systems for IBM, Microsoft, and Google.

Next, Hinton moved on to image recognition networks building off an algorithm of LeCun’s which would go on to power systems like a self-driving vehicle’s computer vision capability—its ability to see the road, recognize cars, pedestrians, etc.
Bengio, working as a professor at the Univeristy of Montreal, oversaw research into generative adversarial networks, which uses one neural network to engage another, where one is designed to generate something original like a picture of a person’s face and the other network operates on what was generated as a form of quality assurance.

By  Angela Chen Mar 28, 2019, 12:05 PM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge“Prison labor” is usually associated with physical work, but inmates at two prisons in Finland are doing a new type of labor: classifying data to train artificial intelligence algorithms for a startup. Though the startup in question, Vainu, sees the partnership as a kind of prison reform that teaches valuable skills, other experts say the claim of job training is more evidence of hype around the promises of AI.Vainu is building a comprehensive database of companies around the world that helps businesses find contractors to work with, says co-founder Tuomas Rasila. For this to work, people need to read through hundreds of thousands of business articles scraped from the internet and label whether, for example, an article is about Apple the tech company or a fruit company that has “apple” in the name. (This labeled data is then used to train an algorithm that manages the database.) That’s no problem for articles in English: Vainu simply set up an Amazon Mechanical Turk account to have people do these small tasks. But Mechanical Turk is “not really that useful when you want to do something [with the] Finnish language,” Rasila says, and the company had only one trainee tagging lots of data in the Finnish language. “We saw that and said, ‘okay, this is not going to be enough,” he adds. The Vainu offices happen to be in the same building as the headquarters of the Criminal Sanctions Agency (CSA), the government agency that oversees Finnish prisons, and so, says Rasila, the founders had an idea: “Hey, we could actually use prison labor.”The partnership started about three months ago and Vainu is now working with two different prisons, one in Helsinki and one in Turku. Vainu shipped 10 computers to these prisons and pays the CSA for each task the prisoners complete. The amount is comparable to how much the startup would have paid for a task done on Mechanical Turk, though the CSA is responsible for figuring out how much of that goes to the prisoners, as well as selecting the inmates who do the data classification. “Hey, we could actually use prison labor”Finland is famous for its progressive prison policies. Approximately one-third of the country’s prisons are so-called open prisons, where inmates live and work like normal citizens. John Pratt, a researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington who studies different penal systems, notes that there is less of the “overwhelming emphasis on security” found in the United States. Prisoners are generally required to work or do vocational training, but are sometimes even allowed to work outside the prison or remain self-employed. Officials at the agency were excited to partner, according to Rasila, especially because the new jobs don’t require anything other than a laptop. “There’s no risk for violence,” he says, adding that when it comes to other forms of prison labor, like metalsmithing, access to tools that can be turned into makeshift weapons can make a prison workspace “a dangerous place.” Rasila estimates that, currently, a little less than 100 prisoners are working on Vainu’s project for a few hours a day. (A representative from the CSA did not respond to a request for comment.)Right now, Vainu and the CSA have an annual contract based on the number of tasks. The Vainu team hopes to expand elsewhere in Finland, and other countries where it can be hard to find people willing to do this type of work in local languages. To them, it’s a win-win situation. One motivation for the inmates is to make money, of course, but “a selling point of this was that the demand for training AI is actually increasing significantly, globally,” Rasila says. Similarly, the CSA wrote in a release that the program is part of its efforts to develop work activities that match “the requirements of modern working life,” and a PR representative pitched the partnership to The Verge as “an opportunity for inmates to have a job that can empower them.”It’s not surprising, either, that there would be an especially high demand for this type of work in other countries, according to Lilly Irani, a professor of communication at the University of California at San Diego. AI algorithms need to be trained in culturally specific ways, she says, and most Mechanical Turk workers are in the US. Though Rasila says that this is an example of developing skills that can be useful in the future, he also says that the tasks have “zero learning curve” and only require (presumably pre-existing) literacy, which calls into question how useful this skill is. This type of job tends to be “rote, menial, and repetitive,” says Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information science at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies information workers. It does not require building high level of skill, and if a university researcher tried to partner with prison laborers in the same way, “that would not pass an ethics review board for a study.” While it’s good that the prisoners are being paid a similar wage as on Mechanical Turk, Roberts points out that wages on Mechanical Turk are extremely low anyway. One recent research paper found that workers made a median wage of $2 an hour. For Irani, there’s nothing special about AI in this story. In the US at least, prison labor has long been controversial, with some saying that it economically exploits workers while others argue that it can help rehabilitate them. To her, the public relations push around the collaboration is more surprising than the fact that digital work has become part of prison labor. “The hook is that we have this kind of hype circulating around AI so that we can masquerade really old forms of labor exploitation as ‘reforming prisons,’” Irani says. “They’re connecting social movements, reducing it to hype, and using that to sell AI.”Update April 1st, 2019: This article has been updated to include more information about the Finnish penal system.

Production planning in manufacturing is a vital part of operations management, despite the fact that most production planning applications don't really plan anything. Traditional planning systems, including material requirements planning and its derivatives, do a great job of sorting out the varying requirements and dates. They then apply a type of fixed logic to that mass of data and lay out a plan or schedule that seems reasonable and may actually work. But any experienced planner will tell you that a typical computer-generated plan might contain elements that are impractical or downright impossible -- like launching a production order two weeks ago and finishing it today, or having a work center commit to three or four times as much production as it can complete in a day.









AI to improve production planning in manufacturing
The new generation of so-called advanced planning and scheduling (APS) overcomes many of those limitations by applying optimization algorithms instead of fixed logic that can trade off priorities and alternatives to come up with a more feasible plan that balances both resources and material date and quantities. But even APS, as ""smart"" as it is, still has its limitations. It takes a dedicated, knowledgeable human planner to interpret and apply the recommendations in the context of what's really happening out on the plant floor and in the customer's world by using intelligence that is not found in the data. Based on experience and knowing, or at least being able to anticipate, what is likely to happen under various scenarios moving forward?
The use of the word intelligence in the preceding paragraph is significant, for this is the human-like thinking that AI is designed to do. These production planning systems ""learn"" by collecting a massive amount of data and thoroughly analyzing it for cause and effect to build a model of the process. Then, as new information comes in, the system can perform thousands of what-if simulations to find the best path forward. The model is also refined based on additional data as these scenarios play out.
Production planning systems that incorporate AI capabilities will not replace human planners -- at least, not anytime soon. It will take some time to build up the necessary level of confidence needed to trust a computer to carry out this vital task. That being said, AI-developed plans and schedules will undoubtedly be ""better"" than any human could create. Plants will run more efficiently, product quality will improve and more work will be completed on time and at a lower cost.
So, what will the planner do after AI takes over the job of production planning in manufacturing? In addition to adding the ""sanity check"" on plans and planning system operations, human planners can focus on managing any special exceptions that the system might not be able to address. In addition, human insight and ingenuity can be directed toward process improvement.

The result was abstract crimson canvases that could be interpreted as clouds, flowers or fibroids.“While Rembrandt was addressing the power of medical science in his art I wanted to talk about the fascinating world of AI,” says the artist and human-computer interaction researcher. He first began tinkering with AI while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015. This series of works titled The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Algorithm, and was showcased at Gradient Descent, a first-of-its-kind AI art exhibition held at Delhi’s Nature Morte gallery in August.The work went on display again, yesterday, for a second edition of Gradient Descent, in Bengaluru, organised by Nature Morte and curated by an art collective called 64/1. Also on display are the works of AI artists Mario Klingemann from Germany, Jake Elwes and Anna Ridler from the UK and Memo Akten from Turkey. In January, artist and sculptor Sahej Rahal, 30, displayed his latest creation, Juggernaut, at Mumbai’s Chatterjee &amp; Lal. It’s an AI-driven audio-visual piece inspired by video games. The video traces the journey of a droid as it floats through an alternative civilisation, constantly evolving and building itself up by picking up totems and ruins of pillars to self-create a multi-limbed sculptural installation.Around the world, artists are exploring the interface between art and artificial intelligence, to create works, some of which are even being auctioned. The New York auction house Christie’s sold the AI-generated print, Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, by Paris-based art collective Obvious, for $432,500, last year. Sotheby’s followed suit and sold the two-screen installation Memories of Passerby I by Mario Klingemann for £32,000 earlier this month.“We have only just begun exploring AI-driven art as a genre in India and there is much scope for it to grow,” says artist Raghava KK, who is also co-founder of 64/1. “I have always thought of myself as a cyborg and there are a couple of others like me who find working with AI an extremely exciting prospect.” FIRST BRUSHSince 2014, Raghava has been using different forms of technology, from drawing on iPads and tapping into brainwaves, to create art. “Now the computer science department of Ashoka University also plans to include AI-driven art in their curriculum,” he says. Agrawal’s first tech-based art project was The Flying Pantograph in 2015, which used a pen-carrying drone to draw on a vertical wall. “The motion dynamics of the drone and the software intelligence added a new visual language to the art,” he explains. The art from that first experiment ended up being, essentially, a scribble. But this got him interested in how human and machine could come together for creative expression, which prompted him to design a software program called Tandem in 2016.Tandem uses an algorithm that lets the computer imagine and suggest a visual output. A roughly drawn figure of trees can be interpreted as dogs; the human artist interfacing with the AI can also add filters of emotions like happy, sad or dreamy, which the computer will interpret in the form of hues. Agrawal’s AI art created through Tandem has been exhibited at AI art exhibitions in South Korea, Germany, Austria, the US and Australia. His latest work, The Anatomy Lesson…, was created after he fed 60,000 images of surgical dissections into a similar algorithm. “The feedback I’ve got for this work has been as exciting as the creative process,” he says. One observer told him a painting reminded him of the interiors of a cave; a woman said she felt it celebrated womanhood.ONES &amp; ZEROESArtist Baiju Parthan says one thing holding back AI art in India is the large expense involved in creating your own algorithm.While Agrawal had considerable assistance from the MIT Media Lab, Rahal used his rudimentary programming knowledge and a free game development program called Unity to create Juggernaut. “After several messy rounds of programming, I managed to write a code that lets the droid perceive its space, choose objects around it, overcome obstacles and create an end product,” he says. The programme produces new sculptural forms every time the simulation is run. “My art is heavily inspired by the video games I’ve played all my life. This has a videogame feel but a deeper subtext of evolving time, history and cultures.”Artists have been using technology for a long time, and it was inevitable that AI would be part of this process as well, says art critic and curator Girish Shahane. Artist and curator Bose Krishnamachari, co-founder of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, disagrees.“I would like to think that AI-driven art is a temporary phase. Internationally, it has become a big trend and while I appreciate it, I don’t see it as something that is here to stay or is a big game-changer,” he says.Meanwhile, with a degree from IIT-Guwahati and a Masters in media, arts and science from MIT, Agrawal is keen on researching ways of merging science and art, but his mother is struggling to understand how her engineer son can also be an artist. “She was taken aback by the surgery images and it took her a while to understand how tech programs can help create art,” he says, laughing. “But she is slowly opening up to how both the fields can meet and I hope so can rest of the art world.”","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/meet-the-indians-using-artificial-intelligence-to-create-art/story-t6bL8UA0IG9WRW0IxwPmEK.html'}",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Hindustan Times', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com'}","['India News', 'Trending', 'Cricket', 'World News', 'Cities', 'Business', 'Opinion', 'Analysis', 'Lifestyle', 'Entertainment', 'Education', 'Astrology', 'HT Premium', 'Elections 2024', 'Videos', 'Photos', 'Sports', 'Web Stories', 'Science', 'HT Insight', 'Games', 'Podcasts']","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/htlogo-v1.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimes', 'https://twitter.com/htTweets', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hindustantimes', 'https://www.instagram.com/hindustantimes/', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ht']",lifestyle,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1.hdg1', 'h2.sortDec']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle', 'name': 'Lifestyle'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture', 'name': 'art culture'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'name': 'Meet the Indians using artificial intelligence to create art'}}]",,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Hindustan Times House, 18-20, Kasturba Gandhi Marg', 'addressLocality': 'New Delhi', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '110 001'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91 – 11 – 60004242', 'contactType': 'Customer Service', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:00', 'closes': '18:00'}}",en,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg', 'caption': 'Bengaluru-based Harshit Agrawal’s artwork, created using an algorithm called Tandem, was showcased at Art Centre Nabi, in Seoul, South Korea, in 2016.', 'description': 'Bengaluru-based Harshit Agrawal’s artwork, created using an algorithm called Tandem, was showcased at Art Centre Nabi, in Seoul, South Korea, in 2016.', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}"

The University of Toronto’s Geoffrey Hinton has been named one of three recipients of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award – dubbed by some “the Nobel Prize of computing” – for his decades-long work advancing the field of artificial intelligence.
Hinton, a U of T University Professor Emeritus who also works at Google, was named alongside two of his friends and longtime collaborators – Yann LeCun, of Facebook and New York University, and Yoshua Bengio, of Université de Montréal.
The Association for Computing Machinery lauded the three for making “conceptual and engineering breakthroughs” in deep neural networks – an area of AI inquiry that was once deemed fanciful, but is now considered transformational and is touching the lives of billions of people.  
""It's very nice that the group of us have been recognized as having a big impact,” said Hinton, who has sometimes been referred to as the “godfather” of deep learning, as the field is known.
“It's sort of an acceptance by the computer science community that this stuff isn't crazy.”
The A.M. Turing Award, named for British mathematician Alan Turing, who first articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing, is the premier international award for achievements in computing and includes a $1 million prize funded by Google.
It’s the second time the award has been given to a U of T researcher. University Professor Emeritus Stephen Cook won it in 1982 “for his advancement of our understanding of the complexity of computation in a significant and profound way.” Alumnus and former faculty member William Morton Kahan also won the award in 1989 while he was a faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley. Former postdoctoral researcher Silvio Micali, now a faculty member at MIT, won in 2012.
“I want to congratulate Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for their incredible work – and sheer perseverance – in advancing the field of artificial intelligence over so many years,” said U of T President Meric Gertler.
“Their determination to follow paths others had rejected is testament to the importance of supporting basic research, which may not always produce results quickly – but can lead to profound discoveries over time that forever change our world.”
In recent years, the deep learning techniques Hinton, LeCun and Bengio helped pioneer have been used to achieve breakthroughs in a range of applications – everything from voice recognition software in people’s phones to algorithms that can spot cancerous tumours in medical scans. That, in turn, has sparked a gold rush for Canadian talent, prompting nearly a dozen multinational companies to set up AI labs in cities like Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton.
Canada’s early lead in deep learning also helped lay the foundation for initiatives like the Vector Institute of Artificial Intelligence, where Hinton is the chief scientific adviser. The centre will be moving into the first phase of U of T’s new Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre – a 750,000 square-foot innovation complex on College Street that’s being supported by a $100-million donation by Onex Corp. founder and CEO Gerald Schwartz and Indigo founder and CEO Heather Reisman. 
It wasn’t always this way. Hinton recalled a time when he, LeCun and Bengio were relegated to the fringes of computer science research for their insistence that computers could learn in a way that mimics the human brain.
""We stuck to that when almost everyone else in artificial intelligence and computer science didn't,” said Hinton.
“It wasn't quite the same in psychology, where a lot of people believed in neural networks. But if you looked at the people doing computer science and machine learning, they became thoroughly disenchanted with them.""

Hinton said he first met LeCun at an academic conference in Paris in 1985. Intrigued by his work, he later agreed to become his external thesis adviser. There was only one small problem: “The exam was in French and I didn't speak French, so the only thing I understood in his thesis was the equations,” Hinton said. “But that was the important part.""
LeCun would later do post-doctoral research in Hinton’s Toronto lab before going on to work at AT&T’s Bell Labs, where his early work in convolutional neural networks would be used to read hand-written text. At the time, however, few people believed the technique could be applied to photographs of three-dimensional scenes.
Hinton’s relationship with Bengio, who also spent time at Bell Labs, would develop a few years later, though neither one can pinpoint the exact date.
Regardless, all three men were moving in the same circles and, research-wise, were on the same page.
Beginning in 2004, the trio’s work really started to come together. That’s when Hinton set up a program with the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) focused on machine learning and computer vision, which included both LeCun and Bengio.
Now meeting on a regular schedule, the three began regularly sharing ideas that informed each other’s work. In particular, Hinton recalled holding unofficial meetings in advance of a conference the three of them attended every year in Vancouver.
""Those were very important meetings,” Hinton said. “We would discuss all sorts of unpublished ideas and it was relatively small group of people, so you didn't need to waste time describing basic things.
“That was very useful for making progress.""
Hinton said the CIFAR program was key to advancing the group’s research. And he stressed it wouldn’t have happened without the help of past CIFAR head Chaviva Hosek, who was a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy and  “who got the point very quickly,” and another senior CIFAR executive named Mel Silverman, a University Professor Emeritus of medicine, who helped sketch out a research proposal.
""The funding allowed us to work together again.""
For Hinton, a big public breakthrough came in 2012 after he and two of his students, Alex Krishevsky and Ilya Sutskever, entered an image recognition and classification competition called ImageNet and shocked the computer vision community by almost halving the next-best error rate.
“We showed that the computer vision community was completely wrong and that Yann's convolutional nets, with a few extra tricks, could do much better than they could at recognizing things in photographs,"" Hinton said.
Deep learning had finally arrived, although it’s not like Hinton, LeCun or Bengio were the least bit surprised.
""We all had very similar basic beliefs about how neural networks were the right things to do,” Hinton said, “and that they would win in the end.""
