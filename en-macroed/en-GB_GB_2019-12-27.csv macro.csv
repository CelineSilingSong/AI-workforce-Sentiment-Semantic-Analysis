The very same warehouse workers once predicted to be losing their jobs to mechanical replacements.But doing your job side-by-side with robots isn’t easy. According to their makers, the machines should take on the most mundane and physically strenuous tasks. In reality, they’re also creating new forms of stress and strain in the form of injuries and the unease of working in close quarters with mobile half-ton devices that direct themselves.“They weigh a lot,” Amazon worker Amanda Taillon says during the pre-Christmas rush at a company warehouse in Connecticut. Nearby, a fleet of 6ft-tall roving robot shelves zipped around behind a chain-link fence.Taillon’s job is to enter a cage and tame Amazon’s wheeled warehouse robots for long enough to pick up a fallen toy or relieve a traffic jam. She straps on a light-up utility belt that works like a superhero’s force field, commanding the nearest robots to abruptly halt and the others to slow down or adjust their routes.“When you’re out there, and you can hear them moving around, but you can’t see them, it’s like, ‘Where are they going to come from?’,” she says. “It’s a little nerve-racking at first.”'Antiquities' carved by robotsShow all 191/19'Antiquities' carved by robots'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCTodd White 'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCTodd White 'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCTodd White 'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCAmazon and its rivals are increasingly requiring warehouse employees to get used to working with robots. The company now has more than 200,000 robotic vehicles it calls “drives” that are moving goods through its delivery fulfillment centres around the US. That’s double the number it had last year and up from 15,000 units in 2014.Its rivals have taken notice, and many are adding their own robots in a race to speed up productivity and bring down costs.Without these fast-moving pods, robotic arms and other forms of warehouse automation, retailers say they wouldn’t be able to fulfill consumer demand for packages that can land on doorsteps the day after you order them online.But while fears that robots will replace human workers haven’t come to fruition, there are growing concerns that keeping up with the pace of the latest artificial intelligence technology is taking a toll on human workers’ health, safety and morale.Warehouses powered by robotics and AI software are leading to human burnout by adding more work and upping the pressure on workers to speed up their performance, says Beth Gutelius, who studies urban economic development at the University of Illinois at Chicago and has interviewed warehouse operators around the US.A robotic arm lifts a pallet of merchandise inside an Amazon Fulfillment Center (Getty)It’s not that workers aren’t getting trained on how to work with robots safely. “The problem is it becomes very difficult to do so when the productivity standards are set so high,” she says.Much of the boom in warehouse robotics has its roots in Amazon’s $775m (£591m) purchase of Massachusetts start-up Kiva Systems in 2012. The tech giant rebranded it as Amazon Robotics and transformed it into an in-house laboratory that for seven years has been designing and building Amazon’s robot armada.Amazon’s Kiva purchase “set the tone for all the other retailers to stand up and pay attention”, says Jim Liefer, CEO of San Francisco start-up Kindred AI, which makes an artificially intelligent robotic arm that grasps and sorts items for retailers such as The Gap.A rush of venture capital and private sector investment in warehouse robotics spiked to $1.5bn (£1.1bn) a year in 2015 and has remained high ever since, says Rian Whitton, a robotics analyst at ABI Research.Canadian e-commerce company Shopify spent $450m (£343m) this fall to buy Massachusetts-based start-up 6 River Systems, which makes an autonomous cart nicknamed Chuck that can follow workers around a warehouse. Other mobile robot startups are partnering with delivery giants such as FedEx and DHL or retailers such as Walmart.A Scout robot is being tested near Amazon’s Seattle headquarters (Amazon)Amazon this year bought another warehouse robotics start-up, Colorado-based Canvas Technology, which builds wheeled robots guided by computer vision. Such robots would be more fully autonomous than Amazon’s current fleet of caged-off vehicles, which have to follow bar codes and previously mapped routes within warehouses.The tech giant is also still rolling out new models descended from the Kiva line, including the Pegasus, a squarish vehicle with a conveyor belt on top that can be found working the early-morning shift at a warehouse in the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear, Arizona. A crisscrossing fleet of robots carries packaged items across the floor and drops them into chutes based on the zip code of their final destination.All of this is transforming warehouse work in a way that the head of Amazon Robotics says can “extend human capability” by shifting people to what they are best at: problem-solving, common sense and thinking on their feet.Robots sends packages down a chute which will deliver them to workers (AP)“The efficiencies we gain from our associates and robotics working together harmoniously – what I like to call a symphony of humans and machines working together – allows us to pass along a lower cost to our customer,” says Tye Brady, Amazon Robotics’ chief technologist.Brady says worker safety remains the top priority and ergonomic design is engineered into the systems at the beginning of the design stage. Gutelius, the University of Illinois researcher, says that the aspiration for symphonic human-machine operations is not always working out in practice.“It sounds quite lovely, but I rarely hear from a worker’s perspective that that’s what it feels like,” she says.Gutelius co-authored a report published this fall that found new warehouse technology could contribute to wage stagnation, higher turnover and poorer quality work experiences because of the way AI software can monitor and micro-manage workers’ behaviours.A worker stows packages into special containers after robots deliver them separated by postcode (AP)A recent journalistic investigation of injury rates at Amazon warehouses from The Centre for Investigative Reporting’s Reveal found that robotic warehouses reported more injuries than those without.Reveal looked at records from 28 Amazon warehouses in 16 states and found that the overall rate of serious injuries was more than double the warehousing industry average. Amazon has countered it is misleading to compare its rate with rivals because of the company’s “aggressive stance on recording injuries no matter how big or small”.The Reveal report also found a correlation between robots and safety problems, such as in Tracy, California, where the serious injury rate nearly quadrupled in the four years after robots were introduced.Melonee Wise, CEO of California-based Fetch Robotics – which sells its autonomous robotic carts to retailers and other clients – credits Amazon’s Kiva acquisition for propelling innovation in the industry.Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsBut she says that Amazon’s system forces workers to do “un-ergonomic moves” such as reaching up high or crouching down to pick out and stow inventory into the shelves-on-wheels.“They have robots that live in cages,” she says. “Our robots are designed to work safely around people, which is a very large distinction between the two systems.”Amazon hasn’t disclosed how its safety record at robot-powered warehouses compares to those without. But company officials remain optimistic that Amazon workers are adapting to the new technology.At a visit with a reporter earlier in December to the warehouse in North Haven, Connecticut, Brady was explaining the workings of a powerful robotic arm called a “palletiser” when crates it was stacking on a pallet started tumbling over. Unfazed by the temporary malfunction, he watched as an employee disabled the machine, discovered an apparent structural weakness in the pallet, adjusted the stack of crates and let the robot get back to work.“His ability to problem-solve that was like this,” Brady says, enthusiastically snapping his fingers. “What I love about that is it’s humans and machines working together.”Associated PressMore aboutAmazonartificial intelligenceRoboticsTechnologyWorkers RightsJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/5Are warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Are warehouse robots causing more harm than good?A robotic arm lifts a pallet of merchandise inside an Amazon Fulfillment CenterGettyAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?A Scout robot is being tested near Amazon’s Seattle headquartersAmazonAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Robots sends packages down a chute which will deliver them to workersAPAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?A worker stows packages into special containers after robots deliver them separated by postcodeAPAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Machines ‘creating new forms of stress’ and causing increasing injuries, experts say ✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Why humans should work with machines rather than against them

Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new technology but has been around for the past 60 years. 
With the growth of data rising in the computing ecosystem and talent growth, it is nearly everywhere in the form of chatbots, internet search engines, product recommendations or in security platforms. 
At present, much of the investment in AI is done by a handful of international companies, which are leading the way in demonstrating to the rest of the world how to harness the full potential of these new technologies. 
AI has the potential to do so much more yet there is a tremendous amount of skepticism about the technology – the economics of it is quite hazy, for instance – and its usefulness to humans. 
In this piece, we will explore some of the possible human concerns regarding AI and examine the merit of these concerns. But before that let’s understand how AI and machine learning are related – AI means getting a computer to mimic human behaviour in some form or manner, and machine learning is a subset of AI – it constitutes systems that enable computers to analyse data and deliver AI applications.
Human concerns regarding AI 
The most common fears surrounding AI today are:
* Machine learning being synthetic as it is passed from humans and not all of the human knowledge can be infused into a machine 
* Machine-based decisions are biased and could be non-inclusive in nature by favouring a particular section of the society 
* Machine-based decisions are difficult to explain and may not stand in the court of law 
* When machines start to learn by themselves, humans would lose control and machines may take over humanity 
These are some important ones, though the list could go on. Let’s examine the implications of these in the society.
If machine intelligence is artificial, human intelligence is more artificial. No one is born with intelligence. Human intelligence is an accumulation of knowledge over time and from different sources. 
The idea of AI is to pass the collective confirmed human intelligence to machines for doing the routine tasks traditionally done by humans. 
It’s a misunderstanding that AI is a panacea for all problems, but it certainly can bring scale and efficiency to certain mundane activities. The machine learns from the data, and more the data, smarter the machine. This is the true potential of AI technologies. It is therefore important that we understand and leverage the technology in an appropriate way.
Another concern is that machine-based decisions are biased and non-inclusive. Humans have strong bias around income groups, race and gender.
They also have cognitive biases which cloud their judgement and decision making. AI learns from societal actions and if that’s biased then how can you expect AI algorithms to be bias-free? This is not a flaw of technology but a reflection of conscious/unconscious bias and prejudice that exists in the society. 
In fact, the AI technology is mirroring the society and that helps us to better identify societal shortcomings. The upside is that AI connects unconnected to the mainstream world. Its gives access to information, product and services which the unconnected segment might not have imagined in their current lifetime. For some of us, AI is deeply inclusive, both economically and socially. AI, if implemented in the right way, can help us reducing bias from our day to day decisioning process.
Another thing that makes humans uneasy about this new technology is that it is inexplicable in nature. AI models are known as black-box algorithms – higher the complexity, better the accuracy and hence harder to interpret. If we are using a tool for taking certain critical decisions, it is important to know what drives those decisions. Without this clarity, there is bound to be anxiety around the technology. 
The AI community is well aware of these deficiencies, and the next wave of AI will be about addressing the inexplicable factor surrounding this technology without necessarily exposing the commercial secrets. It is important to note that this technology is still in a nascent stage, and these doubts and fears should not hold us back from experimenting and benefitting from it.
Machines are getting smarter by the day and there is fear that smart machines will may take over human jobs in future. In a recent conference held in Shanghai, Elon Musk claimed that smart machines will surpass humans in every single way, while Jack Ma argued that humans will always be in charge of their destiny when it comes to technology – the truth may be somewhere in between. 
Experience so far tells us that machine have not been creative enough to learn anything outside data and hence there is limited possibility that machines will take over human talent in the foreseeable future. While AI may displace some jobs, it will also create jobs. PwC predicts that AI will create over 7.2 million jobs in the UK alone over the next two decades.
Machines and humans can co-exist for a smarter future
The first three industrial revolutions have transformed our society with digital technology playing an integral role. The fourth industrial revolution will see smart machines and humans collaborating further – driving hybrid decision making and producing better results. We need to place more accountability in the hands of the algorithm experts to produce benevolent smart machines which can create ethically sound, socially conscious, politically acceptable and economically viable decisions. 
But, in the meantime, lets learn how to work with machines rather than against them.

From The Reading ListArtnome: ""AI Artist Robbie Barrat And Painter Ronan Barrot Collaborate On 'Infinite Skulls' "" — ""It is early in the year, but the most compelling show for art and tech in 2019 may already be happening. AI artist and Artnome favorite Robbie Barrat has teamed up with renowned French painter Ronan Barrot for a fascinating show that lives somewhere in the margin between collaboration and confrontation.""The L'Avant Galerie Vossen emailed Robbie last April after seeing his AI nude portraits and asked if he would be willing to fly out to Paris to work with Ronan. Robbie agreed and flew out last July to meet with Ronan, and the two have been working together ever since. The show titled 'BARRAT/BARROT: Infinite Skulls' opens Thursday, February 7th, and literally features an 'infinite' number of skulls.""For the last two decades, it has been artist Ronan Barrot’s tradition to use the remaining paint on his palette to paint a skull each time he stops, interrupts, or finishes a painting. As it was explained to me, the skulls are like a side process of the main painting, it’s like when you clean out your motor after driving for miles and miles. Ronan now estimates that he has painted a few thousand of these, and this massive visual data set of painted skulls was perfect for AI artist Robbie Barrat to use in training his GANs (generative adversarial networks).""GANs are comprised of two neural networks, which are essentially programs designed to think like a human brain. In our case, we can think of these neural networks as being like two people: first, a 'generator,' whom we will think of as an art forger, and second, as a 'discriminator,' whom we will think of as the art critic. Now imagine that we gave the art forger a book with 500 skulls painted by Ronan as training material that he could use to create a forgery to fool the critic. If the forger looked at only three or four of Ronan’s paintings, he may not be very good at making a forgery, and the critic would likely figure out the forgery pretty quickly. But after looking at enough of the paintings and trying over and over again, the forger may actually start producing paintings good enough to fool the critic, right? This is precisely what happens with GANs in AI art.""AdvertisementWBGO: ""With 'Natural Machines,' Pianist Dan Tepfer Brings Coding and VR Into an Improv Arena"" — ""Dan Tepfer is a jazz pianist whose newest project, Natural Machines, brings virtual reality and algorithmic learning into the realm of the concert hall. He appears next Tuesday at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, where his audience will join him in an immersive audiovisual saga.""What kind of music J.S. Bach might be making today? Tepfer has long been obsessed with that composer’s famous Goldberg Variations — making it the subject of his 2011 album, Golberg Variations / Variations — and recently started thinking about how the same idea could propel a state-of-the-art musical idea.""Tepfer, who was formally trained as an astrophysicist but self-taught as a computer programmer, writes his own code for a Yamaha Disklavier, enabling the digital player piano to react to his improvisations in real time.""This program aired on December 30, 2019.Thank you for choosing journalism from WBUR and On Point. I’m here to ask if you would make another choice. Journalism is experiencing a profound disruption. Digital technologies and platforms are upending how we fund our work.

Some the works are still images, while others are videos.At first glance, none of it seems to make any kind of sense.“People freeze. They’re mesmerized. They literally won’t move,” Morton said. “It’s like they have to look, and from what I’ve been told, get their bearings.”Morton’s work is part of a budding art form — one that uses artificial intelligence to generate images and visuals.VIDEO: An Austin artist explains how AI is used to create artDubbed generative art, the works are created through non-human systems, such as computers.Artists have used algorithms and computers to generate art as early as the 1950s. University of Texas art historian and curator Taylor Bradley said the infusion of AI into the generative art genre is a relatively new development.“Across the country, there are shows going up all the time about digital art, AI-generated art, smart technologies and what have you,” she said. “I think there is plenty of acceptance and excitement over this new medium.”Despite its recent arrival on the scene, Bradley said the practice of using AI to create art reminds her of a period in art history when artisans and craftsman used to hone their various skills to create beautiful vases and furniture.“I think artists have always been engineers who are inventing, innovating and pushing the limits of technology,” Bradley said.Before Morton opened her East 6th Street gallery — named the Generative Art Project — she was entrenched in the world of fashion. She has also worked as an art columnist in New York.Morton said the new brand of AI-powered generative art forces people to look inward for meaning rather than using external context.“For the first time in my life in a very overarching way, this work is arousing our self-awareness of our animalistic nature,” Morton said.Many of the artists whose works are featured in the gallery will first collect data sets found in the real world. Then, through the use of artificial intelligence, artists find patterns in data sets that can be incorporated into their work through visualization tools.Because the data is grounded in reality, Morton said, people gain a sense of familiarity even in generative art that looks completely abstract.“You get a feeling that you’re in the presence of a living, real thing,” Morton said. “And that changes both how you experience the work as well as how you try to understand it.”Morton’s husband, James Pricer, is a local artist who creates art with the help of artificial intelligence.For one of his works, Pricer used data that he collected from a person’s life, including their blood pressure, heart rate and genetic information.Though his art is largely enabled by the analysis powered by artificial intelligence, Pricer says the final part of his process depends on something much more human.“What tells me that I’m finished is when I have a very strong emotional reaction,” he said.Pricer, who has a background in data science, says he had long wanted to find out a way to communicate to others the meaning he found in numbers.“Traditionally in the art world, you either had representational art or abstract art. Just like bridging tech and art, I thought if I could bridge representation and abstraction, that would make it possible for me to communicate what I see and feel in the data, and it’s turning out to be true,” Pricer said.João Beira is the founder of Datagrama Visuals, a company based in Austin that organizes performances and exhibitions using AI-generated art.Beira came to the United States from his native Portugal about 10 years ago to pursue a doctoral degree in digital media at the University of Texas at Austin.“I realized that even though Austin is in touch with the musical experience, visually, there was not really much going on in terms of bringing new ideas and doing things outside the norm,” Beira said.Beira said the lack of an existing community is not necessarily a hindrance. Rather, he said it presents more of a blank canvass that he and other generative artists can fill.“Austin might not be the first city you think about when you think about this technology, but the fact that the scene does not yet exist helps us build a foundation to build something here,” Beira said.Beira said he finds meaning in generative art that is inspired by nature.“You can find, for example, how trees grow and how they generate branches, or how the scales of a fish are organized,” Beira said. “You can actually replicate these different patterns and algorithms, and you can generate them in real-time.”Beira uses different programs to create his works, such as “DeepDream” — an artificial intelligence-enabled software created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev that studies patterns in images and generates its own shapes and colors in based on the patterns that it has identified.Beira’s company also uses software created by an Austin-based company called “Synesthesia Live,” to create visualizations at live music performances.None of the visuals are pre-programmed by Beira to look a specific way.The added element of unpredictability, Beira said, is what makes AI-generated art exciting for him. Beira said he hopes his art can help people gain a better understanding of human consciousness, and in the process, themselves.“It’s not so much me being the creator and the ideas I have in my head,” Beira said. “It’s more about me being an architect, pulling all these things together and seeing where it takes me because it’s completely unpredictable how the machine learns to see the world, just like a child when it first starts to look around the world and begins making the notion of their own world.”Want to hear Austin’s top news every weekday morning?

1. Wearables went mainstream, but AR glasses like Google Glass and Snap Spectacles  aren't as big a deal as tech companies thought they'd be.











                                                  Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
                                                


In 2009, futurist Ross Dawson predicted that in the coming decade we could see ""augmented humans"" with AR glasses or contacts allowing us to control machines. Instead, Google Glass and Snap Spectacles both made Business Insider's list of ""Worst Tech of the Decade.""Something about the tech just didn't resonate with people, beyond the few superfans who tried them. Shortly after Google Glass was released, Google even had to warn wearers not to be ""creepy or rude (aka, a 'Glasshole')."" The company ended consumer sales of Glass in 2015.







2. Augmented reality, in general, isn't as advanced as experts predicted 10 years ago. Breakouts like Pokémon Go were big hits, but other consumer products haven't gone far.











                                                  Reuters
                                                


Futurist Gerd Leonhard predicted that tablets would usher in an era of augmented reality's dominance, which would be a ""huge boon"" to content production. AR has allowed for fun Snapchat effects and games like Pokemon Go, but it hasn't changed daily life in the way that people thought it would — at least not yet.

3. Self-driving cars have gotten more advanced, but they're not about to take over the roads anytime soon.











                                                  Mark Matousek/Business Insider
                                                


Autonomous vehicle technology from companies like Tesla has definitely improved, and reports of drivers falling asleep at the wheel have mostly been without injuries as the cars were able to compensate. But Tesla still says that autopilot mode requires ""active driver supervision,"" and a Tesla in autopilot mode earlier this month crashed into a police car, proving that the system is far from perfect. Self-driving tech from Alphabet and Uber have also yet to see a wide launch, and largely remain in the testing phase.

4. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were supposed to be the future, but they haven't been widely adopted, and Facebook's Libra currency has caused headaches for the company.

The last decade has seen plenty of highs and lows for cryptocurrencies. Investing in bitcoin early could have made you very wealthy by now, but many analysts see it as a bubble or niche financial product.Cryptocurrency exchanges have been hacked, sometimes leading to investors losing their holdings. Some early investors have made millions, others trying to get in on the craze have seen their investments fall to a fraction of their value as crypto prices fluctuate wildly.Facebook is working on the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on the subject before the House Financial Services Committee in October. Lawmakers have been critical of the project, and many major backers including PayPal and Visa have dropped out.

5. Some scientists and researchers predicted that artificial intelligence would help us avoid human shortcomings, like bias, but while the technology shows promise, it's far from perfect.











                                                  Fabrizio Bensch/ Reuters
                                                


Incorporating AI into sectors like policing was predicted to to help us avoid prejudice, but even as AI plays an increasingly important role in daily tasks, bias among AI exists. In fact, researchers keep finding evidence that AI is far from perfect and can introduce similar biases as those held by people. From an AI algorithm that kept black patients from getting the same quality of medical care as white patients, to hiring algorithms that learned to prefer male candidates, it's clearly early days for the technology.

NITI Aayog’s roadmap for the national Artificial Intelligence (AI) program has given wings to the technology revolution in India. AI offers opportunities to complement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and work. India is recognising the potential of AI to change economies. India’s approach to implementation of AI has to be guided by optimisation of social goods, rather than maximisation of topline growth.
Let us explore the impact or changes AI has made on several sectors in India.
Role of AI in Indian Farming



Agriculture is a vibrant part of the Indian economy. AI has entered the Indian agriculture sector though lately but progressively. AI together with the Internet of Things and sensor technology can be the great enabler of precision agriculture. AI can also play a critical role along with remote sensing technology in the wide-scale implementation of Climate-Smart Agriculture. Some of the AI Techniques like Mobile-based Recommender Systems and Expert Systems can drastically increase the adoption rate of agriculture technologies like high yielding or disease-resistant varieties, innovative farm implements thereby help in increasing farmer’s income. 



Microsoft is addressing the problems in farming by detecting plant diseases, predicting climate changes and helping farmers to increase crop yields. Microsoft and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics developed an AI Sowing App. The app states the right time to sow crops which is often the challenge for Indian farmers where drought and excess rainfall are serious challenges. The app uses machine learning andbusiness intelligence from the Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite.



IIT-Bombay alumnus Milan Sharma company,  Intello Labs claims to provides advanced image recognition technology that can recognize objects, faces, flora fauna and tag them in any image. The company claims to use deep learning algorithms on which a new generation of intelligent applications are being built for applications including agriculture. 



The company’s image based solutions provide insights into the crops’ health during the growing season and its final harvested quality by a click of a photograph.Gobasco, another company, uses AI and related technologies in the various stages of the agriculture supply chain to ensure it is efficient and fast. It claims to employ real-time data analytics on data-streams coming from multiple sources across the country aided with AI- optimized automated pipelines to dramatically increase the efficiency of the current agriculture supply chain.
AI in Indian Defense



Artificial Intelligence has been used mainly for commercial work and yet to dominate defence sector in India. Addressing the Army Technology Seminar Army chief said the next revolution in military affairs will be defined by technology and innovations in technology. “We need to address, how can we incorporate AI and big data into our system. If we don’t start now, it will be too late.” Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat.The process of preparing Indian defense forces for the use of AI has already been started by the ministry of defense.  In February 2018, a multi-stakeholder task force on Strategic Implementation of Artificial Intelligence for National Security and Defence was constituted.The objective of the task force is to study the whole range of issues on the implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on National security and defense needs. It has studied research and innovation in Artificial Intelligence and how it can be adopted in the defense sector.



The Defence Public Sector Undertakings and ordnance factories have been asked to develop AI-enabled products. A project has been sanctioned to the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), a DRDO based laboratory.



CAIR has developed self-directed technology-based products to focus on strategic command control in communication systems. CAIR has developed snake robots, sentries and Hexa-robots for surveillance and investigation purposes.Some of the projects take account of AI-based solutions to signal intelligence for enhancing intelligence collation and analysis capabilities to the armed forces.Another project named, Energy Harvesting Based Infrared Sensor Network for Automated Human Intrusion Detection (EYESIRa) is another project. AI-based tools would aid the defense forces constructively in areas of decision support, sensor data analysis, predictive maintenance, situational awareness, accurate data extraction, security, etc. These tools will assist the defense personnel in better operations, maintenance, and logistics support.As reported, the Army Design Bureau has built an AI-based night vision device that will be mounted on helmet and wristband which is attached to it, vibrates when the device picks up on movement in the area. This will warn soldiers of unusual activity across different terrains and in high altitude areas.
 AI In Healthcare 



Indian government’s Niti Aayog has placed healthcare among one of the focus areas for AI  intervention. The Indian healthcare industry has faced many challenges and still struggling. As a country with over 1.3 billion population suffers from an acute shortage of doctors, doctors unwillingness to practice in rural areas and many more. AI startups and private players are working towards the adoption of AI in healthcare. AIIMS has already incorporated AI and Machine Learning into their research. Researchers from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, (IIIT-D) and AIIMS collaborated for a project that uses thermal images and AI to predict hemodynamic shock or insufficient oxygen supply to organs leading to multi-organ failure in children even before doctors can diagnose the condition. 



In another case, researchers from the National Brain Research Centre (NBRC), and Neuroimaging and Neurospectroscopy Laboratory (NINS) used AI for early detection of Alzheimer’s.Medical education has not been untouched by the advent of AI. The Supreme Court suggested that advanced technologies like AI and ML should be leveraged to look into verification of medical colleges by the Medical Council of India (MCI) to grant permissions.Microsoft India and Apollo Hospital Group have collaborated to set up a National Clinical Coordination Committee (NCCC) which will work for the AI-powered Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Score API designed to foresee the risk of CVD in the population of the country.



Though Indian companies have made progress in the direction of embedding AI/ML capabilities into some of the diagnostic systems and treatment protocols, these are restricted to pilots and in high-end hospitals. Medicine is convoluted and it keeps changing. Artificial intelligence may not replace doctors in the near future but they can be a reliable assistant.

AI in Indian Transportation System



The growing Indian population has catalyzed the higher demand for mobility. Delhi government is planning to invest around ₹1,000 crore in the intelligent traffic management system, to fix the existing traffic system in India’s capital. The new system will work on radar-based monitoring with the help of AI. There have been also instances where these intelligent services have been extended to crowd management and service delivery as well. Allahabad police have already used new tech to manage vehicular and transportation traffic at the Kumbh Mela, one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. Indian Railways will use AI to find digital innovations for better customer interface and better service delivery. India’s Railway minister Piyush Goyal had said, “AI can transform Indian Railways in terms of safety, passenger amenities, better revenues, growth and efficiency.” AI forecasting application can predict train delays, maintenance of tracks. AI can solve oﬄine planning problems for a railway network, rescheduling, freight scheduling and many more.



Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are the two Indian states to use Artificial Intelligence in the public transport systems. The states are set to install AI-powered anti-collision systems with two sensors to be fitted in the front bumper and the second near the headlight switch of the buses to avoid the accidents by continuously tracking and observing the object within the range up to 180 feet and indicating the bus driver in case of his being sleepy and inattentive.



NITI Aayog and International Road Federation, Genrva signed an agreement to cooperate in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems and to design a policy framework for the same. Pune has already planned an ITS implementations focussing on signal priority, vehicle tracking and automatic fare collection.  Delhi, parking lot at Palika Bazar has simplified the parking issue of 1,050 cars and 500 two-wheelers with the help of electronic parking guidance and VMS smart cards. 
AI in Banking Sector

ICICI Bank: In the month of February this year, ICICI bank has launched its AI-based chatbot, named iPal to interact with the customers to answer their queries. It has been reported that the iPal has interacted with 3.1 million customers and answered about 6 million queries with 90% accuracy rate.  ICICI Lombard General Insurance is not only using Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to improve claims processing and settlement but also to detect frauds in motor and health insurance segments. With the application of AI and machine learning the insurer is able to check whether a hospital is sending claims for a particular illness at a particular price or not with greater efficiency and accuracy. Earlier AI was used to sanction straight forward cases like cataract and maternity but now it will be also used for complex cases like dengue. The company is looking forward to using AI in other various operations too. State Bank Of India: SBI has started AI to reduce additional cost, improve efficiency and detect human behavior. SBI has ‘SBI Intelligent Assistant’ (SIA)- a smart chat assistant which is evolved from the ‘cutting edge technology of AI’ that resolves the queries of NRI customers in an efficient manner like a bank representative.

HDFC Bank: HDFC’s Bank chatbot EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant) is India’s first and largest AI-powered banking chatbot. EVA is available 24 hours and uses the latest in AI and natural language processing to understand customers’ queries and fetch the relevant information in just a millisecond.
