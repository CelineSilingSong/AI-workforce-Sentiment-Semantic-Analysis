Many organizations are struggling to find strategies for recruiting a more diverse workforce, and some are turning to artificial intelligence (AI). But artificial intelligence got a bad rap last year when news got out that Amazon's internal AI recruiting tool had ""learned"" gender bias. So, is AI beneficial to those seeking diversity, or will it just exacerbate the problem? One recruiting firm has found that AI is an effective strategy for increasing the diversity of candidate pools, as long as its implemented correctly.


The Problems With Using AI In Recruiting

Amazon scrapped its internal AI recruiting efforts after realizing that the test recruiting program they designed was biased against women. The computer models were trained with résumés submitted to Amazon over the previous ten years. Not surprisingly, most of these résumés came from men. Therefore, the computer models “learned” that men were superior job candidates. 

As a result, the models became biased against women, generating lower ratings to graduates of two all-women’s colleges and penalizing résumés that contained the word “women’s” as in “women’s chess club captain.” Although the programs could be altered to become neutral to these particular terms, Amazon decided to scrap the project out of fear that the models may develop other discriminatory selection criteria.

The Benefits Of Using AI In Recruiting
Despite Amazon's setbacks, Genevieve Jurvetson, cofounder and CMO of the artificial intelligence-based recruiting firm, Fetcher, believes AI is an essential tool for those seeking a more diverse candidate pool. “If you get too caught up in the fears surrounding AI, you miss a huge opportunity,"" Jurvetson says. She explains that there are innumerable criteria that you can use to find good candidates that are not remotely gender-related. Jurvetson claims that Fetcher's use of AI techniques allows them to bring minorities and women into their clients' hiring pipeline in a way other recruiting methods just can't.
Why are AI techniques so effective? We all know humans have biases. Take gender bias, for example. After a lifetime of exposure to mostly men in leadership roles, in boardrooms and in tech jobs, we develop a bias to prefer men in these positions. The big advantage of artificial intelligence is that it removes the humans and their biases from a large chunk of the recruiting process. The more you can remove human intervention, particularly at the stages of the recruiting process that are most prone to bias, the less that bias will be able to influence decision-making.

Although Fetcher allows clients to “thumbs up or thumbs down” potential candidates, Jurvetson thinks the most diverse candidate pools come from what they call their fully automated mode. In this mode, Fetcher hones in on client preferences by asking the client to review a handful of candidates. Then, Fetcher's systems take control, assembling a candidate pool, and contacting potential candidates directly. This way, a client's potential biases are removed from the process of choosing who will be contacted. Jurvetson describes, “When you pull yourself out of the process, that’s a really important step because when you’re not hand-selecting each candidate, you’re not bringing in these inherent biases that we all have.”

One reason that organizations have trouble increasing diversity is that the traditional methods of searching for candidates are often biased. The problem, Jurvetson explains, is that searches often use bias-ridden proxies for candidate potential. “Did they go to a top 20 university? Did they come from a top-tier company? Those tend to be pools of talent that might not be that diverse to start with. Using AI to be able to identify patterns, career progression is a great one, that correlate with success better than those old proxies is exciting and effective,” she explains.

According to Jurvetson, searches using these less-traditional proxies for success identified by artificial intelligence programs allow Fetcher to find candidates that might otherwise go overlooked. This allows organizations to cast a wider net than they might otherwise.
Research confirms there are huge advantages of casting a wide net when assembling a candidate pool if you want to increase diversity. One study found that if you only have one female candidate or underrepresented minority candidate in your pool of candidates, they have almost no chance of making it to the offer stage. That's because the lone woman or minority seems too different from the norm. However, if you add a second female or minority candidate, their odds of making it to the final round increase dramatically, and they have the same chance of receiving an offer as the other candidates.    
What keeps the Fetcher models from having the same issue as Amazon’s failed model? Jurvetson suggests that precautions need to be taken to minimize any unintended effects. At Fetcher, she says they keep their models simple, and they keep a trained human eye on the models and the outputs to be sure the recruiting criteria are gender-neutral and that the models are returning diverse candidate pools.
The Future Of AI In Recruiting
Recently, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and Reece Akhtar made an argument in Harvard Business Review for taking the use of AI techniques one step further and applying them to the interview process. The researchers report, “One of the major problems with the way we currently interview job candidates is that the process is largely unstructured, leaving the questioning to the whims and fancies of the interviewer. It shouldn’t take much convincing to see how this is not only inefficient, but how it also leads to biased decision-making due to interviewers expressing and seeking to confirm their own preferences. This is where video or digital interviews are likely to help. Digital interviews can remove these limitations almost entirely.”
While optimistic at about their potential, Jurvetson doesn't think AI job interviews will take over any time soon. ""I think if used thougthtfully, they can be really powerful and helpful for a lot of candidates, especially at early stages of the recruiting process, but I don’t have to tell you all the ways that can go wrong as well. You have to be smart about how and when you utilize these types of interviews, or racial or gender issues could come into play in a really sad way, and you could also negatively impact the candidate experience,"" she reports. One more limitation she added, “I’ve heard from candidates interviewing for more experienced roles that they sometimes find [automated interviews] insulting, because they can give the impression that the potential employer isn't willing to give you their time.”
For those looking to create a more diverse workforce, removing human decision-making from at least a part of the recruiting process seems like a no-brainer for reducing unconscious bias in hiring. Implemented correctly, AI tools can be a great way to search in an unbiased manner. And for those job seekers of the future, keep an open mind about a robot interviewer—hopefully it will be programmed to be less biased than a human manager.

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 15, 2019  /PRNewswire/ -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is moving full steam ahead in the U.S. workplace. By 2022, 60% of U.S. companies expect to be using AI or advanced automation to support efficiency in operations, staffing, budgeting or performance. Currently 24% of companies are using AI or advanced automation with an additional 36% planning to use it within three years — and half of those (18%) within the next year alone.

Recent opinion surveys sponsored by Genesys examine the attitudes of U.S. employers and employees about the rising adoption of AI in the workplace -- and the impact they think it will have on jobs.







These insights stem from an opinion survey sponsored by Genesys® (www.genesys.com), the global leader in omnichannel customer experience and contact center solutions. The survey examined the attitudes of American employers about the rising adoption of AI in the workplace. The results come on the heels of findings from a companion survey of employees announced by Genesys in July. The company surveyed employers and employees in six countries — the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Regardless of the age of their organization, the U.S. employers surveyed believe AI makes their companies more effective. Specifically, 32% of employers find it enables companies to achieve goals faster, more effectively and at lower cost. An additional 25% believe AI allows employees to become more productive and to feel more valuable. That said, even with a total positive response among 57% of employers, their enthusiasm for new workplace technology tools such as AI and bots is surpassed by that of their employees, 70% of whom voiced a positive attitude toward AI in the earlier Genesys survey of employees.
But AI is not for every workplace. Nearly a third (31%) of employer survey respondents do not feel AI or advanced automation is practical for their type of business. The exact same percentage wonder if AI is too complex to implement.How leadership feels about AILuckily for technology vendors, 40% of employers say there is no hesitation within their companies about the need to adopt new technologies such as AI, bots or augmented reality. Their leadership realizes it makes the business more efficient. There is some concern within 24% of employers about the cost of adopting new technologies, but only 13% of the survey pool, mostly employers with younger companies, are suspicious that the usefulness of AI is over-hyped.Currently, 47% of the employers surveyed think AI will have a positive impact on their company within the next year, with a mere 5% predicting a negative impact. Looking five years ahead to 2024, 62% of employers believe AI's positive impact on their companies will continue, while the negative has only increased by 2%, to 7%. AI is seen by 26% of employers as necessary for their companies to remain competitive in the future. In addition, U.S. employers recognize that AI is changing their employees' lives. In fact, almost two-thirds (64%) of the U.S. employers surveyed think their employees are excited to have better, AI-enabled technology tools because it assists them in their jobs.""The survey results serve as another proof point that businesses win big when they deploy automation and AI-assisted technologies – and so do employees,"" said Merijn te Booij, chief marketing officer for Genesys. ""Our research shows 61% of employers believe workers are more fulfilled when their workplace adopts AI because it allows them to take on more challenging tasks. When AI moves rote, mundane duties off employees' plates, they have more time to focus on what they're best at – work that's more interesting, diverse and requires more complex problem solving."" The future of jobs There's a definite disconnect between U.S. employers and their employees when discussing ""fear of the bot."" According to the Genesys research, employers believe employees are more concerned than they really are. Are employers seeing a specter that doesn't exist, or do employees have their heads in the sand?
42% of U.S. employers believe employees are scared of AI/bots because of potential job elimination. Due to the perceived risk to jobs, 8% of employers say they would like to avoid adoption of AI/bots in their companies. 
67% of U.S. employee respondents in an earlier Genesys survey said they are not afraid that AI/bots would eliminate their jobs within the next 10 years while just 19% are fearful. 
50% of the U.S. employers surveyed say the adoption of AI will not cause them to reduce their workforce. 
30% of the U.S. employers surveyed anticipate workforce cuts due to AI adoption but 53% don't expect major staffing changes. 
36% of U.S. employers surveyed see a positive impact of AI on their employees in the next year with the number jumping to 53% when questioned about five years in the future. 
32% of U.S. employees surveyed anticipate a positive impact from AI on their jobs in five years.
Methodology and Demographics of SurveysGenesys commissioned third-party research consultancy Vitreous World to conduct online Employee and Employer surveys in six countries. 303 adults completed the U.S. Employer survey in May. The survey pool was divided into Millennials (43%), Generation X (41%), and Baby Boomers (17%), with 56% women and 44% men. The margin of error is plus/minus 3%.For a copy of the full survey data, North American press and analysts should contact the U.S.-based Genesys media relations team at genesys@sterlingpr.com.About GenesysGenesys® powers more than 25 billion of the world's best customer experiences each year.

Instead, the company, which has attracted nearly $30 million in funding from a SoftBank-owned firm and others, is reportedly relying mostly on human engineers, while using hype around AI to attract customers and investment that will last it until it can actually get its automation platform off the ground. The company claims its AI tools are “human-assisted,” and that it provides a service that will help a customer make more than 80 percent of a mobile app from scratch in about an hour, according to claims Engineer.ai founder Sachin Dev Duggal, who also says his other title is “Chief Wizard,” made onstage at a conference last year. However, the WSJ reports that Engineer.ai does not use AI to assemble the code, and instead uses human engineers in India and elsewhere to put together the app. The company was sued earlier this year by its chief business officer, Robert Holdheim, who claims the company is exaggerating its AI abilities to get the funding it needed to actually work on the technology. According to Holdheim, Duggal “was telling investors that Engineer.ai was 80% done with developing a product that, in truth, he had barely even begun to develop.” Engineer.ai uses mostly conventional software and human engineers to make appsWhen pressed on how the company actually employs machine learning and other AI training techniques, the company told the WSJ it uses natural language processing to estimate pricing and timelines of requested features, and that it relies on a “decision tree” to assign tasks to engineers. Neither of those really qualify as the type of modern AI that powers cutting-edge machine translation or image recognition, and it does not appear that any kind of AI agent or software of any kind is actually compiling code. Engineer.ai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Engineer.ai is not alone in allegedly talking up its AI capabilities. Funding for AI startups is growing fast, reaching $31 billion last year, according to PitchBook, and companies like Japanese conglomerate SoftBank have pledged to invest hundreds of billions in AI in the coming years. The number of companies which include the .ai top-level domain from the British territory Anguilla has doubled in the last few years, the WSJ reports. In other words, saying your company is building a traditional technology, like an app development platform, but tossing in AI is an easy way to get funding and attention in a saturated startup landscape increasingly squeezed by the efforts of giants like Facebook, Google, Uber, and others. According to the UK investment firm MMC Ventures, startups with some type of AI component can attract as much as 50 percent more funding than other software companies, and the firm tells the WSJ that it suspects 40 percent or even more of those companies don’t use any form of real AI at all. Part of the issue is that AI can feel easy to get off the ground in a testing or preliminary format, but that it’s much harder to actually deploy at scale. Additionally, gaining the necessary training data to build capable AI agents can be extremely costly and time-consuming; companies like Facebook and Google have gigantic research organizations paying engineers top salaries for the purpose of developing better AI training techniques that may one day be used to build commercial products. The revelations around Engineer.ai also reveal an uncomfortable truth about a lot of modern AI: it barely exists. Much like the moderation efforts of large-scale tech platforms like Facebook and YouTube — which use some AI, but also mostly armies of contractors overseas and domestically to review harmful and violent content for removal — a lot of AI technologies require people to guide them.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming smarter every day, beating world champions in games like Go, identifying tumours in medical scans better than human radiologists, and increasing the efficiency of electricity-hungry data centres. Some economists are comparing the transformative potential of AI with other “general purpose technologies” such as the steam engine, electricity or the transistor.
But current AI systems are far from perfect. They tend to reflect the biases of the data used to train them and to break down when they face unexpected situations. They can be gamed, as we have seen with the controversies surrounding misinformation on social media, violent content posted on YouTube, or the famous case of Tay, the Microsoft chatbot, which was manipulated into making racist and sexist statements within hours. 
So do we really want to turn these bias-prone, brittle technologies into the foundation stones of tomorrow’s economy?
Minimising risk
One way to minimise AI risks is to increase the diversity of the teams involved in their development. As research on collective decision-making and creativity suggests, groups that are more cognitively diverse tend to make better decisions. Unfortunately, this is a far cry from the situation in the community currently developing AI systems. And a lack of gender diversity is one important (although not the only) dimension of this. 
A review published by the AI Now Institute earlier this year, showed that less than 20% of the researchers applying to prestigious AI conferences are women, and that only a quarter of undergraduates studying AI at Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley are female.

The authors argued that this lack of gender diversity results in AI failures that uniquely affect women, such as an Amazon recruitment system that was shown to discriminate against job applicants with female names. 
Our recent report, Gender Diversity in AI research, involved a “big data” analysis of 1.5m papers in arXiv, a pre-prints website widely used by the AI community to disseminate its work.
We analysed the text of abstracts to determine which apply AI techniques, inferred the gender of the authors from their names and studied the levels of gender diversity in AI and its evolution over time. We also compared the situation in different research fields and countries, and differences in language between papers with female co-authors and all-male papers.
Our analysis confirms the idea that there is a gender diversity crisis in AI research. Only 13.8% of AI authors in arXiv are women and, in relative terms, the proportion of AI papers co-authored by at least one woman has not improved since the 1990s.
There are significant differences between countries and research fields. We found a stronger representation of women in AI research in the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark, and a lower representation in Japan and Singapore. We also found that women working in physics, education, biology and social aspects of computing are more likely to publish work on AI compared with those working in computer science or mathematics.
In addition to measuring gender diversity in the AI research workforce, we also explored semantic differences between research papers with and without female participation. We tested the hypothesis that research teams with more gender diversity tend to increase the variety of issues and topics that are considered in AI research, potentially making their outputs more inclusive. 
To do this, we measured the “semantic signature” of each paper using a machine learning technique called word embeddings, and compared these signatures between papers with at least one female author and papers without any women authors.
This analysis, which focuses on the Machine Learning and Social Aspects of Computing field in the UK, showed significant differences between the groups. In particular, we found that papers with at least one female co-author tend to be more applied and socially aware, with terms such as “fairness”, “human mobility”, “mental”, “health”, “gender” and “personality” playing a key role. The difference between the two groups is consistent with the idea that cognitive diversity has an impact on the research produced, and suggests that it leads to increased engagement with social issues. 
How to fix it
So what explains this persistent gender gap in AI research, and what can we do about it? 
Research shows that the lack of gender diversity in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is not caused by a single factor: gender stereotypes and discrimination, a lack of role models and mentors, insufficient attention to work-life balance, and “toxic” work environments in the technology industry come together to create a perfect storm against gender inclusion.

There is no easy fix to close the gender gap in AI research. System-wide changes aimed at creating safe and inclusive spaces that support and promote researchers from underrepresented groups, a shift in attitudes and cultures in research and industry, and better communication of the transformative potential of AI in many areas could all play a part.
Policy interventions, such as the £13.5m investment from government to boost diversity in AI roles through new conversion degree courses, will go some way towards improving the situation, but broader scale interventions are needed to create better links between arts, humanities and AI, changing the image of who can work in AI.
While there is no single reason why girls disproportionately stop taking STEM subjects as they progress through education, there is evidence that factors including pervasive stereotypes around gender and a teaching environment that impacts the confidence of girls more than boys play a part in the problem. We must also showcase those role models who are using AI to make a positive difference.
One tangible intervention looking to tackle these issues is the Longitude Explorer Prize, which encourages secondary school students to use AI to solve social challenges and work with role models in AI. We want young people, particularly girls, to realise AI’s potential for good and their role in driving change.
By building skills and confidence in young women, we can change the ratio of people who study and work in AI – and help to address AI’s potential biases.

Robots and the workforce: understanding the research
As artificial intelligence (AI) technology develops at breakneck speed, some worry that robots may take away jobs. A new research primer from the Journal of Organization Design looks at the current and future research landscape.

Erica Gordon-Mallin 12 Aug 2019

Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technology has been advancing rapidly over the past several years. For example, the AI Index reports that the number of papers, courses, and patents related to AI has grown dramatically over the past five years, and a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that venture capital investment in AI startups has increased almost tenfold and the annual number of purchases of robots has tripled over the past decade.
In all likelihood, the advances in AI and robotics technology will help stimulate economic growth in many countries. This is welcome news as 36 of 37 advanced economies had slower productivity growth during 2006–2016 compared to 1996–2006. Across these economies, growth has slowed from a 2.7% average growth rate in the earlier decade to a 1.0% average annual growth rate.
New technologies typically create occupations even as they destroy existing ones.
However, some worry that this technology-enabled growth will come at a substantial cost. For example, some research has warned that AI threatens 15–30% or even 50% of jobs. Despite these concerns, such visions of the future are likely far-fetched, in part because new technologies typically create occupations even as they destroy existing ones—for example, “Web Developer” is an entire occupational category tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that didn’t exist a few decades ago—and in part because new technologies typically augment most jobs rather than directly leading to the creation or destruction of entire occupations.
In order to stimulate research on the effect of AI and robotics on organizations, we recently published a research primer on artificial intelligence and robotics in the Journal of Organization Design that describes the current state of the field. We draw on a wide body of literature on previous innovations, as well as the nascent literature on AI and robotics technologies themselves, to outline the various ways in which artificial intelligence and robotics may alter the ways in which we work and how organizations can structure themselves to best take advantage of these new technologies. We hope this primer can serve as a resource for scholars as we continue to investigate how these novel technologies affect labor and firms.
In an effort to understand where AI may substitute for or complement jobs, we devise a new methodology that links advances in AI to occupational abilities, and use this to create an AI occupation impact (AIOI) score for each occupation from 2010 to 2015. We utilize these AIOI scores to study the link between AI and employment and wage growth. We provide broad evidence that, on average, occupations impacted by AI are correlated with a modest growth in wages: an increase of one standard deviation in AI impact is associated with a 0.41% increase in wage growth. However, we find no evidence that AI and employment are correlated.
We also study the link between AI and the presence of complementary software skills. To do this, we use data from Burning Glass Technologies on software skill requirements in job listings and classify occupations into terciles depending on the proportion of software skills needed in a job.
Our findings suggest that the complementary effects of AI, at least as it relates to wage growth, are largely driven by occupations involving a high level of software skills. While there is no statistically significant relationship between the impact of AI and wage growth for occupations with low- or medium-software-prevalence occupations, there is a positive and significant effect for high-software-prevalence occupations. An increase of one standard deviation in the occupation impact score is associated with a 0.61% increase in wage growth for high-software-prevalence occupations (compared to 0.41% for all occupations).
Overall, our findings suggest that the effects of AI on labor are not uniform across occupations, and that access to complementary skills and technologies may play an important role in determining the impact of AI on occupations.
More broadly, and as highlighted in our article, we believe there are many fruitful avenues for scholars to study how these new technologies affect labor and firms. Other avenues include investigations of differences in adoption across organizational forms (e.g., for-profit vs not-for-profit vs government-owned firms), effects of these new technologies on competition between firms, effects of these technologies on inequality within an occupation, firm, or region, and effects of these technologies on the nature of skills required for an occupation.

Services Babylon Offers

Babylon's engineers, doctors, and scientists developed an AI system that can receive data about the symptoms someone is suffering from, compare the information to a database of known conditions and illnesses to find possible matches, and then identify a course of action and related risk factors. People can use the ""Ask Babylon"" feature to inquire about their medical concerns to get an initial understanding of what they might be dealing with, but this service is not intended to replace the expertise of a doctor or be used in a medical emergency.

In pursuit of its mission, Babylon offers a ""talk to a doctor"" service via its app, GP at Hand that provides 24/7 access to healthcare professionals through video or audio conferencing. The app can be downloaded from Google Play or the App Store. At the consultation, doctors can give medical advice, answer questions, discuss treatment, and can order prescriptions that can be delivered to a patient's door. All of the patient's clinical records are stored in a secure environment, and their health history can be accessed and referenced when it's needed. If a patient needs to revisit their appointment, they can review the medical notes and replay a recording of the appointment at any time.

PROMOTED
Another feature that is available on the app is Healthcheck. Built with the support of doctors, scientists and disease experts, this AI tool can take answers from questions about family history and a person's lifestyle and compare it to the medical database to then create a health report and insights to help someone stay healthy.
GP at Hand App's Popularity and Growing Pains
Even Matt Hancock, theUK health secretary, champions the GP at Hand app and more than 51,000 people across London have downloaded it. The app operates through the Hammersmith and Fulham clinical commissioning group, a National Health Service (NHS) body for the area. In fact, the app hasten times more patients registered than the practice it took over from. Since the clinical commissioning group (CCG) is required to pay for the healthcare of all the patients registered on the app—even if they do not live in Hammersmith and Fulham—the popularity of the app has pushed up the costs for the CCG. In addition, the app has been criticized for attracting younger users, leaving traditional practices shouldering the burden of higher costs for caring for an aging population. The GP at Hand app and artificial intelligence technology is expected to ultimately lower overall costs for NHS; however, the current situation of how to handle the app's popularity straining one CCG and to determine how to fit the app into the NHS's financial structure still need to be resolved.
In other examples, it's clear that the GP at Hand app and the AI used to power its recommendations needs to continue to train and get better. Some industry watchdogs have pointed out that the chatbot doctor onGP at Hand misadvised action in a potentially life-threatening situation that required immediate medical attention. More rigorous and independent testing is still necessary before AI can be completely trusted with life or death advice.

The start-up claims that in its own tests, the AI system was spot on80 percent of the time and that the tool was never designed to completely replace the advice of a real doctor, but actually to reduce waiting times and to help doctors make more accurate decisions. The world is facing an extreme shortage of doctors and medical professionals, and tech such as what Babylon offers is one way to help improve the healthcare of millions of people.According to NHS England, ""Each safety case [of Babylon] meets the standards required by NHS and has been completed using a robust assessment methodology to a high standard.""
While it might not be a perfect system, Babylon shows that artificial intelligence has progressed enough to work alongside healthcare professionals and can be a beneficial tool. But, patients still need to remain to be their own fierce healthcare advocates. If the advice received from artificial intelligence doesn't seem to hit the mark, it's good advice to request a second opinion—from a human.

Artificial intelligence, robotics, and the workforce of the future
connor.pearce@primecreative.com.auAugust 13, 2019, 9:00 amAugust 14, 2019 

       




The spread of advanced automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence is transforming the way manufacturers work. Manufacturers’ Monthly explores how these development are impacting the workforce.




In the manufacturing sector, technological change and transformations in production processes are pointing towards changes in business models. In particular, developments in advanced automation, robotics artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, sensor technology, data analytics, and 3D printing are altering the way in which operations are carried out. That there will be impacts upon the makeup of the workforce is obvious; but the precise nature of the long-term changes to work in the manufacturing sector is debated.
The factors leading to the intensification of industrial automation in recent years, including the growth of AI, are expansions in the capacity for data storage and advances in data analytics, computational power and internet connectivity. Along with these, improvements in transferring digital instructions to the physical world, such as robotics and 3D printing are, according to some experts, on the precipice of transforming the world of work.
According a recent report by Oxford Economics, “How Robots Change the World”, while the ever- faster adoption of robots will lead to greater productivity and economic growth, and create jobs in hitherto non-existent roles and industries, business models across a variety of sectors will be disrupted, with tens of millions of jobs lost as human workers are displaced by machines.


“The number of robots in use worldwide multiplied three-fold over the past two decades, to 2.25 million,” said Oxford Economics’ CEO and chief economist Adrian Cooper. “Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030, with 14 million in China alone. The implications are immense, and the emerging challenges for governments and policymakers are equally daunting their scale.”
In the manufacturing sector alone, the report states, worldwide job losses are set to reach 20 million.


This figure is 8.5 per cent of the global manufacturing workforce. The jobs most at risk are those in low-skill areas and those with lower productivity. According to economic modelling by Oxford Economics, recent improvements in New South Wales’ manufacturing productivity mean that the impact of future robot densification in the state will be more or less muted. South Australia, on the other hand, is much more vulnerable. The state is Australia’s most intensive in terms of manufacturing, but it also has low levels of manufacturing productivity.
Manufacturing is already an intensely automated sector, currently accounting for around 86 per cent of the total global operational stock of robots according to the International Federation of Robotics. The Oxford Economics report suggests that there are three main drivers behind the adoption of robotics in manufacturing: price, innovative applications, and consumer demand. The continued exponential growth in the processing power


of microchips and the increased capacity of networks mean that the per-unit cost of many technological components has been dropping. And, with developments in AI, robots and machines are making more informed decisions from the data that is, in ever greater volumes, gathered and stored across industrial sectors and systems. It is these developments, too, that are helping drive the adoption of robotics and automation across a broader swathe of manufacturing sectors.
In recent years, collaborative robots, or cobots, enabled by AI and cloud technologies, have begun to emerge, bridging the divide between manual assembly performed by skilled human workers and automated production. This has the potential to deeply transform the way work is performed in the manufacturing sector. Speaking earlier this year at AUSPACK 2019 in Melbourne, Universal Robots’ Peter Hern made the case that collaborative robots were, in fact, enabling production to be focussed back towards the human workforce. “When we talk about robots, a lot of people ask, ‘Are we losing our jobs to robots?’ Absolutely not. In fact, what we find is that the human robot collaboration is actually 85 per cent more productive that humans or robots alone,” he said. “It enables companies to reposition their staff, their workers, from dull, dangerous, and mundane roles into more productive roles and higher value roles.”








The Oxford Economics report itself states that it would be “simplistic” to characterise robotisation and the adoption of advanced automation as merely a “destroyer” of jobs. It will instead lead to a “robotics dividend”, characterised by lower prices for manufactures, higher real incomes, and higher tax revenues. A one per cent increase in the stock of robots per worker in the manufacturing sector leads to a 0.1 per cent growth in output per worker.
“This confirms our hypothesis,” the report’s authors state. “[By] displacing automatable jobs in manufacturing, robots free up many workers to contribute productively elsewhere in the economy, as they meet the demands generated by lower prices for manufactured goods.”
A July talk at Deloitte Australia in Sydney on the future of the workforce saw the consulting company’s chief data scientist Gavin Whyte attempting to calm fears, propelled by the media, that the adoption of AI would lead to the disappearance of jobs. “Yes, AI will impact business, permeate industry and affect your roles, but in a good manner,” Whyte said.
According to Whyte, as AI continues to permeate the economy, it will transform the way work is carried out – not by displacing the workforce, but by freeing workers from mundane tasks and activities to carry out higher-order tasks.
Drawing attention to the way the internet has transformed economic activity since 1995, Whyte said that as the adoption of computers and the internet intensified, the cost of search and of digital transfers dropped dramatically. Similarly, as the processing power of computers expands, the cost of what Whyte calls “arithmetic” – algorithmic processing – drops. “And what happens when the cost of an item drops? We use more of it. The cost of search has dropped drastically, so we use more of it – we use Google search for so many of our activities today – and the cost of arithmetic has dropped tremendously, so we use more of it in areas like demand forecasting, and in using computers to record and transfer ever-larger volumes of data.”


Moving more directly on to the topic of AI, Whyte said that the AI the cost of prediction had dropped dramatically in recent years. “It has plummeted to a point where prediction is now cheaper, quicker, faster. And, when something becomes cheaper – like the internet, like arithmetic – we start using more of it for a whole range of purposes,” he said. Prediction is essentially the use of information to generate information that you don’t currently have. If you start applying AI to prediction problems, you get a better outcome with the resulting information, and we can start utilising the power of prediction in areas that have, historically, not been problems of prediction at all.”




And, according to Whyte, that means AI is making our jobs, and our lives, more convenient. “We require convenience. And convenience comes at a cost.” If we use AI to make life and work more convenient, said Whyte, it will impact some roles; but as with every other industrial revolution, where more advanced techniques boosted productivity and opened up new roles in production, the development of AI will open up the potential for new roles along with the means of helping and improving workers in their existing roles.
“The idea pushed in the media today is that ‘AI is going to come and automate your roles and thousands are going to lose their jobs’. But if you really look into the heart of the matter, this is not the case,” he said.
According to Whyte, as the cost of machine prediction drops, enabling more and greater volumes of data to be processed, it also enables better further, better human judgement. “A machine makes predictions. But who is going to use those predictions? Humans. We need to make judgements from them,” he said. Whyte argued that the speed, quality, volume, soundness and accuracy of human judgement would increase as machine prediction is applied to more spheres of work, making AI a complement to human workplace roles. “AI is not going to replace you – AI is going to improve your judgement and improve outcomes.”



Getting on board with the AI revolution, however, will require training that prepares the workforce for jobs of the future. In September last year, the Australian Industry (Ai) Group released a report on its survey of 300 businesses, 75 per cent of which reported skills shortages. Among the most serious gaps were in skills utilising data, automation and AI.
Federal industry, science and technology minister Karen Andrews recently attended G20 meetings in Japan regarding the spread and adoption of AI. Speaking about the meetings, Andrews said that AI was increasingly seen as the “petroleum of the twenty-first century”, with all member countries regarding AI as a critical issue for the future.








“I think it’s fair to say that the impact of AI will make a significant difference to the way we work and the way we live, and it’s important that we make sure that we get the policy settings right,” Andrews said.
The adoption and development of machine learning and AI by industry is being encouraged via the federal government’s Taking Local Businesses Global initiative, $29.9 million will support Australian businesses and workers to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This includes co-funding for Cooperative Research Centre grants for industry-led research.
Andrews said that is important that workers’ fears and concerns that AI adoption will lead to a reduction in job opportunities, or even make them redundant, be taken into account
in the development of policy, which should focus on training people to help them transition to other jobs.


In a submission to the federal government’s Senate Select Committee on the Future of Work and Workers last year, University of Adelaide researchers indicated that over the period of increasing automation, unemployment has not been correlated with the increase, while worker productivity, their corresponding income and the broader gross domestic product has risen sharply over the same period.
“While automation reduces the need for some occupations, it creates the need for new ones, which are often higher paid,” the submission states. “The car industry uses the largest number of industrial robots in the world. But there was little correlation between automation and the change in labour share in the car industry between 2004 and 2014.”
While AI has the potential to increase Australia’s productivity, the submission indicated that, currently, two thirds of Australian organisations are having difficulties in finding suitable staff to lead AI technology integration and 75 per cent of IT decision makers feel that the executive team in their organisation needs formal training on the implications of AI technologies.


The researchers said that Australia is peculiarly well placed to capitalise on the current situation, but, also, that it needs to do so quickly, as other countries are investing heavily in these areas.
“As AI-driven automation lowers the cost of production, Australia could once again become competitive in manufacturing goods that are currently produced cheaply elsewhere because of low wages in other countries,” the submission states. “But we will need to encourage investment in new-generation automation to take advantage of this new trade opportunity, and ensure we have the education, training and research in place to capitalise.”
CSIRO’s data innovation group Data61 is currently leading the development of an AI roadmap and ethics framework on behalf of the federal government.
Chief executive of CSIRO, Dr Larry Marshall, in a presentation last year at the AFR Innovation Summit, said that AI was going to transform the future of work, and that staying ahead in AI investment, research and training would ensure Australia stays at the forefront of job creation in new industries, predicting and preparing for them before they emerge.


“To ensure a long and prosperous future for Australian industries, we need to ensure Australia grows its pipeline of AI-literacy – which is really STEM literacy,” Marshall said.
“I’ve heard people say that coding is all kids will need to know in the future, but I disagree. What is most important is to instil our children with the ability to learn how to learn. That is the beauty of science. It teaches you how to tackle problems and gives you a toolkit to approach any problem.
“The most important thing to remember, in the face of all of the hype, is that for machine learning technology to work well, it needs to ‘learn’, and it is our role to help give this technology real intelligence.”

I found it interesting as a case study of an AI project with broad implications for business people and machine learning professionals. After all, everyone has either hired or been hired at least once. We all have a stake in the recruiting game. Sadly, most reporting was sensationalist trash, and the news cycle quickly moved on.It seems nobody tried to answer the question of how a company of the caliber of Amazon — with seemingly infinite resources — could stumble so badly. Is AI technology inherently evil? Are all software engineers and data scientists sexist brutes? Is the technology too immature for complex business problems? Or is there something specific about AI projects that makes them difficult — even for the best companies?Trending AI Articles:1. 100 days to Deep Learning: Part 2 the 100 days2.
