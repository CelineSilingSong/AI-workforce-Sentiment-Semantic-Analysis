Technology leaders such as Microsoft, IBM, Huawei and Google have entire sections of their business focused on the topic and dedicate resources to build AI solutions for good and to support developers who do. In the fight to solve extraordinarily difficult challenges, humans can use all the help we can get. Here are 8 powerful examples of artificial intelligence for good as it is applied to some of the toughest challenges facing society today.
8 Powerful Examples Of AI For GoodAdobe Stock

Accessibility

There are more than 1 billion people living with a disability around the world. Artificial intelligence can be used to amplify these people’s abilities to improve their accessibility. It can facilitate employment, improve daily life and help people living with disabilities communicate. From opening up the world of books to deaf children to narrating what it “sees” to those with visual impairments, apps and tools powered by artificial intelligence are improving accessibility.

Climate Change, Conservation and the Environment

One of the most perplexing and pressing issues the planet faces today is climate change. Artificial intelligence innovators are developing ways for the technology to be applied to help improve the climate change issue from simulations to monitoring, measuring and resource management. In addition, AI has been deployed in conservation biology. AI tools make wildlife monitoring more accurate and efficient, and data analysis streamlined. Drones are also used to monitor wildlife populations and count animals as well as catch poachers in the act.
PROMOTED
World Hunger
In order to feed the world’s population by 2050, the United Nations estimates we will need to increase the world’s food production by 70%. This gargantuan task seems more plausible with the support of artificial intelligence. In addition to developing hearty seeds, artificial intelligence can be used to automate tedious tasks, detect disease for earlier interventions, apply herbicide precisely and generally maximize crop production.
Human Rights
Artificial intelligence makes the task of identifying human rights violations such as human trafficking quicker and more comprehensive. Using face recognition technology powered by artificial intelligence photos can be analyzed to find missing people and images can be reviewed to spot other human rights violations.

Fight Fake News
Even though artificial intelligence generates a lot of disinformation campaigns and fake news content, it can also be used to battle it. Artificial intelligence can be used to verify the truth of articles. Since the amount of content generated daily is too much for humans to effectively monitor, artificial intelligence offers a solution that makes identifying fake news possible. Even though the algorithms are only as good as the input, they receive to learn from, using AI in the fight over fake news is a step in the right direction.

Education
As the pressure continues to mount for educators to customize learning for each student and hit performance benchmarks, artificial intelligence supplies valuable tools that can support learning in and out of the classroom. On a systemic level, artificial intelligence can help process educational statistics to enable decision-making for policy-makers and educational leaders.

Healthcare
Artificial intelligence is already revolutionizing healthcare. It is aiding in diagnoses and detecting illness and disease prior to the involvement of medical professionals as well as assist healthcare staff once patients are under their care. Healthcare systems create volumes of data that would go unused without the support of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Not only does artificial intelligence get used to develop innovative drug therapies and customized medicine, but robots are also increasingly being used to support surgeries.
Resilience
Not only does artificial intelligence play a critical role in detecting, monitoring and learning about natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, but it’s also leveraged for learning to make our society more resilient when faced with catastrophe. Researchers are currently using artificial intelligence to find solutions to make Los Angeles’ plumbing infrastructure less susceptible to damage from earthquakes. In this case and other applications, AI can run many scenarios and computer models to determine the best solutions for vexing issues.
There’s no shortage of challenges that need to be solved today to enable a better tomorrow for our planet, cultures and society. When humans collaborate with artificial intelligence, solutions that otherwise wouldn’t have been thought of can be developed and vetted at a pace that wouldn’t be possible if only humans were tasked with the assignment. AI provides innovative ways of solving extremely challenging problems while at the same time providing ways of significantly improving life.

Artificial Intelligence Helps Providers Choose Depression Therapies


An artificial intelligence algorithm can accurately predict whether an antidepressant will work based on brain activity.

Artificial intelligence tools may be able to help providers objectively diagnose and prescribe depression treatments based on analyses of brain activity, according to a study published in Nature Biotechnology.







The findings are part of a national trial initiated by UT Southwestern in 2011, which seeks to better understand mood disorders. Several studies from the trial demonstrate how advanced technologies, including AI, brain imaging, and blood tests, could help doctors choose appropriate depression therapies.
""These studies have been a bigger success than anyone on our team could have imagined,"" said Madhukar Trivedi, MD, a UT Southwestern psychiatrist who oversaw the multi-site trial involving Stanford, Harvard and other institutions. ""We provided abundant data to show we can move past the guessing game of choosing depression treatments and alter the mindset of how the disease should be diagnosed and treated.""
Researchers noted that in the US, antidepressant use has increased nearly 65 percent over a decade and a half. The increased use of this medication makes it more crucial to further understand the underpinnings of depression and ensure patients are prescribed the appropriate treatment.
""It can be devastating for a patient when an antidepressant doesn't work,"" Trivedi said. ""Our research is showing that they no longer have to endure the painful process of trial and error.""
The team evaluated more than 300 participants with depression who were randomly chosen to receive either a placebo or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), the most common class of antidepressant. Researchers used an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure electrical activity in the participants’ cortex before starting treatment.
The group then developed a machine learning algorithm to analyze and use EEG data to predict which patients would benefit from the medication within two months. The algorithm was able to accurately predict outcomes. Additionally, further research indicated that patients who weren’t likely to respond to antidepressants were likely to improve with other interventions, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation.
The researchers derived study data from the 2011 trial initiated by UT Southwestern, called the EMBARC trial. EMBARC aims to develop biology-based, objective strategies to treat mood disorders. The trial evaluates participants with major depressive disorder through DNA, blood, and other tests, and seeks to address the fact that most patients don’t adequately respond to their first antidepressant.
""We went into this thinking, 'Wouldn't it be better to identify at the beginning of treatment which treatments would be best for which patients?'"" Trivedi said.
Previous EMBARC studies identified various predictive tests, including the use of MRI to examine brain activity both in a resting state and during the processing of emotions. EEG will likely be the most commonly used tool, because it is more effective and less expensive. However, a blood test or MRI may be needed for some patients if the depression manifests itself in a different way.
""There are many signatures of depression in the body,"" Trivedi said. ""Having all these tests available will improve the chances of choosing the right treatment the first time.""
Researchers’ next steps involve developing an AI interface that can be widely integrated with EEGs across the country, as well as seeking approval from the FDA. With this new method, providers could significantly improve depression therapies.
“This study takes previous research, showing that we can predict who benefits from an antidepressant, and actually brings it to the point of practical utility,” said Amit Etkin, MD, PhD, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who worked with Trivedi to develop the algorithm.

But recent developments in AI are pushing the gaming field even further, as researchers develop algorithms that can help fans make exciting new titles on their own.The history of AI and that of gaming are inexorably intertwined. Early AI researchers saw games like chess as markers of intelligence, and thus perfect testing grounds for their work. “One of the very earliest things that people tried to do with this sort of burgeoning field was get it to play chess and get to play chess well, and, obviously, that eventually happened with Deep Blue,” says Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. Contemporary AI researchers have focused on more complex games, particularly the ancient Chinese game of Go.As AI research moved into the subfield of machine learning — in which algorithms are “taught” how to learn on their own — video games emerged as a similarly suitable testbed. “A game is fully observable in a way that much of the real world isn’t,” says Guzdial. “Most importantly, it has rewards. It has a notion of ‘you are doing well’ or ‘you are doing badly.’ Building up those kinds of functions in life is extremely complicated.” In Super Mario Brothers, for instance, a player knows they’re doing poorly when they take damage or lose a life. They know they’re doing well when they finish a level, defeat enemies, or earn coins. That kind of feedback is key for training machine learning algorithms.Of course, simply playing a game is one thing. What about creating them, the way some musicians are using AI to generate entirely new forms of their art? Guzdial and his team are working on exactly that. They’re developing software that, working alongside human partners, creates new video games out of whole cloth.To train an AI to build its own Super Mario Bros.-style platforming games, for instance, Guzdial and his team had the software “watch” hours of videos showing people playing that game, as well as similar titles, like Mega Man and Kirby’s Adventure. After binge-watching gaming videos on YouTube and elsewhere, their software guesses at the rules of the games, then it checks its guesses by watching the videos once more. With the rules of a game sorted out, Guzdial’s algorithms follow a similar procedure to create new levels in which the rules are put to work.“Once we’ve learned both of these bits, we put them into this common representation — basically squash these two sets of knowledge together into this big representation — we call it a game graph,” Guzdial says. “And you can think of this as this dense tangled web of information about a game. But importantly, it has all the information you need to basically reproduce the game.” Finally, to generate its own games, the team’s software looks at all the information in this “game graph.” Then it begins to design, combine, and reproduce what it saw. In one example, Guzdial says the AI took the platforming styles of Mega Man and Super Mario Bros. and combined them to create something new. “Now imagine that happening over and over and over again for every piece of level design for every piece of game rule logic,” he says. That could result in entirely new AI-generated games — experiences similar to what gamers know and love, but novel enough to be notably different. Because Guzdial’s work is academic in nature, it’s protected under fair use, and thus isn’t likely to run afoul of copyright laws.Guzdial says his goal isn’t to replace game creators. Instead, he’s hopeful his work can reduce the barrier of entry around game creation. “The plan was always to use this to help people make games,” he says. Using a tool like his, he says, a gamer could start building their own levels without learning how to write code. Other level-building tools, like Nintendo’s Super Mario Maker, are already big hits with fans. “It allows the user to basically define the set of rules that the AI has learned without having to explicitly know anything about coding,” he says.Up next for Guzdial is a tool that could let gamers bored of their current selection to instantly build an entirely new game simply by deciding how they want their game to look and feel. The AI could then take that input and design a game, complete with rules and levels. All the software would need, he says, are two frames worth of data, defined by the player. “And as soon as we have more than one frame, the AI system learns rules that would explain the difference between the two frames,” he says. The AI makes predictions, the creator gives feedback, and the AI makes adjustments. At the end of this back and forth, Guzdial says, a gamer would have something brand new to enjoy. “We’re putting some finishing touches on the interface and then we’re going to run a human subject study to find out if we’re on the right track,” he says.A practical consumer version of that technology is still likely years away. The industry may be slow to adopt it, too, nervous about software outmoding human game designers. Guzdial thinks that independent developers will likely be the trailblazers who make the first compelling games using tools like his. He pointed to Lab Assistant, a machine learning-based game in which a player has to teach language to a mysterious ooze in order to solve puzzles. “I can totally imagine that what we get are some passionate indie [developers] messing around with these technologies and making weird, cool, interesting little experiences,” he says. “But I don’t think they’re going to impact triple-A game development anytime soon.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DALLAS – Feb. 10, 2020 – Artificial intelligence may soon play a critical role in choosing which depression therapy is best for patients.
A national trial initiated by UT Southwestern in 2011 to better understand mood disorders has produced what scientists are calling the project's flagship finding: a computer that can accurately predict whether an antidepressant will work based on a patient's brain activity.
The new research is the latest among several studies from the trial that cumulatively show how high-tech strategies can help doctors objectively diagnose and prescribe depression treatments. Although implementing these approaches will take time, researchers predict tools such as AI, brain imaging, and blood tests will revolutionize the field of psychiatry in the coming years.

What did researchers do in this study?
""These studies have been a bigger success than anyone on our team could have imagined,"" says Madhukar Trivedi, M.D., a UT Southwestern psychiatrist who oversaw the multi-site trial involving Stanford, Harvard and other institutions. ""We provided abundant data to show we can move past the guessing game of choosing depression treatments and alter the mindset of how the disease should be diagnosed and treated.""
EEG-based predictions
The study published in Nature Biotechnology included more than 300 participants with depression who were randomly chosen to receive either a placebo or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), the most common class of antidepressant. Researchers used an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to measure electrical activity in the participants' cortex before they began treatment. The team then developed a machine-learning algorithm to analyze and use the EEG data to predict which patients would benefit from the medication within two months.
Not only did the AI accurately predict outcomes, further research suggested that patients who were doubtful to respond to an antidepressant were likely to improve with other interventions such as psychotherapy or brain stimulation.
The findings were validated in three additional patient groups.

Why is this study important to patients?
“This study takes previous research, showing that we can predict who benefits from an antidepressant, and actually brings it to the point of practical utility,” says Amit Etkin, M.D., Ph.D., a Stanford University psychiatry professor who worked with Trivedi to develop the algorithm.
Among the next steps, researchers say, is developing an AI interface that can be widely integrated with EEGs across the country, as well as seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Signatures of depression
Data from the study derive from the 16-week EMBARC trial, which Trivedi initiated at four U.S. sites to establish biology-based, objective strategies to remedy mood disorders.
The project evaluated patients with major depressive disorder through brain imaging and various DNA, blood, and other tests. His goal was to address a troubling finding from another study he led (STAR*D) that found up to two-thirds of patients do not adequately respond to their first antidepressant.
""We went into this thinking, 'Wouldn't it be better to identify at the beginning of treatment which treatments would be best for which patients?'"" Trivedi explains.
Previous EMBARC studies identified various predictive tests, including the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine brain activity in both a resting state and during the processing of emotions. EEG will likely be the most commonly used tool, Trivedi says, because it's less expensive and – in most cases – will be equally or more effective.
However, a blood test or MRI may be needed for some patients if the depression is manifesting itself in a different way.
""There are many signatures of depression in the body,"" Trivedi says. ""Having all these tests available will improve the chances of choosing the right treatment the first time.""

EMBARC’s first EEG study
Growing problem
According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, antidepressant use in the U.S. has increased nearly 65% over a decade and a half – from 7.7% in 1999-2002 to 12.7% in 2011-2014. Trivedi says the expanded use of medications makes it more critical to further understand the underpinnings of depression and ensure patients are prescribed an effective therapy.
While his team continues to evaluate data from the EMBARC trial, Trivedi has initiated other large research projects to help improve the remission rate of depression. Among them is D2K, a study that will enroll 2,500 patients with depression and bipolar disorders and follow them for 20 years. In addition, RAD is a 10-year study of 2,500 participants (ages 10-24) that will uncover factors for reducing the risk of developing mood or anxiety disorders.
Utilizing some of these enrollees, Trivedi’s research team will study the results from several other tests to assess patients’ biological signatures to determine the most effective treatment.
""It can be devastating for a patient when an antidepressant doesn't work,"" Trivedi says. ""Our research is showing that they no longer have to endure the painful process of trial and error.""
About EMBARC
EMBARC (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care) was a multicenter effort that also involved researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Columbia University, McLean Hospital, Stanford University, University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Michigan.  It was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Stanford Neurosciences Institute, the Hersh Foundation, the National Key Research and Development Plan of China, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Trivedi is founding director of UT Southwestern’s Center for Depression Research and Clinical Care, a cornerstone of the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. He served as EMBARC's coordinating principal investigator. Trivedi, a professor of psychiatry, holds the Betty Jo Hay Distinguished Chair in Mental Health and the Julie K. Hersh Chair for Depression Research and Clinical Care.
UT Southwestern and Stanford have filed for a patent for the algorithm described in the Nature Biotechnology study.
Disclosures for Trivedi are included with the article's online publication.

For instance, across the continent, banks have launched chat banking services using artificially-intelligent chatbots. Also, across sectors such as agriculture and e-commerce, African entrepreneurs are building AI-driven solutions.The use cases for blockchain in Africa has been on the increase. Organisations such as Binance Labs and Blockchain Nigeria User Group are investing in and helping stakeholders in the blockchain sector.
We have begun to see a rise of use cases across industries for Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. For blockchain, it is gaining traction in the financial services sector especially for cross-border payments. However, what we found is that organizations and policymakers still have many questions about these technologies. Our objective with this event is to completely demystify AI and Blockchain for businesses and policymakers.
