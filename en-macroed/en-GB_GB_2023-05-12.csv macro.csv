There’s a lot to be excited about it.Artificial intelligence has been around for years, but scarcely has it found itself in conversation as much as it has now. The launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT rocketed generative AI onto the radar of many people who hadn’t been paying much attention – or didn’t feel it was relevant to their lives. This has included workers, who’ve already been touched by the technology, whether they know it or not.The chatbot, which uses machine learning to respond to user prompts, is helping workers write cover letters and resumes, generate ideas and even art in the workplace and more. It’s already making a splash in hiring with recruiters, who are finding they need to adapt to the new technology. And as competing companies rush to launch similar tools, the technology will only get stronger and more sophisticated.Although some workers fear being replaced by AI, experts say the technology may actually have the power to positively impact workers’ daily lives and skill sets, and even improve the overall work economy. BBC Worklife spoke with experts about what to expect from AI now and in the future workplace.Expanding daily ideas and solutionsOne of ChatGPT’s main abilities is that it can function like a personal assistant – given a prompt, it generates text based on natural language processing to give you an accessible, readable response. Along with providing information and answers, it can also aid knowledge workers to analyse and expand their work. “It can help you brainstorm and generate new ideas,” says Carl Benedikt Frey, future of work director at Oxford University. In his own field of academia, for instance, he’s seen it test for counterarguments to a thesis, and write an abstract for research. “You can ask it to generate a tweet to promote your paper,” he adds. “There are tremendous possibilities.” For knowledge workers, this could mean creating an outline for a blog and a social media post to go with it, distil complex topics for a target audience, plan a business-trip itinerary in a new city or predict a project’s cost and timeline.For many users, ChatGPT functions as a sounding board – a tool to bounce ideas off, rather than create them. “I generate ideas all the time, and ask AI to do supplements on it,” says Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, US, who studies AI and innovation. “I use it to help me process information, to summarize stuff for me, very much as a partner.”There’s a lot of potential for workers to step outside of the box with the assistance of generative AI, whether it’s improving their daily workflows, or developing long-term projects and goals.Getty ImagesExperts say AI can broaden our thinking, introducing new approaches and solutions to problems (Credit: Getty Images)Increasing accuracy and correcting biasesAI also has the power to catch some issues people might overlook. This can mean a range of things – for instance, spotting inaccuracies in text, checking code or even circumventing biases and prejudices workers may not even be aware they have.An analyst interpreting a set of data, for instance, might be able to identify a confirmation bias in their work, meaning they look for evidence to support an outcome they already believe exists. AI can interpret data impartially, and provide a more detailed, big picture analysis, explains Anna Salomons, professor at Utrecht University School of Economics, Netherlands.The technology is far from perfect, but can currently lay the foundation for workers to see outcomes and solutions outside their personal experiences, opening up opportunities for impartiality and inclusion across myriad fields and sectors. And experts say the AI will only get better at this. The ability to “more quickly and better diagnose problems”, says Salomons, won’t replace expertise – while AI can identify problems, humans still need to correct them. But generative AI can identify these issues faster and often more accurately than humans alone. Plus, as ChatGPT and other machine learning models are constantly updating and advancing as their datasets become broader, the technology means being able to catch biases, mistakes and errors at the cutting edge. Adding new jobs and careersOne of the primary worries about AI is that it will take workers’ jobs at a staggering rate. Some data confirms that, indeed, this technology will affect a swath of jobs; in March, Goldman Sachs reported that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. Yet experts say not to worry about being displaced quite yet – and that, perhaps, this shift could even create new job opportunities.AI can help knowledge workers create an outline for a blog and a social media post to go with it, distil complex topics for a target audience, plan a business-trip itinerary in a new city or predict a project’s cost and timelineTraditionally, says Mollick, “automation disruptions result in a lot of chaos in the short term, and then more jobs in the long term”. This chimes with 2021 research Salomons co-authored, which showed 60% of jobs done today didn’t exist in 1940. Industrialisation and automation, she says, led to entire new industries from cars to computers, and added new jobs from drivers to web designers in the process.Although we aren’t yet able to know if the trend will continue, emerging data is beginning to show positive signs for new positions and even entire careers. The proliferation of AI is already increasing the demand for jobs including data analysts and scientists who work with the technology to create best practices in the workplace. According to the 2023 World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report, AI and machine learning specialists are the fastest growing job fields. Pushing workers into AI fluency While some workers are diving into the technology wholeheartedly, others may find it scary to begin engaging with AI. Yet generative AI will be in the workplace – and experts say its prevalence will push workers into using the technology, so they don’t fall behind.“What I keep emphasizing to people is to just start using this,” says Mollick. As workers get increasing fluent, he adds, they can find themselves ahead of the curve, and at a distinct advantage in the workplace.Workers resistant to AI could be seen as unwilling or incapable of adapting, says Frey. “I think workers that don't work with AI are going to find their skills [become] obsolete quite rapidly. So, therefore, it's imperative to work with AI to stay employed, stay productive and have up to date skills.”As AI becomes a more core part of the workday, Frey says this push into fluency means workers will be better equipped to utilize it as a supplement to their current skill set. Familiarity with this technology also set them up to grow and develop those skills quickly.Ultimately, AI is growing fast, and its full potential has yet to be realized. But many experts are hopeful there’s a big upside, enabling workers to innovate quickly and evolve their skills. “Ideally we want to use these technologies to create new products, new industries, new lines of work,” says Frey. “I think that is the challenge going forward – to actually use AI to generate new and previously inconceivable things.”How we workFeatures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But can it have a positive impact – or are we in for a darker future?Supported byAbout this contentPhilippa KellyFri 12 May 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 May 2023 17.21 EDTShareIn 1965, the political scientist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon declared: “Machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.” Today, in what is increasingly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is igniting similar concerns.The European parliament’s forthcoming Artificial Intelligence Act is likely to deem the use of AI across education, law enforcement and worker management to be “high risk”. Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI”, recently resigned from his position at Google, citing concerns about the technology’s impact on the job market. And, in early May, striking members of the Writers Guild of America promised executives: “AI will replace you before it replaces us.”Yet, according to Philip Torr, professor of engineering science at the University of Oxford, the fallibility of AI tools – driven not by emotion, but by data and algorithms – means that the presence of humans in the workplace will remain essential.“Industrial revolutions in the past have typically led to more employment, not less,” says Torr. “I think that we’ll see the types of jobs changing, but that’s just a natural progression.”Torr, an award-winning research fellow at the Alan Turing Institute in London, compares the impact of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to the advent of the word processor: an extremely useful tool that will fundamentally change the way we work.He is generally optimistic that humans can coexist productively alongside such technologies – and he is not alone in this view. Many experts in the field believe that, with the right education and legislation, automation could have a positive impact on the workplace.There are, of course, those who predict a darker future in which workers are appraised by algorithms and replaced by automation. But there is one broad area of consensus: for better or worse, a growing number of industries are likely to be permanently and structurally altered by the march of AI.View image in fullscreenHealthcareUntil now, the use of AI in medicine has centred on MRI scans, X-rays and the identification of tumours, says Torr. Research is also being conducted into dementia diagnosis via smartphone. Apps could track the length of time it takes a user to complete a routine task such as finding a contact, and flag an increase in this time as a possible sign of the syndrome.Each of these applications could save valuable time for doctors and other medical staff. However, Torr says in the future LLMs will have the biggest impact for patients and practitioners.He gives the example of arriving at a hospital, answering a set of questions and then being moved to another room, only to be asked the same set of questions. Instead, he explains, answers could be logged via an AI-driven app, which would then pass each patient’s information to the relevant staff.Torr acknowledges, however, that, despite its efficiency, diagnosis by algorithm – or indeed automated surgery, which he also imagines is a likely development – may not prove popular with patients. “You can imagine making some sort of robotic salesman,” he says. “But people would still want to see the real thing.”Where the technology could be more welcome, however, is among health service central planners. With large, complex organisations to run and targets to meet, they could be helped by AI suggesting plans and schedules to decrease mounting pressures faced by medical services worldwide.View image in fullscreenEducationAI is already used in schools, colleges and universities, albeit in limited ways. However, as automation makes its way further into the classroom, Rose Luckin, professor of learner centred design at University College London Knowledge Lab, says the choices we make now will decide its future impact.“There’s a dystopian version where you hand over far too much to the AI,” she says. “And you end up with an education system that’s much cheaper, where you have a lot of the delivery done by AI systems.”The more well-off students will still have lots of lovely one-to-one human interactions, alongside some very smartly integrated AIIn this future, teachers assisted in marking and lesson planning by LLMs would be left with more much-needed time to focus on other elements of their work. However, in a bid to cut costs, the “teaching” of lessons could also be delegated to machines, robbing teachers and students of human interaction.“Of course, that will be for the less well-off students,” Luckin says. “The more well-off students will still have lots of lovely one-to-one human interactions, alongside some very smartly integrated AI.”Luckin instead advocates a future in which technology eases teachers’ workloads but does not disrupt their pastoral care – or disproportionately affect students in poorer areas. “That human interaction is something to be cherished, not thrown out,” she says.View image in fullscreenCall centresKnown for their high staff turnover, call centres are often stress-filled environments in which staff spend much of their day attempting to calm angry customers. For this reason, explains Peter Mantello, professor of media and cyber-politics at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, the centres will increasingly become a popular home for what is known as emotional AI.Using voice-tone recognition, such tools allow staff and managers to gauge the emotional state of their customers and workers. This means that staff can better assist callers, and managers can take better care of staff. Mantello warns, however, that the technology is also a form of surveillance.“Surveillance is about social control and shaping people’s behaviours,” he says. “And so in the workplace, this idea of being positive, authentic and happy is going to be more and more linked to productivity.”I think we’re going to see emotion play an even more important part in creating or measuring the idea of a good workerMantello’s concerns stem from the possibility that the data AI generates could be misused by those in power, for example by a manager using data showing poor productivity to dismiss a worker they dislike, or making a purely statistical judgment on an individual’s value.The growth of such technology has implications for those working across other sectors, too. From public relations to bartending, presenting a positive demeanour has long been a part of certain roles, but Mantell says: “I think we’re going to see emotion play an even more important part in creating or measuring the idea of a good worker.”View image in fullscreenAgricultureAccording to Robert Sparrow, professor of philosophy at Monash University’s Data Futures Institute in Australia, many areas of agriculture will prove resistant to increased automation. While farmers already benefit from the application of AI in climate forecasting and pests and disease modelling, he says that in order for the technology to cause real disruption, there would need to be significant progress in robotics.“I can get ChatGPT to write better essays than many of my students,” he says. “But if you asked a robot to walk into this room and empty the wastepaper basket or make me a cup of coffee, it simply couldn’t do that.”This lack of dexterity and inability to cope with unpredictable spaces or tasks, combined with the cost of such technology, makes robots unlikely to replace agricultural workers in the near future, he believes.However, Sparrow describes agriculture as a technologically progressive industry. Food often travels across the world to reach consumers, and Sparrow describes logistics as an element of farming in which AI has real potential to increase efficiency – although this would not come without risks for human workers.“All the people currently working to determine which pallets need to go on which truck, to get to which ship, to get to market on time – if they all lost their jobs because of improvements in AI, it’s not at all obvious that they will find jobs elsewhere,” he says.View image in fullscreenMilitarySparrow says military investment in AI is high, and the belief that it will drive the future of warfare is common. However, despite the introduction of semi-autonomous drones, tanks and submarines, the technology is used less than one might imagine.This, however, is likely to change – particularly for those who serve at sea or in the air. “I’m not alone in thinking that, in the future, human beings won’t be able to survive air combat,” he says. “Flying without a pilot can be lighter, faster, more manoeuvrable and also more expendable.”Sparrow also believes that commands could eventually be delivered by AI, rather than by senior officers. Although humans would remain involved in decision-making, the possibility of automation bias – the human tendency to defer to machines – raises concerns.Too hot to handle: can our bodies withstand global heating?Read moreHe gives the example of a battalion sent into heavy enemy fire by an AI general – something that he acknowledges human generals might also need to do. “You know those people are going to be killed,” he says, “but that’s harder to stomach if a machine gave the order.”Autonomous warfare conducted from a distance could also lead to changes in military culture and the way in which working in the sector is perceived. While traits such as courage, mercy and compassion are often attributed to soldiers, Sparrow says that AI-driven fighting would “make it very hard to maintain these illusions”.Changes in public opinion aside, the positives of removing military personnel from the dangers of direct combat are clear. However, Sparrow still holds serious concerns about a future in which humans play a lesser role than technology in warfare, and believes that automated weapons systems could one day be capable of drawing humans into war.He is similarly sceptical about the future of AI across all workplaces. “The idea that these tools will leave the core of the job intact is often a marketing pitch,” he says. “If the technology is genuinely better than a person at the role, why would we employ people?”Explore more on these topicsEmploymentThe future of workWork & careersArtificial intelligence (AI)HealthGlobal healthGlobal educationComputingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

As AI tools become increasingly popular, people worldwide are concerned that the technology will replace human employees in several job roles.
Along with assembly lines, AI may also start impacting many sales, marketing, law, and healthcare roles.

AI technologies like ChatGPT have immense potential for disruption across industries. Elon Musk, one of the founders of OpenAI, called ChatGPT a form of ‘dangerously strong’ AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also said that he is a little afraid of ChatGPT. Tech leaders globally have raised concerns about authoritarian governments taking undue advantage of AI tools and the potential for a rise in cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.
Microsoft’s round of layoffs in March also included its entire AI ethics and society team, which is critical to adopting guidelines for AI principles for accessibility to the general public while maintaining ethical standards. One can argue that the unrestricted use of AI to replace humans in jobs without suitable alternatives is unethical.
Furthermore, according to a report released by Goldman Sachs this March, AI is projected to replace approximately 300 million full-time jobs conventionally held by humans. The capabilities of generative AI to generate productive content indistinguishable from human work are creating concerns around the world. Let us look at a few jobs most likely to be impacted by the upcoming generative AI revolution.

1. Computer Programmers
While computer programming and coding were long considered future-proof jobs, AI tools like ChatGPT are expected to replace many programming tasks in the near future. So, programmers with only very specific skill sets may be able to retain their positions.
AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly capable of crunching numbers with high accuracy, allowing for faster coding and reducing the need for many employees. For instance, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that 30% of non-customer-facing roles in the business will be cut due to AI in the next five years. However, skilled programmers and coders will have to adopt AI to their roles to improve productivity and aid sustainability in the job market.
2. Social Media Teams
Today, every business requires optimal use of social media to maintain a good relationship with its customers and the public. Social media teams are essential for planning and executing social content and interaction strategies.
These tasks are expected to be extensively carried out by AI in the future. AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly capable of generating content required for social media campaigns, including writing attractive slogans and captions for platforms like Instagram. These tools can also generate complete social media plans as per customized requirements. While AI is not expected to replace humans completely, candidates capable of harnessing their creativity could leverage AI solutions and benefit the most from these changes.

3. Web and Graphic Designers
A good website is critical for every organization. Web designers are essential to companies for working on code development extensively. However, these jobs are increasingly facing threats due to artificial intelligence.
Users can now leverage tools like Amazon’s Codewhisperer and GitHub’s Copilot X to write dynamic website code in any programming language with professional results.
Graphic designers who could develop compelling visuals for landing pages were considered AI-proof for a long time due to the need for creativity. However, the availability of AI-based image generators is changing this. Companies now only need a few prompts to generate aesthetically pleasing images, which can be used for various applications. This impacts the jobs of graphic designers. However, the fact that AI generates images from sample data sets is also generating concerns about potential plagiarism.
4. Proofreaders and Translators
Proofreaders have long been a time-intensive but essential resource in content creation. Normally the job requires not just grammar and spelling skills but also a great eye for fact-checking.
AI tools like ChatGPT initially made proofreading easy but are now doing the job without any human interaction. Providing ideal writing samples is enough for AI tools to check and edit all types of content.
Artificial intelligence is also casting its shadow on the jobs of translators. The GPT-4 large language model (LLM) can support content in more than 26 unique languages. These tools can easily and instantly translate and transcribe a piece of content into multiple languages.
5. Healthcare Assistants
Advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have generated notable opportunities in the healthcare industry. Robotic doctors can conduct significant portions of critical operations without human intervention. Consequently, the role of surgical assistants is expected to be taken over in the foreseeable future.
Such AI-based healthcare assistants can reduce human error in surgeries, keep track of medications, and help in healthcare and pharmaceutical research. While AI is unlikely to replace human healthcare professionals completely, minor roles are at risk.

Education and Reskilling Are Key
The unprecedented changes brought about by artificial intelligence in the job market are certainly expected to displace several job roles. However, like other technologies in the past, a balanced perspective on change can help smoothen the transition.
As industries push to adopt AI solutions, some jobs will be replaced. However, individuals, governments, and organizations must strongly invest in education and reskilling programs to minimize the impact on the workforce and optimally repurpose human resources. With dedicated thought, human qualities of ingenuity, creativity, and adaptability can not only be preserved but also enhanced with AI technology.

  What opportunities does AI present for tax and accounting professionals?








  How can CPAs best prepare for the future of AI in tax and accounting?




The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has already had a tremendous impact in many industries, and the tax and accounting sector is no exception.  As AI technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, it presents CPAs with a range of opportunities to enhance their advisory services through automated processes, real-time insights, and personalized advice.
In this article, we will explore insights discussed in a recent Pulse of the Practice podcast episode with Mo Arbas, Senior Business Advisory Consultant, at Thomson Reuters, and Paul Miller, President/Owner, of Business By Design. The two will cover the current state of AI in tax and accounting, how it can improve advisory services, what opportunities it presents for tax and accounting professionals, and how CPAs can best prepare for the future of AI in tax and accounting. With help from Checkpoint Edge, you’ll be able to take full advantage of emerging AI technologies to provide more efficient services for your clients.
The current state of AI in tax and accounting
The use of AI in the tax and accounting profession is rapidly becoming more popular. This technology offers a range of advantages that CPAs can leverage to provide better services to their clients. Automation of mundane tasks, real-time insights, and personalized advice are just some of AI’s benefits to the industry.
Paul Miller, President and Founder of Business noted “AI can be used as a tool for leverage in the industry, helping to automate repetitive tasks and allowing professionals to focus on higher-value work.”
AI also provides more accurate data analysis and forecasting, allowing firms to stay ahead of changing regulations and market conditions. In addition to reducing errors common in manual processing, it frees up valuable time for other areas of work. Furthermore, AI-driven advisory services equip CPAs with powerful algorithms and predictive analytics which enable them to gain meaningful insights into customer behavior and create strategies tailored to each client’s individual needs.
The implementation of AI in tax and accounting has opened the door for a wealth of opportunities that were not available before. Firms that take advantage of emerging technologies like AI will be well-positioned to offer superior services while remaining competitive in today’s marketplace.
How can AI improve advisory services?
The integration of artificial intelligence into tax and accounting practices is bringing forth a range of opportunities to enhance advisory services. Automation through AI can reduce the burden of mundane tasks and open up more time for personalized advice that meets each client’s unique needs. AI-driven analysis can also identify areas of improvement in the financial process, leading to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
Real-time insights into customer behavior and preferences enabled by AI technology can create strategies tailored to every customer. This not only provides better customer service with quicker responses but also facilitates fraud detection earlier than manual methods. CPAs are provided with powerful algorithms and predictive analytics which enable them to make decisions based on accurate forecasts rather than relying on assumptions or gut instinct. Additionally, voice recognition technology and chatbots can improve the customer experience while reducing labor costs associated with hiring additional employees.
Both Paul and Mo emphasized the importance of embracing AI technology and using it to enhance the services they provide to clients. They encouraged professionals to stay informed about AI developments and be prepared to adapt their businesses to leverage the benefits of AI technology.
Businesses that employ AI have access to a variety of tools that allow them to remain competitive in their field while offering superior services. To get the most out of these technologies, it is important for professionals to stay on top of developments in the field and invest in training so colleagues understand how best to use these tools effectively.


Free Guide
The Tax and Accounting professional’s guide to everything AI
If your firm hasn’t yet adopted an AI-enabled solution, and you’re unsure of how to do so, you’re in luck. This guide is designed to answer your lingering questions about the state of AI in the tax and accounting world and what it means for your firm.




What opportunities does AI present for tax and accounting professionals?
The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in the tax and accounting profession has presented a range of new opportunities for CPAs. From automating mundane tasks to providing data-driven insights, AI can be used to optimize an accountant’s advisory services. This technology can also be used to better understand client needs and offer tailored advice. AI can also help to reduce errors and increase accuracy when preparing financial statements.
Using AI tools, CPAs are now able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior which they would not have been able to obtain on their own. With access to real-time data, professionals are more capable of predicting future trends in order to create effective strategies that align with current market conditions. Furthermore, AI tools can help detect anomalies quickly during audit or investigation processes – allowing firms to respond swiftly should any discrepancies arise.
Another advantage AI can bring to your firm is automation. Automation through AI will free up time for other important activities while providing valuable information about customer behavior – enhancing overall productivity within the firm while offering superior services at the same time!
How can CPAs best prepare for the future of AI in tax and accounting?
In addition to staying up to date and investing in training, CPAs should also be aware of the potential risks that come with using AI. Data privacy is a major concern when it comes to AI-based tools and the accuracy of predictions can be an issue as well. It’s wise for CPAs to develop relationships with experts who specialize in implementing new technologies into existing systems, so they can get the most out of any AI solutions they choose to adopt.
As noted by Miller, “I think we’re at a point where you have to start to change because the decision has already been made […], the market has already moved.”
By taking proactive measures such as staying informed on AI advancements, investing in training, and building expert relationships, CPAs can ensure they are ready for the future of tax and accounting. With these steps taken, they will have access to powerful algorithms and predictive analytics which will enable them to maximize their clients’ success while providing superior services tailored specifically for each individual need.

What is AI art?
AI art (artificial intelligence art) is any form of digital art created or enhanced with AI tools. Though commonly associated with visual art -- images and video, for example -- the term AI art also applies to audio compositions, including music.
Since the earliest pictures found on cave walls, human creativity alone has driven art's history. Inspired humans using hand-held tools -- musical instruments or paintbrushes -- generated all manner of art throughout recorded history. AI art shatters that paradigm.
Using machine learning algorithms, computer technology -- trained on a body of art to learn what art is and how to describe it -- applies various techniques, such as a generative adversarial network (GAN), to change or enhance existing human creations or generate entirely new works of art.
AI art challenges the millennia-old requirement of humans as the sole creators of art. Its introduction raises questions about the genesis of creativity and carries ethical and legal concerns. It’s also an opportunity to extend the boundaries of art -- and creativity -- in many ways.

AI art allows anyone to create works or even entire collections of art, but in a small fraction of the time non-AI methods afford. In addition, AI art can create visual or audio compositions that would be difficult to create otherwise. With text-to-image generative AI tools, such as Dall-E or Stable Diffusion, humans no longer need to attempt to draw the image they want; they simply type a text prompt into the tool, which generates the desired imagery.





History of AI-generated art
The earliest iterations of AI art appeared in the late 1960s, with the first notable system appearing in 1973 with the debut of Aaron, developed by Harold Cohen. The Aaron system was an AI assistant that used a symbolic AI approach to help Cohen create black-and-white art drawings.
AI-generated art began its recent ascent in 2014, when GANs -- a foundation of generative AI technologies -- were first discussed. In 2015, Google released DeepDream, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an experimental approach to AI art, further advancing the field.
Ganbreeder was launched in 2018 and rebranded itself as Artbreeder, using GAN models to allow humans to use AI to modify existing images and create new ones. That same year, an artist collective operating under the name of Obvious made headlines by selling a painting called Edmond de Belamy, created using GAN models, at Christie's auction house for the princely sum of $432,500. Those GAN models were trained on a corpus of 15,000 portraits from the 14th to the 19th century that were publicly available on the WikiArt website.
The public debut of text-to-image GAN-based online services for image generation sparked the imagination and interest of users around the world in January 2021. That month, OpenAI launched Dall-E, providing a publicly accessible and usable system that enabled anyone with internet access to create AI art with text prompts, giving the world a look at AI art’s possibilities.



This Dall-E image was generated based on a user's text prompt.





In May 2022, Google announced its Imagen text-to-image technology as another option for AI art. This was followed in August 2022 by Stability AI, which launched Stable Diffusion's services, another GAN-based, publicly accessible option to create AI art with text prompts.
The growth of AI art tools continued in 2023, with large software vendors joining the market. Notably, the Adobe Firefly service was announced in March 2023. This GAN-based approach integrates with Adobe's popular image and video editing tools, including Photoshop and Premier.


What types of AI are used to generate art?
Though AI art uses a variety of models and techniques, the fundamental process remains the same. The first step is machine learning, during which an AI model is trained on a data set to begin to form a knowledge base. Once an understanding of a data set is established, models can begin the next step: creating and generating images. As part of an interface to the models, modern AI art tools often employ some form of natural language processing, or NLP, to understand and interpret the text users input in their request to generate an image.
Different types of AI models used to generate art include the following:

Generative adversarial network. In a GAN, multiple neural networks are used together for deep learning operations to help predict, or generate, the end result the user seeks based on the prompt.
Convolutional neural network. With the CNN approach, the deep learning model identifies objects, which can then be useful for generating new images.
Neural style transfer. An NST is used in conjunction with a CNN as a deep learning technique that enables the transfer of the style of one image to another. For example, a user could use an NST to generate AI art in the style of Van Gogh.
Recurrent neural network. RNNs are utilized for generating sequences of data like music. They use a feedback loop to produce a sequence of outputs based on prior inputs, which enables them to generate new outputs that resemble the inputs on which they were trained.



How are artists using AI?
Again, the primary tools of artists were physical items like brushes, paints, chisels or musical instruments. But the introduction of AI expands the palette of capabilities available to all artists in the following ways:

Art therapy. Art is used for personal enjoyment and relaxation, and therapists have occupational AI art to help patients on a case-by-case basis.
Democratization. AI enables more people than ever before to create and generate their own art, supporting a new generation of would-be artists.
Education. Educators and teachers are using AI art tools to help teach a new generation of artists.
Enhancing existing creations. AI tools and features help to enhance, augment and improve existing creations. For example, AI can be used to reimagine an existing piece of art in a particular artistic style.
Fully AI-generated art. AI tools help artists create entirely new pieces of visual art, videos and music.
Inspiration for new art. AI tools inspire artists with starting points that can lead to new pieces of art.




These images represent the variability in AI art and AI-generated images.







How difficult is it to make AI art?
Making AI art is an increasingly simple task for artists of nearly any skill level.
At the most advanced, complex level, an artist can choose to train an AI model to create art. In this approach, the artist first needs to collect or have access to a data set of art. Once the target data set has been assembled, the next step is to train the model to learn from the assembled data. With the trained data set on an appropriate GAN model, the next step is to generate the art.
It is significantly easier for an artist to use an AI tool that has already been trained on a data set of existing art. It is possible, depending on the tool, to focus additional training on an artist's own set of images to further refine the model. With the pre-trained model and any customization, the artist can then generate images. Images can be generated with text prompts, then refined after they have been generated. Some tools will allow for further generation with supplemental text prompts, while others can provide artists with additional visual design tools to fine-tune a creation. Many of the tools offer new users with free credits to explore the process of AI art.
Among the many AI image generator tools available to generate AI art today are the following:

Adobe Firefly.
Artbreeder.
Dall-E.
Deep Dream Generator.
DreamStudio.
Midjourney.
Playform.
Stable Diffusion.



What ethical concerns are associated with AI-generated art?
As explained above, AI-generated content has many positive aspects, but potential pitfalls to AI art include the following:

Authorship. Artists have long enjoyed the practice of signing their names to works of art. But how does authorship work with AI art? An emerging ethical dilemma concerns who actually created the work: the AI, or the human who instructed the AI with the prompt to create the work?
Bias. Any AI model is only as diverse as the data on which it was trained. There is the probability for bias if the data on which the model was trained lacks diversity and sensitivity toward equity and issues of discrimination.
Copyright. A major concern is intellectual property theft. For example, large GAN-based AI tools for art have sometimes been trained on data sets without obtaining full legal copyright access. Because of these situations, multiple lawsuits have been filed that extend the ethical concern of AI-generated art into the legal domain. Getty Images, for example, filed a lawsuit in January 2023 against Stable Diffusion for alleged infringement on copyrights held by Getty.
Originality. While defining what constitutes ""art"" has long been the subject of debate, one common attribute is that it is -- in some way, shape or form -- original. With AI art there is an ethical question about whether generated works are genuinely original or just derivative.

SAP and Microsoft are developing a generative AI solution to help customers address the talent gap.The solutions aim to produce new methodologies to improve how businesses attract, retain and coach their employees. The tech giants will leverage SAP SuccessFactors solutions with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot in Viva Learning. SAP and Microsoft will also integrate Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to utilize powerful language models that assess and create natural language.Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO at Microsoft, said:We have an incredible opportunity to deliver next-generation AI that will unlock productivity growth for every individual, organization and industry, including the human resources function. We’re building on our long-standing cloud partnership with SAP and bringing together the power of Microsoft 365 Copilot with SAP SuccessFactors solutions to transform how organizations attract and develop their most important resource – their people.”How SAP Will Streamline Recruitment and Employee LearningMicrosoft and SAP’s collaboration, compounded by SAP’s use of the Azure OpenAI Service API, ensures the vendors work together on strategies for improving recruitment and employee learning processes.For recruitment, SAP will leverage the Azure OpenAI Service API and data from SAP SuccessFactors solutions to generate compelling and targeted job descriptions. Integrating the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution and Microsoft 365 allows business leaders to edit job descriptions using Copilot in Word with additional content and checks to detect bias. The final job descriptions will be published in SAP SuccessFactors to conclude the workflow.SAP will also utilize the Azure OpenAI Service API to create interviewer prompts within Teams with suggested questions based on a candidate’s resume, the job description and similar jobs.For learning, employees can use Copilot in Viva Learning to perform natural language queries to create personalized learning recommendations based on data and learning courses in SAP SuccessFactors solutions that fulfil the employee’s career and development goals.After learning is concluded, the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio will update automatically, providing businesses with an up-to-date assessment of their skill landscapes.Addressing Enterprise’s Talent Gap Concerns



SAP and Microsoft recognize that closing the talent gap demands optimizing recruitment in today’s competitive market and delivering effective development programmes to help employees grow. Several challenges are inherent to this process, including updating requirements regularly —as well as job descriptions and interview questions — and closing the gap between employees’ unique career ambitions and the cross-skilling and upskilling opportunities provided by the business.Microsoft and SAP are collaborating to provide SAP customers with generative AI-powered offerings which attract the most qualified candidates for critical roles and create personalized insights to maintain employee engagement after they’ve been hired.“For years, Microsoft and SAP have worked together to help drive their customers’ transformation journeys forward,” added Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “SAP has long embedded AI into our solutions, and we’re very excited about the opportunities generative AI unfolds for our industry and our customers. Today’s announcement is one example of how we are bringing the power of generative AI to business, building on 50 years of trusted innovation for companies worldwide.”Microsoft’s Holistic AI Projects2023 has seen Microsoft launch a diverse range of AI-powered solutions and partnerships, the most significant of which is arguably Copilot, which Nadella described at the time of Copilot’s announcement in March as “the greatest productivity tool on the planet”, with 20 enterprise customers being granted preview access to the solution.The initial announcement outlined Copilot’s productivity-boosting features for PowerPoint and Excel, and Microsoft has since revealed the AI-powered solution’s integration with SharePoint and Microsoft Viva.Last week, Microsoft expanded the Copilot Early Access Programme to an initial wave of 600 organizations after “overwhelming feedback” (said Jared Spataro, CVP of Modern Work and Business Applications at Microsoft) from those already enjoying preview access.Microsoft also revealed that it was introducing Copilot AI capabilities to its 365 suite last week — including OneNote, Outlook and Whiteboard — meaning Microsoft has implemented its AI across its full 365 suite.Copilot and the SAP generative AI collaboration aren’t Microsoft’s only AI-centric projects.Last month, Microsoft announced that AI-based noise suppression would launch in December. According to the roadmap for the solution, the update will automatically remove any “unwelcome” noise in the background of a user’s meeting.Siemens is also releasing a Teams-integrated app powered by generative AI to enhance productivity and innovation for industrial businesses. The app, Teamcenter for Microsoft Teams, is planned to launch later this year and is a collaboration between Teams’ platform, Siemens software for product lifecycle management (PLM), and, like with the Microsoft and SAP collaboration, Azure OpenAI Service’s language models and other Azure AI capabilities.

First it was wild and incredible works of art, then text documents of every kind, from homilies to academic essays. One of the issues in the current Writers Guild strike is whether studios and networks should be allowed to use programs like ChatGPT to create outlines or full-length scripts, which writers then would simply rewrite or polish.We have labeled the programs that do this work “artificial intelligence.” And on the surface, the reality of that concept has never seemed more persuasive. These programs generate complete and seemingly original works in an instant. They can also communicate with a person in a way that resembles actual conversation.AdvertisementIn a way, ChatGPT and its ilk are the highest form of separating laborers from the fruit of their labor.Tweet thisBut in fact, for the time being anyway, these programs are not sentient but just a very complex form of the kind of predictive text bot you find using Gmail or Google docs. ChatGPT-3, for instance, was trained on and is informed by 500 billion “tokens”—words or phrases culled from books, articles and the internet through which it interprets and responds to the prompts given to it. (You’ll also hear this referred to as “large language model” machine learning.) Where Google docs might suggest the rest of a phrase when you start typing the first word, ChatGPT has so much data at its disposal it can suggest a whole paragraph or essay. And it continues to learn and develop from the data that we enter and responses that they get.Now, you might say, why make a big fuss about what we call this? No one is claiming that ChatGPT is C-3PO or that we are approaching the singularity. Chill out.AdvertisementBut in calling these programs “artificial intelligence” we grant them a claim to authorship that is simply untrue. Each of those tokens used by programs like ChatGPT—the “language” in their “large language model”—represents a tiny, tiny piece of material that someone else created. And those authors are not credited for it, paid for it or asked permission for its use. In a sense, these machine-learning bots are actually the most advanced form of a chop shop: They steal material from creators (that is, they use it without permission), cut that material into parts so small that no one can trace them and then repurpose them to form new products.Maybe that sounds silly. We’re talking about things like breaking a scene from a play into tiny phrases, not Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams or more recently Ed Sheeran using Marvin Gaye tracks without permission. Where does the principle of fair use come into play when creative products can be sliced into such microscopic units? Some might argue that what ChatGPT does is more akin to Sheeran arguing that he’s just taking building blocks and using them in new ways. But I don’t know. “To be or not to be” or “Attention must be paid” certainly seem like someone’s intellectual property.It is important to remember these program algorithms are predictive—that is, they’re meant to think about their tokens in relationship to each other. It makes sense that, having been given a thousand tokens from a great writer like Toni Morrison or Stephen King, bots like this would be able to either reproduce or repurpose those authors’ voices, ways of thinking and turns of phrase.AdvertisementWhat we face in dealing with programs like ChatGPT is the further relentless corrosiveness of late-stage capitalism, in which authorship is of no value. All that matters is content.Tweet thisAnd once again, this has all been done without anyone ever having obtained those writers’ permission to allow their work to help inform the program’s output. A number of such art-based programs are currently facing lawsuits over claims that their databases of billions of copyrighted images, which are then “diffused” to create new images, constitute copyright infringement. (There’s also a case currently before the Supreme Court considering when the use of another artist’s material becomes transformative instead of theft.)In a way, ChatGPT and its ilk are the highest form of separating laborers from the fruit of their labor. We get an answer or piece of art from a predictive text bot and the original articles and ideas from which they were generated are so far removed that even those creators themselves don’t realize they have been stolen from. In fact, they themselves might join those who think that argument is absurd. Which is kind of like admiring somebody’s souped-up hot rod when a tiny part of its hood (or engine design) was stolen from your car.

What the downfall of the Papal States can teach today’s Catholic integralists
A movement known as Catholic integralism has been enjoying something of a revival in contemporary American political thought, especially among Catholic critics of liberalism and modernity. But history tells us that integralism can be more harmful than helpful.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A technology with the potential to transform all aspects of everyday life is shaping the next pursuit at Purdue University. With the programs, research and expertise highlighted below, Purdue is guiding the advancement of artificial intelligence. If you have any questions about Purdue’s work in AI or would like to speak to a Purdue expert, contact Brian Huchel, bhuchel@purdue.edu. 
President Mung Chiang’s 2023 Spring Commencement speech

Taking AI as his theme, President Chiang concluded his address to graduates with these words: “Our best hope for AI is that it advances individual freedom. That it presents more options, not more homogeneity. That the freedom to choose and free will still prevail. Let us preserve the rights that survived other alarming headlines in centuries past. Let our students sharpen the ability to doubt, debate and dissent. Let a university, like Purdue, present the vista of intellectual conflicts and the toil of critical thinking.”  

Purdue launches nation’s first Institute for Physical AI (IPAI)

The Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence, or IPAI, is a pillar of Purdue Computes, a new initiative consisting of three dimensions that enable the university to lead in a new frontier of technological advancement.
The institute develops AI at the intersection of the virtual and the physical, leveraging strengths in agricultural data, neuromorphic computing, deep-fake detection, smart transportation data and AI-based manufacturing.
This universitywide institute will add 50 affiliated faculty over the next five years and pursue cutting-edge topics through several current and emerging university research centers. 

Purdue receives $500,000 grant as part of new AI Institute focusing on climate-smart agriculture and forestry

Purdue has received a five-year, $500,000 grant for education and workforce development in the new AI Institute for Climate-Land Interactions, Mitigation, Adaptation, Tradeoffs and Economy (AI-CLIMATE).
Part of a larger federal initiative for collaborative AI research, the institute will leverage AI to create more climate-smart practices that will absorb and store carbon while simultaneously boosting the economy in the agriculture and forests industries.
Purdue will guide the development and deployment of instructional modules and other education related to digital agriculture and AI in climate-smart agriculture. Other institute members: University of Minnesota, Cornell University, Colorado State University, Delaware State University, North Carolina State University and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. 

Purdue announces computer sciences, AI, microchip initiative

A recent Inside Indiana Business article highlights Purdue’s multimillion-dollar investment to advance AI, computer sciences and microchip research.
President Mung Chiang said: “When it comes to computing, AI and chips, areas that will redefine the entire economy and society in every way imaginable, the strategic hiring, structuring and investment announced today enables Purdue University to advance at the forefront.”
Purdue’s Institute for Physical AI will engage scientists across the university who bring “interdisciplinary thinking and problem-solving” to advance AI, according to Karen Plaut, executive vice president of research.

NSF funds institute to research AI-powered cybersecurity

Six Purdue researchers have joined the nation’s best computer scientists and engineers to form the National Science Foundation-sponsored Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and OperatioN (ACTION).
ACTION researchers will work to bring the continuous learning – and now, reasoning – of AI to the constant situational awareness and actions that are fundamental to cybersecurity.
Purdue will serve as one of ACTION’s major hubs for research, education, workforce development and technology transfer in this $20 million, five-year project.

Purdue expert: Is AI a danger or a tool?
AI presents both unique opportunities and unique challenges. How can we use this technology as a tool? Researcher Javier Gomez-Lavin, assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy, shares the work that needs to be done in habits, rules and regulations surrounding those who work with AI.
You’ve got to have heart: Computer scientist works to help AI comprehend human emotions

Current AI technology understands only content, not context. Researcher Aniket Bera is programming devices to incorporate nonverbal cues and communication, which involve observing and analyzing facial expressions, body language, involuntary and subconscious movements and gestures, eye movements, speech patterns, intonations, and different linguistic and cultural parameters.
This “emotional” AI can be used for mental health programs, navigating human emotions in shared spaces like self-driving cars, and providing rescue services during disasters.
“The idea is to build a future where robots can be partners, can help humans accomplish goals and tasks more safely, more efficiently and more effectively,” Bera said. “In computer science, a lot of time the biggest problems are the humans. What our research does is put the human back into problem solving to build a better world.”
Visit the Purdue News YouTube channel for video of demonstrations from Bera’s lab.

There’s a popsicle taking over the Middle East (try the black lemonade!).The ability of artificial intelligence to do certain tasks, such as writing college essays and generating fake Drake songs, is well-known. Less understood is the technology’s impact on one of the biggest conundrums of modern economics: Why worker output isn’t higher despite the technological revolution we’re all clearly living through.BloombergBusinessweekAirbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them DirectlyWe Asked Six Top Executives to Tell Us About Their Fitness RoutinesThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get IntoHow CBS Still Churns Out Hit TV Shows That Defy Cable Cutters  Expectations that the internet would spur leaps in productivity have been met, after an initial surge, with mixed results. The contribution to output made by pandemic-driven work from home has also drawn differing reviews. Figuring out why is among the biggest challenges governments face, given that sluggish productivity is blamed for eroding wages, public finances and living standards.  A new paper from the Brookings Institution, Machines of Mind: The Case for an AI-Powered Productivity Boom, argues that large language models such as ChatGPT could be a game changer for productivity, with the biggest gains expected in white-collar work.  The boost would come by making cognitive workers more efficient and by accelerating innovation as these workers make discoveries. In one scenario under the Brookings analysis, a decade of incremental increases in productivity growth would leave the economy 5% larger.“These large language models are really going to boost the productivity of anyone who is engaged in cognitive work or anyone who is engaged in white-collar work,” says Anton Korinek, an expert on AI who is one of the co-authors of the Brookings paper.  Korinek estimates his use of ChatGPT for brainstorming, writing, coding, statistical analysis and writing mathematical models has made him at least 20% more productive. He feeds the platform bullet points and “it does the job of forming well-crafted sentences out of these bullet points,” he says.  The Brookings paper isn’t alone in highlighting potential AI-driven productivity gains. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts in March estimated the combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation and higher productivity for nondisplaced workers would likely result in an output boom that would “substantially” raise global economic growth. The team estimated that generative AI could raise US labor productivity by roughly 1.5 percentage points per year over a decade. Such a jump would be dramatic—productivity expanded only 1.3% on average in the decade through 2022, undermining wage growth.  A separate study found that customer service workers at a Fortune 500 software company who were given access to generative AI tools became 14% more productive on average than those who were not, with the least-skilled workers reaping the most benefit. That study was conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who tested the impact of generative AI tools on productivity at the company over the course of a year.There’s no shortage of pushback when it comes to how AI will affect our economies. Critics say large language models, for example, are error prone. Others argue that any productivity gains will be hard to measure and may not even show up in official government data. And the effect of technology regulation is unknown.Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive who helped create credit-default swaps, warned that if AI grows too quickly or is unregulated and all of the technology’s inherent biases and abuses are unchecked it would be “a devastating loss,” as she said on an episode of Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein.Even OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday that “regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks,” although he believes the technology has the potential to solve humanity’s biggest problems.  Perhaps the most pressing concern is the dislocation to society caused by jobs that are lost as companies switch to AI. Call center workers, for example, would likely be vulnerable. Although many developed economies have labor shortages, soaring inflation has made it hard for wages to keep up with living costs.  Korinek acknowledges the full impact of AI on jobs and incomes will take time to reveal itself. But he’s clear that change is coming.“This is going to be very different from the past 40 years when blue-collar workers lost out and white-collar workers benefited from technology progress,” he says. “This is a reversal where white-collar workers are the ones that are easier to automate now.” —Enda Curran, Bloomberg NewsDepartment of Missed OpportunitiesThere’s a world where Covid-19 could’ve been the catalyst for growth in China’s biotech sector and cemented its place as a world-class startup environment.  From the next issue of Businessweek:President Xi Jinping’s administration in 2015 made biotech one of the 10 key sectors to build up under its Made in China 2025 state industrial strategy. The government went on to streamline regulation and attempted to align standards with those of the Western world, aiming to make its drugmakers more competitive so they could eventually challenge Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca Plc and other pharma giants.As a result, venture capitalists, private equity funds, investors in initial public offerings and others have poured more than 1.5 trillion yuan ($216 billion) into the Chinese biotech industry since 2015, according to Bi Jingquan, the former head of China’s drug regulator. Chinese companies accounted for 7 of the world’s 10 largest biopharma IPOs from 2018 to 2020, according to McKinsey & Co., and the combined market value for the industry soared from $3 billion in 2016 to more than $380 billion in 2021.But that hasn’t been the experience of scientists on the ground. The country has lagged behind on developing mRNA Covid vaccines—although it’s not for a lack of trying of Chinese experts.What accounts for the gap? The story dives in deep, but the short answer is it takes a long time to build up the expertise necessary to introducing new medical technology with any speed. You need a network of scientists and doctors who can lean on one another for help; you need regulators who understand the space that they are working in, to safeguard human testing. The US is aided by heavy interplay between private companies and academic institutions, something that’s not as common in China. Money has poured into biotech, yes, but so far, that hasn’t been enough.Dark PassagePictures show a family’s journey from Venezuela to New York City, from riding on top of a dangerous cargo train, to taking the subway.

Amazon is working on infusing generative AI features akin to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard AI to its shopping application and website in an effort to provide a more conversational experience, job postings on the company’s career section indicate.
The job postings sought a senior development engineer for machine learning and another engineer to “rearchitect” the search engine or feature inside Amazon’s shopping application.
“We’re working to improve shopping on Amazon using the conversational capabilities of large language models, and are searching for pioneers who are passionate about technology, innovation, and customer experience, and are ready to make a lasting impact on the industry,” one of the job postings read.











 
 
 
Another job posting, according to a Bloomberg report, sought a software engineer who would be part of “a new AI-first initiative to re-architect and reinvent the way we do search through the use of extremely large-scale next-generation deep learning techniques.”

Amazon’s intent to overhaul its search feature inside its application comes at a time when rivals such as Microsoft and Google have been adding their own generative AI engine across their product portfolio.
Microsoft was one of the first companies to showcase the power of generative AI by bringing ChatGPT’s underlying AI engine into Bing Chat, which is now being made more widely available.











 
 
 
Bing Chat is a conversational interface built inside the Microsoft Edge browser that lets users search the internet in a conversational manner.
Last week, Google also said it was adding generative AI features to Google search in the US. These features include summarizing search content and helping users with shopping.
Rivals adding generative AI features and consumer demand may be the two reasons behind Amazon’s push in revamping the search engine of its retail application.











 
 
 
In the US, about 56% of product searches start on Amazon, more than on search engines or Walmart, according to a survey of 1,000 consumers conducted by Jungle Scout, which provides SaaS-based tools for search, market analytics, sales intelligence and inventory management to Amazon resellers.
Technology giants, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, previously contended with the same rigor during the rise of voice computing in 2016, which saw these giants release their AI assistants, including Cortana, Google Assistant, and Alexa. 
Amazon’s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), already has a service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, that provides large language models to other enterprises to build generative AI based use cases as per their individual requirements.

skill shortage is now being felt across the spectrum.New Delhi: The demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) skills is gradually increasing in India amid a talent crunch and industry experts said on Thursday, as most organisations in the country enter an exploration mode with generative AI in the ChatGPT era.There are 45,000 Artificial Intelligence (AI) job openings in India, with data scientists and Machine Learning (ML) engineers being among the most sought-after careers, according to a latest report by TeamLease Digital, a tech staffing firm.Although Nasscom said that India currently ranks first in terms of AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration, the AI skill shortage is now being felt across the spectrum.Most Indian firms now focus on content generation with AI, within the corporate arena, though there are several other use-cases of generative AI that are currently in play.A Salesforce study revealed on Thursday that only 4 in 10 Indian employees are using AI in their current role -- which is cited as one of today's most in-demand digital skills.There is a disconnect between the skills companies need and those currently used by the workforce.While nine in 10 Indian workers report using digital skills in their day-to-day work, only one in four workers are currently using AI skills in their day to day roles and just over half (52 per cent) report using skills beyond digital administration.""As more companies adapt AI and automation to streamline their operations and boost efficiencies, the need to train employees to leverage these tools will become even greater,"" said Sanket Atal, Managing Director, Salesforce India Operations and Site Lead, Salesforce India.""Complimenting employees' excitement for the opportunities these tools offer with effective skills development programs should be an important part of every business leader's strategic plan,"" Atal added.By the end of 2023, AI is expected to create 2.3 million jobs, with the highest demand for roles such as AI developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.According to the World Economic Forum, AI is predicted to create 97 million jobs by 2025.""HireMee is exploring generative AI to generate questions around specific skill sets and is engaged with a client in validating questions that have been generated using ChatGPT and providing feedback,"" Venkatraman Umakanth, Senior Vice President and Head, HireMee, told IANS.According to Umakanth, generative AI also requires a strong foundation In mathematics, statistics, and programming.""We do see an increase in demand for coding skills, though it is moving from being front-end/backend developers to full-stack developers,"" he said.According to a report by global investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs and Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is ""a major advancement"".Vee Technologies' CEO Chocko Valliappa said that it is time Indian organisations ramp up their efforts to hire an AI-ready workforce and create world-class innovations.The demand for AI talent has grown 11 per cent in India over the last six months, driven by job demands in sectors like IT, retail, telecom, BFSI and advertising/market research sectors.The Indian job market will witness a 22 per cent churn over the next five years with top emerging roles coming from AI, machine learning, and data segments, according to the report by foundit (previously Monster India &amp; APAC).","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times

This doesn't only apply to artists or models but also to software developers and data scientists.A portfolio of your projects acts as public evidence of your skills. This public evidence can be anything from a blog to open-source contributions to an active engagement on forums such as StackOverflow. But these types of public evidence take a long time to build.Another type of evidence showcasing your skills is with smaller end-to-end projects.Another type of evidence showcasing your skills is with smaller end-to-end projects.

The search bar at the top of the app and home page in recent years have become the default gateway for millions of shoppers seeking to find a specific product. More than half of US shoppers say they start product searches on Amazon.com, a higher share than Google, according a survey conducted earlier this year by Jungle Scout, a maker of software for sellers on Amazon.Early deployments of generative AI by Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and others have been beset by errors in response to basic questions. But they also show how a beefed-up Microsoft Bing or Google search could offer users a more valuable way to find products.Asking Microsoft Bing — which is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT – to show the five best electric razors pulled up a roster of five products, including citations to reviews from Men’s Health and GQ, along with links to stores selling the products. The same search on Amazon yields a pair of ads, followed by dozens of products.Read More: Why Microsoft’s Satya Nadella Doesn’t Think Now Is the Time to Stop on AIAmazon’s search experience has been criticized in recent years for the increased share of results devoted to ads and other sponsored content.Generative AI uses vast quantities of data to assemble large language models that can help create text or images following a prompt. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said on an earnings call last month that the technology “presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience.”Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud-computing unit, in April announced a set of services that rely on advances in generative AI. They have yet to be widely released. Meanwhile, the company is hoping to use similar technology to improve its Alexa voice assistant, Insider reported. Amazon is also building a team to use artificial intelligence tools to create photos and videos for advertising campaigns, the Information reported this month.",,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/Lsj8tliq/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-10T19:57:50.000Z,PT7M21S,https://time.com/6280051/amazon-artificial-intelligence-product-search-jobs/,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6280051/amazon-artificial-intelligence-product-search-jobs/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/Lsj8tliq.m3u8

While some worry about the extinction of certain skills, for marketers, AI represents a powerful tool that can help them work more efficiently and effectively. In the spirit of this topic, I took a stab at ChatGPT to create an opening paragraph, and here&rsquo;s what it said.Prompt: Write an opening paragraph for an article about how generative AI will change the marketing landscape.ChatGPT&rsquo;s responseAs marketing evolves, we see a rise in the complexity and sophistication of consumer behavior, which creates new challenges for marketers. To overcome these challenges and meet consumer expectations, businesses must embrace AI technology to improve personalization, segmentation, and content creation. The emergence of generative AI is a game-changer in this regard, offering unparalleled opportunities to enhance customer engagement and drive revenue growth.Impressive, but not entirely perfect. However, it&rsquo;s a very good starting point to work on.ChatGPT is the prodigal son that brought generative AI to fame. It hit 1 million users in just 5 days. To put this achievement into perspective, it took Instagram approximately 75 days to reach the same number of users, while Spotify took even longer, clocking in at roughly 150 days. ChatGPT's unprecedented success is a testament to the growing demand for AI-powered solutions in the tech industry, particularly in the field of natural language processing.The era of generative AI has unlocked a new horizon in marketing. It has revolutionized the way we communicate with our customers. One of the most remarkable ways in which it's transforming marketing is through personalized content creation. By leveraging the power of these sophisticated algorithms, marketers can now tailor content to each individual customer based on their preferences and behavior. This level of personalization has yielded impressive results, with increased customer engagement, conversions, and stronger brand loyalty.Another great breakthrough that generative AI has achieved is the ability to provide unparalleled recommendations. With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data in real time, this technology allows businesses to provide personalized and relevant suggestions to customers, effectively improving the customer experience. This enhanced level of personalization has paved the way for higher conversion rates, repeat purchases, and overall customer loyalty.The Next Frontier for Generative AIGenerative AI has firmly established its presence and influence across industries. With its impressive use cases and ability to automate tasks for marketers, its transformative power cannot be ignored. OpenAI's ChatGPT, built on a powerful LLM model, is poised to drive significant changes in consumer behavior over the coming years. Its potential to revolutionize the way businesses communicate and engage with customers is immense.As generative AI continues to revolutionize the marketing industry, it's essential to note that it's not a replacement for humans but rather an augmentation. Emotionally intelligent content creation, for instance, is a crucial aspect that requires human intervention to understand the intricacies of a brand's personality. Therefore, it still requires a human touch to add context and creativity to its insights. The need for skilled marketing professionals will remain as they re-evaluate their current martech stacks to identify areas where generative AI can be leveraged to enhance their efforts. By embracing AI technology, marketers can streamline their workflows, free up time for more meaningful tasks, and focus on delivering personalized, relevant experiences to customers.The transformation in the marketing landscape brought about by generative AI is paving the way for a new form of agency, the Product-Led Agency, or ""Progency,"" as I would name it. This new breed of agency will fuse creativity and content expertise with data-driven insights and software capabilities, built atop generative AI platforms that can deliver the precise outcomes marketers demand, all on a performance-based model. These updates will enable a revolutionary approach to agency work, unlocking new levels of innovation and collaboration between humans and machines.As generative AI rapidly advances, we're witnessing major players like Microsoft incorporate this technology into their platforms. Microsoft Edge, for instance, has already integrated ChatGPT, enabling users to find answers to their queries instantly with a simple prompt. This innovation is only the beginning, and we can expect other industries to follow suit. The impact of this technology on martech will be revolutionary, allowing brands to leverage an omnichannel platform capable of creating hyper-personalized content for each channel and accurately measuring their success. In conclusion, companies that want to stay ahead of the curve should begin exploring ways to incorporate AI into their operations sooner rather than later.The author is Group CEO, Netcore CloudDisclaimer: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Artificial intelligence is making its way into one of the most fundamental aspects of education: completing assignments. 

Students are turning to AI-powered tools to help them finish their homework faster and more efficiently than ever, but is this a positive development or does it raise concerns about academic integrity? 







Our staff didn’t write that introduction. Instead, it was written by ChatGPT. The fact that it’s convincing is part of the challenge that teachers face as artificial intelligence invades the classroom. 

David Harvey teaches 11th grade English at Tocoi Creek High School in St. Johns County. 

After almost three decades in the classroom, Harvey is confronting a new problem - students using artificial intelligence to complete assignments. 

“In the past, you would suspect the hand of a tutor or perhaps an overbearing parent helping out,” Harvey said, “Now we can tell by the responses that it’s pretty obvious some of them are using ChatGPT.” 

Visiting Professor of English Tricia Booker said there’s no formal policy for dealing with AI. Red flags include perfect grammar, a bland writing style and often a failure to respond to the actual writing prompt. 

“In writing classes, I think it’s particularly important for you to learn how to communicate,” Booker said. “And so, that’s where I think we’re going to really have to look at informing our students how A-I can be useful but when it is absolutely inappropriate.” 

The unusual quality of artificially generated work can be detected by the school’s plagiarism detection tool called TurnItIn. 

“If you run your papers, all your papers through TurnItIn, it’s an automatic process,” Booker said. “If any of it’s plagiarized, it’ll pick it up, so we were seeing papers that were coming in that had zero percent plagiarism but were absolutely perfect.” 

AI’s influence in the classroom isn’t all bad. Harvey said some non-English speaking students can use it to help with learning sentence structure. 

“Type in a question and have it run its wheels, and it comes back with all these ideas,” Harvey said, “so it’s really great for brainstorming, for getting kids to think about the text in a different way.” 







Expert with the Global AI Ethics Institute Josh Gellers said schools are just scratching the surface of AI, and he thinks it will soon be used to assist students outside of the classroom. 

“Think about understaffed administrative offices like admissions,” Gellers said. “When it’s come time for students to apply to college, you might be able to use a chatbot like ChatGPT or another kind of artificial intelligence to answer questions that you don’t need a human to be there to respond to.” 

While academic integrity is a concern, Gellers said AI can be used in ways that will enrich the experience for both students and faculty. 

“We want to tack our sails to the wind that is artificial intelligence,” Gellers said, “so that we can harness it for good educational purposes. Thinking about how it can make us stronger instructors, thinking about how we can better train our students for careers in the future, careers that aren’t even maybe developed yet.” 

As with students who plagiarize, those who use AI to do their work can face punishments including suspension or expulsion, but Harvey said perhaps the biggest impact on students who use chat g-p-t is the loss of individual expression. 

“We’re teaching skills,” Harvey said. “We’re also teaching critical thinking, and if you just sign it off to ChatGPT, that crucial skill to be able to think for yourself is probably the biggest risk.”
