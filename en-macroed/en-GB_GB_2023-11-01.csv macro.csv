A question typed in to ChatGPT, such as “What is the capital of France”, has to be processed by an LLM in order to produce an answer like “The capital of France is Paris”.
 Here’s a visual walk-through of how this type of artificial intelligence works.

LLMs, like some other sorts of artificial intelligence, are inspired by - but do not recreate - the way human brains work. The basic structure of these models consists of nodes and connections.




The nodes in the large language model are, in essence, words, and the basic task of the model is to map the ""distances"" between words, with the output being ""the word mostly likely to come next"".




The words, and in some cases parts of words, such as the plural marker ""s"" or the prefix ""un-"", are stored in the model as tokens. Each token is represented not as a sequence of letters, but as a vector, a sequence of numbers.




The vectors work similarly to map coordinates. It's common to represent the locations of cities, say, by using a vector such as [2.34337,48.85663]. That one is for Paris. The first number represents distance and direction east-west from Greenwich. The second does the same for distance from the equator.




The vectors also tell us about the relationship between the places. Paris and Orléans's numbers are close together, because the two places are close together. Using some (relatively) simple maths, we can derive from those vectors a number of useful insights; the distance between places, which is further east and which further north.




The vectors assigned to the word tokens in the model similarly place them in a ""space"", and similarly encode how ""close together"" they are in that space.




But the distances are not only expressed in two dimensions as (many) map references, nor in three dimensions as in this cloud ...




... but in hundreds of dimensions. This is the actual vector for happy in one LLM. We don't know exactly what the dimensions encode, but they may be things like ""substitutability"" - on that dimension ""happy"" would be close to ""sad"", even if on another dimension they might be very far apart.




The basic predictive text in SMS apps, in contrast, only really has one dimension; what is the word which most commonly, in all scenarios, comes next. But crucially an LLM is still, deep down, only figuring out what word - or sequence of words -  is most likely to come next. It can do so much better than predictive text for two related reasons; ""transformers"" and ""attention"".




A transformer is a mathematical process that recalculates the vectors for each token; that is, it assigns new distances between each pair of tokens, based largely on what other tokens are in its utterance. If you ask ""What is a tidy thing to eat pasta with?"" and (in a different chat ... ) ""What is a nice thing to eat pasta with?"" the LLM will start typing its answer...




In each case the LLM gets the first few words from rearranging your question into a response. Now it just has to find the most probable next word.




First the LLM weights all the relationships between all the words it knows, in thousands of dimensions, based on its immense corpus of training data. But then, crucially, it looks at what words have come before and reweights those associations. It is possible that within the model's computations, ""Tidy"" has a close relationship with ""utility"" and ""tools"" and that informs the output. .




Indeed the word ""with"" itself will be reweighted by the preceding terms to lie closer to one set of its alternatives, such as ""using"", ""by means of"". In the second sentence ""nice"", it seems, has relationships with ""taste"" and ""flavour"" and the word with gets reweighted to lean closer to its other alternative, ""accompanied by"".





That reweighting step is what the LLM technicians call a “transformer”, and the principle of re-evaluating the weights based on the salience given to previous bits of the text is what they call “attention”.The LLM applies these steps to every part of a given conversation. So that if you ask “What is the capital of France?” it can re-evaluate capital to probably mean “city” not “financial resources” when it gets the added input of “France”.And when you subsequently ask “How many people live there?” it has already assigned enough salience to the idea of “Paris (city)” that it can conclude that “there” is standing in for “Paris”.Attention is widely considered a breakthrough development in natural language AI, but it doesn’t make for the successful models on its own. Each of those models then goes through extensive training, partly to master the question-and-response format, and often to weed out unacceptable responses – sometimes sexist or racist – that would arise from an uncritical adoption of the material in the training corpus.NotesMost of the visualisations are illustrative but informed by conversations with industry experts, to whom thanks, and by interaction with publicly available LLMs. The vector for happy is from the BERT language model using the transformers Python package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is artificial intelligence?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, How does artificial intelligence work?Artificial intelligence, or AI, is where a computer is able to carry out a task in a way that can be considered human-like.The term ""artificial intelligence"" was first used in 1956.In the 1960s scientists were teaching computers how to mimic - or copy - human decision-making.This developed into research around ""machine learning"", where robots were taught to learn for themselves and to remember their mistakes, instead of simply copying behaviour. Algorithms play a big part in machine learning as they help computers and robots to know what to do.How does it work?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Artificial intelligence works by learning rules and patterns from lots of kinds of dataComputers can be ""taught"" how to do things in a number of different ways.One way is through algorithms - which is a fancy term for a set of rules that a computer must follow.Another way is through experience.For example, a computer might learn how to play chess by being taught the rules of the game before playing millions of matches, and then gaining an understanding of chess with every win and every loss.A computer should be able to spot patterns in the information it receives, which helps it to make decisions, predictions and even take real-world action.If you cannot see this image, click here.What are some examples of artificial intelligence?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Facial recognition technology has been made possible through developments in artificial intelligenceYou can find artificial intelligence being used almost anywhere now - even in your home or at school. Search engine Google uses AI to rank the webpages that come up when something is searched for, and allows users to search with images and voice commands instead of text. Artificial intelligence is also used by social media apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat to show you posts and products the apps think are most relevant to you.Facial recognition has also been made possible due to artificial intelligence, allowing someone to unlock their phone or computer using only their face.Outside of the home, artificial intelligence has been used to create driverless cars, flight simulators and to predict the weather.Artificial intelligence is also being used to help detect and diagnose illnesses like cancer.What is generative artificial intelligence?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, AI has produced an image inspired by Johannes Vermeer's painting ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" on display at the Mauritshuis museum in the NetherlandsGenerative artificial intelligence is where programs can learn from lots and lots of data to create, or generate, new content that seems human-made.ChatGPT is an example of generative artificial intelligence. It is a chat bot that is able to talk and respond like a human.And other programmes like DALL-E can use text instructions to create images that look as if they've been photographed, painted or drawn.What do critics of artificial intelligence have to say?Artificial intelligence is being used in all sorts of ways, but as the technology develops quickly, some people have raised concerns.For example, there are worries over the accuracy of data that is given to AI by humans.In 2019, a US government conducted a study into the facial recognition software of 99 companies.The technologies struggled to accurately identify African-American and Asian faces compared to white faces.""When we've been teaching it about people's faces there hasn't been as much focus on people of colour so the data contains more images of white men and women,"" technology expert Krittika D'Silva said.Image source, REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaImage caption, Vice-President of the United States, Kamala Harris, shared her concerns about artificial intelligence in London on WednesdayOthers are worried about the privacy of artificial intelligence.Vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, spoke ahead of the UK's Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit on Wednesday about her concerns of ""cyberattacks at a scale beyond anything we have seen before"".Some technology experts, such as Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk, say they worry that AI could be a big threat to the world.But lots of experts say this is too negative a view, with Meta's president of global affairs Nick Clegg saying ""speculative, sometimes somewhat futuristic predictions"" should not get in the way of immediate issues to do with AI technology.Others are more concerned about jobs, as it's believed artificial intelligence could replace many careers.Investment bank Goldman Sachs wrote a report that suggested AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe.Prof Gina Neff, who runs an AI centre at the University of Cambridge, said: ""We're concerned about what's going to happen to our jobs, what's going to happen to our news, what's going to happen to our ability to communicate with one another.""What is being done to protect us from artificial intelligence?Image source, CHRIS J RATCLIFFE/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockImage caption, UK science, innovation and technology secretary Michelle Donelan posed for a photograph with international ministers at the AI Safety Summit 2023The summit has brought together world leaders to discuss the future of artificial intelligence, and ways to protect the world from the technology developing in a way that might cause harm.The Bletchley Declaration shows there is a desire for countries to work together to better understand the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence.Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said at the summit: ""We have always said that no single country can face down the challenges and risks posed by AI alone, and today's landmark declaration marks the start of a new global effort to build public trust by ensuring the technology's safe development.""China's Vice Minister of Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui, agreed that the world needed to work together on this issue.""We call for global collaboration to share knowledge and make AI technologies available to the public,"" he said.More on this storyIs using AI to help with school work cheating?Published1 March 2023AI helps decode an ancient mysterious scrollPublished15 October 2023What is facial recognition and why are people talking about it?Published5 August 2020",http://schema.org,CreativeWork,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/67288332,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC Newsround', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/newsround/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",2023-11-02T13:36:06.000Z,2023-11-02T13:36:06.000Z,What is artificial intelligence and why does it matter to you?,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_bbc/B76E/production/_131585964_gettyimages-1458155158.jpg'}",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_bbc/B76E/production/_131585964_gettyimages-1458155158.jpg,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/67288332,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC Newsround', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/newsround/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As AI-based tech becomes ever more sophisticated, concerns about its possible negative effects on society are growing. Chief among these is the threat it poses to the labour market. Indeed, in a new paper entitled Future Risks of Frontier AI, the Government Office for Science considers a scenario in which increased automation disrupts the UK’s workforce, leading to increased unemployment and poverty by 2030.
Such outcomes are far from unlikely. IBM’s chairman and CEO, Arvind Krishna, expects that about 7,800 jobs at the company could be replaced by generative AI in the medium term, for instance. Meanwhile, BT Group’s leadership team has been open about its plan to slash the firm’s headcount by 55,000, using tech including AI to automate up to 10,000 jobs within seven years. 
Harmeen Mehta, the telco’s chief digital and innovation officer, believes that too much attention is being paid to the technology’s negative impact on people whose jobs it’s already affecting. 
I don’t know how horses felt when the car was invented, but they didn’t complain that they were put out of a job; they didn’t go on strike
“Society changes and jobs morph,” she says. “I don‘t know how horses felt when the car was invented, but they didn’t complain that they were put out of a job; they didn’t go on strike. It’s part of evolution. Some jobs will change, some new ones will be created and some will no longer be needed.” 
The UK press has adopted a particularly circumspect attitude towards AI, according to Mehta, who believes that the media focus in the US and much of Asia has been much more on its potential applications. 
“The media here is creating a level of paranoia that’s going to paralyse this country – it creates more emotional problems for me than I do for myself,” she says. “I’ve spent the past two years trying to convince my company that human intelligence and artificial intelligence can work together.”
Mehta believes that the UK is trailing badly in the innovation stakes behind the US, which is home to firms at the forefront of AI development, including OpenAI, Amazon and Microsoft. 
“The UK is a leader in research, but we lag on turning that into products that generate revenue,” she observes. “We‘re not monetising our own brain cells.“
Creating a startup culture at BT
Mehta joined the company in March 2021 to lead its digital transformation unit, BT Digital. This department is responsible for modernising the business, which she describes as “a little bit more institutionalised” than her previous employer, Indian telco Bharti Airtel.
Having missed out on a “whole wave of transformation”, BT has left itself “a lot of catching up to do”, according to Mehta. With this in mind, she is determined that the firm will seize the latest opportunities created by the rise of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT. 
“If I don‘t do this for BT, the business won’t survive because every other company will do it and overtake us,” she stresses.
The UK is not going to be an AI hub if you don’t let companies adopt AI
In her bid to “shake up” the enterprise, which can trace its roots back to 1846, Mehta has been hiring candidates with experience in startups to inject some entrepreneurial spirit into the organisation. 
“These people have shown what they can do without the resources of BT, so imagine what they can do for the country, not just for the company, if we give them a bit of room,” she says.
Alongside its remit for product innovation and service digitalisation, Mehta’s unit is also responsible for finding £1bn in savings through digital transformation with a project that’s known internally as “simplify”. This forms part of the wider £3bn cost-reduction target set last year by BT’s outgoing CEO, Philip Jansen.
These savings will come from measures such as productivity improvements, a reduction in spending on legacy systems, a shift away from using subcontractors and, crucially, the adoption of generative AI. 
AI should be a ‘call to arms’ for society
While Mehta accepts that this last measure in particular will affect numerous roles at the company, she encourages people to retrain to avoid being automated out of a job. 
“Every job that exists today won’t exist in exactly the same form in the future,” she argues. “The people who reskill themselves will have jobs, at this company or another, while those who don‘t might not. That is simply part of the evolution of society.”
This challenge should be reframed as a “call to arms for society“ that urges people to “wake up, reinvent yourself and get ready”, says Mehta, who adds: “Why is it my job to make every person in the company relevant for the future? It‘s their responsibility to put themselves on the map and mine to create an opportunity for them to do that. It takes two to tango.” 
Reskilling works beautifully if it’s done with the right mindset and people are hungry to lea
Mehta can provide a clear example of how this approach is working at BT. Earlier this year, she encouraged tech-savvy workers in the firm’s Belfast call centre to apply for jobs in her business unit. Of the 50 or so applicants, four have gone on to have full-time roles in BT Digital and have received training on low-code platforms (which don’t require deep knowledge of programming languages to use). 
“They’ve gone from working in call centres to building the technology we’ll be using in call centres,” Mehta says. “I just created a little bit of an atmosphere and gave them a platform. The experience has made me confident that reskilling works beautifully if it’s done with the right mindset and people are hungry to learn.”
She would like such a model to become more prevalent in British business. In her view, if this country is ever to become a leading AI power, people must learn to stop worrying about the risks posed by the technology and focus on the opportunities it offers. 
“The UK is not going to be an AI hub if you don’t let companies adopt AI. While this will mean that some mundane jobs will disappear, new kinds of jobs will be created,” she argues. “This can lead to much more innovation because we’ll be spending less time writing emails and more time actually thinking.”

				Concerns about AI range from how will it change the nature of work to what it might mean for human life on earth 
			

Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg
			   

			







As artificial intelligence continues to advance at a rapid pace, technology moguls and influencers across the globe have been sharing their views on what impacts are to be expected.With the progression comes a whole series of questions, which Telegraph readers have been sending in their multitudes.Many are concerned how artificial intelligence will change the nature of their work, and whether it will make certain jobs redundant. Others question how society will change, and indeed what the advancement of AI might mean for human life on earth. The Telegraph’s technology editor, James Titcomb, has answered the most pressing of readers’ queries about AI and what it holds for the future. Read on to have your questions about AI answered by our expert, and please share any additional questions in the comments section.Reader Gary Bowers asks: “How fast is AI coming along? For instance, is it learning how human emotions work yet?”The Telegraph’s technology editor, James Titcomb, responds: “AI is clearly making rapid progress in some areas, but remains fairly basic in others. One of the problems with the term ‘artificial intelligence’ is that it makes us think of these systems in human terms. “The reality is that in some fields - arithmetic, for example - machines have outperformed us for decades; in others, they are nowhere near. Emotions fall into the latter: we haven’t really built AI that exhibits anything close to an emotion, partly because we don’t really understand how they work in living things. “There are certainly AIs that scan faces and voices to detect emotions, which have been used by police and marketing companies, although their effectiveness has been questioned.“For now, it’s probably better to think about AI in terms of individual capabilities than comparing it to the human brain. In some areas, such as generating images or summarising text, it is improving quickly, although these changes tend to come in fits and spurts, rather than improving gradually.”Another reader, Ben Francis, wants to know: “How do we prevent this tech hitting escape velocity and leaving us behind?”James replies: “For now, AI still can’t do a lot of things we can do, so it’s unlikely that we will be left behind any time soon, but experts do have some ideas about how to manage its rise. “One is that we should ban AI from writing computer code to develop AI. This would prevent a phenomenon known as ‘recursive self-improvement’ where a system repeatedly improves itself until it outsmarts humans and then becomes all-powerful.“Another emerging research area is known as AI alignment: ensuring that a robot’s goals are in line with ours. It is hoped that this would prevent famous doomsday scenarios where an AI is given a straightforward task - cleaning up the oceans or creating paperclips - and ends up destroying humanity as a side effect.”








Roy Read questions: “Surely we are our own worst enemies when it comes to AI?”Here’s what James has to say: “If you bring up concerns about artificial intelligence with researchers, or suggest that progress could be slower, many will argue that easing back is pointless. They say that somebody is going to develop this technology sooner than later, and wouldn’t you rather it was us than China or Russia?“As with most technologies, development is often hard to stop. One exception has been nuclear weapons, where a concerted international effort stopped their deployment decades ago. Safety advocates would like to see similar treaties and international agreements when it comes to AI: some have proposed a body similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency to regulate use of the technology.”Frederick Otobele asks: “How will cybersecurity experts’ work be impacted by AI?”Our expert responds: “In short: they’ll be busy! Security experts have warned for years that AI could lead to the industrialisation of hacking as automated systems probe for weaknesses in security networks. “A growing concern is that AI software that can accurately replicate people’s voices and likenesses could bypass security controls such as voice banking, or automate scams so that vulnerable people are fooled into sending money.“We’re yet to see that come to pass, but it is probably only a matter of time. Cybersecurity experts are likely to be as in-demand as ever.”Kates Ferrier queries: “I don’t understand why AI is being introduced. Why would we as a nation give further way to instability in the employment industry and opportunity to earn a salary? It’s frightening.”James says: “New technologies - from the loom to the steam engine - have often threatened to displace jobs, but have in the end made us more productive, with plenty of employment still available. The question with AI is whether it represents a step change that could make vast swathes of the workforce, not just certain jobs, redundant. We’re not there yet.“The other response is that it’s simply difficult to hold inventions back, at least not without very strict regulation. Employers that could save money by employing AI are unlikely to voluntarily choose to ignore it.”Reader Richard Burgess would like to know: “Do we need AI?”Our expert replies: “We often talk about the downsides of AI, and many of the uses that have emerged in the last few months - cheating at homework, hacking or copyright infringement - seem like things we could do without. AI’s supporters say there are very serious advantages, such as making us more productive at work, helping to discover new drugs, and the eventual arrival of self-driving cars, which could make the roads safer.“The UK’s flatlining productivity in the last decade and a half has consistently puzzled economists and politicians: if AI can help fix the puzzle, it would certainly be a benefit.”Mohamad Behery queries: “Surely if jobs are at risk it means it’s not good for the economy with less tax being pumped into the system, shouldn’t the Government intervene to protect the citizens?”James answers:“Generally, new technologies haven’t meant fewer jobs over the long run, but there is an active debate over whether taxpaying human jobs should be protected in the short term to minimise disruption to individual livelihoods.“One proposal, that has been supported by Bill Gates and others, is to tax robots and AI in the same way we do humans. In theory, this would level the playing field, putting humans at less of an advantage.“In practice, it’s hard to define AI, and even harder to tax it. But if millions of humans are rendered redundant, governments will have to find a way to adapt. Higher taxes on wealth or on corporate profits to fund a universal basic income are among the ideas that have been mooted.”




Jobs safe from AI that pay the highest salaries



Jane Pourtney’s question is: “To what extent are A level and university essay questions being redesigned to overcome AI assistance?”Here’s what our experts says:“One of the first clear impacts of ChatGPT has been a cheating epidemic. Thousands of students have turned in essays and homework generated by the system, leading some schools and universities to ban the software. “Others have turned to anti-cheating tools designed to check if something has been written by AI, although many produce errors, leading students who have written their own work being falsely accused of cheating.“Teachers seem to be gradually adapting, rather than resisting, however. Some are moving essay writing to the classroom, where students cannot use ChatGPT. Others are allowing students to use the software, but adding interviews to show that students understand the subject. “The latter might prove more useful: like calculators and spell check, students are likely to continue using AI in the world of work.”Another reader, Charlie Jones, asks: “If you were a teenager soon to be making choices for university and future career, what would you seek or avoid with AI in mind?”James replies: “This is a great question. The instinctual answer is computer science or maths: if AI is going to replace jobs, it seems a safe bet that at least the people developing it will be in employment. “Any skilled physical job is likely to be in demand for some time: while software has come on in leaps and bounds, robots remain a challenge. Lawyers will have no shortage of work either, judging by the frequent lawsuits against AI companies from people who say they have been libelled or had their data stolen.“With some exceptions, however, many of today’s jobs are still likely to exist, just in different forms. AI is a tool that still requires human intervention.”A question from Joe Jackson: “Should we consider films based on tech, such as Will Smith in I, Robot being a very possible reality within the next 50 years?”James answers: “Probably not. Hollywood movies such as The Terminator have done a good job of entertaining us but a pretty poor job of educating us about an AI future. For example, they often give AI human qualities - a lust for power - that we have no evidence they possess.“50 years is a long time frame, and AI will undoubtedly make huge advances over the decades. “We should certainly be wary of the risks - but the most risky scenarios to do with AI are probably about humans incorrectly deploying them in areas like weapons systems than the typical Hollywood examples of a race of robots enslaving humans.”Peter Mitchell asks: “Will AI be able to replace customer service operators?”Our expert replies:“This is something that is already happening. Go on many websites today and you’ll find yourself talking to an AI bot, rather than a human operator. Energy provider Octopus, for example, says that customers actually prefer communicating with AI than staff.“AI is unlikely to be able to answer all queries for many years, but the number of cases it can deal with are likely to gradually increase until it is handling the majority of customer service issues. “For now, AI is better at answering chats and emails than phone calls, but voice recognition and replication technology means that is changing too, although some people may find it uncanny.”Finally, reader Peo Rakata would like some advice: “As a finance and banking professional, how can one adapt to the new AI environment to avoid retrenchment?”In response, James says:“It is hard to predict, but the white collar jobs that are probably most at risk from artificial intelligence are those in repetitive or data-intensive tasks: data entry and analysis, compliance, and so on. Those that involve a lot of personal interaction are less likely to be affected. That is probably the case from finance to a lot of other office-based jobs.“These changes tend to happen relatively gradually though, and employers often find new jobs for their workers. Computers and the internet have changed offices hugely, but we still have just as many people employed in them, even though we have fewer typists and secretaries.”Do you have a question about AI?

LinkedIn has introduced a new feature for premium users that uses generative AI to help jobseekers find new roles.The social media platform, owned by Microsoft, debuted the AI chatbot, which is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, to a subset of US-based premium career members on 1 November 2023. LinkedIn said the AI tool will leverage a knowledge graph based on data from its 1 billion members and 67 million employers to provide users with advice on how they can tailor their profile to make applications more successful and evaluate whether or not they are a good fit for roles.The AI will also analyze a user’s posts on their feed and suggest relevant opportunities that users may have missed in their search. LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProVP of Engineering Lei Yan said the target for the new tool is for job seekers to receive a bespoke experience tailored to their sector and skills,""We’re transforming the job seeking experience for our Premium subscribers to be more personalized, efficient, and adaptive with the help of AI. Premium subscribers will also see personalized takeaways and insights on posts and articles in their feed to help them build professional knowledge and stay up to date in their domain.”The new chatbot follows the integration of several AI features on the social networking platform in recent months. In May 2023, the firm introduced a raft of AI enhancements such as automatically generated, personalized recruiter messages, AI-enhanced job descriptions, and a profile building service.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

DOWNLOAD NOWThe system, trained on the hiring patterns from the previous 10 years, was observed to be recreating the gender-based inequalities that existed in the company’s previous recruitment cycles. Recent research has shown racial bias, in addition to gender-based inequality, remains a pervasive issue in tech recruitment, suggesting AI systems trained on currently available datasets are likely to reflect this bias, and may even amplify it.The potential for AI to address employment inequalitiesYet AI’s impact on labor market inequalities has the potential to be a positive one if applied in specific ways. This is the argument of the founder and chief executive of Melbourne-based startup Sapia.ai, Barb Hyman.The hiring automation service interviews thousands of candidates simultaneously via text chat, which removes many of the factors that might influence an AI or human in charge of recruitment, claimed Hyman when speaking to The Guardian in March 2023. “The only way to remove bias in hiring is to not use people right at the first gate,” Hyman says. “That’s where our technology comes in: it’s blind; it’s untimed, it doesn’t use resume data or your social media data or demographic data. All it is using is the text results.”

Generative AI ethics: 8 biggest concerns and risks


Under the radar for decades, generative AI is upending business models and forcing ethical issues like customer privacy, brand integrity and worker displacement to the forefront.

George Lawton



Published: 01 Nov 2023


 
Like other forms of AI, generative AI can influence a number of ethical issues and risks surrounding data privacy, security, policies and workforces. Generative AI technology can also potentially produce a series of new business risks like misinformation, plagiarism, copyright infringements and harmful content. Lack of transparency and the potential for worker displacement are additional issues that enterprises may need to address.







""Many of the risks posed by generative AI … are enhanced and more concerning than others,"" said Tad Roselund, managing director and senior partner at consultancy BCG. Those risks require a comprehensive approach, including a clearly defined strategy, good governance and a commitment to responsible AI. A corporate culture that embraces generative AI ethics must consider eight important issues.

1. Distribution of harmful content
AI systems can create content automatically based on text prompts by humans. ""These systems can generate enormous productivity improvements, but they can also be used for harm, either intentional or unintentional,"" explained Bret Greenstein, partner, cloud and digital analytics insights, at professional services consultancy PwC. An AI-generated email sent on behalf of the company, for example, could inadvertently contain offensive language or issue harmful guidance to employees. Generative AI should be used to augment, not replace humans or processes, Greenstein advised, to ensure content meets the company's ethical expectations and supports its brand values.


2. Copyright and legal exposure
Popular generative AI tools are trained on massive image and text databases from multiple sources, including the internet. When these tools create images or generate lines of code, the data's source could be unknown, which can be problematic for a bank handling financial transactions or pharmaceutical company relying on a formula for a complex molecule in a drug. Reputational and financial risks could also be massive if one company's product is based on another company's intellectual property. ""Companies must look to validate outputs from the models,"" Roselund advised, ""until legal precedents provide clarity around IP and copyright challenges.""

Businesses are scrambling to maximize the benefits of today's generative AI while wrestling with inherent ethical issues.







3. Data privacy violations
Generative AI large language models (LLMs) are trained on data sets that sometimes include personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals. This data can sometimes be elicited with a simple text prompt, noted Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute. And compared to traditional search engines, it can be more difficult for a consumer to locate and request removal of the information. Companies that build or fine-tune LLMs must ensure that PII isn't embedded in the language models and that it's easy to remove PII from these models in compliance with privacy laws.


4. Sensitive information disclosure
Generative AI is democratizing AI capabilities and making them more accessible. This combination of democratization and accessibility, Roselund said, could potentially lead to a medical researcher inadvertently disclosing sensitive patient information or a consumer brand unwittingly exposing its product strategy to a third party. The consequences of unintended incidents like these could irrevocably breach patient or customer trust and carry legal ramifications. Roselund recommended that companies institute clear guidelines, governance and effective communication from the top down, emphasizing shared responsibility for safeguarding sensitive information, protected data and IP.


5. Amplification of existing bias
Generative AI can potentially amplify existing biases -- for example, bias can be found in data used for training LLMs outside the control of companies that use these language models for specific applications. It's important for companies working on AI to have diverse leaders and subject matter experts to help identify unconscious bias in data and models, Greenstein said.








6. Workforce roles and morale
AI can do a lot more of the daily tasks that knowledge workers do, including writing, coding, content creation, summarization and analysis, said Greenstein. Although worker displacement and replacement have been ongoing since the first AI and automation tools were deployed, the pace has accelerated as a result of the innovations in generative AI technologies. ""The future of work itself is changing,"" Greenstein added, ""and the most ethical companies are investing in this [change].""
Ethical responses have included investments in preparing certain parts of the workforce for the new roles created by generative AI applications. Businesses, for example, will need to help employees develop generative AI skills such as prompt engineering. ""The truly existential ethical challenge for adoption of generative AI is its impact on organizational design, work and ultimately on individual workers,"" said Nick Kramer, vice president of applied solutions at consultancy SSA & Company. ""This will not only minimize the negative impacts, but it will also prepare the companies for growth.""


7. Data provenance
Generative AI systems consume tremendous volumes of data that could be inadequately governed, of questionable origin, used without consent or contain bias. Additional levels of inaccuracy can be amplified by social influencers or the AI systems themselves.
""The accuracy of a generative AI system depends on the corpus of data it uses and its provenance,"" explained Scott Zoldi, chief analytics officer at credit scoring services company FICO. ""ChatGPT-4 is mining the internet for data, and a lot of it is truly garbage, presenting a basic accuracy problem on answers to questions to which we don't know the answer."" FICO, according to Zoldi, has been using generative AI for more than a decade to simulate edge cases in training fraud detection algorithms. The generated data is always labeled as synthetic data so Zoldi's team knows where the data is allowed to be used. ""We treat it as walled-off data for the purposes of test and simulation only,"" he said. ""Synthetic data produced by generative AI does not inform the model going forward in the future. We contain this generative asset and do not allow it 'out in the wild.'""





8. Lack of explainability and interpretability
Many generative AI systems group facts together probabilistically, going back to the way AI has learned to associate data elements with one another, Zoldi explained. But these details aren't always revealed when using applications like ChatGPT. Consequently, data trustworthiness is called into question.
When interrogating generative AI, analysts expect to arrive at a causal explanation for outcomes. But machine learning models and generative AI search for correlations, not causality. ""That's where we humans need to insist on model interpretability -- the reason why the model gave the answer it did,"" Zoldi said. ""And truly understand if an answer is a plausible explanation versus taking the outcome at face value.""
Until that level of trustworthiness can be achieved, generative AI systems should not be relied upon to provide answers that could significantly affect lives and livelihoods.

IntroductionOccupation is a major component of adult life and is an important determinant of overall health. Workers are exposed to negative conditions such as prolonged sitting, stress, and chemical and physical agents including diesel engine exhaust and asbestos1. Such occupational exposures globally account for 2.8% of deaths and 3.2% of disability-adjusted life years from all causes2. For example, about 26% of low back pain has been estimated to be work-related and 3.2% to 4.6% of all cancer deaths are due to occupational exposure. Occupational epidemiological studies that assess exposure-response associations fuel interventions to promote workers’ health. Such studies rely on high-quality exposure assessments to secure correct or unbiased results3.Occupational data in population-based cohorts is collected from respondents via open-ended surveys where they report their job title as they know it in a free-text format4. Subsequently, Job-Exposure Matrices (JEMs) can be used to assign a wide range of exposures to occupations5. A JEM comprises of estimated probabilities and intensities of exposure to harmful agents by standardized occupational titles and industries. Through the use of occupational and industry classification systems, free-text job descriptions are translated into such standardized occupational titles and industries6.Occupational coding is performed manually by expert coders. To ensure high quality and consistency of coding, documentation, procedures, and training are provided4. Nevertheless, consistent coding of job descriptions remains challenging, given the large number of different outcome categories. After three months of extensive coding and training, the coding efficiency of an expert coder can reach ~2700 codes per month7. Furthermore, because of the repetitive nature of the task, prolonged occupational coding sessions result in reduced coding accuracy due to fatigue. Hence, given the large scale of many occupational epidemiological cohorts, multiple expert coders need to be deployed. This introduces a 44–89% inter-coder reliability range for the most detailed coding level8, with more recent studies reporting ranges between 42–71%9,10,11,12.Tools have been developed to support manual assignment of occupational codes to job descriptions13,14. Additionally, tools have been developed that enable completely automatic coding, achieving a prediction accuracy ranging 15–64% on the highest coding level with an out-of-distribution accuracy ranging 17–26% (see Table 1)10,15,16,17,18,19,20. Although some coding tools achieve a human-coder level prediction accuracy, their exposure assessment accuracy may be lower. Research on automatic coding tools reports inter-coder reliability of 51% with an exposure assessment Cohen’s Kappa score between 0.4–0.87. However, a separate study reports higher minimum human exposure assessment Cohen’s Kappa ranges between 0.66 and 0.84 with only 36–50% inter-coder reliability21. Hence, human intervention is required during or after the automatic coding process to ensure reliable exposure assessment. However, current (semi-)automatic coding tools either lack the implementation of machine learning techniques, which are essential for achieving human-level prediction accuracy16,22 or are limited to one national occupational coding classification system10. This implies that only JEMs using these national classifications can be applied, limiting the use of these tools in global exposure assessment studies requiring other classifications. Consequently, we developed, tested, and validated OPERAS, a decision support system for epidemiological job coding that utilizes ML-based classification models for four (inter)national classification systems. Its goal is to support expert coders during occupational coding through both automatic coding as well as decision support through code suggestions. Our evaluation shows that OPERAS outperforms existing automatic coding tools and expert coders, leading to a substantial workload reduction and highly accurate exposure assessment.Table 1 Supported occupational classification(s), applied classification algorithm, and accuracy (%) of the currently available automatic occupational coding tools.Full size tableMethodsOPERAS has been developed via six phases. First, we acquired datasets and identified classification performance barriers. Additionally, we specify the origin, available input classes, and used occupational classification systems. Second, to enable complete code suggestions, we removed missing and incomplete codes during data preparation. Furthermore, to ensure optimal classification performance, we reduced the dimensionality and retained crucial information of the free-text job descriptions through multiple Natural Languange Processing (NLP) techniques. Third, using state-of-the-art gradient tree boosting, we trained the classification models. We optimized for generalizability by using pre-defined parameter settings and the inclusion of generally described job descriptions from the coding index in the training set. Fourth, using prediction accuracy and Cohen’s kappa, we evaluated the classification models on their classification performance and present its impact on the occupational coding process. Fifth, based on two occupational inter-coder reliability studies, we compared OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability to expert coders. Sixth, using four JEMs, we evaluated the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models on their exposure assessment for two groups: 1) all individuals, and 2) exposed individuals. In the following subsections, each phase will be explained in detail.DatasetsUsing French23, Asian24, and Dutch25 datasets, we developed OPERAS’ classification models. These datasets respectively contain French, English, and Dutch manually expert-coded free-text job descriptions in four hierarchically structured occupational/activity sector coding classifications. Each classification consists of multiple numbers and/or letters (e.g., “211A”) where each added (combination of) character(s) provides additional detail about the job description. For example, the major, sub-major, minor, and unit groups of the ISCO-88 code “2221” are “Professionals” (2), “Life Sciences and Health Professionals” (22), “Health Professionals” (222), and “Medical Doctors” (2221), respectively. For insufficiently detailed job descriptions the expert coder will replace not codable levels with a pre-defined character (e.g., “#”). In the following paragraphs, each dataset and coding classification will be further described. The descriptive statistics of each dataset can be found in Tables 2 and 3.Table 2 Descriptive statistics of viable entries from the Constances, AsiaLymph and Lifework datasets (IQR = interquartile range).Full size tableTable 3 Minimum, 25%, 50%, 75% quantiles, and maximum word count of job descriptions per input class for AsiaLymph, Constances, and Lifework datasets.Full size tableConstances is a general-purpose cohort of French adults aged 18–69 with a focus on occupational and environmental factors23. The dataset contains free-text answers to open-ended questions regarding participants’ occupations held and sector of activity. This information was manually coded into the French Nomenclature d’Activités Française (NAF)2008 and Professions et Catégories Socioprofessionnelles (PCS)2003 classifications by expert coders using a dedicated application showing the entire summary of a participant’s occupational history26. Here, a NAF code describes one’s activity sector and consists of four digits and one letter (e.g., “4231A”), whereas a PCS code describes occupation and consists of three digits and a letter (e.g., “211A”). The Constances cohort has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the French Institute of Medical Research and Health, the “Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés”, and the “Conseil National de l’Information Statistique”. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Access and permission to reuse the restricted data for the current study were provided by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of the original study.The AsiaLymph dataset is a hospital-based case-control study of lymphoma among Chinese in Eastern Asia24. This dataset contains free-text traditional and simplified Chinese occupations, tasks, employers, and products that were translated into English. They were manually coded using the International Standard Classifications of Occupation (ISCO)-88 coding classification, which consists of four hierarchical levels of detail, each represented with a number (e.g., “4521”). The occupational data were independently coded by two study centers, where discordant codes were resolved by a third expert coder. The AsiaLymph study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the four participating sites, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Access and permission to reuse the restricted data in the current study were provided by the PIs of the original study.The Lifework cohort is a large federated prospective cohort from the Netherlands that quantifies the health effects of occupational and environmental exposure25. The dataset includes job names, descriptions, and company types that were manually coded into ISCO-68 occupational codes, which is an earlier version of ISCO-88. This version has an additional level of detail to describe a job description (e.g., “1-21.10”). Contrastingly, instead of supplemented incomplete codes, only the levels that can be coded are given (e.g., “1-21” instead of “1-21.##”). The coding was performed by expert coders, where uncertain initial codes were resolved by a second expert coder (see manual coding procedures in the Supplementary Methods). The Lifework cohort and contributing subcohorts were reviewed and approved by the committee at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the committee at TNO (Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research) Nutrition and Food Research, and the committee at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Participants signed an informed consent form for each subcohort prior to enrolment. Access and permission to reuse the restricted data in the current study were provided by the steering group of the Lifework study.Data preparationThe Constances, Asialymph, and Lifework datasets contain 637,148, 36,179, and 12,120 entries, respectively. To ensure complete code suggestions, entries with incomplete codes were considered nonviable for classification model training. After data cleaning, 281,418, 483,090, 36,007, and 12,007 viable entries remained to train the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 models, respectively. A large number of incomplete NAF and PCS entries were removed using this strategy due to the insufficiently detailed descriptions before occupational coding. However, this was warranted as it ensures optimal decision support during the occupational coding process through complete code suggestions.As all data were collected in an open-ended format, tokenizing, removing punctuation marks, converting all input to lowercase, and stemming all words to their root form allowed for the reduction of the random noise and dimensionality of the data27. Compared to other automatic text-classification systems, we noticed a low word count of the descriptions, and high variability between descriptions of the same occupation27,28,29. Hence, to allow for the retention of important information and similar representation of similar job descriptions, we embedded all descriptions into numerical feature vectors using sentence embedding30. Sentence embeddings are fixed-length vector representations of sentences that allow for comparison and computation with other sentences. These embedders have been trained on large corpora of textual data to learn highly generic semantic relations between sentences. The goal is to encode the sentence so that similar sentences (in terms of meaning) are close in the embedding space, and dissimilar sentences are far apart. In the current context, this would result in similar job descriptions being represented as such. When multiple input classes per occupational code were required for classification model training (e.g., job description and sector), we summed the resulting feature vectors to combine all information31. To increase the generalizability of the models, we randomly split up the prepared data from each dataset into a training (60%), test (30%), and validation (10%) set, and supplemented the training set of each occupational classification with job descriptions from their respective coding indexes.As classification models tend to overly represent majority classes, the class sizes of the outcome categories should be balanced32. However, algorithms that synthetically provide data balance could not be applied to the current datasets due to the difference in class size being too large33,34. Oversampling algorithms could not compute synthetic samples due to the minority classes having too few samples. Contrastingly, undersampling resulted in the loss of too much information due to the majority classes being reduced to only a few samples.Classification model trainingUsing the state-of-the-art gradient tree boosting algorithm XGBoost, we developed the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models35 (see Fig. 1). We chose this algorithm due to a study performed by Schierholz and Schonlau22, where multiple Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were evaluated on their classification performance based on five occupational datasets. They found that, when the training data was supplemented with the job descriptions from the coding index, the XGBoost algorithm performed best.Fig. 1: Flowchart of the data preparation and training strategy of OPERAS’ classification models.An arbitrary example (i.e., “Service Employee.” and “Electronic Retail.'') of two input classes (i.e., job description and sector) of the same entry in an occupational database is given.Full size imageXGBoost generates an ensemble of weak Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs) and combines their predictions to produce a strong, accurate model35. The model is trained by minimizing a regularized objective function, which includes a loss function to measure the error between the target class (i.e., the ‘gold-standard’ occupational code), and a regularization term to prevent overfitting. For multi-class problems such as the current one, XGBoost builds a binary outcome ensemble for each class. The ensemble is trained in an additive manner, where a new CART is added to the ensemble in each iteration to fit the residual errors of the previous iteration. Furthermore, XGBoost uses several techniques to prevent overfitting, such as the addition of the regularization term, subsampling of training data and columns, and the penalization of large weights. These strategies can be fine-tuned using several adjustable hyperparameters. A more extensive description of the algorithm and its hyperparameters can be found in the Supplementary Methods and in the original paper from Chen and Guestrin35.Schierholz and Schonlau22 empirically optimized the hyperparameters for the largest occupational dataset and proposed a default setting. As the datasets used in ref. 22 are similar to the current datasets in terms of data collection (i.e., free-text job descriptions), (number of) outcome categories (i.e., occupational codes), and average word count, we expected similar relative performance when the proposed default set of hyperparameters is used in the current study36. Following the instructions from Schierholz and Schonlau22 we have set lower values for η and max_depth for optimal classification performance. Hence, we adopted and used the following hyperparameter settings for the development of each classification model: Early stopping if performance does not improve for 1 round, η = 0.6, max_delta_step = 1, max_depth = 20, γ = 1.5, λ = 1e−4, min_child_weight = 0, subsample = 0.75, colsample_by_tree = 1, and colsample_by_level = 1.We trained the NAF, PCS, and ISCO-68 classification models in the original language of the corresponding dataset, whereas we trained the ISCO-88 model using its English translation. Here, the classification models were solely trained using the training data. The validation set was used during training to allow for early stopping of training to reduce the chance of overfitting37. We performed feature selection to find the combination of input classes that yield the best predictive performance for each dataset. Here, we used an exhaustive wrapper approach, where a classification model is trained for each combination of input classes in a dataset and evaluated to find the combination which provides the best predictive performance38. Using exclusively the test set, we measured the performance of the classification models.Evaluation metricsUsing the entries in the test set of the corresponding datasets, we assessed the accuracy and inter-coder reliability of OPERAS’ classification models using accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa (κ), respectively. Here, we consider the manually expert-coded job descriptions from the aforementioned datasets as the gold standard.We deem accuracy to be an important metric in the current study, as it indicates the proportion of occupational codes which will potentially require less coding time during the occupational coding process. We define accuracy as the number of correctly predicted codes relative to the total number of predicted codes39,40.$$Accuracy\,(\%) =\frac{{Number\,of\,correct\,predictions}}{{Total\,number\,of\,predictions}} \times 100\%$$
                    (1)
                For each classification model, we computed the accuracy per code level and major occupational group.Since OPERAS autonomously codes the entries from the test set, it can be considered an (automatic) coder. Hence, OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability can be calculated using κ, which takes into account the correct prediction occurring by chance. This is defined as:$$({P}_{o}-{P}_{e})/(1-{P}_{e}),$$
                    (2)
                where Po represents the probability of overall agreement over the label assignments between the classifier and true process. Pe represents the chance agreement over the labels. This is defined as the sum of the proportion of examples assigned to a class times the proportion of true labels of that class in the dataset41.OPERAS contains a feature to automatically process predicted codes with a confidence score above a pre-defined threshold. This confidence score is obtained through XGBoost’s class probability prediction function35. As little to no time will be spent reviewing the codes above the threshold, we grouped predicted codes based on their confidence score in intervals of 5% ranging from 0% to 100% and evaluated the accuracy of each group. Here, we estimate a minimum workload reduction by correcting the automatically processed codes above a threshold for the percentage of correct codes.Human-model cross-validationWe compared OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability to two occupational inter-coder reliability studies9,11. Maaz et al.9 studied the inter-coder reliability of two professional coding institutions and two in-house expert-coders in Germany. Here, the self-reported occupations of 300 students’ mother and father were coded (2 × n = 300) into ISCO-88 codes, resulting in n = 12 coder pairs. They found mean inter-coder reliability (in κ) on the first, second, third, and fourth coding level of 0.71 (range: 0.68–0.76; SD = 0.04), 0.66 (range: 0.63–0.72; SD = 0.03), 0.57 (range: 0.53–0.63; SD = 0.04), and 0.51 (range: 0.48–0.57; SD = 0.03), respectively. Similar results were found in Massing et al.11 where occupational data from a German social survey (n = 5,130) and a German field test for adult competencies (n = 4, 159) (ALLBUS and PIAAC) were separately coded into ISCO-08 by three and two agencies, respectively. This resulted in n = 4 coder pairs, where they found mean inter-coder reliability (in κ) of 0.65 (range: 0.59–0.70; SD = 0.03), 0.60 (range: 0.56–0.65; SD = 0.02), 0.53 (range: 0.46–0.59; SD = 0.03), and 0.46 (range: 0.40–0.55; SD = 0.04), on the same coding levels, respectively.Using an independent sample t-test, we compared the mean inter-coder reliability of each coder pair from these studies to OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability on all coding levels. Here, we provide a two-sided p value where the statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05. To account for the difference in coding levels and to ensure a fair comparison, we used coding levels 2-5 for the NAF classification model. Given the small sample size, we report the effect sizes in Hedges g42.Exposure assessment evaluationUsing the Formaldehyde-JEM43 and Silica-JEM44, we evaluated the exposure assessment accuracy and κ for the NAF and PCS classification models. For the ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models, we performed the exposure assessment evaluation using the ALOHA-JEM45 and DOM-JEM46, respectively.We performed the evaluation for two groups, 1) all individuals and 2) exposed individuals. For the first group, we calculated the accuracy using all individuals in the test set. For the second group, we only included job episodes in the evaluation that were deemed exposed according to the gold-standard expert codes. For each JEM, we considered an episode exposed if the total exposure level is higher than 0. This was done to account for the chance level of a non-exposure assignment being substantially higher given the many occupational codes in the JEM resulting in no exposure. Furthermore, assigning an exposed individual a not-exposed status often has the largest effect on the following epidemiological study. Hence, performing an evaluation for this group will give more insight into the applicability of these classification models in real-world scenarios. The accuracy and κ in both groups are calculated using Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) respectively. Additionally, we grouped the predicted exposure assessments on the confidence score of the original code in intervals of 5% ranging from 0% to 100% and evaluated the accuracy of each group. To resemble OPERAS’ real-world usage of the automatic coding function, we used the minimum confidence score of the NAF or PCS code for the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM. In the following sections, we provide additional information on the content and application of the JEMs.Formaldehyde-JEMThe Formaldehyde-JEM has been developed by “Santé Publique France” (the French National Health Surveillance Agency), as part of its “Matgéné” program to assess formaldehyde exposure in the French population43. It has been developed by a team of occupational experts through a meta-analysis of 469 scientific, medical, and technical sources. This resulted in a matrix evaluating formaldehyde exposure based on occupational history describing occupation, sector, and corresponding dates between 1950 and 2018. The occupational history was coded using the NAF2008 and PCS2003 and provides three exposure indices for each combination: the probability of exposure, the intensity of exposure, and the frequency of exposure. These respectively refer to the percentage of exposed workers, the mean exposure dose during tasks, and the percentage of working time performing tasks with exposure. Additionally, exposure indices are provided for different calendar periods to account for variations due to changes in exposure over time. As this study concerned a meta-review, no approval by an Institutional Review Board was needed.We applied the Formaldehyde-JEM to the gold standard manually coded NAF and PCS codes and OPERAS’ predictions to obtain the formaldehyde exposure for each job episode. This is obtained by multiplying the probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure. We used these to calculate the exposure assessment accuracy of OPERAS’ NAF and PCS classification models. Further, after applying a JEM to manually coded occupational codes stemming from the same job activity, similar exposure levels are expected47. Here, even unequal exposure levels from these codes are still considered relevant for subsequent occupational epidemiological studies. Hence, to assess OPERAS’ performance in such real-world exposure assessment scenarios, we also performed the evaluation using a dichotomous status of ’exposed’ or ’not exposed’. Further, we measured the rank correlation between the formaldehyde exposure levels of gold-standard manual coding and OPERAS’ coding using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (τ)48.Silica-JEMThe Silica-JEM assesses the crystalline silica exposure in the French population44. Similar to the Formaldehyde-JEM, it has been developed by a team of occupational experts from “Santé Publique France”, as part of its “Matgéné” program through a meta-analysis of 469 scientific, medical, and technical sources. This resulted in a matrix evaluating exposure to crystalline silica based on occupational histories describing occupation, sector, and corresponding dates between 1947 and 2007. Similar exposure indices, namely the probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure are provided for each combination of NAF2008 and PCS2003 codes for different calendar periods. As this study concerned a meta-review, no approval by an Institutional Review Board was needed.For each job episode, we applied the Silica-JEM to the gold standard manually coded and OPERAS-predicted NAF and PCS codes. To obtain the total exposure, we multiplied the probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure and used this to calculate the exposure assessment accuracy. Here, we also calculated the accuracy and κ for the dichotomous ’exposed’ or ’not exposed’ status and calculated τ for the silica exposure levels.ALOHA-JEMThe ALOHA-JEM has been developed for a study assessing the association of occupational exposure and symptoms of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary ventilatory defects in a general population-based study of five areas in Spain45. Subjects completed a respiratory questionnaire on symptoms and occupation and underwent baseline spirometry. Based on expert knowledge, The JEM was developed ad hoc by two occupational experts. It contains a job axis, and an exposure estimate for 12 generic industrial exposures, namely: biological dust, mineral dust, gas fumes, VGDF (i.e., vapors, gases, dust, and fumes), all pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents, other types of solvents, and metals. Exposure estimates for each aforementioned exposure can be obtained for all ISCO-88 codes. Here, three levels of exposure can be assigned, namely 0: no exposure, 1: low exposure, and 2: high exposure. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating centers. All patients gave written informed consent.For each gold standard manually coded and OPERAS-predicted ISCO-88 code, we applied the ALOHA-JEM to obtain a level of exposure for each aforementioned exposure. Here, we deemed OPERAS’ exposure assessment correct if all exposures matched this gold standard for each job episode. Consequently, if a single exposure level is inaccurate, it will deem the entire exposure assessment incorrect. This provides a baseline measure of performance. To allow for the evaluation and comparison of single exposures, we calculated accuracy and κ individually for each exposure. Additionally, we calculated accuracy per exposure level for each exposure in the JEM.DOM-JEMThe DOM-JEM has been developed for the assessment of the inter-method reliability of retrospective exposure assessment related to occupational carcinogens46. Based on a multi-center lung cancer case-control study conducted in seven European countries, it contains estimations of nine related exposures for each ISCO-68 code. These are asbestos, chromium, DME, nickel, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), silica, animals, biological dust, and endotoxin. The DOM-JEM has been developed based on expert knowledge by three independent occupational exposure experts assigning exposure levels to each manually coded ISCO-68 code from the original study. Similar to the ALOHA-JEM, exposure levels ranging 0–2 were used, respectively signifying no exposure, low exposure, and high exposure. This study was approved by the ethics review board of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Informed consent was obtained for all participants.We applied the DOM-JEM to the gold standard manually and OPERAS-predicted ISCO-68 codes to obtain a level of exposure for each exposure in the DOM-JEM. Here, we deemed OPERAS’ exposure assessment correct if it matched the gold standard for all exposures. Similar to the evaluation conducted with the ALOHA-JEM, we determined overall accuracy and κ for each exposure and computed accuracy per exposure level.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Ethics statementSince the datasets used in the current study do not contain any information that could be used to identify a person, ethical review from an Institutional Review Board was not required.ResultsAfter data cleaning, 281,418 (Constances)23, 483,090 (Constances), 36,007 (Asialymph)24, and 12,007 (Lifework)25 entries were available to train NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models, respectively. Additionally, using the Formaldehyde-JEM (NAF&PCS)43, Silica-JEM (NAF&PCS)44, ALOHA-JEM (ISCO-88)45 and DOM-JEM (ISCO-68)46 exposure assessment evaluation was conducted (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). This evaluation was conducted for two groups: all individuals, providing OPERAS’ performance in real-world exposure assessment scenarios, and exposed individuals, to account for the chance level of a non-exposure assignment being substantially higher.Using the expert codes as the gold standard, we used prediction accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa (κ) as evaluation metrics (see Table 4 and Supplementary Tables S3-S6). Additionally, OPERAS provides a confidence score indicating the probability of correctness of a suggested code for each prediction. This is used to interpret the quality and usefulness of a classification model (see Fig. 2).Table 4 Per coding level (CL), the outcome categories (OC), accuracy (Acc., %), and inter-coder reliability (Cohen’s Kappa, κ) are given for the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models.Full size tableFig. 2: Confidence score distribution and accuracy of the classification performance and exposure assessment evaluation.The proportion (%) of codes in a confidence score interval is denoted by the bars in the histogram. The mean accuracy (%) and standard deviation of codes (n = 4 independent accuracy scores) in an interval are respectively represented by the dotted and vertical lines in the continuous graph. Here, the dots denote the individual accuracy of each classification model in an interval. The grey area represents the accuracy range over the intervals. Colors correspond to the different classification models. a Results of the classification performance evaluation. b Results of the exposure assessment evaluation of all individuals and c exposed individuals.Full size imageModel evaluationNAF and PCS use Constances’ input-classes occupation and sector with an accuracy per major occupational group ranging between 52.17–95.91% and 32.45–90.56%, respectively. 57.41% of the suggested NAF codes have a confidence score in the 95–100% range, with an accuracy of 97.02%. 43.11% of the suggested PCS codes are within this range, with 94.47% correctly predicted. Using the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, exposure assessment for all individuals gave 98.09% (κ = 0.84) and 98.41% (κ = 0.67) accuracy, respectively. Here, 31.28% of the suggested codes had a 95–100% minimum confidence score for both the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, with 99.32% and 99.77% accurate exposure assessment, respectively. Evaluation for the dichotomous ‘exposed’ or ‘not exposed’ status for this group gave 98.30% (κ = 0.85) and 98.51% (κ = 0.68) accurate exposure assessment for the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, respectively. Kendall rank correlation for the exposure levels of the same JEMs respectively was τ = 0.85 (p < 0.01) and 0.68 (p < 0.01). For exposed individuals (6.30% and 2.58% of job episodes, respectively), exposure assessment using the same JEMs respectively gave 81.85% (κ = 0.81) and 61.82% (κ = 0.61) accuracy. 54.22% and 20.27% of these codes had a 95–100% confidence score, of which 98.59% and 93.33% had correct exposure assessment, respectively. Here, the dichotomous evaluation resulted in 85.18% and 65.54% accurate exposure assessment for the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM, respectively.ISCO-88 uses Asialymph’s input-classes occupation, task, employer, and product with an accuracy per major occupational group ranging between 63.53–96.11%. 21.54% of the predicted codes have a confidence score in the 95–100% range, with 94.57% accuracy. Using the ALOHA-JEM, exposure assessment for all individuals gave 75.05% accuracy (range: 83.69–98.03%) and κ = 0.70, where 21.54% of the suggested codes had a 95–100% confidence score with 97.68% correct exposure assessment. For the exposed individuals (62.53% of job episodes), exposure assessment gave 65.58% (range: 57.12–87.68%) accuracy, κ = 0.63, with 22.35% of the suggested codes having a 95–100% confidence score, where 96.88% had a correct exposure assessment.ISCO-68 uses Lifework’s job name input-class, where the accuracy per major occupational group ranged 53.58–80.67%. 20.65% of the suggested codes have a 95–100% confidence score, with a 95.38% correct prediction. Using the DOM-JEM, exposure assessment for all participants gave 84.19% accuracy (range: 91.84–98.90%) and κ = 0.59 where 20.65% of the suggested codes had a 95–100% confidence score, with 99.32% correct exposure assessment. For the exposed individuals (24.54% of job episodes), exposure assessment gave 49.97% (range: 25.00–59.71%) accuracy and κ = 0.46, with 17.98% of the suggested codes having a 95–100% confidence score and 98.11% correct exposure assessment.Human-model cross-validationHuman inter-coder reliability studies including coder pair level inter-coder reliabilities report ranges (in κ) of 0.51–0.719 and 0.46–0.6511. We compared this to OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability (see Table 4).The Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality and Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances reveal that all coding levels are normally distributed, where coding levels 3 and 4 do not have equal variances across groups. Hence, to compare OPERAS’ inter-coder reliability to the aforementioned human inter-coder reliability studies we use the independent sample t-test while correcting for the inequality of variances of coding levels 3 and 4. We find that OPERAS significantly outperforms expert coders on all coding levels (see Table 5).Table 5 Per coding level (CL*) the mean, range, standard deviation (SD), and comparison (including Hedges g) of expert coders (N = 16) with OPERAS (N = 4) are given.Full size tableHuman workload reductionOPERAS improves the efficiency of the occupational coding process by enabling the automated processing of codes with a confidence score above a custom threshold. Figure 2 shows the confidence score distribution of the NAF, PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models in intervals of 5%, ranging from 0% to 100%. The (mean) prediction accuracy within each interval is also displayed.An estimated minimum workload reduction can be calculated through the percentage of automatically coded job descriptions above a threshold while correcting for incorrectly coded job descriptions. Given a confidence score threshold of 95% for the NAF, which has 57.4% of the suggested codes above this threshold of which 97.0% are correct, a minimum workload reduction of 55.7% (57.41 × 0.9702) could be realized. Although the overall prediction accuracy of the PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models is lower, their accuracy within the 95–100% confidence score interval remains similar. Hence, given the same confidence score threshold, a minimum workload reduction of 40.7%, 20.4%, and 19.7% could be realized using OPERAS’ PCS, ISCO-88, and ISCO-68 classification models, respectively.DiscussionTo build robust generic classification models, we refrained from tweaking hyperparameter settings. Instead, we used default values and included generalized job descriptions from the coding indexes in the training data22. This provided us with a good baseline performance that can be expected to generalize to other datasets36. Further, OPERAS proposes a limited set of probable codes for similar job descriptions. This holds the potential for improved inter-coder reliability among expert coders utilizing OPERAS13, which can contribute to the occupational coding process’ robustness. Moreover, OPERAS’ adaptable automatic coding can enable a substantial workload reduction for a wide range of applications. For example, the default 95% confidence score threshold could be lowered to increase workload reduction for applications that are tolerant to less accurate codes or solely require high accuracy on lower coding levels.Differences in classification performance can be attributed to the difference in available job descriptions per classification model. The NAF and PCS were respectively trained with 281,418 and 483,090 entries, whereas the ISCO-88 and ISCO-68 models were trained with respectively 36,007 and 12,007 entries. Additionally, the difference in combined job description length between datasets could also have contributed to the difference in classification performance. Longer job descriptions decrease coding reliability if the additional information does not directly correspond to the definition of the occupational code12. This is due to an increase in potential occupational codes that can be assigned to a job description. In classification model training, the information increases variance within outcome categories, resulting in decreased classification performance49. The accuracy of OPERAS’ classification models shows a comparable non-monotonic downward trend with an increase in description length. However, the very small number of entries for the larger description lengths of the used input classes (see Table 3) warrants being careful with definitive conclusions on the association between prediction accuracy and description length.The difference in exposure assessment performance could be attributed to the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM containing specific occupational exposures that are relatively rare in the general population. Hence, the chance of discordant codes resulting in a non-exposed status is relatively high50. When the prevalence of exposed individuals increases, or when only exposed individuals are considered in the comparison, inter-rater reliability tends to decrease (see Fig. 2b, c). However, a moderate increase in reliability can be observed during the dichotomous evaluation for exposed individuals of the Formaldehyde-JEM and Silica-JEM. The correlation coefficients for all exposure levels also show strong and moderate correlation for respectively the same JEMs. However, they are not near perfect as evidenced by their inter-rater reliability for all individuals. Hence, to ensure reliable health outcomes it is crucial to take these factors into account during (semi-automatic) occupational coding47,50.The class imbalance in current datasets presents a substantial challenge for the development and deployment of the classification models. This is due to the fact that ML models tend to over-classify the majority class, thereby compromising the classification performance of minority classes32. This is a large issue, particularly in the current domain where the misclassification of minority classes can have critical implications on health outcomes. Traditional methods designed to tackle this issue, such as SMOTE, are in this case inadequate as the representation of the minority class in the datasets is excessively low33,51. As such, it is important that alternative data augmentation techniques are developed that can effectively enhance the representation of minority classes in datasets where the representation of the minority class is (close to) one. This will contribute to a more balanced and accurate performance of ML models, thereby increasing their generalizability and applicability in critical domains.OPERAS’ classification models are trained using one occupational dataset each. However, job description characteristics often differ between occupational datasets, possibly resulting in a lower out-of-distribution performance11,20. Additionally, OPERAS has been trained and tested on expert-coded occupational data coded on the least aggregated level. Although OPERAS’ data pre-processing pipeline can manage and produce predictions for ambiguous or incomplete data, its performance in such scenarios remains untested. Hence, to assess the generalizability of OPERAS’ classification models, its evaluation could be extended using external validation sets. To further improve the classification model performances, other classification techniques, hyper-parameter settings, and the use of additional datasets could be considered52. Additionally, OPERAS’ human-model cross-validation is currently based on external occupational inter-coder reliability studies containing different occupational characteristics compared to the current ones9,11,23,24,25. Hence, to gain more insight into OPERAS’ performance against expert-coders, additional cross-validations using the same underlying datasets could be performed.With OPERAS, a decision support system for epidemiological job coding of free-text job descriptions is introduced, which outperforms both expert coders9,11 and state-of-the-art coding tools18,53. This is achieved through the ML-based classification models for four (inter)national classification systems. OPERAS’ codes are accompanied by confidence scores that can be used by the expert coder to partially automate the coding process with accurate exposure assessment, resulting in a substantial workload reduction. Additional insight into OPERAS’ classification performance can be gained through the use of external data sets and comparisons with expert coders using the same underlying data. As such, OPERAS supports custom occupational coding, enabling large-scale occupational health research in an efficient, effective, accurate, and stable manner.

To explore this, large occupational cohorts of free-text job descriptions are manually coded and linked to exposure. Although several automatic coding tools have been developed, accurate exposure assessment is only feasible with human intervention. We developed OPERAS, a customizable decision support system for epidemiological job coding. Using 812,522 entries, we developed and tested classification models for the Professions et Catégories Socioprofessionnelles (PCS)2003, Nomenclature d’Activités Française (NAF)2008, International Standard Classifications of Occupation (ISCO)-88, and ISCO-68. Each code comes with an estimated correctness measure to identify instances potentially requiring expert review. Here, OPERAS’ decision support enables an increase in efficiency and accuracy of the coding process through code suggestions. Using the Formaldehyde, Silica, ALOHA, and DOM job-exposure matrices, we assessed the classification models’ exposure assessment accuracy. We show that, using expert-coded job descriptions as gold standard, OPERAS realized a 0.66–0.84, 0.62–0.81, 0.60–0.79, and 0.57–0.78 inter-coder reliability (in Cohen’s Kappa) on the first, second, third, and fourth coding levels, respectively. These exceed the respective inter-coder reliability of expert coders ranging 0.59–0.76, 0.56–0.71, 0.46–0.63, 0.40–0.56 on the same levels, enabling a 75.0–98.4% exposure assessment accuracy and an estimated 19.7–55.7% minimum workload reduction. OPERAS secures a high degree of accuracy in occupational classification and exposure assessment of free-text job descriptions, substantially reducing workload. As such, OPERAS significantly outperforms both expert coders and other current coding tools. This enables large-scale, efficient, and effective exposure assessment securing healthy work conditions. Work can expose us to health risks, such as asbestos and constant noise. To study these risks, job descriptions are collected and classified by experts to standard codes. This is time-consuming, expensive, and requires expert knowledge. To improve this coding, we created computer code based on Artificial Intelligence that can both automate this process and suggest codes to experts, who can then check and change it manually if needed. Our system outperforms both expert coders and other available tools. This system could make studying occupational health risks more efficient and accurate, resulting in safer work environments. Langezaal, van den Broek, et al. develop a decision support system for epidemiological job coding. This system is used for occupational classification and exposure assessment of job descriptions and performs better than both expert coders and alternative currently available tools.', 'datePublished': '2023-11-04T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2023-11-04T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '11', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-023-00397-4', 'keywords': ['Epidemiology', 'Population screening', 'Medicine/Public Health', 'general'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-023-00397-4/MediaObjects/43856_2023_397_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43856-023-00397-4/MediaObjects/43856_2023_397_Fig2_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Communications Medicine', 'issn': ['2730-664X'], 'volumeNumber': '3', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Mathijs A.

Leaders have been inundated with speculation about the technology’s potential to transform work. However, this raises an entirely new sets of problems for leaders: They now understand that the future will involve humans working with AI and feel immense pressure to “do something” to implement AI solutions. But how do they actually integrate AI with their workforce to achieve good business outcomes?
Since the launch of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT in November 2022, and the tsunami of other applications that have followed, we have conducted dozens of in-depth CEO interviews across industry sectors. Our goal was to identify how generative AI has changed the practices of leading firms and extract lessons for success.
Our recent interviews reveal a marked shift in focus from earlier studies — both our own and those of other researchers. While our own earlier interviews showed the importance of a human-focused culture, our recent interviews have signaled a definitive shift toward development of individual human competencies. The current hype cycle is around AI capability, digital skills, and the need for organizational change management, but our current finding reveals the importance of specific human capabilities to the successful use of AI.
In fact, it is the human ability to understand context — which AI tools lack — that necessitates the need for greater human skills. This is an important insight that can help leaders understand the necessary human elements that drive an organization’s successful use of AI.
The Skills Companies Really Need

We observed two categories of human skills that leaders see as critical — and which organizations are actually teaching to their employees. First are effective interpersonal skills, such as basic conflict resolution, communication, skills of disconnecting from emotions, and even mindfulness practices. Second is domain expertise, with a focus on preserving that knowledge among experienced talent and developing it among young inexperienced workers.
Insight Center CollectionHow Generative AI Is Changing WorkExploring the impact on workers, companies, and the economy.
While digital literacy was viewed as a given by the leaders we spoke to, interpersonal skills such as the ability to effectively communicate, meaningfully engage with others, and garner team cooperation were not. Our interviews reveal that while technical skills get more press, it is these uniquely human skills that companies need — and find to be in short supply in today’s marketplace. Peter Cameron, CEO of Lenox Group, underscored that workplace success depends on the ability to cultivate personal relationships, saying that, “Nothing replaces long-term relationships that are personal — and the longer the relationship the better.” Maria Villablanca, co-founder and CEO of Future Insight Network, pointed to specific qualities to look for in talent: “People that can be creative and innovative in the way they find solutions — problem solvers.” Broader research backs this up: A study of 1,700 global companies found that companies that excelled on human capital metrics were four times as likely to have superior financial performance.
One of the greatest values of experienced workers is domain expertise — deep knowledge of one’s environment. As AI takes over more tasks, there is a significant danger of atrophy of skills and loss of this kind of knowledge. John Sicard, president and CEO of the supply-chain-management company Kinaxis, pointed out that domain knowledge is essential to helping a business navigate through turbulent times. He gave the analogy that when an airplane experiences anything unusual, the autopilot is immediately turned off and pilots take control — at which point the pilots need to know what to do. Developing and maintaining these skills is essential.
Further, generative AI is shown to be more useful as a co-pilot for senior employees that can sift through AI “hallucinations” — inaccurate information presented as fact — and take the output as an aid. Inexperienced employees, however, may not be discerning enough and need a path to develop this knowledge. The sentiment was echoed by Ted English, former CEO of TJX Companies and current executive chairman of Bob’s Discount Furniture, who told us leadership requires “a lot of instinct, experience, and knowledge. Some of it you can’t get from a machine. Technology reinforces and allows you to make a more confident decision.”
While much has been written on the need to combine humans with AI, the real issue is how to implement this in practice. Here’s what companies need to do.
More Than Just Combining Humans and AI 
In 2020 we published our Four I framework for using AI that calls for creating a human-centric organization. As a result of our current findings, we have modified the descriptors of our original framework, making it more specific in its mandates. This offers a direct comparison — and shift — between the use of AI in the post pandemic business environment.
The first layer of the framework is intentionality. In this context, we mean that a company’s business model should be purposefully designed around AI capability, rather just applying AI to existing processes. Spencer Fung, president and CEO of Li & Fung, a global supply-chain and logistics company, gave us an analogy: “Companies acquiring AI without a new business model is like a company digitizing a horse and carriage — while the competition has created a digital automobile.” He offered the clothing company Shein as an exemplar: a company that became a fast-fashion industry leader by using a business model centered around a seamless e-commerce platform leveraging a data-driven approach.
Next comes integration across all functions of the enterprise, with horizontal communication and AI as the enabling layer — in other words, getting rid of silos. For example, ekaterra, the world’s largest tea company, invested in a unifying AI platform to create complete horizontal connectivity, integration, and real-time visibility.
The real challenge, however, is implementation. Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion, has written that winning performance does not come from combining the best technology with the best people — but from the best process of combining. To achieve this, talent must be familiar with AI capabilities and know how best to utilize them.
However, AI is an evolving technology, and that necessitates a business add slack to the system to allow opportunity for learning. One of the authors learned this in an earlier project with Lockheed Martin on the F-22 Raptor, where downtime was needed for workers to become familiar with new tools and technologies. With an evolving technology new learning may even cause a temporary loss of productivity, but that loss will ultimately be more than made up — it’s the proverbial, “putting down an axe to learn how to use a chain saw.”
Implementation also requires differentiation between “deep work” and “shallow work,” with the latter assigned to AI. Deep work, however, requires worker training for developing talent literacies. For example, one company builds in 90-minute sessions as part of the regular work week.
The last part of the framework is indication, or performance measurement. Forget traditional performance measures or the inane debate on working from office or home. Look to develop novel metrics tied directly to purposeful intentionality of your business model using generative AI. Organizations from Google to Schneider Electric are now using AI to redefine what to measure, how to measure, and improve performance.
Humans With Enhanced Skills “In the Loop”
Competitive advantage cannot be achieved without humans in the loop. Rushing to replace talent with AI is a huge mistake.
Why?
First, AI is copyable. What is not copyable is a unique business model, processes, and thoughtful integration of humans.
Second, AI is based on historical data that may not hold true in a volatile global business environment. Kinaxis’s Sicard underscored that “every math-based model collapsed when the pandemic hit. None of the assumptive parameters could be trusted. It is not an indictment on the science … but an indictment on the believe that those technologies eliminate the need to be agile.” Business decisions are not made in a vacuum separate from issues of labor, inflation, geopolitics — and this is where domain expertise of people is essential. In our executive interviews we repeatedly heard that the new competitive advantage is “the human mind,” “human critical thinking,” and “human decision intelligence.”
Third, AI is subject to hallucination and “drift,” where output is either fabricated by the AI or simply inaccurate. Handing the reins over to AI poses great risks in terms of inaccurate decision making and even legal liability.
AI is still a tool. The centerpiece are people, but with enhanced human literacies, a well-thought-out business model, and superb processes that integrate humans with their AI co-pilots.Read more on Talent management or related topics Technology and analytics and AI and machine learningNSNada R.

Companies are using artificial intelligence to determine who to hire and fire. It is simultaneously being deployed in various ways to improve recruitment and retention. This includes résumé screenings, candidate matching, interview schedules, probability analysis, performance evaluations and layoff decisions.


AI screens résumés and identifies the most qualified candidates for a job, matches candidates with job openings based on their skills, experience and preferences, schedules interviews and reduces the time it takes to fill open positions.

With predictive analytics, AI determines which employees are most likely to leave a company. Employers can use this insight to course-correct and have transparent conversations about how they can alleviate the risk of voluntary turnover. It also evaluates employee performance and identifies areas for improvement.

PROMOTED
Most concerningly, some companies are using AI to make layoff decisions, leveraging the data to determine the workers who are the poor performers. In a 2023 Capterra survey of 300 human resources leaders, 98% of surveyed HR executives said they plan to employ software and algorithms to reduce labor costs.

Recruiting And Hiring With AI
The role of recruiters is to find the best, most suitable applicants for the job efficiently, which is not easy. Search professionals must allocate many hours to sourcing qualified people for the position. This involves elaborate Boolean searches, sending dozens of emails, texting and calling prospective candidates.

AI-powered recruiting tools offer advantages over traditional recruiting methods, including analyzing large amounts of data, automating the recruitment process, reducing bias, helping companies find and hire passive candidates who may not be actively looking for a job and improving employee retention.

LinkedIn, the go-to site for job seekers and networking, plans to leverage generative AI technology with its insights of more than 950 million professionals, 63 million companies and 40,000 skills on the platform.
Over the next year, LinkedIn will roll out Recruiter 2024 to enable recruiters and talent acquisition professionals to find on-target candidates for their jobs faster.
The feature will offer a clean interface with a rectangular box in which recruiters and talent leaders can use natural language to express their hiring goals in their own words. For example, a hiring professional would write, “I’m searching for a software engineer with 10 years of experience,” then add specific skills, background and experiences pertinent to the role. AI combined with LinkedIn’s massive data can produce the candidates the employer desperately seeks.
Getting Fired By AI
In 2019, the Verge reported that Amazon used an AI system to monitor and automatically fire hundreds of fulfillment center workers for failing to meet productivity quotas.
A signed letter by Amazon’s attorney disclosed, “Amazon’s system tracks the rate of each individual associate’s productivity and automatically generates any warnings or terminations regarding quality or productivity without input from supervisors.”
At the time of the reporting, a company spokesperson contested the cold firings:
""It is absolutely not true that employees are terminated through an automatic system. We would never dismiss an employee without first ensuring that they had received our fullest support, including dedicated coaching to help them improve and additional training. Since we’re a company that continues to grow, it’s our business objective to ensure long-term career development opportunities for our employees. Similar to many companies, we have performance expectations regardless of whether they are corporate or fulfillment center employees. We support people who do not perform to the levels expected of them with dedicated coaching to help them improve and be successful in their career at Amazon.""
According to the Washington Post, former employees at Google began to wonder if AI played a role in the 12,000 job cuts the company made this year, since HR uses technology to analyze employee data that recommends who to interview, hire and retain.
In a Discord post, an ex-Googler theorized the company may have used a “mindless algorithm carefully designed to not violate any laws.” However, Google denied this claim and said there was “no algorithm involved” in its layoff selection.
This month, an Amsterdam court ruled that Uber had failed to comply with the European Union’s algorithmic transparency requirements, which prohibits using AI or similar technology from being the sole decision-maker on actions that have “legal or other significant effects” on people. Two drivers in the U.K. and one from Portugal sought legal action against the rideshare company for their alleged “robo-firings.”
Uber was required to provide transparency in how it used automation to make decisions to workers affected by them, but the company argued that in doing so, it’d be compromising trade secrets.
In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, a company spokesperson said:
“At the time when these drivers’ accounts were flagged, they were reviewed by our Trust and Safety Teams, who are specially trained to spot the types of behavior that could potentially impact rider safety. The Court confirmed that the review process was carried out by our human teams, which is standard practice when our systems spot potentially fraudulent behavior.”

Artificial intelligence is changing the world – and one of the main areas it will affect in the short-to-medium term is the workforce. 
AI algorithms imitate real-world systems. The more repetitive a system is, the easier it is for AI to replace it. That’s why jobs in customer service, retail and clerical roles are regularly named as being the most at risk.
That doesn’t mean other jobs won’t be affected. The latest advances in AI have shown all kinds of creative work and white-collar professions stand to be impacted to various degrees. 
However, there’s one important point that’s usually not addressed in discussions about AI’s impact on jobs. That is: where you work may be as important as what you do. 
Current trends and projections suggest people in developing countries, where a higher proportion of jobs involve repetitive or manual tasks, will be the first and most affected.

      The hidden cost of the AI boom: social and environmental exploitation




Privileged by geography
According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, emerging technologies and digitalisation are among the biggest driving factors for job displacement. The report states:

The majority of fastest declining roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with bank tellers and related clerks, postal service clerks, cashiers and ticket clerks, and data entry clerks expected to decline fastest.

Let’s take an office clerk as an example, whose responsibilities include answering phones, taking messages and scheduling appointments. We now have access to AI tools that can perform all these tasks. 
They can also work non-stop, for free (or a fraction of the price), without being affected by personal problems, and without having to mentally strain to optimise their workflow. Of course they’re going to be attractive to employers!
At first glance, you might assume an office clerk living in a developed country is more likely to lose their job than their counterpart in a developing country, since the former seems more likely to implement new AI tools. 
In reality, however, it’s expected more people in developing countries will lose their jobs. The success of each nation will depend on how well it can adapt to the displacement of its workforce.
In 2009, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union created the information and communication technologies (ICT) development index to benchmark and compare ICT performance within and across countries.
This index measures, among other things:

the level and evolution over time of information and communication technologies in different countries 
how each country’s experience compares to others’
the extent to which a country can develop and use these technologies to boost its own growth and development in the context of the capabilities and skills available.

In other words, a country’s score on this index can be correlated with how well it adapts to emerging technologies such as AI. 
Unsurprisingly, developed countries rank higher than the rest of the world. In 2012, the top five ranking countries were the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Finland. The bottom five were Eritrea, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Niger.



People in developing nations won’t have as many resources to adapt to disruption caused by increasing AI use.

Wealth and opportunity makes a difference
The World Bank has divided the world by income and region, showing developing countries are among the lowest earners. 
Generally speaking, employing people is much easier in developing countries, due to lower wages, tighter competition and less regulation to support employees.
The World Bank estimates about 84% of the world’s working-age population lives in developing countries. Similarly, a 2008 report from the International Labour Organisation estimated 73% of all the world’s workers lived in developing countries, while only 14% lived in advanced industrial countries.
That means whatever clerical jobs aren’t taken by AI in developing countries will become more competitive than most people can handle. As World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos wrote in 2016, in reference to the digital revolution: 

[…] the jobs where workers are likely to lose out are disproportionally held by the least educated and the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. As a result, the biggest risk from the digital revolution is not massive unemployment, but widening income inequality.

These factors will result in an employer-ruled ecosystem in developing countries. These countries have both a higher occurrence of jobs that can be replaced or displaced (such as call centre jobs), and less of the money and skills needed to implement AI tools effectively. 
The cost and affordability of AI programs and algorithms will also speed up this process in certain regions. 
Critical thinking remains important
Experts note AI will create many employment opportunities, including jobs that don’t yet exist. It’s just that not all countries will be well-equipped to make the transition when the time comes. 
The Future of Jobs report says “analytical thinking and creative thinking remain the most important skills for workers”. So if you’re worried about keeping your job in the future, it’s worth acquiring more of these skills.
Beyond that, you might stop and consider how the place you live could play a role in whether you’ll have work in the future – and if you happen to live in a wealthy, developed country, consider yourself lucky.

Some tech executives and political leaders have warned the rapid development of AI poses an existential threat to the world if not controlled, sparking a race by governments and international institutions to design safeguards and regulation.
In a first for Western efforts to manage its safe development, a Chinese vice-minister joined US and EU leaders and tech bosses such as Elon Musk and ChatGPT’s Sam Altman at Bletchley Park, home of Britain’s World War Two codebreakers.
More than 25 countries present, including the US and China, as well as the EU, signed a “Bletchley Declaration” saying countries needed to work together and establish a common approach on oversight.

The declaration set out a two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building scientific understanding of them, while also developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.
Wu Zhaohui, China’s Vice-Minister of Science and Technology, told the opening session of the two-day summit that Beijing was ready to increase collaboration on AI safety to help build an international “governance framework”.
“Countries regardless of their size and scale have equal rights to develop and use AI,” he said.
Fears about the impact AI could have on economies and society took off in November last year when Microsoft-backed start-up OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the public.
Using natural language processing tools to create humanlike dialogue, it has stoked fears, including among some AI pioneers, that machines could in time achieve greater intelligence than humans, leading to unlimited, unintended consequences.
Governments and officials are now trying to chart a way forward alongside AI companies which fear being weighed down by regulation before the technology reaches its full potential.

“I don’t know what necessarily the fair rules are, but you’ve got to start with insight before you do oversight,” Musk told reporters, adding that a “third-party referee” could be used to sound the alarm when risks develop.
While the EU has focused its AI oversight on data privacy and surveillance and their potential impact on human rights, the British summit is looking at so-called existential risks from highly capable general-purpose models called “frontier AI”.
Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of AI research lab Google Deepmind, told reporters he did not think current AI frontier models posed any “significant catastrophic harms”, but said it made sense to plan ahead as the industry trains ever larger models.

The summit is the brainchild of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who wants to carve out a post-Brexit role for his country as an intermediary between the economic blocs of the United States, China and the EU.
British digital minister Michelle Donelan said it was an achievement just to get so many key players in one room. She announced two further AI Safety Summits, one to be held in South Korea in six months and another in France six months after that.
“For the first time, we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risk around frontier AI,” Donelan told reporters.
Just as tech companies compete for dominance in AI, governments are jostling to lead the way on regulation.
China is a key participant at the summit, given the country’s role in developing AI. But some British lawmakers have questioned whether it should be there given the low level of trust between Beijing, Washington and many European capitals when it comes to Chinese involvement in technology.
The US government made clear on the eve of the summit that the call to Beijing had very much come from Britain, with its Ambassador to London, Jane Hartley, telling Reuters: “This is the UK invitation, this is not the US”.
US Vice-President Kamala Harris’ decision to give a speech in London on Wednesday about her government’s response to AI, and hold some meetings with attendees away from the summit, meaning they may have to leave early, also raised some eyebrows.
Sachin Dev Duggal, founder of London-based AI firm Builder.ai, said it risked undermining the event’s core focus, while some lawmakers from Sunak’s Conservative Party suggested Washington was trying to overshadow his summit.
British officials denied that, saying they wanted as many voices as possible.

Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 8 months oldNo utopia: experts question Elon Musk’s vision of world without workThis article is more than 8 months oldUsing AI to create less and better work would benefit society but getting rid of it altogether would be unproductive, experts sayCaroline DaviesFri 3 Nov 2023 13.01 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Nov 2023 12.49 EDTShareOscar Wilde thought hard work “the refuge” of those with nothing better to do while he envisaged a society of “cultivated leisure” as machines performed the necessary and unpleasant tasks.Karl Marx’s dream was of a society regulated general production that allowed liberated workers to “hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner” without the drudgery of being tied to one job.The 19th-century socialist activist William Morris advocated for more pleasurable work, believing that once the profit motive of the factory had been abolished, less necessary labour would led to a four-hour day.So Elon Musk’s suggestion to Rishi Sunak that society could reach a point where “no job is needed” and “you can do a job if you want a job … but the AI will do everything” revives a debate on the issue of how we work that has long been discussed.Yet a world without work, experts question, may be more dystopian than utopian.“This is an old, old story that never actually happens,” said Tom Hodgkinson, co-founder of the Idler magazine, which for three decades has been a platform to examine issues surrounding work and leisure.“There was a poem in ancient Greece saying, ‘Isn’t it wonderful that we have invented the watermill so that we no longer have to grind our corn? The women can sit around doing nothing all day from now on.’ It’s that kind of recurrent idea.“People like Bertrand Russell were talking about this in the 30s. What would we do without work? One view is people wouldn’t know what to do because people are more or less slavish. That they would just sit around watching daytime TV or porn all day.”In fact, given more free time, such as on furlough during Covid, “they start living better”, Hodgkinson said. “They are starting neighbourhood groups, doing more gardening, doing up the house, spending more time with family, doing creative things, playing music, writing poetry, all the things that are part of what I would call a good life.”Despite that, he said, studies had shown that paid work was beneficial for mental health, for status and identity.“I think we need to do some sort of work. We should be moving towards a shorter working week, and more leisure-filled society,” Hodgkinson said, adding that a radical overhaul of our economic and education models would be needed to eliminate work on the scale that Musk predicted.One significant body of research in 2019, led by Brendan Burchell, professor in social sciences and a former president of Magdalene College, Cambridge, established that eight hours of paid employment a week was optimal in terms of benefit in mental health, and that no extra benefit was subsequently accrued.Setting aside the “awful jobs that really screw you up”, Burchell said, “your average job is good for you” in terms of social interaction, working collectively, giving structure and sense of identity.A world without work “is a terrible idea of what society would look like for all sorts of reasons, as well as people’s mental health”, he said.The labour market, as a way of distributing money around the economy, would have to be transformed, as would the education system, “to teach people how to fill their days, by writing poetry or going fishing or whatever, instead of going to the factory or the office”, Burchell continued.Shifting to shorter working hours was shown to have “massive benefits for people”, said Burchell, but he added: “If we move to a society where lots of people are completely excluded from the labour market, then I get very worried that’s going to be a very dystopian future.”In his book Making Light Work: An End to Toil in the 21st Century, David Spencer, professor of economics at the University of Leeds, also makes the case for less work, but not its elimination. “It would leave us bereft potentially of things that we value in work,” he said, citing communal enterprise, personal relationships and the development of skillsets.So in essence, we would be a poorer, sadder, less skilled society. “Yes, there will be some loss through loss of work,” Spencer said. “I realise not all work is good. So we ought to automate drudgery, seek to use AI to reduce the pain of work, and therefore leave work which is good.”He draws from Morris, who talked about bringing joy to work. “Skilful work is good work and it has a role in the creation of a better society,” said Spencer. “We ought to use technology to create less and better work. In that sense, the future can be really positive.This was, he added, the future imagined by “Oscar Wilde, William Morris, and a lot of utopian positive thinking, where technology makes work lighter. It’s not eliminating work – it’s bringing light to work.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveUS election live updates: top congressional Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris for Democratic nomination – reportBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in face",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI chatbots show an impressive ability to generate clear and coherent text from simple natural-language prompts. But what's going on behind the scenes?







In the following excerpt from How AI Works: From Sorcery to Science, a recent release from No Starch Press, author and programmer Ronald Kneusel breaks down the components of large language models (LLMs), which power popular AI chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Bard. Kneusel explains how LLMs use transformer neural networks -- a type of AI architecture introduced in 2017 -- to process input text, enabling them to identify complex relationships and patterns in massive data sets.
Check out the rest of How AI Works for a deep dive into the history and inner workings of AI that doesn't involve extensive math or programming. For more from Kneusel, read his interview with TechTarget Editorial, where he discusses the generative AI boom, including LLMs' benefits and limitations and the importance of alignment.
Large language models are impressive and powerful. So how do they work? Let's take a shot at an answer.
I'll begin at the end, with a few comments from the conclusion of the ""Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence"" paper mentioned earlier:
How does [GPT-4] reason, plan, and create? Why does it exhibit such general and flexible intelligence when it is at its core merely the combination of simple algorithmic components -- gradient descent and large-scale transformers with extremely large amounts of data? These questions are part of the mystery and fascination of LLMs, which challenge our understanding of learning and cognition, fuel our curiosity, and motivate deeper research.

AI Works.'

That quote contains questions that currently lack convincing answers. Simply put, researchers don't know why large language models like GPT-4 do what they do. There are certainly hypotheses in search of evidence and proof, but as I write this, no proven theories are available. Therefore, we can discuss only the what, as in what a large language model entails, and not the how of its behavior.
Large language models use a new class of neural network, the transformer, so we'll begin there. (GPT stands for generative pretrained transformer.) The transformer architecture appeared in the literature in 2017, with the influential paper ""Attention Is All You Need"" by Google researchers Ashish Vaswani et al. The paper had been cited over 70,000 times as of March 2023.
Traditionally, models that process sequences (such as sentences) used recurrent neural networks, which pass their output back in as input along with the next input of the sequence. This is the logical model for processing text because the network can incorporate the notion of memory via the output fed back in with the next token. Indeed, early deep learning translation systems used recurrent networks. However, recurrent networks have small memories and are challenging to train, which limits their applicability.
Transformer networks utilize a different approach: they accept the entire input at once and process it in parallel. Transformer networks typically include an encoder and a decoder. The encoder learns representations and associations between the parts of the input (think sentences), while the decoder uses the learned associations to produce output (think more sentences).
Large language models like GPT dispense with the encoder and instead learn the necessary representation in an unsupervised way using an enormous text dataset. After pretraining, the decoder part of the transformer model generates text in response to the input prompt.
The input to a model like GPT-4 is a sequence of text made up of words. The model splits this into units called tokens. A token might be a word, a part of a word, or even an individual character. Pretraining aims to map tokens to a multidimensional embedding space, which it does by associating each token with a vector that can be thought of as a point in that space.

Figure 7-3: Context encoding in the embedding space





The learned mapping from tokens to vectors captures complex relationships between the tokens so that tokens with similar meanings are nearer to each other than tokens with dissimilar meanings. For example, as shown in Figure 7-3, after pretraining, the mapping (context encoding) will place ""dog"" closer to ""fox"" than to ""can opener."" The embedding space has many dimensions, not the mere two of Figure 7-3, but the effect is the same.
The context encoding is learned during pretraining by forcing the model to predict the next token given all previous tokens in an input. In effect, if the input is ""roses are red,"" then during the pretraining process the model will be asked to predict the next token after ""roses are."" If the predicted token isn't ""red,"" the model will use the loss function and backpropagation to update its weights, thereby taking a gradient descent step after suitable averaging of the error over a minibatch. For all their abilities, large language models are trained the same way as other neural networks.
Pretraining enables the model to learn language, including grammar and syntax, and seemingly to acquire enough knowledge about the world to allow the emergent abilities that have turned the world of AI on its head.
The decoder step takes the input prompt and produces output token after output token until a unique stop token is generated. Because so much of language and the way the world works was learned during pretraining, the decoder step has the side effect of producing extraordinary output even though the decoder is, in the end, just predicting most likely token after most likely token.
More specifically, during the prediction process, GPT-style models use attention to assign importance to the different tokens in the input sequence, thereby capturing relationships between them. This is the primary difference between a transformer model and older recurrent neural networks. The transformer can pay attention to different parts of the input sequence, enabling it to identify and use the relationships between tokens even if they are far apart within the input.
When used in chat mode, LLMs give the illusion of a back-and-forth discussion when, in reality, each new prompt from the user is passed to the model along with all the previous text (the user's prompts and the model's replies). Transformer models have a fixed input width (context window), which is currently around 4,000 tokens for GPT-3.5 and some 32,000 for GPT-4. The large input window makes it possible for the attention portion of the model to go back to things that appeared far back in the input, which is something recurrent models cannot do.
Large language models are ready for use after pretraining if desired, but many applications fine-tune them first using domain-specific data. For generic models like GPT-4, fine-tuning likely consisted of a step known as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, the model is trained further using feedback from real human beings to align its responses to human values and societal expectations.
This is necessary because LLMs are not conscious entities, and thus they cannot understand human society and its many rules. For example, unaligned LLMs will respond with step-by-step instructions for many activities that human society restricts, like how to make drugs or bombs. The ""Sparks"" paper contains several such examples of GPT-4 output before the RLHF step that aligned the model with societal expectations.
Stanford University's open source Alpaca model is based on LLaMa, a large language model from Meta. As of this writing, Alpaca has not undergone an alignment process and will answer questions that GPT and other commercial LLMs correctly refuse to answer.
Conclusion: Alignment is absolutely critical to ensure that powerful language models conform to human values and societal norms.

		Microsoft’s generative AI assistant is integrated within a host of the company's workplace apps. Here’s what enterprises need to know about the renamed ‘Copilot for Microsoft 365.’	




 









Initially called Microsoft 365 Copilot when it launched in November 2023, the renamed “Copilot for Microsoft 365” brings a range of generative AI (genAI) features to office productivity apps such as Word, Outlook, Teams and Excel. 
In a blog post announcing the tool, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described it as “the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing…. With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.”
At launch, Microsoft explained that the Copilot “system” consists of three elements: Microsoft 365 apps such as Word, Excel, and Teams, where users interact with the AI assistant; Microsoft Graph, which includes files, documents, and data across the Microsoft 365 environment; and the OpenAI models that process user prompts, such as the ChatGPT-4 large language model and DALL-E 3 model for image generation.
 
 
 













 
 

With the tool, Microsoft aims to create a “more usable, functional assistant” for work, J.P. Gownder, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester’s Future of Work team, told Computerworld in fall 2023. “The concept is that you’re the ‘pilot,’ but the Copilot is there to take on tasks that can make life a lot easier.”

The Copilot for M365 is “part of a larger movement of generative AI that will clearly change the way that we do computing,” he said, noting how the technology has already been applied to a variety of job functions — from writing content to creating code — since ChatGPT-3.5 launched in late 2022.
A Forrester report last year predicted that 6.9 million US knowledge workers — around 8% of the total — would be using Copilot for M365 by the end of 2024.
 
 
 













 
 



 


Nadella talked up the effectiveness of the M365 Copilot during a 2023 earnings call, claiming customers had seen productivity gains in line with that of the GitHub Copilot, the AI assistant aimed at developers that launched two years ago. (For reference, GitHub has previously claimed developers were able to complete a single task 55% quicker thanks to the GitHub Copilot, while acknowledging the challenges in measuring productivity.)
Even priced at $30 per user per month, there’s potential to deliver considerable value to businesses, assuming the Copilot delivers on its promise over time. Said Gownder: “The key issue is, ‘Does it actually save that time?’ because it’s hard to measure and we don’t really know for sure. But even conservative time savings estimates are pretty generous.”
The Copilot for M365 is billed as providing employees with access to genAI without the security concerns of consumer genAI tools; Microsoft says its models aren’t trained on customer data, for instance. But deploying the tool represents significant challenges, said Avivah Litan, distinguished vice president analyst at Gartner.
 
 
 













 
 

There are two primary business risks, she said: the potential for the Copilot to ‘hallucinate’ and provide inaccurate information to users, and the ability for the Copilot’s language models to access huge swathes of corporate data that’s not locked down properly.
“Information oversharing is one of the biggest issues people are going to face in the next few months, or six months to a year,” said Litan. “That’s where the rubber is going to hit the road on the risk — it’s not so much giving the data to Microsoft or OpenAI or Google, it’s all the exposure internally.”
Copilot for Microsoft 365 features: How do you use it?

Copilot interactions within apps can take a variety of forms, depending on the application. In many cases, users will interact with it via the chat interface available in a sidebar; Copilot functionality is also built more directly into some apps, such as a pop-up in a Word document or Outlook email, for instance. 
 
 
 













 
 

Here’s how the Copilot works in some M365 apps.
In a Word doc, it can suggest improvements to existing text or let users create a first draft from scratch. To generate a draft, a user can ask Copilot in natural language to create text based on a prompt, and can upload additional files and sources of information to guide the AI assistant. Once created, the user can edit th document, adjust the style, or ask the Copilot to redo the whole thing. A Copilot sidebar provides space for more interactions with the bot, which also suggests prompts to improve the draft, such as adding images or an FAQ section, or summarize the text. 
During a Teams video call, the Copilot provides a recap of what’s been discussed so far, with a brief overview of conversation points in real time. It’s also possible to ask the AI assistant for feedback on people’s views during a call, or what questions remain unresolved. Those unable to attend a particular meeting can send the AI assistant in their place to provide a summary of what they missed and action items they need to follow up on. 
 
 
 













 
 


Copilot can help a Word user draft a proposal from meeting notes. 

In PowerPoint, Copilot can automatically turn a Word document into draft slides that can then be adapted via natural language in the Copilot sidebar. It can also generate suggested speaker notes to go with the slides and add more images. 
These are just some examples. Other apps that feature Copilot integration include Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Loop, and Whiteboard.
The other way to interact with Copilot is via a separate chat interface that’s accessible via Teams. Here, the Copilot works as a search tool that surfaces information from a range of sources, including documents, calendars, emails, and chats. For instance, an employee could ask for an update on a project, and get a summary of relevant team communications and documents already created, with links to sources.
 
 
 













 
 

Microsoft will extend Copilot’s reach into other apps workers use via “plugins” — essentially third-party app integrations. These will allow the assistant to tap into data held in apps from other software vendors including Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Mural. Fifty such plugins are available, with “thousands” more expected eventually, Microsoft said. 
How much does Copilot cost — is it worth $30 per user, per month?
The main Microsoft 365 Copilot is available for enterprise customers on E3, E5, F1 and F3 plans, as well as Office E1, E3, E5, and Apps for Enterprise. It’s also available for smaller business customers on the following plans: Businesses Basic, Business Standard, Business Premium, and Apps for Business.
In each case, the Copilot for Microsoft 365 costs an additional $30 per user each month.
 
 
 













 
 

It’s a significant extra expense given that M365 subscriptions start at $6 per user each month for Busines Basic and go up to $55 per user each month for E5. Part of this due to the cost of the high computing costs of the Copilot incurred by Microsoft, said Raúl Castañón, senior research analyst at 451 Research, a part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“Microsoft is likely looking to avoid the challenges faced with GitHub Copilot, which was made generally available in mid-2022 for $10/month and, despite surpassing more than 1.5 million users, reportedly remains unprofitable,” said Castañón.
In addition to the core Copilot for M365, job role-specific Copilots are available as paid add-ons. Sales and service Copilots each cost an additional $20 per user each month, while a finance Copilot is currently in preview.
 
 
 













 
 

The pricing strategy reflects Microsoft’s confidence in the impact that genAI will have on workforce productivity.
Per Forrester’s calculations in the “Build Your Business Case For Microsoft 365 Copilot” report, an employee earning $120,000 annually — roughly $57 per hour — might save four hours a month on various productivity tasks; those four hours would be worth around $230 a month. In that scenario, it would make sense to invest in Copilot for an employee earning even half that amount, and that’s leaving aside less tangible benefits around employee experience when automating mundane tasks.
There are, as the Forrester points out, other costs to consider beyond licensing — employee training, for instance, as employees learn the new technology. Gartner also predicts that enterprise security spending will increase in the region of 10% to 15% in the next couple of years as a result of efforts to secure genAI tools (not just M365 Copilot).
 
 
 













 
 

Businesses are likely to take a cautious approach to deploying the Microsoft tool, at least at first. Microsoft expects revenue related to M365 Copilot to “grow gradually over time,” Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call. On the same call, Nadella noted that Copilot will be subject to the usual “enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp.”
Even if the pace of adoption is gradual, there appears to be plenty of interest in deploying it. Forrester expects around a third of M365 customers in the US to invest in Copilot in the first year. Companies that do so will provide licenses to around 40% of employees during this period, the firm estimated.
(Note: while not actually branded as Copilot, Microsoft also makes some genAI features available in Teams Premium. This includes AI-generated notes, AI-generated tasks and live translations in video calls, all of which are powered by ChatGPT AI models. For businesses that are mostly interested in AI assistant features for meetings, this offers a cheaper option than a full Copilot for M365 subscription.) 
 
 
 













 
 

What are Microsoft’s other Copilots?
Microsoft’s Copilot is embedded in a wide array of products. Beyond the M365 suite, there are Copilots for Dynamics, Power BI, GitHub, and Microsoft’s security suite.
And then there are Copilots aimed primarily at consumer, rather than business, users. 

Microsoft launched Copilot Pro in January 2024, a $20 a month subscription that provides individuals with similar functionality to the Copilot for M365. Copilot Pro customers gain access to Copilot chatbot and genAI image creation, as well as AI assistant features in free web versions of apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook (though not Teams). Those with Microsoft 365 Personal and family subscriptions can also access the Copilot in desktop apps. 
 
 
 













 
 

There’s also a free version of the Copilot with access to chatbot functionality only.
The Copilot chat interface is accessible in several ways by both paid and free users. There’s a dedicated web page, a mobile app, and a chatbot built into the Windows operating system, Edge browser, and Bing search engine.
How are early customers using Copilot?
There are two basic ways users will interact with Copilot. It can be accessed directly within a particular app — to create PowerPoint slides, for example, or an email draft — or via a natural language chatbot accessible in Teams, known as Microsoft 365 Chat. 
 
 
 













 
 

Interactions within apps can take a variety of forms, depending on the application. When Copilot is invoked in a Word document, for example, it can suggest improvements to existing text, or even create a first draft.

To generate a draft, a user can ask Copilot in natural language to create text based on a particular source of information or from a combination of sources. One example: creating a draft proposal based on meeting notes from OneNote and a product road map from another Word doc. Once a draft is created, the user can edit it, adjust the style, or ask the AI tool to redo the whole document. A Copilot sidebar provides space for more interactions with the bot, which also suggests prompts to improve the draft, such as adding images or an FAQ section. 
During a Teams video call, a participant can request a recap of what’s been discussed so far, with Copilot providing a brief overview of conversation points in real time via the Copilot sidebar. It’s also possible to ask the AI assistant for feedback on people’s views during the call, or what questions remain unresolved. Those unable to attend a particular meeting can send the AI assistant in their place to provide a summary of what they missed and action items they need to follow up on. 
In PowerPoint, Copilot can automatically turn a Word document into draft slides that can then be adapted via natural language in the Copilot sidebar. Copilot can also generate suggested speaker notes to go with the slides and add more images. 
 
 
 













 
 

The other way to interact with Copilot is via Microsoft 365 Chat, which is accessible as a chatbot with Teams. Here, Microsoft 365 Chat works as a search tool that surfaces information from a range of sources, including documents, calendars, emails, and chats. For instance, an employee could ask for an update on a project, and get a summary of relevant team communications and documents already created, with links to sources.
Microsoft will extend Copilot’s reach into other apps workers use via “plugins” — essentially third-party app integrations. These will allow the assistant to tap into data held in apps from other software vendors including Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Mural. Fifty such plugins are available, with “thousands” more expected eventually, Microsoft said. 

Copilot can synthesize information about a project from different sources.

How are early customers using Copilot?
Prior to launch, many businesses accessed the Copilot for M365 as part of a paid early access program (EAP); it began with a small number of participants before growing to several hundred customers, including Chevron, Goodyear, and General Motors. 
One of those involved in the EAP was marketing firm Dentsu, which began deploying 300 licenses to tech staff and then employees across its business lines globally. The most popular use case so far is summarization of information generated in M365 apps — a Teams call being one example.
“Summarization is definitely the most common use case we see right out of the box, because it’s an easy prompt: you don’t really have to do any prompt engineering…, it’s suggested by Copilot,” Kate Slade, director of emerging technology enablement at Dentsu, said.
Staffers would also access M365 Chat functions to prepare for meetings, for instance, with the ability to quickly pull information from different sources. This could mean finding information from a project several years ago “without having to hunt through a folder maze,” said Slade.
The feedback from workers at Dentsu has been overwhelmingly positive, said Slade, with a waiting list now in place for those who want to use the AI tool.
“It’s reducing the time that they spend on [tasks] and giving them back time to be more creative, more strategic, or just be a human and connect peer to peer in Teams meetings,” she said. “That’s been one of the biggest impacts that we’ve seen…, just helping make time for the higher-level cognitive tasks that people have to do.”
Use cases have varied between different roles. Denstu’s graphic designers would get less value from using Copilot in PowerPoint, for example: “They’re going to create really visually stunning pieces themselves and not really be satisfied with that out-of-the-box capability,” said Slade. “But those same creatives might get a lot of benefits from Copilot in Excel and being able to use natural language to say, ‘Hey, I need to do some analysis on this table,’ or ‘What are key trends from this data?’ or ‘I want to add a column that does this or that.’”
How does Copilot compare with other productivity and collaboration genAI tools?
Most vendors in the productivity and collaboration software market have added genAI to their offerings at this point.
Google, Microsoft’s main competitor in the productivity software arena, launched DuetAI for Workspace in 2023, and rebranded to Gemini Enterprise ($30 per user each month) and   Gemini Business ($20 user each month). Google’s AI assistant can summarize Gmail conversations, draft texts, and generate images in Workspace apps such as Docs, Sheets,and Slides. 
Slack, the collaboration software firm owned by Salesforce and a rival to Microsoft Teams, launched its Slack AI feature in February. Other firms that compete with elements of the Microsoft 365 portfolio, such as Zoom, Box, Coda, and Cisco, have also touted genAI plans. 
Meanwhile, Apple announced that it will build generative AI features into its range of productivity tools.
Then there are the AI specific tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Claude, Perplexity AI, Jasper AI and others, that provide also provide text generation and document summarization features. 
Copilot has some advantages over rivals. One is Microsoft’s dominant position in the productivity and collaboration software market, said Castañón. “The key advantage the Microsoft 365 Copilot will have is that — like other previous initiatives such as Teams — it has a ‘ready-made’ opportunity with Microsoft’s collaboration and productivity portfolio and its extensive global footprint,” he said. 
Microsoft’s close partnership with OpenAI (Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the company on several occasions since 2019 and has a large non-controlling share of the business), likely helped it build generative AI across its applications at faster rate than rivals. 
“Its investment in OpenAI has already had an impact, allowing it to accelerate the use of generative AI/LLMs in its products, jumping ahead of Google Cloud and other competitors,” said Castañón. 
What are the genAI risks for businesses? ‘Hallucinations’ and data protection
Along with the potential benefits of genAI tools like the Copilot for M365, businesses should consider risks. These include the hallucinations large language models (LLMs) are prone to, where incorrect information is provided to employees.
“Copilot is generative AI — it definitely can hallucinate,” said Slade, citing the example of one employee who asked the Copilot to provide a summary of pro bono work completed that month to add to their timecard and send to their manager. A detailed two-page summary document was created without issue; however, the address of all meetings was given as “123 Main Street, City, USA” — an error that’s easily noticed, but an indication of the care required by users when relying on Copilot.
The occurrence of hallucinations can be reduced by improving prompts, but Dentsu staff have been advised to treat outputs from the genAI assistant with caution. “The more context you can give it generally, the closer you’re going to get to a final output,” said Slade. “But it’s never going to replace the need for human review and fact check.
“As much as you can, level-set expectations and communicate to your first users that this is still an evolving technology. It’s a first draft, it’s not a final draft — it’s going to hallucinate and mess up sometimes.”
Tools that filter Copilot outputs are emerging that could help here, said Litan, but this is likely to remain a key challenge for businesses for the forseeable future.
Another risk relates to one of the major strengths of the Copilot: its ability to sift through files and data across a company’s M365 environment using natural language inputs.
While Copilot is only able to access files according to permissions granted to individual employees, the reality is that businesses often fail to adequately label sensitive documents. This means individual employees might suddenly realize they are able to ask Copilot to provide details on payroll or customer information if it hasn’t been locked down with the right permissions.
A 2022 report by data security firm Varonis claimed that one in 10 files hosted in SaaS environments is accessible by all staff; an earlier 2019 report put that figure — including cloud and on-prem files and folders — at 22%. In many cases, this can mean organization-wide permissions are granted to thousands of sensitive files, Varonis said.
In many cases, the most important data, around payroll, for instance, will have strict permissions in place. A greater challenge lies in securing unstructured data, with sensitive information finding its way into a wide range of documents created by individual employees — a store manager planning payroll in an Excel spreadsheet before updating a central system, for example. This is similar to a situation that the CTO of an unnamed US restaurant chain encountered during the EAP, said Litan. 
“There’s a lot of personal data that’s kept on spreadsheets belonging to individual managers,” said Litan. “There’s also a lot of intellectual property that’s kept on Word documents in SharePoint or Teams or OneDrive.”
“You don’t realize how much you have access to in the average company,” said Matt Radolec, vice president for incident response and cloud operations at Varonis. “An assumption you could have is that people generally lock this stuff down: they do not. Things are generally open.”
Another consideration is that employees often end up storing files relating to their personal lives on work laptops.
“Employees use their desktops for personal work, too — most of them don’t have separate laptops,” said Litan. “So you’re going to have to give employees time to get rid of all their personal data. And sometimes you can’t, they can’t just take it off the system that easily because they’re locked down — you can’t put USB drives in [to corporate devices, in some cases].
“So it’s just a lot of processes companies have to go through. I’m on calls with clients every day on the risk. This one really hits them.”
Getting data governance in order is a process that could take businesses more than a year to get sorted, said Litan. “There are no shortcuts. You’ve got to go through the entire organization and set up the permissions properly,” she said.
In Radolec’s view, very few M365 customers have yet adequately addressed the risks around data access within their organization. “I think a lot of them are just planning to do the blocking and tackling after they get started,” he said. “We’ll see to what degree of effectiveness that is [after launch]. We’re right around the corner from seeing how well people will fare with it.”
The Copilot for M365 pros and cons
Pros:

Boost to productivity. GenAI features can save time for users by automating certain tasks. 
Breadth of features. Copilot for M365 is built into the productivity apps that many workers use on a daily basis, including Word, Excel, Outlook and Teams. 
Responses generated by the Copilot for M365 are anchored in the emails, files, calendars, meetings, contacts, and other information contained in Microsoft 365. This means the Copilot for M365 can arguably offer greater insights into work data than any other generative AI tool. 
Enterprise-grade privacy and security controls. Unlike consumer AI assistants, Microsoft promises that customer data won’t be used to train Copilot models. It also offers tools to help manage access to data in M365 apps.   

Cons:

Price. GenAI isn’t cheap and M365 customers are required to pay a significant additional fee each month for access to Copilot features. An individual employee might not need access to Copilot in more than a couple ofM365 apps.
Need for employee training. Getting the most out of genAI tools will require guidance around effective prompts, particularly for employees that are unfamiliar with the technology — an additional cost businesses must factor in.
Accuracy and hallucinations. LLMs are notoriously unreliable, confidently offering answers that are incorrect. This is a particular concern when it comes to business data, and users must be on the lookout for errors in Copilot outputs.
Data protection risks. The ability for Copilot for M365 to access a wide range of corporate data means businesses must be careful to ensure that sensitive documents are not exposed.
The Copilot functionality in Excel is limited at this stage.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Nov 4, 2023, 6:17 PM EDTShare this story42 Comments / 42 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeThe US Copyright Office is taking public comment on potential new rules around generative AI’s use of copyrighted materials, and the biggest AI companies in the world had plenty to say. We’ve collected the arguments from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Hugging Face, StabilityAI, and Anthropic below, as well as a response from Apple that focused on copyrighting AI-written code.There are some differences in their approaches, but the overall message for most is the same: They don’t think they should have to pay to train AI models on copyrighted work. RelatedThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen nextBing, Bard, and ChatGPT: How AI is rewriting the internetThe Copyright Office opened the comment period on August 30th, with an October 18th due date for written comments regarding changes it was considering around the use of copyrighted data for AI model training, whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted without human involvement, and AI copyright liability. There’s been no shortage of copyright lawsuits in the last year, with artists, authors, developers, and companies alike alleging violations in different cases. Here are some snippets from each company’s response.Meta: Copyright holders wouldn’t get much money anywayImposing a first-of-its-kind licensing regime now, well after the fact, will cause chaos as developers seek to identify millions and millions of rightsholders, for very little benefit, given that any fair royalty due would be incredibly small in light of the insignificance of any one work among an Al training set. Google: AI training is just like reading a bookIf training could be accomplished without the creation of copies, there would be no copyright questions here. Indeed that act of “knowledge harvesting.” to use the Court’s metaphor from Harper & Row, like the act of reading a book ‘and learning the facts and ideas within it, would not only be non-infringing, it would further the very purpose of copyright law. The mere fact that, as a technological matter, copies need to be made to extract those ideas and facts from copyrighted works should not alter that result.Microsoft: Changing copyright law could hurt small AI developersAny requirement to obtain consent for accessible works to be used for training would chill Al innovation. It is not feasible to achieve the scale of data necessary to develop responsible Al models even when the identity of a work and its owner is known. Such licensing schemes will also impede innovation from start-ups and entrants who don’t have the resources to obtain licenses, leaving Al development to a small set of companies with the resources to run large-scale licensing programs or to developers in countries that have decided that use of copyrighted works to train Al models is not infringement.Anthropic: Current law is fine; don’t change itSound policy has always recognized the need for appropriate limits to copyright in order to support creativity, innovation, and other values, and we believe that existing law and continued collaboration among all stakeholders can harmonize the diverse interests at stake, unlocking AI’s benefits while addressing concern.Adobe: It’s fair use, like when Accolade copied Sega’s codeIn Sega v. Accolade, the Ninth Circuit held that intermediate copying of Sega’s software was fair use. The defendant made copies while reverse engineering to discover the functional requirements—unprotected information—for making games compatible with Sega’s gaming console. Such intermediate copying also benefited the public: it led to an increase in the number of independently designed video games (which contain a mix of functional and creative aspects) available for Sega’s console. This growth in creative expression was precisely what the Copyright Act was intended to promote.Anthropic: Copying is just an intermediate stepFor Claude, as discussed above, the training process makes copies of information for the purposes of performing a statistical analysis of the data. The copying is merely an intermediate step, extracting unprotectable elements about the entire corpus of works, in order to create new outputs. In this way, the use of the original copyrighted work is non-expressive; that is, it is not re-using the copyrighted expression to communicate it to users.Andreessen Horowitz: Investors have spent ‘billions and billions’Over the last decade or more, there has been an enormous amount of investment—billons and billions of dollars—in the development of AI technologies, premised on an understanding that, under current copyright law, any copying necessary to extract statistical facts is permitted. A change in this regime will significantly disrupt settled expectations in this area. Those expectations have been a critical factor in the enormous investment of private capital into U.S.-based AI companies which, in turn, has made the U.S. a global leader in AI. Undermining those expectations will jeopardize future investment, along with U.S. economic competitiveness and national security.Hugging Face: Training on copyrighted material is fair useThe use of a given work in training is of a broadly beneficial purpose: the creation of a distinctive and productive Al model. Rather than replacing the specific communicative expression of the initial work, the model is capable of creating a wide variety of different sort of outputs wholly unrelated to that underlying, copyrightable expression. For those and other reasons, generative Al models are generally fair use when they train on large numbers of copyrighted works. We use “generally” deliberately, however, as one can imagine patterns of facts that would raise tougher calls.StabilityAI: Other countries call AI model training fair useA range of jurisdictions including Singapore, Japan, the European Union, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Israel have reformed their copyright laws to create safe harbors for Al training that achieve similar effects o fair use.” In the United Kingdom, the Government Chief Scientific Advisor has recommended that “if the government’s aim is to promote an innovative Al industry in the UK, it should enable mining of available data, text, and images (the input) and utilise [sic] existing protections of copyright and IP law on the output of AI.Apple: Let us copyright our AI-made codeIn circumstances where a human developer controls the expressive elements of output and the decisions to modify, add to, enhance, or even reject suggested code, the final code that results from the developer’s interactions with the tools will have sufficient human authorship to be copyrightable.Comments42 Comments / 42 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Ring: step into the ring

Artificial Intelligence chatbots are everywhere. They have captured the public imagination and that of countless Silicon Valley inventors and investors since the arrival of ChatGPT about a year ago.
The stunning human-like abilities of conversational AI - a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to process and generate human language - have sparked widespread optimism about their potential to transform workplaces and increase productivity.
In what may be a world first, a UK school has appointed an AI chatbot as a “principal headteacher” to support its headmaster. While little is known about the nature of the AI behind it, the chatbot is meant to advise staff on issues such as helping pupils with ADHD and writing school policies.
But, before deploying chatbots in the workplace, it is crucial to understand what they are, how they work and how to use them responsibly. 
How chatbots work
Much has been written about the astounding abilities of generative AI, and its sometimes surprising ability to get things wrong.



Chatbots can be extremely useful but they can also get things wrong.

For example, an AI chatbot can craft a persuasive scholarly argument but, to use chatbot terminology, can “hallucinate” the list of references or get simple facts wrong. To understand why hallucinations occur it is important to understand how these chatbots work.
At their core, AI chatbots are powered by large language models (LLMs), large neural networks trained on massive datasets of text (what we lovingly call “the Internet”).
Importantly, LLMs do not store any data or knowledge in any traditional sense. Rather, when they are built (or “trained”) they encode, in large statistical structures, sophisticated content or language patterns contained in the training data.
Simply speaking, text is turned into numbers, or probabilities.

When in use, LLMs no longer have access to this training data. So when we ask it a question, the response is generated from scratch, every time. Technically, everything is “hallucinated”. When AI chatbots get things right, it is because much of human knowledge is patterned and embedded in language, not because “it knows”. 
By design, AI chatbots cannot produce definitive factual answers. They are probabilistic, not deterministic systems, and therefore cannot be relied on as authoritative sources of knowledge. But their ability to recognise linguistic patterns makes them excel at helping humans with tasks that involve text generation or enhancement. 
Writing persuasive arguments follows certain patterned regularities, whereas factual answers cannot reliably be generated from probabilistic patterns.
The new workplace assistant
Don’t think of your AI chatbot as an omniscient artificial brain, but as a gifted graduate student assigned to be your personal work assistant. 
Like an eager grad student, they work tirelessly and mostly competently on assigned tasks. However, they are also a little bit cocky. Always overconfident, they might  take risky shortcuts and provide answers that sound good but lack any factual grounding.



Chatbots can be used effectively as office assistants.

It is wise always to verify chatbot outputs, much as you would double-check a grad student’s work.
Because of their probabilistic foundation they don’t comprehend your question with any human understanding. But in the right roles, when used appropriately, chatbots greatly augment productivity on language-related tasks.
Working with AI chatbots
The three levels of chatbot capability can be summed up using the acronym ACE - assisting, creating, exploring.

assisting - chatbots can assist with many writing tasks, such as summarising, analysing and refining text, or extracting key points and themes. They can express arguments in academic text in more accessible ways.
creating - chatbots can generate original text, turning dot points into business reports or ideas. They can mimic different genres and write in different styles. As they encode countless bodies of text from different domains, they can be told to take a perspective, impersonating business strategists, scholars, marketers or journalists, to create content useful across many professions.
exploring – chatbots make intriguing “discussion partners” about hypothetical ideas (“what would happen if…”). When exploring new issues, let the chatbot set you questions then get it to answer them. If you want to explore what makes a good project report, or social media post, ask the chatbot to write one and then reflect on why it wrote what it did.

      The US just issued the world’s strongest action yet on regulating AI. Here’s what to expect




The business of chatbots
What do we know about the use of AI chatbots in the workplace so far? Some initial studies point to significant productivity gains. 
A pilot project at Westpac found a 46% productivity gain in software coding tasks, with no drop in quality. The experiment compared groups of developers using AI chatbots for a range of programming tasks with a control group that did not.
A study by global management company Boston Consulting Group also reported significant improvements.



Many workers are worried that their jobs could ultimately be replaced by chatbots.

In a controlled experiment, consultants used AI chatbots to problem-solve and develop new product ideas, which involved both analytical work and persuasive writing. Those who worked with the chatbot finished 12.2% more tasks, 25.1% more quickly, and at 40% higher quality, than those who didn’t.
In yet another case, an AI chatbot is reportedly being used by a US software company to help write proposals for clients. It scours thousands of internal files for relevant information to generate a suitable response, saving the company time.
These cases give glimpses into the future of AI chatbots, where companies fine-tune generative AI models with their own data or documents, using them for specialist roles such as coders, consultants or call-centre workers.
Many workers are worried AI will be used to automate their work. But given the probabilistic nature of the technology, and its inherent lack of reliability, we do not see automation as the most likely area of application.
AI chatbots might not be coming for your job after all, but they are certainly coming for your job description. AI fluency, the skill to understand and work with AI will soon become essential, similar to working with PCs.
Finally, you might ask, did we let a chatbot write this article? Of course we didn’t. Did we use one in writing it? Of course we did, much like we used a computer, and not a typewriter.

_The Conversation requires authors to disclose if they have used AI in the preparation of an article. Articles that use AI for fact-finding or idea generation will generally not be accepted.“

Artificial intelligence may lead to the end of human employment, Elon Musk warns
Jobs would only be there for personal satisfaction

A hot potato: Amid concerns over just how much generative AI will impact employment, Elon Musk has joined the debate with a warning that the technology threatens all human jobs. The world's richest man said the new wave of artificial intelligence tools have the potential to be the ""most disruptive force in history."" 
In a conversation between Musk and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak which took place at the end of the country's AI summit, the CEO had several warnings about the tech.
""We will have something that is, for the first time, smarter than the smartest human,"" Musk said. ""It's hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed.""
Musk added that in this scenario, people who wanted a job could have one for personal satisfaction, but AI would be able ""to do everything.""
""I don't know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable,"" Musk joked.

There was also a warning from the Tesla boss about humanoid robots. ""At least a car can't chase you into a building or up a tree,"" he told the audience, referencing the AI-related technologies being used in his company's vehicles.
Musk has long warned about the dangers of AI in the past, calling for regulation of advanced AI and a ban on the technology being used in weapons. He was also one of the 1,100 signatories who signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause on the development of advanced AIs in March over fears that, among other things, all jobs could become automated.
Musk, who launched a new AI venture called xAI seeking the ""true nature of the universe"" in July, did have some positive things to say about the technology in his talk with Sunak. He noted that ""one of my sons has trouble making friends and an AI friend would be great for him."" He also highlighted how these tools could be an excellent tutor for young people - but that could also raise job fears among teachers and teaching assistants.
The UK summit on AI focused on two areas: the risk of it being misused by bad actors, and any loss of control of advanced systems. But there were few new announcements related to regulation similar to Biden's recent executive order. Musk even took a jab at the summit before it began by posting a cartoon on X (below).

As the AI tsunami sweeps across the white-collar working world and fundamentally disrupts hundreds of millions of jobs, nearly 1 billion knowledge workers worldwide will be affected, and 14 million jobs will be wiped out. Disruption from artificial intelligence is just one of the major structural shifts that will define the American economy over the next few decades. But while white-collar professionals stare down a turbulent job market and declining wages, a large, unexpected segment of the workforce may be safely on high ground: blue-collar jobs. The likes of skilled trades, intensive manual labor, and jobs that require a combination of physical, knowledge, and social work will not be upended. In fact, as other long-term trends take hold, many of these working-class roles are poised for a job explosion.

As older Americans retire in massive numbers and leave behind open jobs, and as demand for healthcare, green energy, high-tech manufacturing, and construction increases, blue-collar jobs are going to see a substantial boom. ChatGPT will not replace the nurse who tends to you at the hospital or the construction worker who remodels your kitchen. The winners of the AI revolution will be the technicians, nurses, and plumbers who keep the new economy running after the machines have taken over the office.

The new economy could be a boon for the working class Describing the nature of factory work in the '90s, the American poet Philip Levine wrote, ""​​We stand in the rain / in a long line waiting at Ford Highland Park. For work. / You know what work is."" At the time, factory jobs in the Rust Belt had dwindled, job-seeking became undignified, and the nature of work grew monotonous and alienating. The decline of manufacturing sped up precipitously in the early 2000s as globalization pushed jobs overseas, low-skilled work was automated away, and the economy shifted toward desk jobs with the advent of the internet. Today, there's a hopeful reversal for American blue-collar jobs. While cognitive workers fight over rapidly disappearing remote jobs, industries such as semiconductor manufacturing have the opposite problem — too many jobs to fill. And that's true across working-class industries. Two years of a historically tight labor market and low unemployment have pushed wages up for lower- and middle-income workers, stimulating a working-class job boom that has seen 9.6 million job openings nationwide and what economists are calling ""full employment."" Over the next decade, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that the fastest-growing occupations will be in healthcare, transportation, renewable energy, and high-tech manufacturing.Nearly half of all job gains will come from the healthcare and social-support sectors. By 2032, one out of six new workers will be a home-health or personal-care aide. Construction, which has added 15,000 jobs a month over the past year, also has room to keep expanding.While manufacturing jobs as a whole are expected to stay flat, spending in this industry has boomed to $200 billion each year, tripling in the past five years. And certain sectors are expected to grow: The electrical-equipment and semiconductor industry is projected to reach 3% annual growth over the next decade. Chip manufacturing will continue to be a national priority, and that means a lot of well-paid jobs that require only a high-school education.

""There's going to be significant demand in manufacturing for the sorts of non-BA technician jobs,"" Mark Muro, an expert on technology and workforce development and a policy director at the Brookings Institution, told me. Within chip manufacturing, roughly 50% of entry-level workers have only a high-school or equivalent education level, compared with 38% for all other industries. Over the next 10 years, as the global semiconductor industry is primed to reach $1 trillion, another 50,000 American jobs will be added for roles such as electrical assemblers and industrial technicians.Despite inflation, real wages are higher for blue-collar, nonmanagerial, and lower- and middle-wage workers than they were before the pandemic.While not all working-class jobs will be safe from automation — retail workers, for instance, do not have a rosy outlook — there has been improvement across the board for lower-income workers. The initial shock of the pandemic hit low-wage workers the hardest, but the recovery since has been more auspicious. Wages have grown nearly three times as fast as in any other recovery period. The wages of the lowest 10th percentile of the workforce — earning an average of $12.50 an hour — grew only 3.9% from 2009 to 2017. But from March 2020 to March 2022, wages grew by 5.7%. Despite inflation, real wages are higher for blue-collar, nonmanagerial, and lower- and middle-wage workers than they were before the pandemic.

Other economic barometers also show steady improvements that are likely to continue. Over the past decade, the poverty rate in America has fallen from 14.8% to 11.5%. The net worth of the average household in the bottom 50% of Americans is up more than 45% from before the pandemic. If a recession is averted, the continuation of a tight labor market will continue to drive wages up, further reduce the poverty rate, and boost household income and net worth. Adding to the tailwinds is AI's adoption, which is likely to augment these jobs, leading to higher productivity growth over the coming decade. Increased labor productivity in the construction industry would be a boon for economic growth since housing scarcity remains one of the most pressing issues for Americans.

Who's safe from AI?In the World Economic Forum's recent joint report with Accenture, 19,000 individual tasks across nearly 900 occupations were analyzed for how much they could be affected by AI. The findings were pretty straightforward: Jobs with a high degree of personal interaction and nonroutine physical tasks faced the least amount of disruption from AI. Other recent projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and McKinsey have come to similar conclusions.""What characterizes the physical labor jobs that are safe for the next five or 10 years are things that are in an unpredictable physical environment,"" Kweilin Ellingrud, a McKinsey Global Institute director, told me. ""If it's in a predictable physical environment, and it's repetitive, then either a robot — likely even before generative AI — or some sort of generative AI can create the automation to do that well.""

One influential explanation for this is known as skill-biased technological change, a theory that says routine roles that are susceptible to automation and computerization will see declining wages, while nonroutine roles that require dexterity or human interaction will see increased demand and wages.  That's what recent research has found: Jobs such as air-conditioning installer, teacher, and hairdresser — jobs that are not routine — will be relatively unscathed over the next five to 10 years. Research led by OpenAI found that 4% of workers, including painters, carpenters, and roofers, had zero tasks that could be influenced by AI. And even though technology could infiltrate more of these roles, they fundamentally cannot be replaced by machines. Ellingrud said, ""Even though we have Roombas, we still have house cleaners because the Roomba can only do so much and isn't all that effective.""

Instead of replacing these jobs, AI will likely benefit specific roles by making it easier to do the most routine parts of the job. Nurses, for example, could spend less time collecting and entering information into a medical-record system. For an industry notorious for high hourly billing rates, allowing nurses to redeploy their time on more critical tasks — such as taking care of patients — would save Americans billions in annual healthcare costs. Similarly, the construction industry could benefit from new technology such as AI drones to do inspections or AI sensors that measure things, freeing up workers to do more.""You may get a bifurcation within these groups where the hands-on physical work remains, but generative AI picks up and substitutes for a lot of the management supervising,"" Muro told me. He added: ""There are these jobs that are in a middle ground where the physical work may remain but the supervision might be more exposed."" But instead of replacing workers, this kind of integration could help these types of roles be more productive, have more demand, and earn more money. Safe groundBlue-collar jobs are not only safe from AI's impact but also physically safer with the tech. AI's adoption in the workplace can help improve safety via real-time monitoring of risks and alerts for equipment issues or injuries. Each year in the US, there are 2.7 million workplace injuries and over 5,000 deaths as a result of workplace accidents, so any improvements would be significant. Though many of these working-class jobs may be physically or emotionally laborious, they are durable for the future. Broadly speaking, the jobs that will come out on top of the AI shuffle are good-quality jobs that provide steady work hours, upward mobility, and career support, as well as ""fair compensation and a degree of voice,"" Muro said.

As the economy gets increasingly precarious because of AI, the winners of this AI revolution will not need to swim a technological triathlon against oncoming waves — they will already be on elevated terrain, safely and skillfully working away.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.

The initial shock of the pandemic hit low-wage workers the hardest, but the recovery since has been more auspicious. Wages have grown nearly three times as fast as in any other recovery period. The wages of the lowest 10th percentile of the workforce — earning an average of $12.50 an hour — grew only 3.9% from 2009 to 2017. But from March 2020 to March 2022, wages grew by 5.7%. Despite inflation, real wages are higher for blue-collar, nonmanagerial, and lower- and middle-wage workers than they were before the pandemic.Other economic barometers also show steady improvements that are likely to continue. Over the past decade, the poverty rate in America has fallen from 14.8% to 11.5%. The net worth of the average household in the bottom 50% of Americans is up more than 45% from before the pandemic. If a recession is averted, the continuation of a tight labor market will continue to drive wages up, further reduce the poverty rate, and boost household income and net worth. Adding to the tailwinds is AI's adoption, which is likely to augment these jobs, leading to higher productivity growth over the coming decade. Increased labor productivity in the construction industry would be a boon for economic growth since housing scarcity remains one of the most pressing issues for Americans. In the World Economic Forum's recent joint report with Accenture, 19,000 individual tasks across nearly 900 occupations were analyzed for how much they could be affected by AI. The findings were pretty straightforward: Jobs with a high degree of personal interaction and nonroutine physical tasks faced the least amount of disruption from AI. Other recent projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and McKinsey have come to similar conclusions.""What characterizes the physical labor jobs that are safe for the next five or 10 years are things that are in an unpredictable physical environment,"" Kweilin Ellingrud, a McKinsey Global Institute director, told me. ""If it's in a predictable physical environment, and it's repetitive, then either a robot — likely even before generative AI — or some sort of generative AI can create the automation to do that well.""One influential explanation for this is known as skill-biased technological change, a theory that says routine roles that are susceptible to automation and computerization will see declining wages, while nonroutine roles that require dexterity or human interaction will see increased demand and wages.  That's what recent research has found: Jobs such as air-conditioning installer, teacher, and hairdresser — jobs that are not routine — will be relatively unscathed over the next five to 10 years. Research led by OpenAI found that 4% of workers, including painters, carpenters, and roofers, had zero tasks that could be influenced by AI. And even though technology could infiltrate more of these roles, they fundamentally cannot be replaced by machines. Ellingrud said, ""Even though we have Roombas, we still have house cleaners because the Roomba can only do so much and isn't all that effective."" Instead of replacing these jobs, AI will likely benefit specific roles by making it easier to do the most routine parts of the job. Nurses, for example, could spend less time collecting and entering information into a medical-record system. For an industry notorious for high hourly billing rates, allowing nurses to redeploy their time on more critical tasks — such as taking care of patients — would save Americans billions in annual healthcare costs. Similarly, the construction industry could benefit from new technology such as AI drones to do inspections or AI sensors that measure things, freeing up workers to do more.""You may get a bifurcation within these groups where the hands-on physical work remains, but generative AI picks up and substitutes for a lot of the management supervising,"" Muro told me. He added: ""There are these jobs that are in a middle ground where the physical work may remain but the supervision might be more exposed."" But instead of replacing workers, this kind of integration could help these types of roles be more productive, have more demand, and earn more money. Blue-collar jobs are not only safe from AI's impact but also physically safer with the tech. AI's adoption in the workplace can help improve safety via real-time monitoring of risks and alerts for equipment issues or injuries. Each year in the US, there are 2.7 million workplace injuries and over 5,000 deaths as a result of workplace accidents, so any improvements would be significant. Though many of these working-class jobs may be physically or emotionally laborious, they are durable for the future. Broadly speaking, the jobs that will come out on top of the AI shuffle are good-quality jobs that provide steady work hours, upward mobility, and career support, as well as ""fair compensation and a degree of voice,"" Muro said.  As the economy gets increasingly precarious because of AI, the winners of this AI revolution will not need to swim a technological triathlon against oncoming waves — they will already be on elevated terrain, safely and skillfully working away.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.",,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Grace DeGraaf'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is It Worth Training in Generative A.I.?

No matter what your role in tech, learning the basics of generative A.I. could impact your job opportunities going forward. Workers across the economy are rushing to adopt this technology as fast as possible.

Online learning platform Udemy saw a 5,226 percent increase in ChatGPT-related learning in the first quarter of 2023, and generalized A.I.-related skills learning on Udemy Business has risen by 60 percent year-over-year, according to its 2024 Learning & Skills Trend Report. “Employees must have the skills required to leverage and work with this new technology effectively,” the report added.

Udemy cites a McKinsey report stating that 30 percent of work hours across the U.S. economy could be automated by 2030, while a PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis concludes that A.I., automation and robotics could collectively contribute $15 trillion to global GDP by that same year.

With that rise in automation, there’s also the possibility that generative A.I. could unlock opportunities for tech pros (and other workers) to have more than one job, according to a recent study by Morgan Stanley (hat tip to Business Insider for the breakdown). “The advent of cheap or free and rapidly democratized access to generative A.I. tools,” that paper concluded, could generate as much as $83 billion of the $400 billion in income expected from multiple jobs by the end of the decade.

For software engineers and others who build software, pay attention to how generative A.I. will increasingly automate code creation and review. In theory, that kind of automation will free up engineers and developers to focus their time and energy on the more creative aspects of their jobs, such as coming up with new features. It may also enable a new generation of “citizen developers” to build apps with a minimum level of programming knowledge, thanks to low- and no-code platforms.

If you’re interested in working more deeply with A.I., another report from McKinsey, Technology Trends Outlook 2023, suggests you master the following concepts:

Machine learning
Computer vision
Natural-language processing
Deep reinforcement learning

Yes, A.I. may eliminate some jobs—but it could also create far more, including ones with high six-figure or even seven-figure salaries.

This year has produced an upsurge in tools that allow the public to use generative artificial intelligence to produce text, images, audio, and video, frequently in the voice of real people. Federal legislators have been both astounded and concerned by this progress, and many are clamoring to craft an appropriate regulatory response. Consensus has yet to emerge, but Congress can look to state legislatures — often referred to as the laboratories of democracy — for inspiration regarding how to address the opportunities and challenges posed by AI.
This year, Congress has held committee hearings and proposed many bills to address the perceived threats and promises of this new technology. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and a bipartisan team of senators have each announced frameworks to guide forthcoming AI legislation. To underscore the extraordinary nature of this issue, on September 13, Schumer assembled two-thirds of the Senate, major technology CEOs, and labor and civil rights leaders for a closed-door AI Insights Forum. Participants — including tech mogul Elon Musk, OpenAI founder Sam Altman, and the Center for Humane Technology’s Tristan Harris — overwhelmingly agreed that AI regulation is necessary.
As our colleagues Faiza Patel and Ivey Dyson have noted, the European Union is steps ahead of the United States and has already provided a potential model for federal regulation with its AI Act. Meanwhile, closer to home, 30 states have passed more than 50 laws over the last five years to address AI in some capacity, with attention greatly increasing year over year.
No existing state legislation matches the ambitious European proposals. Instead, states have entered the space incrementally, passing laws that tackle discrete policy concerns or establish entities to study the potential consequences of AI and make policy recommendations. While much of the enacted legislation does not directly address AI’s impact on elections, laws in California, Texas, Minnesota, and Washington do, and more such laws have been proposed.
This summer, the National Conference of State Legislatures published a report aimed at building consensus around common definitions of AI terms, circulating best practices in AI regulation, and increasing awareness of key risks. The report cautions that “there will be a race to the bottom for AI if no guardrails are offered.”
State legislation often foreshadows federal solutions. Several trends have emerged from state-level AI regulation that merit attention from Washington, DC.

LinkedIn Premium Launches Generative AI Personalization of Posts and Job Listings



Eric Hal Schwartz  on November 1, 2023 at 9:00 am


LinkedIn has augmented the generative AI features of its Premium service with an eye toward boosting personalization and productivity for subscribers. The revamped experience uses advanced analytics to provide tailored insights, career recommendations, and other enhancements.
Generating Personalized Explanations
LinkedIn leverages generative AI to examine content, including posts, articles, and videos, uncovering potential opportunities for the user and and ideas they may find interesting. The AI will even suggest ways the user can take action based on the information pulled from the content. This automated extraction can save time if a user doesn’t want to go through a long piece of is looking for something specific, a kind of personal ‘too long; didn’t read’ summary. The feature also employs Microsoft Bing’s generative AI to answer queries about trending topics, in general, then culled from expert perspectives both on LinkedIn and across the web.
The other new generative AI feature for Premium subscribers helps with seeking a job. When looking at a job post, users can ask about whether they are a fit for the role and the AI will personalize its response to their experience. Users can also learn more about the position, company, and industry by conversing with LinkedIn’s AI, and even get help with preparing or the interview. LinkedIn suggests integrating these formerly disjointed steps into a single interface can build user confidence and boost the potential for a successful career move.
“Whether you’re navigating career changes, building a business, learning a new skill or crafting your voice, your new AI-powered LinkedIn experience — your trusted coach, advisor, co-pilot, assistant, and colleague combined — is your partner in staying ahead,” LinkedIn chief product officer Tomer Cohen explained in a blog post. “Today, we’re starting this journey with the rollout of a new Premium experience, launching to a select group of Premium subscribers. These members will see more personalization with every interaction, from how to get smarter about important topics to personalized career actions they can take. It will include personalized takeaways and nudges, from suggestions for skills you should build, to professionals in your network to reach out to for any question you have (we’ll even help you craft personalized messages to kickstart those conversations).”
LinkedIn AI Everywhere
The new generative features continue LinkedIn’s ongoing infusion of the technology across its platform. LinkedIn began the year by offering to turn written prompts into profile content, job descriptions, and advertising copy. The tools later expanded to helping users write posts and updates on the social media platform, including professional news and comments on the industry. LinkedIn’s latest upgrade introduced several such tools to enhance its recruiting, skill-building, and marketing platforms just last month.
The company is initially rolling out the revamped Premium to a small test group as it gathers feedback to refine the experience before expanding availability. The goal is to provide members with greater value through ever-more tailored insights and suggestions from AI-enabled interactions.

In 2017, during a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) public comment period, bots flooded the agency with more than a million comments from fake constituents calling for the repeal of net neutrality rules. Regulators uncovered this covert attempt to subvert the policy process, but only because hundreds of thousands of the comments were uncannily similar. In the six years since, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have only grown more sophisticated, and similar efforts to deceive policymakers promise to become increasingly difficult to detect and prevent. This troubling risk and its implications for participatory government call for urgent action.
The practice of open and responsive government is integral to the American tradition. Underlying it is the principle that the public should have ample access to information and opportunity to weigh in on important policy decisions. New technologies, from the invention of the telegraph to the explosion of social media, have produced new pathways for public democratic engagement. Yet these same technologies often create new tools that can be used to misrepresent public opinion and distort policymaking. AI is no exception.
As with prior technological revolutions, developments in AI hold promise: in time, they could enhance government’s ability to understand what the public wants and to help citizens participate in policy decisions. In particular, automated summation and analysis could be deployed to augment officials’ capacity to digest public feedback. But these potential benefits can only be realized alongside guardrails to ensure that AI systems are accurate and fit for the purposes at hand, to prevent system biases from reflecting sociohistorical inequities and diminishing the voices of specific communities, and to mitigate the effects when such outcomes occur.
The FCC episode exemplifies how antagonists can use AI tools to undermine authentic public input on government decision-making. New developments in generative AI enable vastly more sophisticated mass deception efforts that effectively mimic individuals’ feedback on public policy, begetting the danger that officials will be duped or diverted by hard-to-detect AI-generated content. Using generative AI, fraudsters can produce mountains of seemingly genuine policy submissions from fake stakeholders to manipulate perceptions of public sentiment. If maliciously deployed at sufficient scale, such efforts can erode government’s ability to be responsive to the American people — and ultimately undermine the people’s trust in government. Public officials who administer elections, meanwhile, face acute risks that bad faith actors will exploit AI tools to amplify baseless concerns about the election process, distract from voter needs ahead of (or on) Election Day, or drown offices in bot-delivered document requests that are difficult to identify as AI-generated.
These hazards require targeted policy intervention. To address these concerns, government institutions should take the following steps:

Implement high-accuracy systems to verify human activity where feasible, with special attention to accessibility and data privacy.
Expand accessible opportunities for in-person participation in government decision-making, including open public hearings and town halls.
Consistently implement surveys directed to known constituents, such as those who have utilized government services or received public benefits, to get feedback on program implementation.
Modify applicable laws and rules so that agencies have the authority to disregard document requests and submissions on proposed regulations shown to have been fraudulently transmitted by bots or automated systems, including those powered by generative AI.
Establish guardrails to regulate governmental use of AI to analyze, summarize, or aggregate public comments or substantially assist in the drafting of rules or public policy, including by setting requirements to guard against bias and ensure accuracy.
Engage regularly with civic organizations to better understand how stakeholders and constituents are using AI to interact with and advocate to government.

Citizen Participation and Government Responsiveness: AI as a Tool to Distort Perceptions of Public Sentiment 
As the political theorist Robert Dahl famously observed, “a key characteristic of democracy is the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens.” Politicians, pundits, and scholars alike have long debated whether American government fulfills this promise. Historically, much of the focus has been on forces that undermine citizens’ ability to choose their leaders — like outright mass disenfranchisement, legislative malapportionment, and gerrymandering — along with forces that shape incentives for public officials, like the outsize role of wealthy campaign donors and the corollary risk of corruption. Yet a basic prerequisite for responsiveness is the ability of officials to assess what the public actually wants. Before policymakers can address constituent preferences, they must first be able to glean what those preferences are.
Of course, policymakers have a range of tools to help them understand what the public wants. Some of these tools, like opinion polls, are relatively insulated from distortion by AI (at least for now). But other methods are far more vulnerable to AI manipulation than polling, particularly when polling relies on methods such as address-based recruitment. And polling’s limitations — including its meager ability to capture nuanced positions and views rendered in detail — are well known, which is why methods of direct engagement with the public and solicitation of public input are still essential. Here, we briefly consider two vulnerable tools for learning citizens’ inclinations: correspondence directed to elected officials and online public comments submitted to regulatory agencies. 
Elected officials from presidents to county commissioners have long relied on written communications to keep a finger on the pulse of their constituents, especially the subset of informed voters attuned to a particular issue. In the past, outside groups have tried to skew assessments of constituent sentiment through astroturfing, the process of recruiting individuals to send often-prewritten form letters to give the false appearance of bona fide grassroots sentiment. However, generative AI allows malicious actors to create, with ease and on a massive scale, unique communications from fake constituents ostensibly advocating policy positions, which greatly complicates the task of detecting efforts to skew perceptions of popular preferences. 
Can elected officials discern AI-generated content from authentic, human-authored constituent mail? Recent research suggests not. In 2020, researchers conducted a field experiment in which they sent roughly 35,000 emails advocating positions on a range of policy issues to more than 7,000 state legislators. Half were written by humans; the other half were written by GPT-3, the then-cutting-edge generative AI model. To explore whether legislators could recognize AI-generated content, the study compared response rates to the human-written and AI-generated correspondence (on the theory that legislators would not waste their time responding to appeals from AI bots). On three issues, the response rates for AI- and human-written messages were statistically indistinguishable. On three other issues, the response rates to AI-generated emails were lower — but only by 2 percent on average.
This finding suggests that an antagonist capable of easily generating thousands of unique communications could potentially skew legislators’ perceptions of the issues most important to their constituents and of constituents’ views on any given issue. Moreover, many of the inconsistencies and problems that some legislators reported as helping them identify suspicious content are becoming less prevalent with more advanced AI models. For example, GPT-3 struggled with logical consistency in writing an email taking a conservative position on gun control legislation, but GPT-4’s updated algorithms are better equipped to avoid such issues. State-of-the-art open-source models, too, are now advanced enough for these writing tasks, making it difficult — if not impossible — to put the genie back in the bottle. 
Generative AI could also threaten democratic responsiveness by undermining the main mechanism for incorporating public input into the regulatory process: the public comment period. Administrative agencies play a vital role in policymaking — particularly at the federal level — but their relative insulation from electoral politics can raise concerns about accountability to the public. The notice-and-comment process, while far from perfect, is one of the principal tools that unelected agency officials use to assess public preferences during agency rulemaking. Technology, especially the advent of e-rulemaking in 2002, has long been heralded as a way to address concerns about democratic accountability by “enhanc[ing] public participation . . . so as to foster better regulatory decisions.” The Regulations.gov website, the official clearinghouse for information related to agency rulemaking, invites ordinary citizens to “Make a difference. Submit your comments and let your voice be heard.” 
But as the bot-driven disruption of the FCC’s net neutrality rulemaking shows, this process is susceptible to subversion. Whereas a crush of comments with suspiciously similar language patterns unmasked the net neutrality scheme, new generative AI technologies can easily overcome this problem by creating millions of unique and varied comments advancing a given policy position. As a result, agencies will find it much more difficult to determine which comments genuinely represent prevailing public sentiment, or even the views of the most directly interested stakeholders. 
Recognizing the threat that malicious AI use poses, technology firms are racing to produce tools that can identify AI-generated text. However, the challenges to doing so effectively are difficult and protean. In July 2023, OpenAI discontinued its AI classifier tool because of its limited accuracy. Given the requirements regarding public comments enshrined in the Administrative Procedures Act, only a highly accurate screening tool would likely pass muster in the context of federal rulemaking processes. And even if future advances succeed in producing reliable and effective tools, access to and ability to use them may vary across offices and levels of government.
Election-Specific Challenges: AI as a Tool to Divert Resources and Distort Perceptions of Public Need 
Generative AI’s potential to disrupt the work of election offices poses a major risk to democracy. Open records laws (also called sunshine laws) are vital transparency tools that let the public peer into the inner workings of government and hold officials accountable. But in past election cycles, election deniers have weaponized such laws to distract and overload officials at some election offices, supplanting the important work of election administration at crucial junctures. In the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections, citizens mobilized by well-funded and conspiracy-addled national groups — with connections to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — inundated local election offices with document requests. Some such requests sought sensitive information like cast vote records, election security protocols, or voting machine serial numbers. While state public records laws may rightly prevent election offices from disclosing information that endangers election security, local officials do not universally know what information must or must not be disclosed in response to requests for records. In the future, election deniers and other malicious actors could step up such efforts by deploying bots powered by generative AI. State laws typically do not limit the use of bots to submit mass-produced requests, nor do they permit officials to decline to respond to automated mass-produced requests — even if the intent is to divert officials’ attention from the critical work of administering elections ahead of Election Day.
Election offices also depend on public input to deliver relevant information about elections and to prioritize tasks in the face of extremely limited resources. Election officials must know about the needs of people with disabilities, minority language groups, and other disadvantaged communities — particularly when those groups encounter issues attempting to register to vote or cast a ballot on Election Day. Officials must also be aware of common areas of confusion about how to vote and be able to effectively address concerns about election security among target groups. 
Malicious use of generative AI could put those essential roles at risk. Deceptive AI-generated mass comments that distort or drown out genuine public questions and feedback could result in inadequate support for needful voters and misdirected voter education efforts. They could also add fuel to restrictive voter rules that create more barriers to voting by creating the impression that baseless fears about the election process are more prevalent; in the past, disinformation purveyors have exploited unfounded fears about election integrity to push through policies that restrict voting access without legitimate justification. AI-assisted distortion of perceived public need could thus make election officials less responsive to voters, less able to communicate vital election information, and less likely to give voters information about the matters they care about most.
Cause for (Tempered) Optimism: AI’s Potential Benefits for Participatory and Responsive Government and Needed Guardrails
If generative AI and other AI tools pose risks for participatory and responsive government, they also present opportunities — most notably their potential to help policymakers better manage and respond to comments, feedback, and questions from the public. But governmental use of AI to substantially assist in sensitive tasks also warrants standards to prevent improper, biased, or inaccurate results. (Substantially assist means employing an AI system to perform a task more complex than, say, alphabetizing documents or sorting them by date or file size.)
Government offices already use non-generative AI to provide information to the public and to respond in real time to constituents seeking information or services. Many government bodies in the United States and elsewhere use AI-powered chatbots to provide 24/7 constituent assistance. Typically not powered by generative AI, these tools tend to be rule-based chatbots that recognize keywords and churn out pre-vetted responses, or conversational agents (similar to Apple’s Siri) that use machine learning and natural language processing to assist constituents. Although chatbots often face public resistance — more than half of respondents expressed negative views about interacting with them in one survey — as they improve, these non-generative-AI technologies could help governments conserve resources and be more responsive if offices implement adequate safeguards to ensure their proper use.
Policymakers at every level of government take in a large volume of outreach from the public that strains the ability of already overstretched staff to respond. These challenges have been thoroughly documented in the context of federal rulemaking. Agencies can receive tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of comments on a particular proposed policy, most of which receive perfunctory treatment. Local administrative bodies similarly struggle to respond to citizen communication requests, feedback, and questions. For example, in an audit of responsiveness to requests for information about how to apply for public housing, around 40 percent of requests, on average, received no reply. Fielding outreach from the public is also a major focus for Congress and state and local legislatures. The Congressional Management Foundation has estimated that many congressional offices dedicate roughly 50 percent of staff resources to managing and responding to constituent communications.
Responding to public outreach imposes opportunity costs on government offices, but neglecting to do so is also problematic. Failure to receive a response from government officials can erode citizens’ perceptions of officials’ political efficacy and cause constituents to become more disengaged from the political process. In some cases, it can have even more immediate and tangible consequences, such as citizens not finding information or assistance needed to receive benefits they are entitled to. It can be especially troubling when nonelected government officials ignore or pass over messages from the public. In the federal rulemaking context, the well-documented tendency of regulators to discount most comments that focus on policy preferences or values in favor of a few relatively detailed technical comments (often from industry or other established stakeholders) arguably undercuts the democratic legitimacy of administrative decisions affecting millions of people’s lives. It also tends to skew policy outcomes in favor of more powerful constituencies with the resources to amass the sort of technical information that agency staff are likely to respond to. 
AI could potentially address these shortcomings and improve agency rulemaking processes. Several recent articles have explored how new AI tools could help agency staff review and summarize the thousands or even millions of public comments received in high-profile rulemakings. For instance, regulators could use language models trained on the corpus of materials and comments relevant to rulemakings to assist in processing, synthesizing, and summarizing information provided by the public. This strategy could nudge regulators to consider more value-focused comments in crafting policy. AI tools could improve other aspects of the notice-and-comment process as well — for example, by helping regulators detect and screen out automated, misattributed, or otherwise spurious comments (though significant challenges with detection of AI-generated content persist, as described above). And, although American commentators have mostly focused on the use of AI in regulatory processes, national legislatures in other countries are also experimenting with ways to use AI to collect and organize citizen input.
Generative AI could also facilitate citizen engagement with government officials during the notice-and-comment process. Some analysts have suggested that AI could be used to alert potential commenters to topics of interest, help them review rule text, summarize technical literature, and even compose comments. Such tools could also help members of the public who would otherwise lack the time or confidence to participate in the public comment process. Again, however, issues related to the accuracy, bias, and quality of information produced by generative AI must be addressed. 
The potential benefits notwithstanding, the use of more sophisticated machine-learning and language-processing AI tools — even those not powered by generative AI — carries significant risks. AI systems need adequate testing, vetting of training data quality, and human oversight to ensure that they provide accurate, accessible, and beneficial information to the public. Bias is a major concern. For instance, an AI bot employed by a local government might provide different answers to constituents writing in about city services based on the neighborhoods they live in. Or an AI conversational agent might struggle to process certain accents or vernacular languages — scenarios that could differentially affect poor communities, communities of color, and non-English-dominant communities. 
Guardrails governing AI’s use for these purposes are imperative. Using AI to review, summarize, and screen public comments presents the same accuracy and bias concerns as its use in other contexts. People are justifiably squeamish at the thought of AI replacing human deliberation in government decision-making. One concern is that “no one at the agency [will] actually read the comments and grapple[] with their arguments.” And AI tools could be used not only to review and summarize comments but also to generate responses to justify an agency’s predetermined approach. Enforceable standards are needed to ensure that AI tools review and summarize comments accurately and without bias, and also to keep human decision-makers active in the thinking work of responding to those comments and, where warranted, incorporating them into final policy decisions. 
Policy Solutions 
Implement Accurate, Effective Systems to Verify Human Activity, with Special Attention to Accessibility and Data Privacy
Governing bodies should implement policies that guard against the malicious use of bots to lodge mass AI-generated comments intended to warp officials’ perceptions of public sentiment. Systems that verify human activity can achieve this in part, but they can also add friction for users, create data privacy concerns, and decrease access for Americans with disabilities. Most federal agencies invite public comments on rulemakings via Regulations.gov, which employs the reCAPTCHA human verification system to bolster the integrity of the comment submission process. (CAPTCHA stands for “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart.”) Although not foolproof, reCAPTCHA helps distinguish between human and bot activity. Regulations.gov uses a new generation of reCAPTCHA that increases accessibility over prior generations, presenting users with a simple “Are you a robot?” checkbox as a first-order challenge while analyzing user behavior to identify signs of bot activity. However, at least one study has found that this version of reCAPTCHA still introduces obstacles for people with visual impairments; it also collects some user data in determining whether users are human. 
Government entities — including Congress, state agencies, and departments that administer open records laws — should incorporate human verification systems into their processes for inviting public comments and receiving document requests. Officials should continually assess CAPTCHA and other verification methods as system capabilities evolve, selecting those that maximize security and accessibility. Officials should pay close attention to the evolving use of generative AI to defeat existing CAPTCHA systems and the need for novel systems to replace them. Laws and regulations should mandate minimal, task-necessary data collection and retention, forbid offices from sharing collected data, and compel periodic deletion of captured constituent data. Government offices and verification system vendors should also be required to disclose details about data collection and storage (without substantially compromising system efficacy by revealing to would-be fraudsters how to circumvent defenses). And government offices should provide alternate submission and verification methods for people with disabilities and those without access to technology or high-speed internet.
Create Opportunities for In-Person Participation and Direct Surveys to Known Constituents 
As the problem of deceptive bot-generated public comments becomes more disruptive, governing bodies should explore modes of participation that are relatively impervious to distortion through generative AI. Opportunities for in-person participation could include public hearings, town halls, and other similar forums. Public hearings and town halls should be held in locations, within regions, and at times that allow a broad cross section of the public to participate. Governing institutions should implement best practices to increase access for people with disabilities, communities of color, and immigrant communities. Such best practices should include offering simultaneous interpretation by interpreters familiar with relevant policy terminology where non-English-dominant communities constitute a threshold percentage of the constituent public; providing American Sign Language interpreters and other appropriate public accommodations; and ensuring, where possible, that hearings are reachable by public transportation.
Because town halls and public hearings typically lack representativeness and are limited in scope, agencies and governing bodies should also consistently incorporate tools like surveys directed to known constituents — for example, those who have utilized government services or applied for public benefits — to capture public insight, sentiment, and feedback. Such surveys would offer valuable feedback on program implementation and service delivery. Officials should conduct survey outreach in a way that enhances the integrity and inclusiveness of the information-gathering process while not unduly burdening recipients. To mitigate the risk of distortion through deceptive AI use, online surveys should employ effective, accessible, and privacy-protecting human verification systems, and they could be offered on a uniform cross-agency platform.
Authorize Government Entities to Disregard Input on Proposed Regulations Transmitted via Fraudulent Use of Bots or Automated Systems 
The federal Administrative Procedure Act, state administrative laws, and open records laws require that governing bodies consider submissions from the public on proposed rules within defined time spans and provide timely responses to document requests, with certain exceptions. Currently, however, no exception exists for comments and requests submitted using AI tools with the intent to distort policymaking or divert resources. When evidence strongly indicates that comments on proposed rules or records requests have been transmitted duplicitously using bots or automated systems, federal and state laws should allow agencies to decline to consider those submissions and requests. 
Regulations and policies governing fraudulent AI use should cover the impersonation or replication of human activity using bots or other automated systems that significantly mispresents the scale of human involvement behind their output. Such a standard should not capture, for instance, the use of generative AI by an individual or organization to assist in the drafting of comments or the use of form letters when endorsed by actual humans — a benchmark that might negatively affect disadvantaged communities. Rather, it should implicate the use of bots or automated systems, powered by generative AI or otherwise, to transmit numerous policy submissions intended to skew official perceptions of the numbers of humans involved in submitting such content or to convey open records requests from nonexistent people. Ample notice and opportunity for appeal should be given for any such determination. Given the current limitations of detection capabilities for generative AI content, and detection tools’ documented history of misclassifying content from non-native English speakers, detection tools should not be deployed unless they meet rigorous standards.
Establish Guardrails for Governmental Use of AI to Analyze Public Comments or Substantially Assist in Drafting Rules or Public Policy 
While AI presents opportunities to enhance policymakers’ responsiveness to their constituents, it can also introduce risks of bias, inaccuracy, and unreliability that must be addressed before such systems are put into use. Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state agencies should implement safeguards for governmental AI use to mitigate these risks, including enforceable requirements that apply to government use of AI to analyze public comments, interact with constituents, and substantially assist in the drafting of regulations, laws, and policies. For federal use of AI, Congress should direct the Organization of Management and Budget (OMB) to promulgate regulations setting out minimum thresholds for quality of training data and AI system accuracy — including standards that address bias deriving from reinforcement learning from human feedback, prohibit algorithmic discrimination as defined by regulation, and require a baseline level of human involvement in and supervision of government decision-making and public communications substantially aided by AI. Lawmakers should also limit the types of information that AI systems can examine when assessing public comments as part of rulemakings governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (for example, restricting the use of actual or predicted race to attempt to correlate sentiment with race).
Congress should also:

facilitate the development of testing methods to assess AI systems against the aforementioned requirements for the specific use of AI in analyzing public comment and drafting public policy;
mandate documentation by government bodies and AI system vendors of compliance with these requirements;
obligate government bodies to institute mitigation measures where needed, and prohibit the deployment of AI systems, including generative AI systems, for the purpose of analyzing public comment or drafting public policy, when they fail to meet established requirements and their flaws cannot be reasonably mitigated;
compel government bodies to continually monitor the use of AI systems after they are tested and implemented;
set transparency mandates for the use of AI to substantially assist in federal government decision-making and processes; and
require government bodies to disclose their use of AI systems, the purpose for their use, the main system parameters for sorting information or making predictions, the data sources used to train them, and the level of human involvement in and review of important AI-assisted decisions and public communications. 

Consistent with President Biden’s recent executive order on AI, OMB and the Office of Personnel Management should incorporate similar directives into guidance for federal agencies. And state legislatures should adopt comparable requirements for state government use of AI systems.
Seek to Better Understand How Constituents Use Generative AI to Compose Comments on Rulemakings and Other Policy Submissions 
Agencies should continually engage with civic organizations to ascertain how stakeholders from diverse communities are using AI to interface with government and to identify any gaps in public education and awareness. Civic organizations should provide guidance to constituents who wish to use generative AI to assist in composing comments on proposed rules and other policy submissions. They should offer advice on the necessary specificity of prompts, the need to review comments ahead of submission to ensure that they accurately reflect the commenters’ preferences, the prudence of fact-checking information produced by AI tools, the cultural biases inherent to some AI systems, and the possibility that AI tools will produce false or misdirected content or content that fails to reflect the constituents’ genuinely held views.

As the digital revolution rapidly reshapes the tech talent landscape with ever-evolving AI tools, companies are strategically adapting to meet future workforce demands. Generative AI has emerged as a driving force across diverse sectors, from manufacturing and finance to healthcare and automobiles, streamlining manual processes and sparking innovation.How is Generative AI transforming workplaces?Generative AI's constant evolution is reshaping skill requirements, urging the adoption of new abilities. In 2026, this evolution will create fresh opportunities in India, with a demand for over 1 million AI/ML/Big Data analytics professionals.To address this shift, upskilling is crucial. It equips employees to navigate generative AI's impact and overcome skill gaps. Surprisingly, despite the pressing need for new skills, 78% of Indian workers lack these critical capabilities, despite 90% of Indian leaders recognizing the need for new skills in preparation for AI-driven growth.How to minimise the impact of AI on jobs?Foster upskilling: By providing opportunities for employees to enhance their skills, organisations can not only boost productivity but also drive innovation with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Identify skill gaps: In order to navigate the ever-changing job market, it is essential for employees to actively seek career guidance and regularly assess their skills. By understanding their current skill set and identifying any gaps, employees can take proactive measures to bridge those gaps and ensure they remain competitive and adaptable in their respective fields.Harbour capabilities with AI: Creativity in training AI involves thinking outside the box and leveraging AI's capabilities to enhance our own, rather than viewing it as a threat. By fostering a collaborative environment, we can guide AI to work in harmony with us, thereby unlocking new possibilities and driving innovation.Cross-Industry collaboration: By fostering collaboration between industries, we can share best practices and strategies for integrating AI. This not only helps in preserving existing jobs but also paves the way for creating new ones. It encourages a collective growth mindset, where industries learn from each other's successes and mistakes, leading to more effective AI integration strategies that benefit everyone.According to Jagmohan Bhanver, Founder &amp; CEO, Talgro, ""Upskilling is crucial in the ever-changing Indian and global industries. It's vital to recognize that generative AI can assist in reducing employee burnout stemming from manual tasks. Embracing AI within companies and acquiring new skill sets can lead to increased productivity and innovation, positively impacting businesses. And with Talgro, we ensure that businesses and employees flourish by tailoring skills to individual needs, fostering adaptation and growth.""With AI constantly advancing, it is essential to upskill in order to cope with evolving job requirements and overcome any limitations. Talgro, an online assessment partner for the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), has clocked over 500,000 users on its platform. Talgro, India's First skill assessment platform, uses AI-powered systems to help people upskill and stay updated. With a team of over 300 mentors, including industry experts, Talgro provides comprehensive support to companies looking to enhance their employees' proficiency in AI. They offer personalised learning and pre/post-assessment tools to drive effective upskilling and reskilling initiatives. Talgro also offers a diverse selection of over 30 courses that cover both perishable and durable skills, empowering individuals to adapt to today's rapidly evolving job landscape.(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by PNN. will not be responsible in any way for the content of the same)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,2024-10-31T10:27:12+05:30,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",
