Five Questions Lawyers Should Ask About AI
By Laura van Wyngaarden, Co-Founder & COO of legal AI company, Diligen
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest emerging technologies, rapidly gaining momentum as it promises to transform the way we work. Buzz around its ability to automate work and predict outcomes is exciting, yet the chatter often clouds our perceptions and complicates the realities of introducing this powerful technology into the practice of law.
As those in the legal industry debate AI’s merits and risks, ponder their responsibilities to it, and attempt to foresee the future of the profession, we serve ourselves well by considering these five thought-provoking questions about the use of AI in the legal practice:
1 – Do lawyers have an ethical responsibility to leverage AI in the practice of law?
Lawyers are well versed in the ethical responsibilities of their profession, but what does ethical responsibility look like when it comes to new technologies, such as machine learning and AI?
Consider the tech that precedes these newcomers—email, electronic case organization and eDiscovery. At one time each of these seemed like risky new technologies, yet now they are part of the responsible practice of law. But, what about AI?
Let’s consider an example from another field. If a surgeon could adopt the latest surgical tools and improve a patient’s chances of survival – do they have an ethical obligation to do so? Would we consider them unethical if they refused to learn new techniques and thus gave their parents riskier operations than necessary?
AI-powered legal tech has the power to help lawyers do faster, more thorough and more cost effective legal work. If we can do this work better and more efficiently for our clients – do we have a responsibility to do so? While leveraging AI may not yet be considered an ethical obligation, I suspect this is a conversation we will be having many more times in the years ahead.
2 – Does entrusting technology with a greater role in the law create or mitigate risk?
Initially, the introduction of virtually any new and disruptive technology brings doubt and fear. Skeptics see embracing new tools as handing over hard-earned authority to machines, and fear that by doing so we are opening ourselves up to unnecessary risk. But is this fear warranted?
As humans, we tend to underestimate the risks in processes we are already familiar with, while overestimating the risks involved in doing things in new ways. For instance, M&A due diligence typically involves students or junior associates spending many late nights reviewing contracts to meet tight deadlines. Because lawyers are accustomed to this practice, they don’t view this as a risk, though clearly sleep-deprived associates under time pressure are prone to errors.
Contract review tools leveraging AI currently have the ability to help legal teams to thoroughly review very large sets of contracts, rapidly surfacing key issues (like a change of control provision that requires consent) buried in the documents that might have been missed if the work was being done manually. While the new tech may attract greater scrutiny than legacy processes, combining skilled lawyers with the right tools can create significant, measurable risk reduction in legal tasks.
 I suspect in years to come we will see insurance companies offering law firms lower premiums if they use AI tools for certain legal tasks, or even mandating the use of the tools as a condition of coverage.
3 – Is the role of legal counsel changing?
Numerous studies show that lawyers believe AI and machine learning technologies will threaten their roles and lead to job cuts. Consider that from the 1980s we saw a huge increase in the number of accounting jobs after spreadsheet technology became available, driving down the cost for calculations and significantly boosting demand for these services. We may well see the same in law.
AI has potential to put the lawyer back into the skilled advisory role by reducing time spent on routine, time intensive tasks that don’t require years of specialised training.

In law, one of the  fastest growing use cases for AI is leveraging machine learning to help lawyers review and summarize contracts. This technology can rapidly surface key provisions in a set of contracts and do much of the time consuming work of compiling contract summaries. This allows the lawyer to spend more time considering the implications of what AI has uncovered and advising their client.
As machine learning technologies allow us to do things we have never done before I expect that we will also see new types of legal roles emerging over the next few years – just as we saw the rapid growth of a plethora of new financial management roles in the last few decades when spreadsheets made the the ability to make rapid, sophisticated calculations standard.
4 – Do clients really care about how lawyers work?
For the most part, clients don’t really care how lawyers work. Clients want the right level of service, at the right cost, to produce the desired outcome.
Increasingly, lawyers’ spending time doing routine tasks that could be done more effectively with the assistance of the right tools will be considered a misuse of time and money.
5 – How do we begin to embrace, rather than fear AI’s role in our profession?
Like any unknown, we fear AI to the degree that we don’t understand it. Learning more about AI’s capabilities and powers – what it can and can’t do right now – goes a long way towards alleviating fears and moving past misconceptions. This prevents us getting either caught in the hype or dismissing all tools out of hand and missing out on the very real and powerful benefits machine learning technology can bring to many legal tasks, helping us to work smarter, faster and more efficiently.

Undoubtedly, AI is rapidly becoming a practical reality throughout the legal field. By better understanding its abilities and our responsibilities in leveraging it, lawyers can create more fulfilling roles for themselves and better serve their clients as AI tools become a valuable – and normal – part of the way of the way legal work is done.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to be a key element in creating the new digital labour force; what analyst firm Gartner is describing as DigitalOps.AI is integrating a long list of some of the most innovative and disruptive technologies available: machine learning; cognitive and computer vision; conversational capabilities; human-to-machine user interfaces; predictive data analytics; cybersecurity; IoT and intelligent monitoring. Prime Day deals are here - shop our expert picksIt is a huge range of applications that will take considerable skill to implement if they are to be optimised in work environments around the world. Despite all the advances in management software and techniques, the most effective path to extracting the maximum value from these technologies is through convergence with robotic process automation (RPA). Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksHealth HeadlinesTop Doctors 'Anti-Lazy' Drops Are Going Viral This JulyHealth HeadlinesBuy NowUndoWe've also highlighted the best AI platforms for businessRobotic process automationThis proven technology is already bringing together AI and cognitive tools to achieve productivity gains of several orders of magnitude whilst simultaneously slashing costs. While RPA streamlines workflows and performs routine administrative tasks at high volume in a fraction of the time it takes humans and to far higher standards of accuracy, the addition of AI and cognitive capabilities promises smarter business decisions and the potential for much more far-reaching positive change. LATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar

The ability to learn is the distinctive characteristic of AI and it means that computers are no longer limited to simply carrying out instructions written by humans. Instead, they can continuously learn from new data and perform better than their human programmers. It is what is described as moving from rules-based to experience-based operations.AI will take over countless tasks such as driving cars, diagnosing diseases or providing customer support. AI's superhuman performance will generate massive increases in productivity. A June 2017 study by consulting firm PwC, predicts AI will stimulate $15.7 trillion in additional wealth for the world by 2030. While AI can be considered the “thinking” component of the digital workforce, RPA embodies the component that “acts”. Computer vision and the crunching of all types of data (structured or unstructured) embodies the “sensing” component. All of this data will be then fed into the AI solution, completing the circle to provide the power to RPA software automation which can work attended under the direction of a human worker or unattended and completely autonomous.Are you a pro?

An employee can be trusted to perform as expected through training and personal performance controls. But how do humans trust a robot or any automated process, for that matter, to perform as expected?It is important to recognise the difference between an RPA robot, and a robot as an AI solution. While the RPA robot is programmed to perform certain tasks, the AI solution is trained by observation. Trusting AI machines will take time and requires transparency and analytics from the point of implementation. Finding a transparent way of helping humans see how the machines learn and use this knowledge in the correct way and take the right decisions will not be easy.Fear of change and lack of personal employee engagement can also have negative impact on the successful adoption of AI-powered automation. It is important for all organisations implementing RPA with AI capabilities to educate their workforces. Artificial Intelligence should be viewed as a technology that makes each employee more productive and opens up access to new capabilities. Training is necessary but should not take too long or become intimidatingly complex.The wider effects of automationThere are limits to the abilities of today's AI which have other ramifications for the relationship between society and automation. Repetitive tasks, such as auditing or insurance and credit administration are likely to disappear and many of the basic information-accessing and processing aspects of the professions such as medicine and the law are likely to be performed by AI and cognitive applications. Yet any role that definitely requires complex human interaction or the management of people is likely to be retained and indeed increased. These jobs are beyond AI's capabilities in terms of creativity, strategy-formulation, sociability and care. Although the technology goes way beyond human capabilities in the digital sphere it lacks social skills or empathy. The concern here is that AI will radically alter many middle-ranking jobs that involve a degree of administration and information analysis. Roles that will remain relatively insulated will be at opposite ends of the income spectrum – from CEOs to carers, podiatrists and hairstylists. As a result, there has been much discussion about providing a universal basic income to citizens who have lost their jobs to technology. This is to miss the opportunity presented by this transformative technology.Such a revolution in how we relate to work will require a rethink from all corners of society. In the private sector, instead of simply viewing AI as a means for cost-cutting through automation, businesses will create new jobs by seeking out symbiosis between AI and the human touch. This will be especially effective in areas such as healthcare and education, where AI can produce crucial insights but only humans can deliver them with care and compassion. We are already seeing that in many organisations where AI-powered ‘Smart’ RPA is implemented, there are very low levels of job losses as the humans are freed from the mundane to move up the value chain; i.e., employees have more time to devote to profitable, creative tasks which increases their engagement.A rethink may be requiredThere is no denying that some roles will disappear and that will require fresh thinking about how to use the wealth generated by AI to reorient our economies.Some of this wealth could be used to support socially useful work such as care or charity work, parenting or home schooling of young children, assisting aging parents or helping a friend with mental or physical disabilities live life to the full. By requiring some social contribution, we would foster a public ethos that focuses on our usefulness to one another and wider humanity. Many difficult questions remain to be answered, of course, before we could consider implementing such a sweeping and idealistic policy. But in the meantime, it is important that business concentrates on obtaining the huge gains in productivity and efficiency from the most effective implementation of RPA and AI. This is the one certain way of harnessing the combined potential of thinking machines and humans.Guy Kirkwood,  Chief Evangelist at UiPathThis is how AI can help you build your next website

""To AI or not to AI"", a play on Shakespeare age-old adage, is making waves into today's' teched-up world as many industries are looking into AI solutions for their businesses, especially when it comes to human resources.Due to the 'Hollywood' driven concept of AI, many organizations are scared of letting a non-human entity handle certain procedures of business, but the day when AI robots could possibly take over the world is far from today. Having an untold potential in the increase of efficiency, partnered with a cost-effective solution, does it not only make sense to adapt to the modern world, but to use the benefits of AI for your businesses recruitment needs, or your needs in general? Is it the right choice for your business? Here is what you need to know in order to answer that question.AI means reduced recruiting timelines



The time of spending hundreds of man-hours filtering through thousands of CVs and online job-board profiles for new employees is coming to an end. For example, ideally, a company, specializing in AI recruiting services, claims on their blog and estimates their AI candidate sourcing algorithm can ""reduce time to hire from 34 days to 9 days"". This is a 73.53% increase in candidate sourcing and on boarding efficiency utilizing a non-biased process that removes stereotypes from sourcing and finds candidates that are technically appropriate for the position.Candidate screening is another task that can be automated by AI technology. By using this intelligent-style method much more online data can be collected such as information from social media profiles, previous online job records, and educational qualifications that will then enhance the ranking system of candidates for recruiters to select from.


Given AI technology can efficiently source and screen multiple candidates in a short period of time the acceptance criteria set by the business and the candidate profile has to be matched to identify and match the most promising candidates for the job. Using this gathered data AI programs can then rank candidates on a scale using various pieces of information such as experience, work history, skill sets, and salary expectations to find the right person. This method of processing data is becoming highly valued in today's market because of its ability to locate passive candidates, who are generally the most desired, as they aren't actively looking for other positions and they are content with their current position meaning they are an asset to their company which in turn means there is less competition to place them.A huge part of the recruiting timeline, after you've found the 'perfect fit' for the role, is interviewing. In today's' international job market, numerous expats are actively seeking roles abroad while not always being able to go to the respective country of their desired job just for an interview. There are a few startups that are specializing in AI interviewing software such as HireVue and Mya. These companies are shifting their focus on simplifying the interviewing process by utilizing video as the medium. Programs such as HireVue use preset questionnaires that the candidate can then film themselves answering. This allows for the recruiter to generically interview a higher number of potential candidates via pre-recorded videos, which can then be sifted through to select individuals who will progress in the talent acquisition process.Using AI technology, the footwork is taken care of from sourcing to interviewing which drastically reduces the recruitment timeline. This, in turn, allows for the talent acquisition team to engage with prospective candidates and determine their ability to perform in the specific role, and inevitably, make a placement at a much faster rate.Related: How the UAE's New Minister of AI Views the Future Of Tech in His Desert NationAI in human resources is cost-effective and better for business overallAlong with numerous man-hours, countless company dollars are being spent on old-fashioned recruitment in today's' market. A 2016 Society of Human Resource Management survey found that ""the average cost-per-hire is $4,129"". That is a staggering dollar amount to place one individual. Let's put it in perspective.In 2017, CNN reported that Amazon had ""541,900 employees in the third quarter of 2017, which was up from a little more than 300,000 in the same period a year earlier."" This means that over that period 12 month period, Amazon hired an estimate of 241,900 new employees. Granted Amazon is already using AI technology in its recruitment services but for the sake of the argument let's pretend they didn't (like a lot of large companies today) and let's pretend their cost of hiring one employee was that of the average found by SHRM. The cost would look like:$4,129 (Average cost to hire) x 241,900 (New employees) = $998,805,100 in recruitment costs per 1 year.


It's estimated that in this scenario Amazon could have spent upwards of $1 Billion USD on recruitment costs alone over the period of 12 months. This is quite astounding and nearly incomprehensible, but possible. With many of the AI recruitment and Human Resources programs available offering tailor-made packages on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly subscription basis, it's not hard to see that you can save a pretty hefty penny by transitioning to AI technology solutions.AI in human resources will improve the ""employee experience"" and take ""engagement down to the individual level.""In the recent IBM Think 2018 panel, Richard Hughes, Senior Vice President at UnitedHealth Group, stated, ""The future is going to be centred on the employee experience and taking engagement down to the individual level. There is no way we can do that on any scale without applying the best that ""data science' has to offer."" AI isn't just about giving humans a hand at doing lower level tasks, it's about data. Vast amounts of data can be collected at an exponentially higher rate with AI than humans can wish to accomplish. This data is what drives businesses in general, not only in the Human Resources department.In larger corporations many employees can feel lost and unengaged by their employers and Human Resource department. Anything from vacation requests not being acknowledged to unenforced policies can be the tipping point for most employees which results in high turnover rates. A high salary does not make an employee happy. Most people feel their jobs are their lives, and who wants to live an unhappy life? No one.


Having access to a wider array of data means you have the ability to make your employees' overall experience better by applying the gathered data and making relevant adjustments to the workplace atmosphere or internal processes. A recent tweet by Hughes says, ""Having good data is like having good health. When you have it, you take it for granted. When you don't, you panic."" Simply put, increased data means increased data analytics, which means advanced insights that lead to improved working conditions for employees that keeps turnover rates low.AI In human resources and setbacks to considerAs you've gathered by now, there are multiple advantages to utilizing AI technology for your human resources and recruiting needs, but nothing is perfect in life, certainly not a budding form of technology that has yet to reach its maximum potential. Many services and programs offered could lack different aspects one might be accustomed to in manual the non AI world, such as the ability to leave feedback to a candidate after a video interview, or specific CV search criteria. One major aspect that AI technology lacks is empathy and human interaction or the opportunity to handpick a candidate and get to know them personally during the recruitment process which simply cannot be done at this time while relying on AI technology to do all the work for your company. AI sees data whereas humans sense emotion and this is something that will not be changing in the foreseeable future.Therefore it is up to you to decide if AI technology is the right solution for your businesses' needs. Are you a corporation with thousands of employees, spending big bucks on recruitment annually and desperately need a way to streamline the process and cut costs? Are you a mom-and-pop shop that has less than 15 employees and takes pride in getting to know each employee like family? Every business has different goals, budgets, and desires, but the beauty of the AI industry is that there is a solution for everyone, no matter how big or how small.


It is up to you to decide what works for your business, whether that is adapting to the constant growing AI industry or keeping things as they are or just introducing small changes over time. Either way, AI technology is only going to keep growing and at some point in the future AI will be the norm and the old-fashioned ways of recruiting and human resource processes will seem like the stone ages.Related: The Future Is Now: The UAE Is All Set To Be A Leading Destination For AI Investment

By 2012, global spend on artificial intelligence is anticipated to hit $57.6 billion, according to International Data Corporation (IDC). And one YouTube star — Taryn Southern — is already activating AI to pioneer a new methodology for producing music. Released today, Southern’s pop album “I Am AI” features eight tracks, each produced entirely with artificial intelligence. She’s also released a new music video “Welcome to the New World,” which integrated collaborators from all over the world.
 
Southern’s first single Break Free reached #48 on the Billboard Indicator Chart , #2 on the Euro Indie Chart and has more than 1.8 million views on the music video. Life Support, her second single, was nominated for a 2018 Streamy Award for Best Immersive Video.  
Her  work on “I AM AI” is unprecedented. Until now, producing an album entirely with artificial intelligence had never been done. And, it’s a process Southern said will revolutionize the open-market for aspiring artists and musicians and disrupt an age-old model for the music industry. 
“I definitely see it changing the future of the music. I imagine in 20 years, ‘coding’ songs will be commonplace,” Southern told VideoInk (a subsidiary of TheWrap) exclusively in an interview. “It’s still incredibly early for AI, but I could see artists using machine learning for all kinds of applications: to mix and master their songs, to help them identify unique chord progressions, alter instrumentation to change style, determine more interesting melody structures based on a musician’s given sound and style preferences, even gage their audience’s emotional response to a song. The sky is the limit.”

So, how does producing music with artificial intelligence work exactly? 
Southern collaborated with Amper — an artificial intelligence music composition software — to develop a process that she says involved telling the computer the sounds, notes, or instruments she wanted. Amper’s software then delivered a “stem,” or audio fragment, to match that criteria. Then with feedback and multiple tweaks, Southern is able to stitch those “stems” together to create a track.  
“This is what the future holds. For us it’s all about the collaboration between creator and the AI,” said Michael Hobe, a Hollywood film composer and co-founder of Amper. “That’s what we’re working towards — to have AI truly integrated into the workflow. And Taryn was really the first to use the tools in this way, which has been really exciting.” 
 
Taryn Southern on YouTube, circa 2013.
For Southern, taking the reins on charting a career path in unconventional ways has been her M.O. She was early to YouTube, launching a channel based on slap-stick and musical comedy in 2006. “I’m not really focused on building an audience on another platform until I have at least 250,000 subscribers on YouTube,” she told VideoInk in 2013. She now has nearly 500K subscribers on YouTube, a platform where Southern isn’t as active outside of releasing music videos for “I AM AI”. 
“When I was on YouTube, I felt owned by an algorithm,” Southern said. “It’s a really tough job to sustain, and we’ve seen a lot of creators experience burnout the past few years. I didn’t want to become a living breathing vlog machine, so I threw in the towel and started exploring other avenues of interest.”
Aside from the album, Southern is also directing a feature-length documentary on the future of man and machine. “It’s called I AM HUMAN. My album is ironically entitled I AM AI, so I’ve got both sides covered!” Southern joked.  
And so Southern has reinvented herself as a technology innovator and AI-storyteller. A musician changing the game, Southern’s work on “I AM AI” is breaking down the old-way of making music and alchemizing the future into the present.  
“I AM AI” is now available on Spotify, iTunes, Google Play and Apple Music.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise, but also potential for pitfalls. AI can change the way we live, work, and play, accelerate drug discoveries, and drive edge computing and autonomous systems. It also has the potential to transform global politics, economies, and cultures in such profound ways that the U.S. and other countries are set to enter what some speculate may be the next Space Race.  
We are just beginning to understand the implications of unchecked AI. Recent headlines have highlighted its limitations and the continued need for human control. We will not be able to ignore the range of ethical risks posed by issues of privacy, transparency, safety, control, and bias. Examples include:

""What Machine Learning Can and Cannot Do""


""AI is Hurting People of Color and the Poor. Experts Want to Fix That""


""Why Artificial Intelligence Will Have Very Human Frailties""


Considering the advances already made in AI—and those yet to be made—AI is undoubtedly on a trajectory toward integration into every aspect of our lives. As we prepare to turn an increasing share of tasks and decision-making over to AI we must think more critically about how ethics factor into AI design to minimize risk. With this in mind, policymakers must proactively consider ways to incorporate ethics into AI practices and design incentives that promote innovation while ensuring AI operates with our best interests in mind.



In an AI World, the Garbage In/Garbage Out Principle is Amplified
With so much at stake, it’s tempting to ponder whether ethical issues can be solved by simple algorithm changes. Why can’t AI technologists team up with philosophers or ethicists and immediately change the calculus to infuse morality into the very algorithms on which AI is based? It’s not that simple. The definition of exactly what is fair and equitable, and in what context, does not have a clear-cut answer. Beyond the murky definitions and lack of common consensus, the issue is not only in the algorithms themselves—it’s in the data used to train them.
Perhaps most consequential is the intentional and unintentional bias embedded in the datasets with which AI is trained. Bias in AI can take many forms: dataset bias, association bias, interaction bias, automation bias, and confirmation bias (Cou et al., 2017). It can be the result of simple mistakes or oversight in data aggregation techniques. Computers then use these potentially flawed data to make assumptions and calculations that are not truly objective. This alone may not seem overtly dangerous, but the real issue lies in the potential of these biases or discrepancies to be scaled to such a degree that they affect how computers treat larger sets of data. Biased data causes machine learning to rely on unjustified bias to discriminate against groups at scale (Crawford, 2017).  
AI technologies already in the market are displaying these intentional and unintentional biases. For example, consider talent search technology that intentionally groups candidate resumes by demographic characteristics, or insensitive autofill search algorithms (Lapowsky, 2018). Conversely, by reinforcing European notions of beauty, the Beauty.AI pageant showed unintentional automation bias in action when machines overwhelmingly chose winners with light skin rather than any of the large number of dark-skinned applicants (Levin, 2016).
As a nation, we need to understand that the implications of AI reach far beyond beauty contests or advertising targets. AI has the ability to create almost undetectable forgeries of news articles, audio recordings, and videos, making it difficult to separate truth from fiction. Organizations and governments will be held accountable for their actions, or lack thereof, in protecting citizens’ rights to privacy, equity, and justice.
Government’s Role in Safe and Responsible AI Implementation

While AI cannot be expected to solve philosophical conundrums that have existed across society for years, government leaders and policymakers are uniquely positioned to lead and fund long-term R&D on topics like ethics and bias where businesses may not be incentivized to invest. They must also introduce smart policy that balances the need for innovation with the obligation to benefit and safeguard society. Such mitigating measures should be built with inclusion and fairness in mind, and include these two fundamental steps:

Establish Standards and Guidance to Navigate Risks. The government can help confront AI risks by leading the joint development and publication of standards and guidance around safety, privacy, ethics, and control in coordination with industry, academic, and international stakeholders. Equally important is continued funding of research focused on testing and certification methods, including programs like DARPA’s Explainable AI, which aims to enable humans to understand how AI algorithms behave. The government should also focus on establishing clear plans and expectations for organizations on how to deal with failures when they do arise—because they most certainly will.  


Devote Public Resources to the Creation and Curation of Accurate and Bias-Free Data Sets. One line of defense against AI systems that inflict unfair treatment is to give more attention to how data sets are constructed before operationalizing them, which means that attention to bias cannot be an afterthought. Today, many of the most powerful data sources come from two places: (1) academic institutions, and (2) corporations. Both types of data sets have limitations. Academia’s data sets are often constrained based on the time and resources of those using the data to drive publications, while corporate data is often representative of individual customer sets rather than the public as a whole. The government should release guidance around data-sharing between public and private organizations to ensure data integrity by allowing for the curation of more diverse data sets, while still adhering to the aforementioned standards and guidance.


By leading the dialogue now and beginning to take proactive actions to address these topics, the government can ensure the development of AI with a net positive impact on society, rather than hindering potential opportunities simply because ethics wasn’t considered at the onset.

Professor Margaret Thornton says technology could bring benefits to lawyers.(Supplied: Australian National University)She believes the march of technology is making it more difficult for graduates to embark on a legal profession.""There are 42 law schools in Australia producing around 7,000 graduates a year [and] they need oversight and training,"" she said.""Traditionally they worked under supervision in established law firms but those opportunities are declining, with fewer jobs on offer and fewer experienced lawyers available to supervise newcomers.""Professor Thornton said the new developments brought about by technology could result in benefits, particularly to women, who account for about 65 per cent of Australia's law students.""With more varied models of legal practice, there's the promise of more flexible hours and that's something working parents, particularly women, need,"" she said.What a lawyer should beRecent law graduate Lachlan Robb works as a paralegal with a Brisbane law firm but wants to undertake a PhD focussing on the impact of technology on legal practice. Lachlan Robb plans to research technology's impact on law.(ABC Gold Coast: Charmaine Kane)Mr Robb said while there may be fewer jobs available in some practices, the roles that are available are becoming more meaningful.""I have noticed uncertainty in students as firms embrace technology [who are asking] 'will I still get a job?' but there are positives',"" he said.""There may be fewer jobs in some practices but the roles that are offered are becoming more meaningful.""There's an argument that firms will need graduates to be employed on more skilled-based activities which will actually use their minds instead of using pattern recognition which a machine can do.""He thinks the role and impact of lawyers will evolve and change as more technology is utilised.""It is going to revert to more of a baseline notion of what a lawyer should be,"" he said.""Not a person who does all the paperwork but an advisor, where the human element becomes more and more important.""Posted 27 Sep 201827 Sep 2018Thu 27 Sep 2018 at 6:40pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesCould a robot do your job?
