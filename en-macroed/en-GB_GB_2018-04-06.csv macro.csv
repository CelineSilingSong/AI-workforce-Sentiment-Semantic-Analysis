Artificial Intelligence (AI) is penetrating industries from healthcare to advertising, transportation, finance, legal, education, and hospitality. Many of us may have already interacted with a chatbot on platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or We Chat. Chatbots are defined as an automated, yet personalized, conversation between software and human users.

The hospitality industry makes heavy use of chatbots to create more compelling customer and employee experiences. Consider Marriott's  Chatbotlr, a chatbot that helps customers make service requests from their smartphones. Chatbotlr provided early knowledge and learning for the development of MC, the Marriott Careers Chatbot, designed to enhance the job candidate experience.
David Rodriguez, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer at Marriott International, Inc., believes the key to success in using AI in the workplace is for HR to develop deeper and tighter relationships with strategic consumer-focused departments. ""At Marriott, we have created not only new HR roles but an entirely new department we call the Brand Talent Team, which is charged with re-imagining our employee experiences to emulate and support our best customer experiences. In fact, Marriott's new Chief Customer Experience Officer, Adam Malamut, was Marriott's Chief Talent Officer and worked in HR for 15 years before moving into Customer Experience, a role that reports to Marriott’s Executive Vice President and Global Chief Commercial Officer.
PROMOTED
As we enter a new industrial revolution, Accenture's latest research, Reworking The Revolution, polled over 14,000 workers across skill levels and generations and found that the full promise of AI depends on how humans and machines work together to deliver enhanced customer and employee experiences. 

This research is reinforced by Gartner's latest prediction, estimating one in five workers will have an AI as their co-worker by 2022.
So, how are companies using AI to mirror their last best customer experience for employees? Marriott International and Hilton provide interesting use cases for how creating a compelling employee experience has gone beyond HR to become a key business initiative requiring a strong partnership between HR, IT, Marketing, Customer Experience, and Workforce Transformation. These type of partnerships are now starting to yield significant business results.  Four lessons in leveraging AI to enhance the employee experience are noteworthy for companies on the journey to create a best in class employee experience.

They include:
1. Identify a business problem to be solved using AI. 
Both Marriott and Hilton identified how AI could be used to deliver an improved candidate experience and leveraged AI to make deeper human connections with candidates. Marriott leveraged its early experience with launching Chatbolr to create MC, a Marriott Careers chatbot for Facebook Messenger which creates a more personalized candidate experience for job seekers. MC converses with job candidates much like a human recruiter, guiding them to apply for open jobs based on their skills and location, and even provides them with some education promoting the company culture and values as a fun way to learn about the various Marriott hotel brands which may align with their interests, skills and goals. As an indication of how engaging the job seekers find MC, 64% return later to initiate new conversations. Research reveals that 50% of job seekers do not hear back after submitting their resumes through traditional corporate channels, so one can see why MC has such a high return rate.
Similarly, Hilton saw an opportunity to create increased human connection and responsiveness in the application and interview process by integrating AI into the candidate experience. Matthew W. Schuyler, Hilton’s Chief Human Resource Officer, and Matthew Welsh, Hilton's Vice President of Global Recruiting, saw an opportunity to leverage the power of AI to reduce time to fill new job openings, improve the candidate experience, and reduce recruiters' administrative workload. This led to the development of Ally, a chatbot for inbound candidates found on the Hilton career site. As Welsh describes this: ""We leveraged AI into how we screen, source, and interview job candidates, and this means our recruiters have more time to focus on the candidate, communicate the Hilton employer brand proposition, and deliver a richer, and more uniquely human candidate experience."" Hilton went on to use AI for video interviews and assessments yielding a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 85 and a 40% improvement in interview hire rates. I used Ally to test the process for applying for a new job at Hilton, and after putting in my zip code and selecting the type of job I was looking for, I was immediately invited to apply for a possible job that fit my criteria. Then a description of the new job was sent to my cell phone with a link to complete the application. Total time for the process: Less than one minute and this left me with a very favorable impression of the Hilton brand!
Research documenting this relationship between the candidate experience and the consumer behavior indicates the growing importance of improving the candidate experience so it reinforces the employer brand. According to Talent Board's CandE Awards research, on average  41% of global candidates who feel they have had a “negative” overall one-star job seeker experience (based on a 1-5 Likert Scale rating) say they will take their alliance, product purchases, and relationship somewhere else. That means a potential loss of revenue for consumer-based businesses. On the other hand, 64% say they’ll definitely increase their employer relationships based on the very positive job seeker experiences they’ve have experienced with a brand.

2. Use AI to design recruiting for both successful job candidates and for disappointed ones.  
Marriott and Hilton both receive well over one million applications for job positions and extend offers to a fraction of them! While AI is being used to source, screen, interview, and make offers to job candidates, this should just be the start of using AI to improve the candidate experience. The question heads of HR and Global Recruiting must ask themselves is: what happens to the ""disappointed"" candidates, who have gone through the application process, but did not find a role that was right for them? One course of action is to bring forward-looking companies together to work on this issue. Hilton is now partnering with a consortium of companies in a collective talent network to share candidate profiles who were not offered positions and connect them to new job opportunities. In return, Hilton receives potential candidates from other employers for its open roles, thereby reducing sourcing time and costs.
3. Be a role model for the change you want to see in your workplace.
My recent book, The Future Workplace Experience: 10 Rules for Mastering Disruption in Recruiting and Engaging Employees, discussed the need for leaders to be workplace activists,  which was defined as a leader who gives a voice to making the changes we all desire in our organization. Workplace activists understand the importance of integrating the intelligent technologies we are using in our personal lives into the workplace, and will seize the opportunity to pull a team together and use agile principles of working to ""test, iterate, and re-test"" a new way to deliver value to employees.
If we want our careers to be relevant and employable,  I believe we must understand the power of these technologies to change, transform, and enhance the employee experience.  As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, say in their Harvard Business Review article, "" Over the next decade, AI won’t replace managers, but managers who use AI will replace those who don't. ""
4. Become a student of the Future of Work, regardless of your functional area.
Understanding the future of work is too important an area to leave to outside consultants or HR. All employees, regardless of their discipline, need to understand what work will look like tomorrow and how to prepare for this today. The pace of change we are experiencing in the workplace is exponential. The historian Norman Davies compared historical change to an avalanche. “The starting point is a snow-covered mountainside that looks solid. All changes take place under the surface and are rather invisible.” But the one certainty for anyone in the path of an avalanche is this: standing still is not an option.
As we contemplate the future of work, we must understand the power of AI to augment the employee experience. The new ways of sourcing, screening, scheduling, and interviewing candidates employed by Marriott and Hilton show just how much technological advances are impacting the candidate and employee experience.  How candidates discover potential employers, interview with them, and stay engaged in their talent communities is now being powered by AI.
But while AI is transforming the employee experience, HR leaders must examine and prepare for both the benefits and challenges of AI. One challenge looming is how to manage a workforce that is a blended one; including human workers, chatbots and robots.  HR leaders must be proactive in identifying this issue early and have a strategy in place for this.  The defining feature of the future workforce will not be job loss to AI but negotiating a new relationship between humans and machines. The future of work is here today, how prepared are you, your team and your organization?

      On March 18 in Tempe, Arizona, an Uber self-driving car struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, who was walking her bicycle across a street. The human driver was supposed to be monitoring the car’s behaviour, but did not do so. Its systems apparently did not detect the victim, as it neither slowed down nor tried to avoid hitting Herzberg

The fatal crash involving an autonomous car operated by Uber in the United States was a tragic but timely reminder of the dangers of companies rushing to implement artificial intelligence to be first to market.
At the time of the crash, the driver who should have been ready to react in just such an event as this was looking down. The car itself had apparently failed completely to see the pedestrian and didn’t slow down or try to avoid hitting her.
Real-world testing, and risks
Again, we are seeing a technology being principally tested to work under normal conditions so that it can be rolled out to market and not necessarily being built with safety as the primary focus. As the former developer of Uber’s machine learning and AI platform has said, car companies should be training their cars in simulated environments which can be programmed to train them in how to detect and avoid any number of possibilities of random events that the car could encounter on the road.
Machine learning suffers from a fundamental problem in that its ability to carry out a task depends on data that is used to train it. What exact algorithm it ends up using to fulfil its eventual purpose and what features are the most important is largely unknown. With deep learning, the multiple layers that make up the overall neural network of the machine learning software make this process even more mysterious and unknown.
We do know that machine learning software picks up biases in the data that is used to test it. Software that is used to calculate the risk of an offender committing a future crime and used frequently by courts in the US has been demonstrated to systematically calculate a significantly lower risk for white offenders than people of colour. Other researchers have shown that machine-learning algorithms learn gender biases that are inherent in the texts that are used to train them.
The dangers of now knowing how things work have been clearly demonstrated by Facebook’s recent admission that it really didn’t know what people were doing with data of millions of its users that Facebook had encouraged them to take. With the use of its platform for the spread of targeted fake news during the US presidential election, Facebook again admitted that it hadn’t realized that foreign governments would exploit this naivety to undermine democracy.
More than just Facebook
It would be wrong to single out Facebook for being the only company who didn’t know their software could be exploited to harm individuals and society. The “right to be forgotten” amendments to data-privacy legislation and enacted by the European Union was formulated specifically to deal with Google’s unwillingness to fix side effects of its search on the privacy of individuals. Legislation in many countries to make reporting of data breaches mandatory has been necessary because companies were unwilling to take cybersecurity, and the protection of their users’ data, seriously.
Given the past, there is no reason to believe that companies who are implementing systems based on AI are thinking of security and privacy by design. On the contrary, machine learning needs data, lots of it, and so companies are acquiring huge data repositories of detailed information in order to exploit it through algorithms. Whilst one could argue that handled responsibly, large amounts of data will be invaluable for research, in health matters in particular, the risks of collecting, storing and using that data, especially in a commercial setting are very high.

French government report
In France, Cédric Villani – the Field Prize–winning mathematician and member of the National Assembly – has delivered his final report detailing a national strategy for the study and exploitation of artificial intelligence. The recommendations cover many of the potential issues that could arise from trying to balance the demands for research, innovation and commercialisation of AI. They also recognise the need to safeguard society and individuals’ privacy and safety and suggests an active role for government in making sure that AI is used in a way that benefits society and respects human rights and values.
However, none of this will be easy. There has already been claims that Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into full effect on May 25, will put EU “firms at a competitive disadvantage compared with their competitors in North America and Asia.”
One must hope that tragedies like the death of 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, run down by a self-driving Uber car, and the widespread outrage of Facebook’s disregard for its users’ personal data will remind people that there is a benefit to measured technological progress and not today’s mantra of technological advancement at any price.

Published: Apr 06, 2018 05:23 AM ESTInteresting Engineering6 years ago0SharePixabayA prominent feature in science fiction over the years has been artificial intelligence. Since the earliest days of computing, scientists and other thinkers have been fascinated by the notion of creating a machine capable of replicating the human brain. It used to be thought that the analogy of the human brain is like a computer ran deep. However, we now know that the picture is much more complicated, the way that the brain works goes beyond a simple computer. Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

We still do not fully understand how consciousness arises in the human brain, and there is still much debate surrounding whether consciousness can be separated from advanced intelligence. But artificial intelligence need not be this complex; we see far simpler examples of what we might describe as artificial intelligence on a regular basis. The voice assistants pre-installed on every modern smartphone are just one example and now these same AIs are being integrated into alarm clocks and speakers so that they can be used to control a variety of smart devices around the home.
Artificial intelligence is increasingly finding its way into industrial and manufacturing contexts. There are even AIs being used to conduct high-frequency trading on the stock market. AIs are now everywhere, meaning that it is becoming easy to forget just how amazingly complex they are. AIs have a great deal to offer the world of engineering. Some of the most exciting current and prospective uses of artificial intelligence are within the field of engineering.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
The term was first used at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. However, while artificial intelligence has long been considered and discussed in an abstract, theoretical sense, it is only in the last decade that we have begun to see it being used in consumer technology. It has now become so ubiquitous in our everyday lives that it is easy to forget what a complex demonstration of technological prowess and understanding artificial intelligence represents.
In answering the question of what artificial intelligence is, and what the term means today, we need to consider what constitutes intelligence. This is not as simple as many people assume it should be. For example, would you consider all animals to be intelligent? Or rather, to have intelligence?
Some animals, such as cats, octopuses, and even dolphins, among others, demonstrate high levels of intelligence. When comparing two different animals, such as a mouse and a gorilla, there are a number of ways that scientists can measure their relative intelligence. But objectively defining and measuring intelligence is difficult.
The AIs that are used in the engineering sector combine both software and hardware components. Think of the robots on a car assembly line and the software that controls them. They are in themselves quite impressive feats of engineering, but are they intelligent?
You might be surprised to learn just how smart and sophisticate our uses of artificial intelligence in engineering are becoming. Smart production lines are definitely the future. But how exactly does artificial intelligence make such a big difference to the engineering sector?
Manufacturing
The rise of artificial intelligence promises to allow us to develop machines capable of performing ever more complicated manufacturing, and even design, tasks. Machines that are capable of learning and improving without human intervention are the ultimate goal, and this would have significant, and far-reaching implications. Furthermore, in our pursuit of creating ever more powerful AIs, we are discovering information about how our own brains work and how we approach the learning process, both consciously and unconsciously.
Many engineers fear that their jobs could soon be taken over by sufficiently advanced robots. As our manufacturing and design capabilities have continued to expand, we have been able to build machinery that is capable of replicating just about everything that a human can do on an assembly line. These fears are not unfounded then, as automation is continuing to take jobs away from people in a number of different areas.
Things aren’t entirely bleak, however, a Stanford University study entitled ‘One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence’, reported that there was no imminent threat to workers. The study argued that even if or when artificial intelligence does have a significant impact on jobs, this will be balanced by numerous other positive effects on society.
Perhaps the most prominent example of artificial intelligence being used in engineering is in the field of automobile manufacturing.
The combination of software and hardware that has made its way on to the manufacturing line has grown progressively more sophisticated over the years. Initially, these robots were performing simple engineering tasks that involved relatively large components and movements. Today, they are capable of precision movements and of emulating the most intricate parts of the process.
Big Data
It would not be unreasonable to say that we are now living in an age of data. Data is a commodity unlike any other that the world has ever known. It is extremely valuable financially, but it can also be used directly in order to give a business a massive edge over the competition.
Artificial intelligence, especially in its most sophisticated implementations, relies heavily on large data sets and algorithmic learning. 
One of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence within the field of engineering is machine learning. Machine learning is dependent upon the constant generation and analysis of data. It is via this process, of extensively collecting data about performance and subsequently analyzing it, that an artificial intelligence is able to learn. If the program is equipped with the right algorithms to identify mistakes, and formulate solutions, then it can perform a process and continually refine it.
For engineers who are working on large scale public projects, big data will be a staple of their work. Big data analysis can tell researchers, in unprecedented detail, where the flow of people in urban environments is at its densest. This, in turn, means that public infrastructure decisions can be based on objective scientific analyses.
Also, within the context of engineering for public works, big data can be used to analyze how well certain solutions have performed when implemented elsewhere. Big data can also allow for an objective and detailed comparison of how similar the current environment is to ones where the solution has been used before. This is relatively simple when using big data analytics techniques, but would be a long and expensive process to complete otherwise.
Machine Learning
One of the most significant technological concepts for the future of artificial intelligence-led engineering is machine learning. Machine learning is the study of exactly how machines learn. The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence isn’t just to have machines that can learn, but to have machines that are capable of self-analysis. Such a machine could assess the efficiency of its learning methods and so refine its processes to a much greater degree.
But what would the practical applications of machine learning look like? Well, imagine if every one of those robotic arms you see putting cars together contained a tiny camera. Each arm could then look over the work of the previous robots along the assembly line. If they identify an issue then they could formulate a solution.
We already have the technology to accomplish the first part. We can take a high-resolution video of a half-assembled car and develop algorithms to identify whether there are any clear faults. We could then have the robots respond to the fault based on what they ‘see’. 
Machine learning takes this process to the next level. With machine learning, the data collected by all of the robots involved in production can be pooled together. With a central artificial intelligence to control each one, it can learn which problems are most likely to appear. With machine learning, that central artificial intelligence would also be able to formulate solutions to problems, rather than simply following pre-defined routines.
Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing is a field of study dedicated to improving the ability of humans and machines to communicate. In particular, natural language processing aims to improve the sophistication with which machines can respond to the human voice. Like with machine learning, natural language processing makes heavy use of large data sets and algorithm-based learning.
Think of the voice assistant in your smartphone. If you have owned a number of smartphones over the last decade or so, then you may well have noticed how much the accuracy with which they hear and transcribe our voices has improved. While your phone might be able to identify the words that you’ve said, this isn’t the same as understanding.
Right now, your phone looks for certain keywords that it understands and works out what you are asking it to do based on context. It then responds or performs an action, and sometimes vocalizes a response. Natural language processing aims to refine this process by allowing the machine to develop a deeper understanding of language. If this understanding is refined enough, then it will reach a point where the machine can deduce what someone wants when presented with an entirely new command or request.
In the Iron Man films, Tony Stark is able to have long conversations with his home assistant, an artificial intelligence called Jarvis. When Tony is designing his Iron Man suits he holds conversations with Jarvis, Jarvis is able to produce schematics according to specifications which Tony expresses, in usual conversational language. This seems like pure science fiction, yet this is exactly the direction that researchers hope to one day take the field in.
For example, if an engineer is trying to work out how to reinforce a particular feature in their design, wouldn’t it be great if they could just ask their computer? Or in the case of an assembly line, imagine if a human overseer could give the robots feedback. They could ask the robots to perform their roles in a slightly different way, to make adjustments, or even to try new things and analyze the result.
These applications are some way off, we still have much to learn about machine learning. However, in recent years we have already made some significant advances that few people could have predicted.
Image Processing
You might be wondering what image processing could have to do with engineering? The connection might not immediately seem obvious, but this is another technology which is vital to implementing artificial intelligence to its full potential in the field of engineering.
When humans see an object, it is because light is entering the eye and being converted into an electric signal. This signal is then carried to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain turns this electronic signal into an image, it is this image that we ‘see’.
Machines work in a very similar way. We can set up a camera in order to record an image, and we can display this image to a user. However, this is not the same as the machine understanding the image. With image processing algorithms, we can have machines analyze what they see and react accordingly. From an engineering perspective, this means we could have machines which are able to identify structural abnormalities and other issues that have identifiable visible signs.
This kind of image processing technology could also make a significant difference to the workplace safety of engineers. There may often be visual clues indicating structural deficiencies and weaknesses that are not immediately obvious until the structure fails. By combining image processing with data input from other sensors, artificial intelligence can be used in a variety of contexts. For example, on both construction sites and the scenes of fires, structural integrity can become a concern. Having a more reliable way for engineers to assess integrity could save lives.
Internet of Things
Many of you can probably still remember a time when being connected to other people meant being at home. Once you ventured outside, there was no 3G or 4G network in place for internet browsing. Eventually, very slow and expensive mobile internet came in the form of WAP.
Today, we are used to having vast amounts of data flying through the airwaves all around us. As smart devices become more common in our homes, we are also beginning to see the practical potential of being able to link devices together. 
The Internet of Things refers to a hypothetical network, which would connect everyday devices and things together, in the same way that the internet connects computers from around the world. Allowing the various devices in our lives to collect and share data would open up some exciting new possibilities.
As the Internet of Things gradually becomes a reality, it will increasingly become something that engineers consider during the design process. With the Internet of Things as a reality, the virtually endless number of ways that we can connect devices and have them work together will allow new and innovative solutions to many problems.
Jobs
No discussion of the impact that artificial intelligence is having on engineering would be complete without mentioning the impact of automation on jobs. In many places, there are widespread fears and anxieties surrounding automation. As machines begin to replace humans in certain jobs, there are worries that we will eventually have no need to hire people at all.
[see-also]
It should be acknowledged that the threat to jobs is very real, and in some areas, it has a significant effect on communities. However, most researchers agree that the long-term benefits of automation outweigh the potential drawbacks.
In the case of engineers specifically, artificial intelligence is opening some exciting new horizons for the field. These new opportunities should be embraced. It is important to realize that many of these advances will make a big difference to our ability to tackle the largest issues facing our civilization.

Artificial intelligence has had an impact on just about every conceivable industry and sector, engineering is no exception. There are a number of different applications of artificial intelligence that are of considerable use to engineers. From allowing more intuitive and innovative interactions with software and machinery, to keeping a watchful eye over the work of engineers as well as other machines, artificial intelligence has many roles to play.
As our methods of collecting an analyzing large data sets become more refined, we are able to unlock the full potential of big data and algorithmic learning. We have always understood that both of these concepts can yield impressive results, but the transformative nature that they both have on engineering demonstrate that they are even more powerful than we once thought.

        Can Artificial Intelligence Make Teaching More Personal?

Goldie Blumenstyk

Noah Berger for The ChronicleAlegra Eroy-Reveles (right), an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at San Francisco State U., uses Gradescope. “Getting feedback from a test you took two weeks ago is not going to help,” says Eroy-Reveles, shown here with Anna Martinez-Saltzberg, an instructor. “It’s important to get it in a timely manner.”





Consumer products like Alexa and Google Home can tell us how to prepare a meal and answer dinner-party trivia questions about the Treaty of Paris. So how long before tools powered by artificial intelligence start assuming more of the classroom work that professors handle today?The answer is simple: They already have. At the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, students in a statistics class last fall had their writing assignments evaluated by an automated text-analysis tool. And in 2016, some of the students in a computer-science class at the Georgia Institute of Technology were surprised to learn that one of the TAs answering their questions remotely all semester was actually a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence.

Consumer products like Alexa and Google Home can tell us how to prepare a meal and answer dinner-party trivia questions about the Treaty of Paris. So how long before tools powered by artificial intelligence start assuming more of the classroom work that professors handle today? The answer is simple: They already have. At the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, students in a statistics class last fall had their writing assignments evaluated by an automated text-analysis tool. And in 2016, some of the students in a computer-science class at the Georgia Institute of Technology were surprised to learn that one of the TAs answering their questions remotely all semester was actually a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. The bigger question, however, is this: How does teaching change as these AI tools start assuming more classroom work? That’s harder to answer. A new grading tool called Gradescope — powered by AI and now being used for more than 175,000 students at 550 colleges — offers one window on the possibilities. The tool helps automate the grading process without requiring instructors to rely on multiple-choice tests. Several professors who use it say the automation has actually made it easier for them to personalize their teaching — although some of their students have needed some convincing.

 Instructors also say the technology has made their grading fairer and faster — the latter an especially useful factor for courses like chemistry, in which students’ mastery of new material depends on their understanding what came before. “Getting feedback from a test you took two weeks ago is not going to help,” says Alegra Eroy-Reveles, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at San Francisco State University, now in her third year of using the tool. “It’s important to get it in a timely manner.” Because Gradescope has made grading tests easier, Eroy-Reveles is giving more of them. Instead of three major exams a semester, she now gives eight smaller tests. “It will take me about three hours to grade about 100 of them,” she says. The tool can read handwritten answers and can group together all the correct formulas in one batch and each variation of the wrong answer in separate batches. Thanks to those AI features, she’s able to quickly see what her students are missing.  The timesaving tool was developed by Arjun Singh and Sergey Karayev as Ph.D. students at the University of California at Berkeley. Working as TAs in a computer-science class on artificial intelligence in 2012, they felt buried by the tedium of having to grade 100 tests by hand and, as Singh recalls, “writing the same thing 50 times as your students make the same mistakes 50 times.” As student of AI themselves, they figured there had to be a way to deploy machine learning to make their own jobs easier. By the summer of 2014 they had written the code that could read students’ names off a form and recognize patterns in handwritten answers, such as chemical formulas for acids, as long as they were entered in a designated area on standardized-test forms. Their software could also identify and cluster those answers into groups. “We built this because we wanted a tool for ourselves,” Singh says.

 With another college friend and Singh’s faculty adviser, they established Gradescope as a company. They hoped that the tool’s main AI feature — its ability to read patterns not programmed in ahead of time — would set it apart from the few other automated grading tools in use. The tool doesn’t do all the work. Instructors, using a standardized form, must still scan in all the tests and determine how much weight to assign to each answer. That’s fundamental to the process, says Singh. For many professors, “the exam is the last line of defense” in a teaching environment increasingly influenced by standardized-course materials provided by publishers and other courseware developers. “They want to be involved in it.” Seth Anthony, an associate professor of chemistry at the Oregon Institute of Technology, tried Gradescope for a final exam last fall and is now using it for his general chemistry course, which has 40 engineering students. He says the tool has made him more attuned to the patterns of students’ mistakes, which he can more easily spot in weekly quizzes. And because the tool requires him to establish the grading rubric upfront, he says, “I can tell that my grading is fairer as a result.” The AI features in Gradescope “are not profoundly deep at this point,” he notes. The tool recognizes handwriting and can cluster answers, but it does not actually learn from previous patterns. Still, he appreciates its benefits, even if some of his students have been a bit uneasy about receiving their grades from an automated system. For some of them, he’s had to provide reassurance that he, as the instructor, was really determining their grades. Artificial-intelligence, Anthony says, “enables me to be more personal, but I can see how students would perceive it as more impersonal.”

That down-home resistance raises a question farmers might be tackling before much of the rest of the workforce: Can new technology ever beat old intuition — even when it comes to a bunch of cows?The AI that Watson’s farm uses — called Ida, for “The Intelligent Dairy Farmer’s Assistant” — tracks his cows’ tiniest movements through their collars and then graphs and dissects them en masse. Those “real-time cattle analytics” are then used by the AI to assess diet and movement and predict health issues of concern, such as lameness or udder infections.As silly as this intricate level of maximum optimization might sound, particularly in relation to a herd of cows that spend much of the day staring blankly or relieving themselves,Watson said, it could mean the difference between a cow’s healthy milking or premature death — and the difference between making or losing hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Ida AI has sparked some early interest among farmers eager to compete in an industry in which low milk prices and farm layoffs have everyone on edge. And while truck drivers and ­cashiers see AI as an omen of job elimination, the farmers say they’re in a labor crunch from years of too few young people getting into farming and need all the help they can get.Connecterra, a development team based in the Netherlands, built Ida with help from TensorFlow, the giant AI toolbox that Google created for its own apps and opened to the public in 2015. That release sparked a major wave of AI development, giving start-ups a shortcut to calculating advanced mathematics and creating learning machines.Google has joined other tech giants in pushing forcefully into AI, with chief executive Sundar Pichai telling a town-hall crowd in January that AI “is one of the most important things humanity is working on” and “more profound than electricity or fire.” (He did not explicitly mention cows.)Standing one March morning among his cows at Seven Oaks Dairy, one of three farms he runs as part of his Hart Agriculture brand, Watson pulls out his iPhone to show off his Ida app. The AI says he has three “potential health problems to be checked” among his herd: Cow #14433 is eating less, while cows #10172 and #3522 are “ruminating,” or chewing, less, a sign they might feel ill. His herd’s cows “to be inseminated” count is at zero, as signified by a reassuring green check mark.At 6-foot-4, with combine-wide shoulders and a Kiwi accent, the New Zealand-born Watson, 46, looks like a rugby player — which he was, playing a linebacker-like position in the late 1990s for a semiprofessional team called the Hurricanes. Shortly afterward, he moved to lead a cattle-grazing research program at the University of Georgia, where he taught and advocated for the increasingly rare practice of letting cows amble about aimlessly on a pasture, eating as they go.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis farm’s cattle — crossbreeds of America’s classic black and white moo cow, the Holstein, and New Zealand’s relatively slimmer brown Jersey bulls — spend almost all day grazing on the thousands of acres of ryegrass and Bermuda grass on his farms. That makes tracking their free-range eating and movement harder than at the average American “confinement” dairy, where cows are kept in stalls and fattened on corn and grains.Share this articleShareSpotting problems the old way required closely watching the herd day and night, “unless it’s really obvious — you know, she’s walking or limping or there are buzzards flying overhead,” Watson said. “Buzzards aren’t a particularly good health program.”The cows’ orange transmitters beam data over the hills of Watson’s pastures to a set of antennae near the milking parlor. A “base station” computer then gulps up and processes all that sensor data, doing much of the AI work locally to avoid the problem of spotty rural Internet service. The sensors the animals wear pay the price for much of this data exchange, Connecterra co-founder Yasir Khokhar said: “You don’t want to know what cows do with them.”The Ida AI was first trained to comprehend cow behavior via thousands of hours of video and sensor inputs, as well as simpler approaches, including Khokhar’s mimicking bovine techniques with a sensor in his pocket. (“I was the first cow,” he said.) Every day brings more cow data and farmer feedback that help the AI learn and improve.The AI, Khokhar estimates, has processed about “600 cow years of data” and gains about eight years of new cow data every day.The AI now logs seven distinct cow behaviors: walking, standing, lying down, eating, chewing, drinking and idling. Other behaviors are on the way, Khokhar said, though he could not disclose them, calling them part of the “secret sauce.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDairy farmers have used sensors for years. But Ida’s developers say its AI can do things old programs can’t, by learning from cow behavior patterns that can pinpoint injuries, predict the onset of certain diseases and “predict peak ovulation time with over 90 percent accuracy.” The AI can also track how changes to cows’ bedding, feed and environment can affect, for instance, how much milk they’re making or how much they’re lying around.Khokhar, who said he conceived the AI idea while living on a Dutch dairy farm, launched his start-up in late 2016 and counts a few thousand cow “subscriptions” on farms in seven countries, including the United States, Spain and Pakistan. The company covers all the equipment and service work and sells monthly subscriptions. Farmers’ prices start at about $3 a month per cow, plus a $79.99-per-cow start-up fee, and Watson estimates he has invested about $17,000 in the system so far.Agriculture has long been one of Big Technology’s juiciest target industries. Revamping the way farmers feed the planet, in the face of existential crises such as food shortages and climate change, would be audacious, revolutionary — and highly profitable. Start-ups and farmers are using camera-equipped robots to pick apples and sort cucumbers, running driverless tractors to harvest grain, and flying scanner drones to spot poachers and survey livestock.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBeyond the Ida collars, other tech start-ups make cow pedometers, robot milkers, tail sensors and electroshock collars that can stop or shift a herd.But even some farmers who have invested heavily in new technology balk at the idea of paying for more. Everett Williams, the 64-year-old head of the WDairy farm near Madison, Ga., said his farm has all kinds of sensors that print out who-knows-how-many reports on matters such as cow activity and whether wild hogs have gotten into his pens. They give him less data than the Ida AI would, he says, but he feels that he doesn’t have the space in his brain for another data stream. “You can only handle so many text alerts,” he said.Systems such as Connecterra also are enduring early criticism beyond the farm. Because AI can help detect early disorders and walking disabilities, conservationists have criticized the systems as encouraging the breeding of a super-cow by speeding underperformers to the slaughterhouse.Rodgers, who runs his “daddy-daughter” family dairy farm in Dearing, Ga., said he’s no Luddite when it comes to farm technology. His “super-system” features cow-tracking transponders and, soon, a DeLaval VMS, which milks cows with laser-guided robot arms and is advertised as the “ultimate automatic milking machine.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis system, unlike Ida, doesn’t track cud-chewing or use AI to tell him which cows to watch or what to do. But he’s okay with that. That’s the way things have always been done here, and he hopes they’ll be that way for a long time.“There’s no substitute for watching your animals. It’s an art and a science, and I hope my daughter and nephew get better at it than I am,” he said. The cattle, he added, don’t care much about evolving with the times. “You cannot bore a cow to death.”Share26 CommentsNewsletterWednesdaysThe Color of MoneyAdvice on how to save, spend and talk about your money for the short and long term from Michelle Singletary.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

				Reading brain waves was useless until A.I. got involved. Now mind reading has real-world, practical applications.

Here’s a thought: Mind-reading software is not only ready for commercial use, but it will actually be of practical use in everyday business applications.
But wait, you say. That’s creepy, invasive and useless. Read this column, though, and you just might change your mind about that. (And if you do, your gadgets will know.)
The missing ingredient
Futurists have predicted mind-reading technology for years. And while the detection of brain-wave patterns has been possible for decades, the missing ingredient was the ability to interpret them.











 
 
 
But now, thanks to artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning, we can finally know what’s going on inside people’s minds.

The general process is this. Researchers have developed software that takes readouts from people’s brains and matches them to words or pictures. Once mapped, future readouts can be read, interpreted and used for various kinds of mind-revealing or mental-control applications.
For example, MIT geniuses have invented a face-mounted device, plus a machine-learning application, that performs real-time speech-to-text conversion — but without the speech part.











 
 
 
I’d better explain that.
Electrodes on the device intercept neuromuscular signals sent by the brain to the face, and the machine-learning application transcribes them into text. It replaces vocalization with “subvocalization,” or “silent speech.”
Researchers use a neural network to match specific neuromuscular signals with specific words. Each person’s physiology is different. The researchers were able to achieve 92% accuracy after 15 minutes of customization and training.











 
 
 
The device also provides bone conduction output. That means you could make requests of a virtual assistant and get results audible only to you, all without the knowledge of people sitting right in front of you.
This is a surprising use for mind-reading technology, because it doesn’t “read” thoughts in general, only “instructions” sent from the brain to the face to speak (even if actual speaking doesn’t audibly or visually occur).
Also, it merely takes an existing behavior — spoken and audible interaction with a virtual assistant — and makes it silent and invisible, thereby increasing the range of situations where one could use a virtual assistant.











 
 
 
A video shows just how well this could work.
Of course, the device itself looks ridiculous. Nobody’s going to wear this in public. What’s important about this research is its proof that subvocalization can be a computer interface.
Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, have created a mind-reading device that also turns mental activity into text with better than 90% accuracy. Instead of understanding the words a person is subvocalizing, it can detect what that person is hearing, with brain activity alone.











 
 
 
The science was a bit gruesome.
The researchers took advantage of a kind of epilepsy treatment whereby electrodes are implanted directly on the surface of the brain. Scientists used those electrodes for a second purpose, which was to monitor brain waves in the auditory cortex. They took that data and used algorithms to decode the specific speech sounds as they were being heard by the subject.
It’s the first step toward creating an externally worn gadget that can be used to convert thoughts to text — either “perceived” or “produced” speech.











 
 
 
Carnegie Mellon University research has found ways to read “complex thoughts“ based on brain scans, and output text accordingly. The university’s study demonstrated that complex thinking could enable its A.I. to predict the next “sentence” in the thought process.
Even Facebook has a mind-reading project in the works. The social networking company’s secretive Building 8 division is working on a way for users to send Facebook Messenger messages using thoughts alone.
Microsoft, ever the user-interface company, was granted patents last year for interfaces that use brain activity to “change the state of a computer or applications.”











 
 
 
One example is to turn down the volume of music based on the mental activity of being irritated by loud noise. It could be used for any number of Microsoft-related products, from enhancing the accuracy of a mouse to enabling next-level applications in the company’s HoloLens mixed-reality system.
Mind-reading research is also making gains in reading visuals, not just words.
A recent University of Toronto Scarborough study was able to roughly re-create faces shown to subjects based on their brain activity.











 
 
 
Thirteen subjects were shown 140 faces. Electroencephalogram (EEG) readouts were processed by an A.I. algorithm developed by the scientists, and produced blurry but recognizable copies of what the subjects were shown.
Researchers are certain they’ll soon be able to re-create faces from memory alone, a feat that has obvious law-enforcement applications.
Japanese researchers at the University of Kyoto are working on a neural network system that performs in a similar way to the University of Toronto research. Subjects are shown pictures, then functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans plus A.I. can estimate what those pictures looked like based on blood flow to the brain.











 
 
 
Researchers at Purdue University are also reading minds using A.I. and fMRI machines. They showed subjects videos and used A.I. to train their software to predict brain activity in the visual cortex. Over time, they could figure out what the person was looking at based on brain activity alone.
Mind-reading apps are also showing up in other contexts.
A startup called Neurable is working on a sci-fi virtual-reality (VR) video game called Awakening, in which you pick up objects and even throw them with thoughts alone. The game comes with an electrode headband that connects to an HTC Vive VR headset.











 
 
 
As with the MIT technology, Neurable’s game doesn’t read “thoughts,” but instead uses neural activity as commands or instructions.
A participant in HTC’s Vive X accelerator program, called Looxid Labs, is building a mobile VR headset with built-in emotion-detection technology that uses both eye tracking and brainwave monitoring.
The company has also developed attachments for the HTC Vive that do the same thing. Developer kits are scheduled for release this summer.











 
 
 
On a more practical level, car giant Nissan revealed its IMx KURO concept car, complete with an EEG headset, at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show.
The system uses monitored brainwaves to speed up the reaction of the car. For example, when it detects that the driver intends to apply the brakes, it starts braking even before the driver stomps on the brakes. Nissan claims that reaction times can be sped up by as much as half a second.
The best application is for everyday business use
What’s now becoming clear is that the best use of mind-reading A.I. is not stand-alone applications for mind control or telepathy. Instead, it will almost certainly be the enhancement and perfection of existing business applications.











 
 
 
Autocorrect and speech recognition could be improved to something close to 100% accuracy by combining existing technologies with mind-reading applications to understand intent or thought processes.
Instead of the sci-fi scenario of some cyborg brainiac bringing finger to temple and mentally commanding armies of robots, mind-reading applications may simply make everything happen more accurately and automatically.
Lights and sounds may turn up or down based on mental preference at the moment. User interfaces could always do exactly what we want them to.
And our own thoughts might be reflected back at us without manually writing them down and reading what we wrote.











 
 
 
Now that A.I. makes real mind reading possible, it’s time to consider that such applications might be practical, productivity-enhancing and actually enjoyable to use.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Elon Musk talks about AI in “Do You Trust This Computer?” (Cinetic Media / Papercut Films via YouTube)
If you want to get really scared about the future, you could see “A Quiet Place” this weekend at your local theater — or you could stream “Do You Trust This Computer?” for free.
The latter movie, about the potential threat posed by artificial intelligence, comes with a thumbs-up from Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla who has long voiced serious concerns about AI.
Musk is one of the prominent interviewees in “Do You Trust This Computer?” — which was made by Chris Paine, the filmmaker behind “Who Killed the Electric Car?” Paine’s new 78-minute documentary had its premiere on Thursday night, and is available for free streaming through Sunday.

Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence. Watch Chris Paine’s new AI movie for free until Sunday night at https://t.co/WehHcZX7Qe
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 6, 2018
Musk brings the money quote when he points out that the evil leaders of the past, such as Adolf Hitler, held only limited sway because they were mortal. That wouldn’t be the case if an evil but superintelligent computer were to take control, he says.
“You would have an immortal dictator from which we can never escape,” he says.
Other cautions come from the likes of Berkeley’s Stuart Russell, the Singularity Institute’s Ray Kurzweil, MIT’s Max Tegmark, Stanford’s Jerry Kaplan and James Barrat, the author of “Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.”
You get the idea.
Microsoft Research’s Eric Horvitz, IBM’s David Ferrucci and Kitty Hawk’s Sebastian Thrun also chime in, but I get the feeling that they’re not as fearful of a Terminator-style takeover (and yes, there’s a clip from the “Terminator” movie).

The documentary touches on the current debate over Facebook’s flaws, but Musk singles out Google Deepmind for special concern. “With a little software update, that AI could take control of the whole Google system, which means they could do anything,” he says.
Rather than trying to beat the machines, Musk argues that we should assimilate them — by developing brain-computer interfaces that will give us AI powers. That’s the point behind Neuralink, one of the ventures he’s backing.
On that point, I side with Jonathan Nolan, the co-creator of HBO’s “Westworld,” who gets a lot of screen time in Paine’s documentary. When Nolan shared the stage with Musk at last month’s South by Southwest conference, he was somewhat skeptical about getting a brain implant.
“I’m keeping my brain air-gapped,” Nolan said.
There’s no question that automation, robotics and AI will transform society in the years to come — particularly when it comes to employment trends. But the outcome is sure to be more nuanced than a “Terminator” prequel.
For a different perspective on the issue, check out what Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, has to say in these reports:

The ongoing AI race between the US and China has taken another turn with news that Chinese firm SenseTime has raised $600 million (£425 million) at a valuation of $3 billion (£2 billion) – making it the world’s most valued artificial intelligence startup.
The company, behind the facial-recognition systems used by Chinese authorities, revealed on Monday it closed its series-C funding round with a record-breaking amount of capital. SenseTime CEO Li Xu said in a statement that the company plans to use the funds to grow its presence overseas and “widen the scope for more industrial application of AI”.

SenseTime hasn’t given specifics on who invested what, but Bloomberg is reporting that ecommerce titan Alibaba has sought the biggest stake in the company, with chipmaker Qualcomm, electronic retailer Suning.com Co and Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte among the other contributors.

Joe Tsai, Alibaba’s executive vice chairman, said: “SenseTime is doing pioneering work in artificial intelligence. We are especially impressed by their R&D capabilities in deep learning and visual computing. Our business at Alibaba is already seeing tangible benefits from our investments in AI and we are committed to further investment.”
SenseTime reportedly serves more than 400 customers, including Honda, Huawei and, Nvidia, although its most notable partner is, inarguably, the Chinese government. The firm’s AI systems are used by the state’s surveillance, processing vast amounts of data across the nation’s CCTV cameras, along with newer systems such as facial-recognition sunglasses. The company eventually aims for its developing ‘Viper’ system to juggle 100,000 live-streams simultaneously from ATMs, traffic cameras and a range of other scanners, automatically processing and tagging individuals.    
The company’s rapid growth emphasises China’s wider goal to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. The competing development of AI technology between China, the US and the rest of the world, is raising questions about the ethical standpoint of future technologies.
“Clearly there is a global competition happening in terms of AI,” Antony Walker, deputy CEO of techUK, told Alphr at the end of last year. “China in particular is very focused. People are coming to realise that your fundamental values need to be embedded in your approach to AI, and doing this with the democratic tradition in Europe and the US is something we need to get right.”
