Robot ordering the human out
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GQm0ZlcZVltBd_9XwJGyNw.jpeg 





Amidst all the hype over AI, there is also a lot of disquieting buzz about the negative consequences of AI. These fall broadly into three camps: job loss, criminal use, and ethical issues. Here, I focus on the concerns of job loss because this is a very real issue.

Philosophically, I am a card-carrying member of the AI fan club, being involved in it for the past three decades, starting with writing expert systems in Prolog back in the mid-80s and moving on to research. I always thought—and continue to think—that outside of low-temperature physics, AI is the coolest invention to beat all inventions in the history of humanity.
So, what more is there to fear here? I won't go into scholarly statistics about the number of jobs that have already been lost to AI with many more potentially on the chopping block. I won't harp on how the transportation industry, facing acute shortages of truck drivers (surely one of the most mind-numbing jobs ever), is looking into AI ""to dump the fleshbag[s] and let the trucks rumble solo down the highway.""
PROMOTED
In my latest book on AI+Blockchain, I describe how jobs that we thought must require a human touch and are therefore safe from AI aren't so immune after all. A quick example should convince you how a number of AI-based technologies can unwittingly collude to make this possible: driverless cars, robotics, payment systems, vision, and natural language understanding for a start. These form a synergistic continuum that, in the restaurant experience alone, can eliminate the parker (valet), barker (doorman), greeter, checker (coat and hat), seater, order-taker, server, sommelier, manager, entertainer, cleaner, and cashier. Let's not forget, tucked away in the kitchen, possibly robotic cooks. Let's face it, fast food burgers don't require a 5-star chef, do they?
All this is widely available on search engines for your reading pleasure (or agony, depending on your viewpoint). But what you won't see as much is the bigger revolution in jobs that I think is inevitable, whether one likes it or not, a revolution that will take place quietly at first, and then with increasing impact.
This revolution will have a much deeper impact than the mere (!) loss of jobs, devastating as job losses can be. After all, unemployment is nothing new. Anyone remember the following industries? Buggy whip makers, switchboard operators, or lift operators? How about knocker-uppers, aka wake-uppers: people whose job was to knock on the outside of your window to wake you up at a specified time in the morning; seriously, that used to be a job 100 years ago before the widespread use of the alarm clock!

Except for the most ardent Luddites, all reasonable people accept this as the price of progress and adapt in their own way. This adaptation is possible mostly because of the disruption caused by automation generally takes a long time to make a whole industry totally extinct.
Here is what I believe about AI and job loss:
Q: Will automation, specifically AI-driven automation, eliminate jobs?
A: Yes. Lots of them and in the most unexpected ways and at an unexpected pace.
Q: Will lost jobs be replaced by other jobs, just as it happened so far throughout history?
A: Only to a limited extent; there will be a massive net loss of jobs. I know many scientists and thought-leaders whom I respect a lot are predicting a huge increase in AI-related jobs to more or less compensate for the losses. I think this time they are wrong. When jobs were lost to mechanization, jobs for the mind opened up. What will happen when jobs for the mind become unnecessary or uneconomical?








Scientists Warn AI Means Job Losses
https://stimsinstitute.files.wordpress.com





Q: Should we retrain our children to compete with robots?
A: This question doesn't even make sense. Did you retrain your kids to run faster than cars? Did you retrain your kids to become stronger than tractors?
Q: Should we refocus children's education to those areas that AI cannot address?
A: Yes and no. The skills that are immune to AI—and unfortunately that is a wispy barrier—are the most impervious to mandatory formal training methods because they stem from innate passion or prodigy-like natural skills. Examples are higher math, theoretical physics, the higher levels of art and music, and so on. For these types of skills, I am reminded of what Edward Gibbon said, ""But the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous.""
How would you adapt to a revolution that promises, not in words but by example, to eliminate the notion of jobs itself? This is the unthinkable frontier beyond which few people are venturing. The idea that we must have jobs is so ingrained in human culture that we forget to ask why.
Let's step back for a second and look at this objectively. The reason we need jobs is so we can pay our bills, buy things, and fulfill our desires. What we really want aren't jobs but the income that jobs bring us. What we need is work (not jobs) for self-fulfillment, and therein lies an enormous difference. More on that below.
What proportion of workers can truly claim that they love their jobs? Talk is cheap. The acid test is this: If you were to win a lottery jackpot worth several millions, would you continue to work at your current job, perhaps for free? I suspect that even those who claim that they really, really love their jobs would re-examine their options if they hit the jackpot. People may continue working, but they wouldn't hanker after paying jobs, especially not jobs that are ridden with stress, abuse, harassment, and office politics.
Isn't this the promise of automation? Let's take a walk down a path that admittedly stretches our credulity. Imagine a future where most of the work is automated, thanks to AI. This would include farming, transportation of goods, personal transportation, maintenance of roads, generation of power, manufacturing, custodial services, interaction services (for example, customer service and in restaurants), medical care, elderly care, schooling, and so on.
Note that I'm not saying humans will be—or even could be—completely eliminated from the equation, only that their role will become either minimal or move up the cognitive scale; they would function as casual supervisors or auxiliary helpers when things get really tricky, and that too on very reduced work hours.










Far out? Not at all. This is already happening in isolated examples. As William Gibson said, ""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.""
Informed people know that this is already happening. What stretches the imagination a bit is how this affects jobs. Let's get back to the fundamentals of economics - the law of supply and demand and its effect on prices.
When AI eliminates jobs (more accurately, the need for them), there is the obvious loss of income. This means less disposable income and reduction of spending on nice-to-have goods and luxuries. Less demand forces prices to drop. If prices drop below a level where commodity margins are threatened, the company and eventually the industry, will fold.
Prices of necessary goods (generally, commodities) will continue to drop, but shrinking margins are somewhat offset by decreasing operational costs (thanks to AI-driven automation). Food prices, for example, could go down. Remember that the sinister food cartels that we fear (whether truly sinister or not) cannot keep charging seemingly high prices because consumers' inability to pay cannot sustain high prices in the long run.
Rather than outright and widespread job loss, what I think will happen is a gradual lessening of work hours, eventually moving employees from full-time to temp. But, if all things go well, the loss in pay need not pinch because there will be a corresponding decrease in costs for all types of goods.
People will slowly come to the realization that total income is less important than relative income. Indeed, income that is measured relative to one's neighbor is even less important than measuring against its economic power. Would you lose much sleep if your six-figure salary got cut in half if home prices were also slashed to a fifth, a pound of filet mignon cost $1.50, and a 10-lb bag of potatoes cost 10 cents? Would you really care if the richest person on the planet makes one hundred million times more income than you do under these conditions?
I don't think people would worry so much about the end result if all things go well. The problem is in the transition, of course. Not all things go well all the time. But the general direction will be towards less job-related work without any corresponding reduction in the quality of life (and perhaps an overall improvement in the quality of lifestyle). This progress will obviously not happen in a straight, happy path, but will meander agonizingly, causing considerable distress, backtracking, and excitement along the way.
In truth, I suspect that there will be plenty of advance notice of impending job loss. A few hundred thousand truck drivers aren't going to show up for work one morning only to be told that they have all been replaced overnight by driverless trucks. Drivers' ed instructors will not be completely blindsided to find one day that they have no students because everyone switched over to driverless cars. The entire DMV staff isn't going to be laid off on the same day because autonomous vehicles and blockchains put them out of business overnight.










There will be a transition which, despite all the hype and exuberance, will have a fairly long trajectory. But slowly, slowly, across the board, people will start discovering that they really don't have to work 60 hours a week. There will be serious proposals to reduce the work week from 40 hours to 36 hours; then to four days a week. Full-time work gives way to part-time work. Desk-bound, 8-5 work will slowly give way to flex-time work. Remote work will edge out on-site work. People will cut their working hours by 25% and find, to their pleasant surprise, that their lifestyle actually improves a bit as a result, even if they aren't making the previous level of income. Hard work will be replaced by smart work (but 'smart' perhaps not in the sense of making enormous amounts of money with little work, but in the sense of obtaining high returns on happiness and lifestyle). Financial freedom will give way to time freedom.
AI will cause enormous job losses, but that is nothing compared to the loss of meaning in traditional work and virtue of duty-bound toil. This will force people to re-examine their motivations for work. Would you get up in the morning and do something for your own sake, for your own pleasure and passion, when you don't have to do so to feed yourself?
What will you do when you don't have to?
Many people will be unpleasantly shocked to find they have no passion. For them, AI spells debilitating inertia, deepening despair, and the slide into apathy. A happy group (hopefully, more than a few) will look upon this as a golden opportunity to get rid of the shackles of work they must do so they can do work they want to do.
The AI revolution will be eclipsed by the revolution caused by decoupling jobs from work and by moving from ""I work, therefore I live"" to ""I live, therefore I work."" Sociologists will be forced to re-examine and re-formulate their models of human interaction and organization. Economists will be forced to re-think incentives and agency relationships. Politicians will be forced to invent new rhetoric for their platforms when the traditional political posturings will become moot. Schools will be forced to contend with a deschooled society (in the sense of Ivan Illich's ""Deschooling Society"").
Society as a whole must then grapple with the deeper social, economic, and psychological ramifications of permanent net job losses caused by AI. In consolation, the loss of jobs without (optimistically) loss of lifestyle should give us the time and freedom to think about these issues. Perhaps we can even debate the nature of intelligence as it applies to artificial intelligence.
If all this pans out as I think it will and should, this is quite a good impact of artificial intelligence on natural intelligence; we have nothing to fear but to be prepared for the transition itself!Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website. Kiran GarimellaKiran Garimella is a Chief Scientist & Chief Technology Officer at KoreConX, leading the development of an AI-based blockchain platform for the global... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  Regardless of whether one adopts a pessimistic or optimistic view of artificial intelligence, policy will shape how it affects society. This column looks at both the policies that will influence the diffusion of AI and policies that will address its consequences. One of the most significant long-run policy issues relates to the potential for artificial intelligence to increase inequality.

Not that long ago artificial intelligence (AI), robots and machine learning (ML) were thought to be things only found in science fiction films. Today, this type of technology is taking center stage in workplaces across the globe. Industries, including manufacturing, retail, agriculture, and customer service have already had AI replace some job positions that left workers scrambling to find new career options.
This AI revolution is not expected to slow down anytime soon. In fact, experts anticipate that as many as 800 million jobsOpens a new window  could be replaced with AI technology by the year 2030. Initially, AI technology and automation in the workplace seemed to only affect pink and blue-collar workers. As this technology advances and becomes more powerful, professional, white-collar workers, including accountants, are starting to worry about what the future holds for their career and if AI will make their job obsolete.
AI in Accounting
In basic terms, AI technologyOpens a new window  is intelligent machines that are able to complete repetitive, mundane tasks at a fraction of the time it takes humans and with greater accuracy. The emergence of Machine Learning Opens a new window now allows AI platforms to observe, analyze and self-learn data and processes to improve its performance and accuracy over time.
AI technology is already able to handle many accounting functions, such as tax preparation, payroll, and audits. Many of the leading accounting software providers, including Xero, Intuit and Sage have incorporated AI technology into their software to handle basic accounting tasks, such as bank reconciliations, invoice categorization, risk assessment, and audit processes, like expense submissions and invoice payments.
Many of these standard tasks are extremely time-consuming, which has many accountants across the country worried about how the emerging AI technology will affect their billable hours. An even bigger concern is that AI technologies will replace the need for companies to work with accountants at all.
AI Will Transform not Replace Accountants
While there is no doubt that AI technology is capable of handling many standard accounting tasks faster and more efficiently or that these capabilities will only increase over time, it doesn’t mean the end for accountants. There always will be a need for that human element – human intelligence – at the other end of AI technology. In fact, according to leading research firm, GartnerOpens a new window , AI is set to create more jobs than it will replace, leaving workers, including accountants with options.
Accountants don’t have to worry about their job being replaced by AI any time in the near future. Companies will always need accountants that can analyze and interpret AI data, as well as provide consulting services. Rather than replacing the role of an accountant, AI technology will transform the duties an accountant performs.
With AI technology and machine learning handling many of the mundane, repetitive tasks, accountants will have more time to focus on other aspects of the job, such as consulting and data analysis. This is good news for many accountants. Rather than spending hours completing menial tasks, accountants of the future will be able to use and analyze AI data to provide their clients with sound business solutions.
In many ways, AI will help accountants improve their services. AI technology will improve data entry accuracy and lower the liability risk for accountants. In addition, emerging technology is more efficient at fraud detection, adding an extra layer of protection for accountants and their clients. It also provides real-time data, which allows accountants to provide real-time solutions. Even more impressive is the ability of machine learning to analyze large amounts of data instantly, evaluate past successes and failures in an effort to accurately predict future outcomes.
Preparing for the Future
There is no way to escape the use of AI technology, at least not if you hope to remain competitive in the upcoming years. The speed, efficiency and accuracy of AI technology just cannot be beat. The only thing accountants can do is to embrace this new technology and learn how to maximize its use. The better equipped you are to help your clients integrate and utilize AI technology in their accounting processes the more valuable you will be.
Many universities today are already incorporating IT and database management courses into their accounting program. This means that graduating students are coming into the workforce with the skills they need for future accounting work. Accountants already in the workforce must find ways to acquire these skills in order to remain relevant to their employers and/or their clients.
Accountants can obtain the IT skills they need by attending seminars, using self-learning online programs or attending college-level courses. It is equally important for accountants to stay up-to-date on the latest accounting trends, emerging technologies and industry news. This will allows accountants to not only keep their jobs but to also provide more efficient services to their clients.
Rather than worry about AI taking over their jobs, accountants should embrace this technology as a powerful solution to enhance customer services. Finally, accountants will be able to use all their training and experience to provide customer will real and effective business solutions, whether it’s in reference to tax consulting, real estate deals, mergers, growth options, or any other business practice.
Technology is advancing at record rates so now is the time to obtain the IT and database management skills you need to advance into the future. With the right skills and training, accountants are guaranteed a lucrative career that will last well into the future.

          MIT researchers aim to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, with a machine-learning model that makes chemotherapy and radiotherapy dosing regimens less toxic but still as effective as human-designed regimens.

MIT researchers are employing novel machine-learning techniques to improve the quality of life for patients by reducing toxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy dosing for glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer.Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that appears in the brain or spinal cord, and prognosis for adults is no more than five years. Patients must endure a combination of radiation therapy and multiple drugs taken every month. Medical professionals generally administer maximum safe drug doses to shrink the tumor as much as possible. But these strong pharmaceuticals still cause debilitating side effects in patients.In a paper being presented next week at the 2018 Machine Learning for Healthcare conference at Stanford University, MIT Media Lab researchers detail a model that could make dosing regimens less toxic but still effective. Powered by a “self-learning” machine-learning technique, the model looks at treatment regimens currently in use, and iteratively adjusts the doses. Eventually, it finds an optimal treatment plan, with the lowest possible potency and frequency of doses that should still reduce tumor sizes to a degree comparable to that of traditional regimens.In simulated trials of 50 patients, the machine-learning model designed treatment cycles that reduced the potency to a quarter or half of nearly all the doses while maintaining the same tumor-shrinking potential. Many times, it skipped doses altogether, scheduling administrations only twice a year instead of monthly.“We kept the goal, where we have to help patients by reducing tumor sizes but, at the same time, we want to make sure the quality of life — the dosing toxicity — doesn’t lead to overwhelming sickness and harmful side effects,” says Pratik Shah, a principal investigator at the Media Lab who supervised this research.The paper’s first author is Media Lab researcher Gregory Yauney.

Rewarding good choicesThe researchers’ model uses a technique called reinforced learning (RL), a method inspired by behavioral psychology, in which a model learns to favor certain behavior that leads to a desired outcome.The technique comprises artificially intelligent “agents” that complete “actions” in an unpredictable, complex environment to reach a desired “outcome.” Whenever it completes an action, the agent receives a “reward” or “penalty,” depending on whether the action works toward the outcome. Then, the agent adjusts its actions accordingly to achieve that outcome.Rewards and penalties are basically positive and negative numbers, say +1 or -1. Their values vary by the action taken, calculated by probability of succeeding or failing at the outcome, among other factors. The agent is essentially trying to numerically optimize all actions, based on reward and penalty values, to get to a maximum outcome score for a given task.The approach was used to train the computer program DeepMind that in 2016 made headlines for beating one of the world’s best human players in the game “Go.” It’s also used to train driverless cars in maneuvers, such as merging into traffic or parking, where the vehicle will practice over and over, adjusting its course, until it gets it right.The researchers adapted an RL model for glioblastoma treatments that use a combination of the drugs temozolomide (TMZ) and procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PVC), administered over weeks or months.The model’s agent combs through traditionally administered regimens. These regimens are based on protocols that have been used clinically for decades and are based on animal testing and various clinical trials. Oncologists use these established protocols to predict how much doses to give patients based on weight.As the model explores the regimen, at each planned dosing interval — say, once a month — it decides on one of several actions. It can, first, either initiate or withhold a dose. If it does administer, it then decides if the entire dose, or only a portion, is necessary. At each action, it pings another clinical model — often used to predict a tumor’s change in size in response to treatments — to see if the action shrinks the mean tumor diameter. If it does, the model receives a reward.However, the researchers also had to make sure the model doesn’t just dish out a maximum number and potency of doses. Whenever the model chooses to administer all full doses, therefore, it gets penalized, so instead chooses fewer, smaller doses. “If all we want to do is reduce the mean tumor diameter, and let it take whatever actions it wants, it will administer drugs irresponsibly,” Shah says. “Instead, we said, ‘We need to reduce the harmful actions it takes to get to that outcome.’”This represents an “unorthodox RL model, described in the paper for the first time,” Shah says, that weighs potential negative consequences of actions (doses) against an outcome (tumor reduction). Traditional RL models work toward a single outcome, such as winning a game, and take any and all actions that maximize that outcome. On the other hand, the researchers’ model, at each action, has flexibility to find a dose that doesn’t necessarily solely maximize tumor reduction, but that strikes a perfect balance between maximum tumor reduction and low toxicity. This technique, he adds, has various medical and clinical trial applications, where actions for treating patients must be regulated to prevent harmful side effects.Optimal regimensThe researchers trained the model on 50 simulated patients, randomly selected from a large database of glioblastoma patients who had previously undergone traditional treatments. For each patient, the model conducted about 20,000 trial-and-error test runs. Once training was complete, the model learned parameters for optimal regimens. When given new patients, the model used those parameters to formulate new regimens based on various constraints the researchers provided.The researchers then tested the model on 50 new simulated patients and compared the results to those of a conventional regimen using both TMZ and PVC. When given no dosage penalty, the model designed nearly identical regimens to human experts. Given small and large dosing penalties, however, it substantially cut the doses’ frequency and potency, while reducing tumor sizes.The researchers also designed the model to treat each patient individually, as well as in a single cohort, and achieved similar results (medical data for each patient was available to the researchers). Traditionally, a same dosing regimen is applied to groups of patients, but differences in tumor size, medical histories, genetic profiles, and biomarkers can all change how a patient is treated. These variables are not considered during traditional clinical trial designs and other treatments, often leading to poor responses to therapy in large populations, Shah says.“We said [to the model], ‘Do you have to administer the same dose for all the patients? And it said, ‘No. I can give a quarter dose to this person, half to this person, and maybe we skip a dose for this person.’ That was the most exciting part of this work, where we are able to generate precision medicine-based treatments by conducting one-person trials using unorthodox machine-learning architectures,” Shah says.
The model offers a major improvement over the conventional “eye-balling” method of administering doses, observing how patients respond, and adjusting accordingly, says Nicholas J. Schork, a professor and director of human biology at the J. Craig Venter Institute, and an expert in clinical trial design. “[Humans don’t] have the in-depth perception that a machine looking at tons of data has, so the human process is slow, tedious, and inexact,” he says. “Here, you’re just letting a computer look for patterns in the data, which would take forever for a human to sift through, and use those patterns to find optimal doses.”Schork adds that this work may particularly interest the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is now seeking ways to leverage data and artificial intelligence to develop health technologies. Regulations still need be established, he says, “but I don’t doubt, in a short amount of time, the FDA will figure out how to vet these [technologies] appropriately, so they can be used in everyday clinical programs.”

Data scientists, artificial intelligence experts and machine learning developers are in hot demand right now — so much, that these are some of the hardest jobs to fill.
According to this year’s best jobs report from Glassdoor, data scientist was the best job in the U.S. It was also the top job in 2017, and in 2016, up from ninth place in 2015. The number of job openings on the site rose from 3,449 in 2015 to 4,524 this year. And IBM predicts that the number of openings for U.S. data scientists and similar advanced analytical roles will reach 61,799 by 2020, with a 93 percent predicted growth rate in data science skills, followed by machine learning with 56 percent predicted growth.

And as demand increases, the number of candidates available to fill those roles is showing signs of not being able to catch up. According to Bloomberg, job postings for data scientists on Indeed.com increased by 75 percent between January 2015 and January 2017 — but job searches only went up by 65 percent.











 
 
 
It’s no wonder that enterprises are having a hard time finding qualified people. According to the 2018 State of the CIO report, 36 percent of respondents say that filling business intelligence and data analytics roles will be difficult, second only to cybersecurity. Artificial intelligence also made the top ten list, with 18 percent of respondents saying they anticipate AI role being hard to fill.

“There’s a significant demand for people with expertise in AI and machine learning,” says Tom Mitchell, professor of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University.
Instead of hiring new employees, some companies are looking to help existing staffers get the advanced education and training they need to work in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.











 
 
 
The most advanced training, such as the master’s program at Carnegie Mellon, takes between a year and a year and a half to complete, and requires knowledge of statistics, and basic programming skills. But there are also many online programs and courses that people can take, Mitchell says.
Here is a look at how several companies across a wide range of industries are training up current employees for the AI era ahead.
Back to school
Los Angeles County knows what the job market is like right now.











 
 
 
“We are also seeking resources that are hard to find when it comes to AI and business intelligence and automation experts,” says Murtaza Masood, assistant director at the LA County Department of Human Resources. He was previously the CIO of the department, and is leading many of the digital transformation initiatives for the county.

Recruitment efforts include partnerships with all regional academic institutions with relevant programs, and an internship program to create a pipeline of talent.
But the county has also been growing its own AI experts.











 
 
 
“Three years ago we established a center of excellence for AI that allowed us to start gathering existing resources within the county that had some expertise in this area,” he says. Employees interested in the subject can get tuition reimbursement for outside coursework, as well as in-house training.
Employees are particularly interested in algorithm design, he says, but the types of training employees pursue varies depending on the need.
“Business initiatives lead to platform decisions which lead to increased demand for training around those particular elements,” he says. Fortunately, the county has in-house talent to draw on. “Historically speaking, we’ve been early adopters of statistical analysis packages.”











 
 
 
For example, the county has recently been investing in monitoring and analysis tools to spot a variety of personnel issues, as well as potential cybersecurity problems. With 111,000 employees — LA County is the largest local government organization in the country — there’s a lot of data that can be analyzed to spot potential problems. But Masood wants to see machine learning and artificial intelligence used for more than spotting problems.
“Where I’m really excited, both as an HR professional and a technologist, is the ability to get training resources to employees to preempt all of that. The ability to serve up timely and bite-size information that enables an employee to improve their thought processes or behavior or knowledge, that is where I think the real power is and that is where the future might be,” he says.
Bringing training in-house
Capgemini is also in the middle of a big push right now to hire people with AI expertise. The consulting firm doesn’t write software, but it works with clients to configure and integrate existing software, and AI is now a major area of focus.











 
 
 
In addition to hiring experts, and sponsoring existing employees to get additional training, the company also has a digital acceleration center to help employees learn about new AI tech.
“We have a sandbox environment and we’ll trial the software in a laboratory,” says Tom Ivory, Capgemini’s head of strategic innovation. “We’re experimenting with dozens of AI technologies right now, and not every single one of them will be greenlit to move forward.”
At that point, Capgemini will train executives and delivery managers and other people on the team that works with customers on how to use those tools, he says.











 
 
 
The company also uses AI in its own operations. For example, Capgemini uses technology from automation vendor UiPath, and IBM Watson, to help process resumes of potential hires.
“We typically used keyword searches,” he says. “By using AI, there are more nuances that can increase the success rate of that individual being staffed on a project.”
At first, Capgemini used vendor-provided training, but soon there was a critical mass of internal experts.











 
 
 
“We had a baseline of management who were trained, as well as people who would actually have their hands on the keyboard, strategists, and folks who could understand how this technology would affect business processes,” he says. At that point, Capgemini brought the training in-house, using purchased training models from the vendor as the base.
Three years ago, the number of people at the company who trained in this technology was in the dozens — now, there are thousands, he says.
Embracing AI companywide
For tech companies that have an AI component to their products or services, employee training is even more critical.











 
 
 
Salesforce, for example, has been adding intelligence to its online customer relationship management platform. That means that in-house employees have to know their way around the technology. There’s an online training platform, part of the same Salesforce Trailhead system that’s available to the public.
“We have our own Trail, in which we have all this learning material that’s just freely available, that allows people to learn how to consume the AI capability that Salesforce provides,” says Marco Casalaina, vice president of product management of Salesforce Einstein at Salesforce.com. “It cuts across the company — we want everyone to be able to add intelligence, and to use intelligence, in applications in Salesforce.”
For example, an IT development team working on a room scheduling application for facilities management added intelligence to their application, to assign rooms to those customers who would benefit from the meetings the most.











 
 
 
“They’re not data scientists,” Casalaina says. “And our training is made for people like that, people who don’t have a data science background but want to make predictions.”
Peer-to-peer mentoring
Cybersecurity firm Stealthbits Technologies is also investing in AI and machine learning skills. Some of that is from outside sources, says Jonathan Sander, the company’s CTO. “But the bulk of it is peer-to-peer.”
The actual training is different for different engineering groups, he says. “For the R&D folks who will get hands on, they are looking for the more comprehensive starter courses followed by the peer-to-peer materials we generate, and finally move into a mentoring system we have for building R&D talent. In that track they cover everything from the basics all the way through to application.”











 
 
 
On the support, consulting, and pre-sales side, the employees need to be able to understand how to use the technology and communicate its value.
“Our customers always benefit from more skilled engineers,” he says, “And the ML training has prepared them to give them good advice in using our ML-powered solutions as well as generally approaching ML as a valuable tool.”
Many companies think that machine learning is too complex or obscure to learn — that’s a mistake, he says.











 
 
 
“Ignore those impressions and get your hands dirty,” he says.
Like Stealthbits, big data firm Insight Engines also see a lot of value in peer-to-peer training.
“We start by incrementally exposing new staff to small areas of our development pipeline, where the changes they make have large-scale impact on our customers,” says Darien Kindlund, vice president of technology at Insight Engines. Then they move on to working on improving workflows, while still being supervised by experienced mentors.
So far about 65 percent of employees — both technical and non-technical — have received this kind of training, with a focus on machine learning, natural language processing, and data science, Kindlund says.











 
 
 
“By providing on-the-job training focused on customer impact in an applied setting, we have found our team absorbs, learns, and builds upon these skills much faster than in an academic setting,” he says.
Cybersecurity vendor Vectra Networks is also focusing on on-the-job, peer-to-peer training.
“Oftentimes, we have experienced mentors paired with new hires on projects to offer suggestions and guide them with machine learning approaches,” says Kevin Ni, the company’s data science team lead. “By training employees here the way we do, we can guide their development focused towards the unique problem space we are in. This means that customers can get results sooner. We also encourage employees to audit major online classes if they are unfamiliar with specific subjects.”
Expecting employees to learn on their own isn’t fast enough, says Joseph Kucic, CSO at Cavirin Systems, a cybersecurity vendor. Until recently, he was with the enterprise AI working group at Verizon.
“On the job, partner-mentor speeds up the ability to transfer knowledge and execute on the business goals,” he says.
If the need for AI talent is extremely urgent, then you can take radical actions, like acquiring talent by buying another company, he says. “But for longer term, the focus needs to be on a partner-mentor approach.”
Training at the pace of change
When training up employees in any emerging technology, keeping up with the rate of innovation is key. That means taking an ongoing approach to fostering new skills.
Invoca, a California-based call intelligence vendor, released its machine learning product, Signal AI, about a year ago. Since machine learning is now a core focus of the company, training is critical.
“We hold educational sessions across departments to educate internal teams about AI foundations, as well as specifically related to our AI solution offering,” says Sean Storlie, the company’s director of product management. There are quarterly AI-related trainings from the company’s data science team. In addition, employees can expense online tutorials, conferences, and onsite training.
“You can’t over-educate on this subject as things are changing so quickly in this industry,” he says.
“We create software that is supposed to also help other companies implement ML and AI,” says Lalith Subramanian, vice president of engineering for security, discovery and analytics at OpenText. “Internally, what we find is that the skills constantly have to be kept up to date.”
The company has a tuition reimbursement program for employees and also has been running training programs for the past three or four years, he says. “For instance, if we have a topic like commutative neural networks to be trained on, we bring in a training company and have groups of employees get the training,” he says.
But will they leave?
Some companies are reluctant to invest in AI-related training because they fear that the employees will immediately walk out the door, translating their new skills into big paydays elsewhere.
“In the tech industry, especially in Silicon Valley, a certain group of opportunists will get the latest training to look good in interviews,” says OpenText’s Subramanian. “But it’s not any more than if we didn’t have the training.”
In fact, in his experience, having the training available helps with retention, he says.
Another cybersecurity company offering extensive AI-related training to employees is Demisto.
“We are not worried about retention,” says company co-founder Rishi Bhargava. “As a company, we firmly believe that better trained employees are happier employees and do their jobs better. Moreover, encouraging upskilling is just one facet of our overall company culture. If a company helps an employee with training and the employee then leaves, the employee must not have been very satisfied with the job in the first place.”
Ongoing training also helps with retention at Aetna, the country’s third-largest health insurance company.
“It teaches them skills that are growing in marketability, and that’s a good thing for a professional,” says Jim Routh, the company’s CSO.
Aetna has a program to teach data science fundamentals to every one of the company’s security professionals, he says. By sticking with Aetna, employees not only continue to get this training, but they can also use the skills they learn on leading-edge applications, which means state-of-the art, unconventional security controls, he adds.
“We partner with a data science team of several hundred data scientists on our health side and our business side,” Routh says. “Together, we’re developing a core curriculum using a combination of commercially-available online training, and some training that we have developed in-house.”
So far, 200 security professionals have gone through the mandatory foundations class. “We’ve been teaching the course for two years now,” he says. “At first it was optional, but it quickly became the most popular course we teach.”

Artificial Intelligence(AI) Systems And Their Influence On Social Media

By Asif Razzaq -   August 8, 2018 



Reddit7VoteFlipShareTweet7 SharesSocial media accounts are an extremely popular method for staying connected and for using emerging technology to grow audiences. Almost 2.5 billion users worldwide will be present on at least one type of social media channel by the end of 2018. 
It’s no wonder that marketing companies as a whole are shifting their focus toward social media and even using AI systems to give themselves an advantage. As the number of tools available starts to rapidly increase it could be possible for marketers to have an easier and more targeted journey of discovering their users.

Facebook and AI:
Facebook with one of the first social networks to start focusing in on AI in the year 2013 when they started to work with New York University. AI systems are present all over Facebook, and many deep learning algorithms are working within keyword studies, shared likes and more. The unfortunate side of Facebook is that it got into hot water from the research that he did with Cambridge analytica. With this specific idea, AI was working to solve through a series of problems over the network. The only issue with that is the AI systems and data that were presented were delivered without the consent of any user. Facebook and the network itself was stopped short in its efforts. 
AI and Pinterest:
With so many people on Pinterest often ending up making purchases of the projects that they see online, the app began to use AI learning to recommend products based off of their likes. The system itself had a stylistic nature that ensured that the suggestions presented could be streamlined for users online and designed in such a way that Pinterest could continually present new ideas and make suggestions for users.

This system did not fall under the same type of scandal that was present on networks like Facebook. The Pinterest recommendations are widely welcomed in many cases for the streamlined and stylistic nature of the social network. The way that searching habits have been changed have also made for a social network that is more intelligent because of its suggestions. 
Twitter and AI:
Twitter also has an advanced AI built into its current configuration. The AI on Twitter is directly responsible for establishing a category for every single tweet. The idea of the category system is to make sure that the content people care about most is what’s appearing in their timeline. 
Twitter is also using a series of neural networks to automatically cropped photos and produce a more consistent aesthetic for the fee. Machine learning was done using eye tracking records to make sure that photographs can be presented in their most appealing form to each user. 
As AI systems continue to integrate their way into social media in the future, brands will be able to generate a better experience for their customers and improve ROI based off of the systems. As there is a large pool of individuals across social media, having AI systems that can cover many bases can help to make sure that ongoing monitoring can occur.

But Can It Do Comedy?Share full articleRead in appPiotr Mirowski in August with a toy robot he uses in his improv act, which combines artificial intelligence and human performers.Credit...Tom Jamieson for The New York TimesBy Alex MarshallAug. 8, 2018LONDON — One recent evening at a London pub, Piotr Mirowski, 39, stood in front of several dozen comedy fans to prove that an artificially intelligent computer program could perform improvised comedy.In one hand, he held a bug-eyed toy robot, its lines voiced by the program. With the other, he pretended to grip a steering wheel. The robot was playing Mr. Mirowski’s partner; they were taking a scenic drive together.ImageCredit...Natalya Micic“I am not trying to be angry,” the robot said, suddenly breaking the mood.“I don’t want you to be angry — this is our quality time,” Mr. Mirowski replied.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m sure that you will find love,” the robot said after an awkward pause, drawing a firm end to the couple’s relationship, and prompting laughter from the audience. “I’m so tired,” it added. Mr. Mirowski made a final attempt to save things, but the robot would not listen. “You are not me. You’re my friend,” it said, emotionless.For someone who had just been dumped in front of a paying audience, Mr. Mirowski looked happy. Why? Because the A.I. he created had worked, and stuck to the topic at hand — a rare event, he said later in an interview.For the past few years, A.I. has been generating attention — and alarm — in many areas of arts and culture. Start-ups and tech giants are developing A. I. systems that can write music, for example, while others are using the technology to generate art. Some fear these projects will put musicians and artists out of work.Using computers to make comedy has received less attention, but it has a surprisingly long history. In the early 1990s, researchers at the University of Edinburgh wrote a program that could produce question-based puns such as “What do you call a good-looking taxi? A handsome cab.” (It “succeeds in generating pieces of text that are recognizably jokes, but some of them are not very good jokes,” the researchers said in a paper on the project.)Today, around a dozen people in Europe and North America are working on similar projects, mainly in their spare time from A.I.-related jobs, Mr. Mirowski said. (He is a senior research scientist working on artificial intelligence at Google DeepMind, but said his work there was not related to comedy.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Mirowski was born in Poland, but spent most of his childhood in France, playing role-playing and video games, he said. He fell in love with improv at college, both the challenge and playfulness of it, and kept doing it after he graduated and started working in A.I.He long thought of combining his passions, but said he had only realized it was possible in 2014, partly because of systems that could quickly analyze large volumes of text, spot patterns and then produce sentences in response. Mr. Mirowski decided to apply that to improv skits.The system he built was remarkably simple. A.L.Ex (which stands for Artificial Language Experiment) has been fed the subtitles from more than 100,000 films, from action movies like “Deep Impact” to the pornographic film “Deep Throat.” When someone talks to it, the system uses a tool called a neural network, vaguely modeled on the brain, to analyze similar exchanges in its database and compose its own response.Mr. Mirowski made his stage debut with A.L.Ex in July 2016. It did not go to plan. “There was a moment where it didn’t say anything as the speech recognition crashed,” Mr. Mirowski said, “so I had to say, ‘I see you want to stay silent.’ That is something you can only really do once.”ImageKory Mathewson, left, in Canada, and Piotr Mirowski in London. They have worked together on A.L.Ex, Mr. Mirowski’s A.I. improv performer, helping it get better at staying on topic.Credit...Daniel Wood for The New York Times; Tom Jamieson for The New York TimesAround that time, Mr. Mirowski met Kory Mathewson, an A.I. researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada who had developed a comedy chatbot he was trying to use in live improv, and the two began collaborating. They have made numerous improvements to A.L.Ex, including tweaks to its code to make it better at sticking to a topic. (If a sketch is set on a pirate ship, you don’t want it to suddenly talk about space.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.L.Ex is now at the point where the pair are happy for other improvisers to work with it. In recent shows in London, Mr. Mirowski also used the system to feed a performer lines through a headset.Despite all the improvements, Mr. Mirowski said working with an A.I. was still like having a “completely drunk comedian” on stage, who was only “accidentally funny,” by saying things that were totally inappropriate, overly emotional or plain odd.“Robots are in a way the antithesis of theater and comedy,” he said. “Theatre is about the human expression on stage, and it’s about the communication and empathy between the actors and the audience. Robots do not have the sensors to perceive any of that.”What A.I. is good at, Mr. Mirowski said, is saying unusual things that challenge the human improviser to work harder, which can increase satisfaction when they manage to make a scene work. “Improv is like intellectual and mental tightrope walking,” he said. “The robot is kind of making the tightrope longer.”In a Skype interview, Mr. Mathewson agreed that the joy of working with an A.I. system came when you managed to do a show that didn’t just rely on the randomness of the responses for humor, but which kept a story going.His early shows were failures in that respect, he said. In one, he swore in exasperation, and the machine replied, “Swearing is often cathartic.” Now he has improvised with it publicly more than 50 times. When shows are a success, they are more celebrations of human creativity than anything to do with A.I., he added.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDuring the show on Wednesday, Mr. Mirowski performed several different scenes using the A.I. None were anywhere near as successful as the one involving the couple going for a drive. The climax of the show involved four members of Mr. Mirowski’s improv troupe, Improbotics Ltd., performing a scene involving a fictional president, his chief of staff and an office cleaner.The audience had to guess which actor was controlled by the A.I. The answer became clear soon after the cleaner took to the stage. “I’m a communist!” she said, completely out of the blue. Later, she performed a U-turn. “I’m not a communist!” she said. Then, out of nowhere she asked another member of the troupe, “Look, do you wanna buy a knife?”Mr. Mirowski watched behind several laptops from the side of the stage. He was smiling. His A.I. was making no sense.

The company is turning to tech to build a stronger business, drive efficiencies in its supply chain and operations, and give consumers what they want thanks to the insights provided from big data and artificial intelligence about fashion trends and their customers’ preferences. Only time will tell if their investment is enough to catapult them out of their sales slump and if their bet on AI and big data will pay off. Here are a few ways H&M is using tech to their business advantage.

Data insights help avoid bad product cycles
About 20 years ago, fast-fashion retailers became disruptors that built strong businesses by trading in quality for better prices and fresh products. However, in order to succeed, fast-fashion retailers such as H&M need to predict what the market wants to avoid a bad product cycle and the reality of discounting inventory, even more, to move it out. Since the price points are already incredibly low for fast-fashion retailers, it's tough to recover from bad purchase decisions ant to move unwanted inventory.   The stakes are high for fast-fashion retailers and the insights provided by data can help build a more flexible and faster supply chain, facilitate trend detection, manage inventory and set prices.





Inventory for individual stores
PROMOTED
Previously, you could walk into any H&M store whether it was located in Sweden, the United Kingdom or the United States and it would carry very similar merchandise. Unfortunately, the retailer was continually faced with needing to cut prices to clear out unsold inventory in its 4,288 stores around the world. In an effort to better stock individual stores with merchandise local clientele desires, H&M is using big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze returns, receipts and loyalty card data to tailor the merchandise for each store. This is known as localization and can be trickier to execute for a global chain such as H&M that typically can leverage economies of scale with its global network of suppliers.

Automated warehouses
In order to get that customized inventory to each store and to respond to consumers’ demands for a hassle-free shopping experience, H&M invested in automated warehouses that will ultimately result in next-day delivery for 90% of the European market when they are completed. Consumers have come to expect anytime, anywhere delivery, plus free shipping and returns—the latter is now being offered to H&M’s loyalty customers. The warehouses and loyalty programs are fueled by algorithms and data, and the company is rolling out RFID tech to its stores to improve efficiencies in its supply chain.
Inspiring and friction-free customer experience
H&M is already offering personalized recommendations for online shoppers, but it will soon bring that capability to its brick-and-mortar stores through RFID technology. When they are in the store, customers can explore suggestions for merchandise selected for them by algorithms. They are working on better integration between the online and offline shopping experience. For example, through a Find a Store feature, customers can find out if an item they discovered online is available at a physical store nearby. Besides, through Scan and Buy, customers can scan an in-store label to find out whether that item is available at another location or online.

Customized fashion
Machines have already composed music, and now through a partnership with Google and H&M’s digital fashion house Ivyrevel, we have Coded Couture. With a promise to “create one-of-a-kind designs based on how you live your life” the Android application monitors your activity and lifestyle and then custom designs and produces a dress—the Data Dress. Depending on how an individual spends the day, the app translates where you eat, the typical weather in the area and how active you are to make decisions regarding color, materials and added details for a bespoke look.
Whether technology will get H&M the results it needs to once again be profitable isn't clear, but the company’s investment in big data and artificial intelligence is certainly a step in the right direction. Data and AI algorithms can make the company’s merchandising decisions more accurate while streamlining supply chains and operations and improving the customer experience.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stark message coincides with the publication of Digital Jersey’s half-year review, which charts progress made in 2018 against a series of key objectives.

Mr Moretta says that, while there’s been movement on a range of fronts, work to equip the island’s workforce with the right skills in the face of the growth of artificial intelligence and its impact on swathes of jobs is vital.

He said: “I think some people are afraid of AI. They think of robots replacing humans, but it’s not like that. I think of it as automated intelligence, rather than artificial intelligence. This is about software doing processes that workers are currently employed to do.

“A harsh reality facing Jersey right now is the island’s brain drain. As a small island community without a university, there's a constant flow of talented people leaving to go to university and often not coming back. We need more degree education and other upskilling options on-island. It’s why Digital Jersey is working tirelessly to create a year-round calendar of events focused on equipping people with those skills.”

The Digital Jersey Hub has, so far this year, run a series of conferences, classes and other events to offer options that suit people whether in work, or out of a job and looking to re-skill. More than 3,000 people have attended in the first half of the year.

“We’ve had a paint-sprayer and somebody working in a fish and chip shop sign up,” added Mr Moretta. ‘”he result is they come out with a skillset that allows them a route into Jersey’s tech sector. They, in turn, are earning more, and that means more tax for government. It’s a win win.’”

Also revealed in the half-year review, the number of businesses who’ve become members of Digital Jersey has broken through the 100 barrier for the first time.

There were 104 business members as of the end of June 2018, of which 20 had joined in the first half of the year. That’s in addition to the 340 individual members, of whom 30 signed up since the start of the year.

Among other highlights, Digital Jersey has:

Supported four firms in relocating to Jersey as part of a campaign to promote the island as the go-to choice for digital entrepreneurs;

Worked with JT to facilitate a new low power wide area network to help link connected devices to the internet;

Assisted local start-up Soulgenic in creating a global online wellness platform, as part of a new business which has created 40 new jobs;

Signed a memorandum of understanding with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, which resulted in more than 600 items of coverage across news, trade press and social media in its first 10 days; and

								How can the government get the most out of its reskilling efforts?							

								Workforce reskilling strategies already reside within the private sector — can the government adopt and scale them for 2 million federal employees?

In navigating the growing shortage of IT and cybersecurity talent available in both the public and private sectors, the Trump administration has made clear its plan to fill a portion of the void by teaching current federal employees new skills.
As part of the President’s Management Agenda, the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Defense and other agencies have been tasked with developing a system to both identify employees with the aptitude for IT and cybersecurity jobs, and adopting automation technology that can assist the reskilling efforts.
Reskilling strategies and products that facilitate them already reside within the private sector. The more critical question is if they can be scaled to a workforce of more than 2 million civil servants focused on a diverse set of missions?
FedScoop spoke to a trio of experts who believe it’s possible and gave guidance for how they think the federal government can be successful in reskilling.

Cross-training
One popular strategy involves not a wholesale shift of employees to a new skill set but instead fostering greater communications and thought-sharing between groups with adjoining missions. It’s often called cross-training.
Joel Jacobs, MITRE CIO and chief security officer, said his company has been deploying cross-training for decades out of an organic need to capitalize on the proficiency of its federally funded research and development centers and the cybersecurity staff tasked with protecting them.
“There was a natural demand that flows between those two,” he said. “So in our own cyberdefense, going back to the 1980s, we started borrowing people from those who have information security backgrounds who work for our sponsors for our own defenses. It turns into a virtuous cycle, and the additional skills of those doing research could gain operational experience. Those doing our own operations could gain access to new ideas and capabilities that were part of direct work.”
To leverage the cross-training goals, Jacobs said MITRE deploys mechanisms like communities-of-interest around certain topics, technical exchange meetings and an intranet system that fosters communications between the operations and research sets to share ideas and new developments.

It fosters not only the collaboration of ideas but also provides both camps with new experience to augment their skills.
The strategy sounds somewhat similar to the DevSecOps philosophy pervading the IT acquisition space, in which teams of IT engineers, operations personnel, security specialists and often even procurement professionals collaborate to design the systems that will serve their enterprise.
Jacobs said he didn’t know if the cross-training strategy could scale up governmentwide because of the diffuse mission goals of federal agencies, but he said the strategy could be effective in stretching resources if it’s applied to adjoining components.
“Part of it is making sure they are investing training in ways that are effective at identifying talent, expanding its application and looking for opportunities to cross-train from related topics,” he said. “I think they have to be looking for adjacencies in talent, not strictly or narrowly prescribed versions of cyber engineers or exclusively-trained from a cyber curriculum.”
Automation cheat sheets

Another avenue the administration will likely pursue is to lean on new technologies to cut down the learning curve instead of having employees learn a new skill set from scratch.
Grant Wernick is looking to deploy such a technology in government right now. Wernick is the CEO and co-founder of Insight Engines, which leverages automation and artificial intelligence to crunch complex data through natural language queries.
As a result, employees new to IT and cyber roles don’t have to have the colloquial skills of a technical expert to access data fast, allowing them to spend more time on investigative processes.
“Now you can take people who are high school graduates or English majors, and if they want a career in cybersecurity, they can do it,” Wernick said. “We actually have stories in the federal government where midlevel analysts — the people who usually just stare at alerts — are actually finding stuff they would never have found because they are curious, they use our product and start digging in and looking around.”
OMB is currently examining areas where it can pilot automation as part of its reskilling efforts. And while Wernick said interest is growing in the public sector, the all-too-familiar hurdles of acquisition bureaucracy, agency culture and technology infrastructure have made widespread adoption of his product a challenge.

“I would say it’s growing in pockets,” he said. “Business-as-usual has been a process that has involved many steps sometimes, and we’re circumventing tons of steps. So that change makes it so new people coming in can really be part of it. But sometimes, it’s like, ‘Well, that’s not the way we did it before.’ So getting people who have been there a long time to refresh their view on things is something that we’ve been spending a lot of time on too.”
Workforce planning
One of the best efforts for reshaping the workforce is outlining the vision of the enterprise.
OPM has discussed implementing direct-hire authority and compensation restructuring to entice more IT and cybersecurity talent to the federal government. However, Margot Conrad, director for federal workforce programs at the Partnership for Public Service, said agencies should analyze the skillsets they will need in the future and balance them against new technology capabilities.
“I think agencies need to be able to forecast for the future to actually be able to do the hiring that they need from the outside or reskill on the inside. As a starting point, I think that is a huge area that we emphasize,” she said. “Thinking about what are some of these new emerging technologies, what does that mean for the workforce itself and what the future needs are going to be and then trying to put together comprehensive strategies to address that.”

That could include a mix of legacy and reskilled employees but also contractors who may have knowledge bases in new solutions.
“I think you need a holistic approach here to workforce planning and succession management,” she said. “That would be critical to the success of any effort.”
