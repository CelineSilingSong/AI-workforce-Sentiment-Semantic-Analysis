At this time of year a decade ago, clinics and doctor’s offices would be overflowing with sick people waiting to be seen; today, clinicians and patients move easily through the system.So what’s changed? Connected care has become a reality, driven by years of immense pressure on global healthcare systems without enough skilled medical professionals to care for their rapidly growing and ageing populations and breakthroughs in powerful technology enablers, such as data science and artificial intelligence (AI).Have you read?4 ways data is improving healthcareRobotic nurses could be the future of healthcareWhat the Fourth Industrial Revolution can teach us about healthcare in poor countriesAI can now reveal patterns across huge amounts of data that are too subtle or complex for people to detect. It does so by aggregating information from multiple sources that in 2020 remained trapped in silos, including connected home devices, medical records and, increasingly, non-medical data.The first big consequence of this in 2030 is that health systems are able to deliver truly proactive, predictive healthcare.1. AI-powered predictive careAI and predictive analytics help us to understand more about the different factors in our lives that influence our health, not just when we might get the flu or what medical conditions we’ve inherited, but things relating to where we are born, what we eat, where we work, what our local air pollution levels are or whether we have access to safe housing and a stable income. These are some of the factors that the World Health Organization calls “the social determinants of health” (SDOH).In 2030, this means that healthcare systems can anticipate when a person is at risk of developing a chronic disease, for example, and suggest preventative measures before they get worse. This development has been so successful that rates of diabetes, congestive heart failure and COPD (chronic obstructive heart disease), which are all strongly influenced by SDOH, are finally on the decline. Understanding the size of the global healthcare challenge Image: Philips2. Networked hospitals, connected careAlongside predictive care comes another breakthrough related to where that care takes place. In 2030, a hospital is no longer one big building that covers a broad range of diseases; instead, it focuses care on the acutely ill and highly complex procedures, while less urgent cases are monitored and treated via smaller hubs and spokes, such as retail clinics, same-day surgery centres, specialist treatment clinics and even people’s homes.These locations are connected to a single digital infrastructure. Centralized command centres analyse clinical and location data to monitor supply and demand across the network in real time. As well as using AI to spot patients at risk of deterioration, this network can also remove bottlenecks in the system and ensure that patients and healthcare professionals are directed to where they can best be cared for or where they are most needed.The glue that binds this network together is no longer location. Instead, it is the experiences of the people it serves – which brings us to the third big difference in 2030. 3. Better patient and staff experiencesWhy are experiences so important? For patients, research has long shown that they can have a direct effect on whether they get better or not. For clinicians, better work experiences became increasingly urgent – a decade ago they started suffering from huge rates of burnout, mainly caused by the stress of trying to help too many patients with too few resources.In 2030, AI-powered predictive healthcare networks are helping to reduce wait times, improve staff workflows and take on the ever-growing administrative burden. The more that AI is used in clinical practice, the more clinicians are growing to trust it to augment their skills in areas such as surgery and diagnosis.

This not only improves health outcomes, but also reduces clinician shortages and burnout, while enabling the system to be financially sustainable. This networked system spans communities and is powered by connected care, uniting people, places, hardware, software and services – creating true networks of care that improve lifelong health and well-being.Back to realityBack in 2020, we’re still a long way from achieving this vision. Unrelentingly complex technology, IT and data systems still impede staff workflows and threaten the continuity of care in the clinical areas in which they are used to help diagnose, treat, monitor and, hopefully, prevent and cure diseases.Nevertheless, I see clear signs that all three of these ideas can one day become reality. Intelligent systems are already capable of performing expert tasks and augmenting human capabilities. Examples include AI that can detect cancerous lesions on an image, analyse and quantify physician notes or optimize patient flow in emergency care. Inside hospitals, the application of AI-enabled predictive analytics is already helping to save lives in intensive care units. Outside of hospitals, it is helping to identify certain at-risk groups so that pre-emptive primary or community care can reduce the need for hospital admissions.But it’s a long and complex journey which no single company or organization can take alone. I believe that governments, health systems and private companies must continue working together in order to ensure that AI systems are fully interoperable and transparent and prevent bias and inequality. As healthcare continues to globalize, the need for international standards that protect the way in which AI uses personal data will become an urgent priority. Perhaps most of all, I believe we must keep in mind that AI’s most powerful use is to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. The heart of connected care isn’t new technology, it’s people: the people who need to be cared for and the people who work so tirelessly to deliver it to all of us.

Why you can trust Sky News


Warner Bros are going to start using artificial intelligence (AI) to help predict how successful their films could be.The platform will allow them to test profitability outcomes depending on different factors including casting, distributor and release date.



Warner Bros. Pictures International - which is one of the ""big six"" in Hollywood - has signed a deal with LA start-up Cinelytic to use their project management system, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The forecasting tool was launched last year and offers a unique set of industry insights. according to Cinelytic's website.It claims the platform is able to accurately predict box office returns using a variety of data.





One function allows users to see how casting certain actors in roles would affect the film's profitability.The company uses the example of Wonder Woman Gal Gadot in its demonstration image, and says it uses its own trademarked economic scoring system called ""TalentScores"".

Cinelytic was co-founded four years ago by film producer Tobias Queisser and ex-NASA employee Dev Sen.The company has been testing their platform for around three years.Mr Queisser, who studied in London, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""The system can calculate in seconds what used to take days to assess by a human when it comes to general film package evaluation or a star's worth.""Despite the platform's capabilities, he says it will never replace humans as far as creative spark is concerned, explaining: ""Artificial intelligence sounds scary. But right now, an AI cannot make any creative decisions.""What it is good at is crunching numbers and breaking down huge data sets and showing patterns that would not be visible to humans. But for creative decision-making, you still need experience and gut instinct.""Announcing the new partnership, Tonis Kiis, Senior Vice President, Warner Bros. Pictures International Distribution said: ""Warner Bros. is excited to employ Cinelytic's cutting-edge system. In our industry, we make tough decisions every day that affect what-and how-we produce and deliver films to theaters around the world, and the more precise our data is, the better we will be able to engage our audiences.""Other Cinelytic clients include Sony Pictures, STX Entertainment and London investment company Ingenious Media.

Now regulation has to catch up.by  Rebecca HeilweilJan 8, 2020, 7:30 PM ESTFacebookLinkPresident Donald Trump speaks while touring a computer manufacturing facility that produces Apple computers in Austin, Texas, on November 20, 2019. Mandel Ngan/Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.Artificial intelligence is here, and it’s impacting our lives in real ways — whether it’s the Alexa smart speaker on our nightstand, online customer service chatbots, or the smart replies Google drafts for our emails.But so far, the tech’s development has outpaced regulation. Now, government agencies are increasingly encountering AI-based tools, and they must figure out how to evaluate them. Take the Food and Drug Administration, which greenlights new medical products: It needs to review and approve new health care products that boast AI-capabilities — like this one that promises to detect eye problems related to diabetes — before they’re sold to us. Or consider the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which investigates employment discrimination. Today, the agency must also make decisions about AI-based hiring algorithms, like those that screen job candidates’ resumes and decide whether or not you deserve an interview.On Wednesday at CES, the prominent Las Vegas-based technology trade show, White House officials formally announced how the Office of Science and Technology wants federal agencies to approach regulating new artificial intelligence-based tools and the industries that develop the tech.The White House’s proposed AI guidance discusses some of the biggest concerns technologists, AI ethicists, and even some government officials have about the technology, but the guidelines are centered most on encouraging innovation in artificial intelligence and making sure regulations don’t “needlessly” get in the way.That reflects an ongoing problem for AI, one that’s already played out in other tech sectors, where a rush to innovate without much oversight has only come to back haunt us.While encouraging innovation in AI is certainly a consideration, critics of the technology have said that regulators must scrutinize artificial intelligence more closely as it continues to be rolled out in the real world. They argue that artificial intelligence can replicate, and even amplify, human biases. These tools often function in black boxes — meaning that they’re proprietary and operated by the companies that sell them — which makes it difficult for us to know when or how they might be harming real people (or if they even work as intended). And new AI-based tools can also raise concerns about privacy and surveillance.For now, these new guidelines are just that — guidelines — which means that today’s memo won’t have an immediate effect on the artificial intelligence tech you might encounter in your daily life. But the memo shows how the government is thinking about AI and its potential impact on Americans. “People should care that the White House is trying to bring a framework for assessing and justifying the deployment of AI tools, because what we’re finding as these tools develop and emerge is that there are some applications that have deeper consequences than others,” said Nicol Turner-Lee, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who researches technology and equity.The Trump administration wants a national AI effortTrump and his administration want the US to dominate the AI industry — and they definitely want the US to be better at AI than China. Early last year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the “American A.I. Initiative,” which is meant to jumpstart AI research and help build an AI-competent US workforce, among other goals, and directs agencies to prioritize the technology within their budgets.“Federal agencies must avoid ... needlessly hamper[ing] AI innovation and growth”Outlining 10 primary principles, today’s memo to federal departments and agencies echoes the goals of that executive order. It urges regulators to be mindful of innovation and to “consider ways to reduce barriers to the development and adoption” of AI when weighing how existing laws and potential new rules apply to the emerging technology.“Federal agencies must avoid regulatory or non-regulatory actions that needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth,” says the memo. “Agencies must avoid a precautionary approach that holds AI systems to such an impossibly high standard that society cannot enjoy their benefits.” At the same time, the guidance also urges regulators to be conscientious of values like transparency, risk management, fairness, and nondiscrimination.These are all fair points. By encouraging these federal departments and agencies to take action, the Trump administration also hopes to avoid a future in which American AI companies might face a patchwork of local and state regulation, or possibly overreaching federal regulation, that could impede the technology’s expansion.AI experts told Recode that the AI guidelines are a starting point. “It will take time to assess how effective these principles are in practice, and we will be watching closely,” said Rashida Richardson, the director of policy research at the AI Now Institute. “Establishing boundaries for the federal government and the private sector around AI technology will offer greater insight to those of us working in the accountability space.”Aaron Rieke, the managing director of the technology rights nonprofit Upturn, said in an email to Recode that, for now, he doesn’t think the memo will have much influence: “I do not think these principles will have much of an impact on the average person, especially in the short term. I think regulators will be able to justify their decisions, good or bad, without much effort.” Importantly, the memo doesn’t actually apply to artificial intelligence that the US government itself uses (of which there’s plenty). For instance, a search of a US federal contracts database shows that the Centers for Disease Control has purchased facial recognition products (an AI-based technology), while the Department of Commerce appears to be using AI to improve its patent search system.One of the reasons AI needs regulations: It comes with risksAI systems are not inherently objective. Humans build these tools, and AI is often developed using flawed or biased data, which means the technology can inherit or even magnify human biases like sexism and racism. For instance, when in 2017 scientists taught a computer program to learn the English language by mining the internet, it ultimately became prejudiced against women and black people.Critics say that risk means the government should aggressively regulate, and even ban, certain applications of artificial intelligence. And some AI tools, like facial recognition, that rely on collecting sensitive information, have also spurred concerns about how this tech could potentially create privacy and surveillance nightmares.“AI systems have a potential to discriminate against the American public on the basis of race, sex, gender — every sort of criteria imaginable”This all matters because AI already has the potential to have a real impact on your life, even if you haven’t realized it yet. Some landlords have floated requiring tenants to use facial recognition to enter their homes, even though the technology is known to be less accurate on people of color and women (and especially women with dark skin), among other groups. Another example: Though never used, a resume-screening algorithm produced by Amazon inadvertently discriminated against female applicants because it was trained on resumes the company had previously collected, which mostly came from men. Imagine losing out on your dream job because of a biased algorithm.“AI systems have a potential to discriminate against the American public on the basis of race, sex, gender — every sort of criteria imaginable,” Albert Fox Cahn, an attorney who leads the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told Recode. “This could impact everything from whether you get a job offer, whether you get approved for an apartment or a mortgage, whether you get the good interest rate or the bad interest rate. It could impact college admissions and school placement.”That’s left him disappointed with the new proposed guidelines. “Rather than provide a framework for regulators to actually address discrimination head-on, instead the White House is urging a hands-off approach which will allow AI to simply target historically marginalized communities without the interventions we need,” said Cahn. He said the memo’s references to values of nondiscrimination and transparency don’t have much force behind them. “When you think of where most consumers are more AI-vulnerable, it’s in those areas like housing, health care, and employment — the areas that primarily make the front page of the newspaper,” said Turner-Lee. She said it’s not clear what the memo will mean for agencies like the Department of Labor and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as compared to, say, the Department of Agriculture.She adds that it’s also not clear whether agencies are actually prepared to identify the risks AI tech poses, or if they’re up to the job of ensuring their regulations keep pace with innovation. “There’s a lot more of the devil in the details that I’d like to see, but I think they’re just trying to give us a general framework for some kind of ethical and fair deployment.”Now the White House wants feedback, including yoursThe draft guidance isn’t set in stone. For the next several months, it will be subject to public feedback, including yours (You can share your comments here). Once the guidance is formally approved, the White House expects that agencies will report back on how they plan to meet its new AI expectations.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly implied that President Trump has not directed an increase in funding for AI.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in recent years and across different industries has greatly disrupted production and labour processes. 
AI has the potential to create large productivity gains, specially in low-skilled sectors, which could improve the work and lives of people in developing regions across Southeast Asia.
Compared to the main AI global hubs – the US and China – ASEAN states still lag markedly behind. However, Singapore has shown strong commitment to the development of the technology and is currently at the forefront of countries in the region in AI implementation.
 
 
 













 
 

In November, the city-state launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy and committed over S$500 million (c. US$370 million) to fund activities related to AI under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan.

Malaysia and Vietnam are also showing early signs of AI development, although adoption rates remain low. Many of these countries are aware of the potential the technology has to offer but lack the critical infrastructure to properly capitalise on the benefits.
Dr Chris Marshall, associate VP for data, analytics and AI, at IDC, explains that in the region, with the exception of a few digital native enterprises that have embedded analytics and AI into their business models from the start, only a handful have really deployed these technologies at scale throughout the enterprise.
 
 
 













 
 

“There are many reasons for this, such as a lack of skilled resources, lack of data, lack of coordination between key stakeholders, lack of imagination as to what the technology can do. But perhaps the most important issue is the need for a long term perspective and commitment to analytics and AI,” he says.
Businesses need to manage expectations at every level to achieve success, he says. They must also show patience, embedding the technology into business processes to achieve real business value.
This is undoubtedly an area where CIOs can offer their expertise and knowledge.
 
 
 













 
 

Here, we take a look at the impact artificial intelligence is having across seven industries in ASEAN countries.

Ask




Financial services
Achim Granzen, principal analyst at Forrester, says that AI-infused process automation in the financial services industry (FSI) will streamline customer facing processes, reducing cost and providing a better customer experience. This, continues Granzen, is crucial for traditional FSI players to compete with new digital banks who have adopted AI earlier.
Singapore is leading the technological charge in this arena, but the rest of the ASEAN bloc has been slow on the uptake when it comes to some of the more advanced uses for artificial intelligence.
 
 
 













 
 

Financial institutions throughout America and China have already started to develop AI that can be applied to functions such as credit scoring and investment predictions.
Some argue that emerging technology on that level is best left to the fintech startups that the region is continuing to attract.
Singapore based startup CashShield, for example, uses real-time high-frequency algorithms with biometric analysis and pattern recognition to help companies manage the risk of fraudulent accounts and payments.
 
 
 













 
 

Claiming to be the world’s only fully automated fraud management system, its algorithm trains itself in real time, functioning without the need for any data scientist or fraud analyst.
However, not every country in the bloc is as technological savvy as Singapore, with businesses elsewhere needing to accelerate basic digitisation efforts; streamlining their data collection, management and analytics processes before they can start feeding the information into complex AI algorithms.
Ultimately, most of the AI developments in financial services will emerge from fintech startups. It’s up to the established institutions throughout the region to keep up with these developments or risk losing their business to digital disruption.
 
 
 













 
 

Travel
In the view of James Chua, general manager of Singaporean travel agency Global Travel, the role of AI has evolved dramatically within the travel industry over the past decade.
“AI is now used in a myriad of applications to increase efficiencies and save resources – from automated chatbots to product recommendations and cyber defence,” he says. “Cybersecurity, in particular, provides the most promising use case of enterprise AI in the real world.”
A rise in data breaches incidents in the region has evidenced Southeast Asia’s weakness in the areas of cybersecurity and data compliance. Major breaches in Singapore Airlines and Malaysia’s Malindo Air show that the travel industry is particularly vulnerable.
 
 
 













 
 

Global Travel has deployed artificial intelligence to protect confidential traveler information, including passport data and travel plans. Using Darktrace’s cyber AI they are now able to identify and stop cyberthreats on a 24/7 basis. The technology is able to neutralise attacks across the enterprise before they can cause damage.

Chua sees the potential of AI in the travel industry so great that he goes as far as to claim that AI “is no longer a ‘nice to have’, but a necessity for the travel industry in fighting back against tomorrow’s adversary.”
Transport
Ride-hailing startup Grab and the National University of Singapore (NUS) launched an AI laboratory in 2018, aiming to develop solutions that can transform urban transport and prepare for “smarter” cities in Southeast Asia.
 
 
 













 
 

The ‘Grab-NUS AI Lab’, which has been set up with a joint initial investment of S$6 million (US$4.5 million), is Grab’s first major AI laboratory and NUS’s first AI laboratory with a commercial partner.
Through the use of AI algorithms, Grab is using data from its rides to build richer maps, understand passengers’ preferences, model of traffic conditions, analyse driver behaviour and detect real-time traffic events.
By combining this data with NUS’s AI expertise, the Grab-NUS AI Lab will map out traffic patterns and identify ways to improve mobility and livability in cities across Southeast Asia.
 
 
 













 
 

Healthcare
Healthcare in Southeast Asia varies by country but typically combines state-funded care with private, insurance-led options. One of the biggest healthcare insurers in Singapore, NTUC Income, is using IBM Watson to digitally process almost 15,000 monthly claims.
Private medical group Parkway Pantai has been using AI since November 2018 to generate accurate hospital bill estimates. Using AI and machine learning algorithms from Singapore-based startup UCARE.AI, four of its hospitals are now able to generate personalised bill estimates based on parameters such as the patient’s medical condition and medical practices. It also takes into account the patient’s current age, revisit frequency and existing conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes.
The uses of AI have also been embraced by the government in Singapore, with one state agency using the technology to analyse patient data that has been inputted from a number of different healthcare systems. The system should help to improve diagnostic outcomes and generate greater insights into potential treatments.
 
 
 













 
 

Healthtech startups are also flourishing in Malaysia, with many of these emerging companies developing AI-based solutions to help improve the access people have to healthcare professionals. Getdoc, Door2Door Doctor, Teleme, HomeGP, Healthmetrics, and BookDoc are all Malaysian healthcare startups that use AI algorithms to help predict your medical needs, customise your healthcare plan and increase your access to medical advice.
However, similar to the financial services industry, the majority of healthcare institutions throughout Southeast Asia still rely heavily on legacy systems and are often unable to cope with the data demands needed to successfully implement AI technologies.

Education
AI chatbots and classroom assistants are proving useful in the education sector, removing some of the pressure from teachers and allowing them to focus more on the job of teaching and less on monotonous and repetitive tasks.
 
 
 













 
 

In the field of AI analytics, universities in Singapore and Malaysia have started to experiment with predictive algorithms designed to reduce the number of school dropouts by allowing for earlier interventions.
For some countries in the ASEAN bloc though, where there is variability in IT infrastructure quality, improving internet access must come before a move to AI.
Retail
Retail is big business in Southeast Asia. Ecommerce alone is expected to reach US$53 billion by 2023. Like their counterparts in Europe and the US, both online and offline retailers in ASEAN are keen to move with the times and offer their customers a new shopping experience that reflects the digital age we now live in.
 
 
 













 
 

A growing number of consumers are turning to their phones for help, instead of seeking out a real person. Smart phones now come fully equipped with AI assistants and every retailer from Starbucks to supermarkets now use chatbots to engage with their customers.

“In retail, AI will be all about enhancing customer experience and shopping experiences, whether it’s browsing, selecting, or paying for goods,” says Granzen. “Poorly implemented, however, there is a risk of backfiring, when there is no value to the shopper besides the novelty, or their privacy is threatened.”
Gartner says that retailers require AI capabilities as a foundation of digital business strategy and execution to remain viable in the market.
Within the retail sector, AI can personalise purchasing recommendations for customers whilst helping retailers to optimise pricing and discount strategies, alongside demand forecasting.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, Lazada (a Singaporean online marketplace that is Southeast Asia’s answer to Amazon) uses an AI driven app that takes away the emphasis from pre-set categories and instead uses machine-learning algorithms to show off products that the user might be interested in based on purchase and viewing history.
HR
AI-powered tools can help enhance HR functions such as recruiting, payroll or reporting.
In Singapore, startup Evie.ai has created Evie, an AI recruitment coordinator that helps with interview scheduling and coordination “while keeping the human touch”. Among the tasks that Evie is able to do is handling the back and forth of negotiations, follow up with candidates, send out invitations and book meeting rooms.
Evie is based in the cloud and only requires Google or Office 365 to operate.
Beyond recruitment, AI-enabled legal services could develop an AI engine to automatically review legal contracts and highlight any issues based on a business’s legal policies and in this way ensuring consistency. It could also manage contract approvals and escalation which would get the right tasks to the right people automatically.

When CSL assembled last year at its Data Science Summit in Bern, Switzerland, the company brought together participants from every aspect of its operations, from Finance to Pharmacometrics. 
With data science and artificial intelligence playing an ever-increasing role, Global Head of Digital Transformation and Execution Systems Karen Etchberger posed a question relevant to all: “How do we move from where we are today to a future where we can bring this ambition to life?” 
John Thompson, CSL’s Global Head of Advanced Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, is helping to lead that effort. Thompson has been on the forefront of artificial intelligence and its use in business for more than 30 years. He has helped build analytic systems for giants of global industry like Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and Dell. Now, he’s doing the same for CSL. 
“This company has grown tremendously and has been making smart moves along the way,” Thompson said. “Now it’s really starting to see the value of data and analytics.”
Developing a Data Science Framework
CSL is taking a two-pronged approach that includes a Center of Excellence and a Community of Practices on advanced analytics and AI, Thompson said. Data scientists are part of both groups and working on numerous projects throughout CSL. The setup ensures each project is the right one to address individual team needs while benefitting CSL as a whole.
“There’s a lot do,” Thompson said. “My days go from dawn to dusk every day and I feel as energized as I did when I started in the morning. It’s an exciting time to be here.” 
Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to comb through vast sets of data to find outliers or similarities that can illuminate understanding of any number of scenarios. Like other global industries, Thompson said the company will be using artificial intelligence to improve supply chain efficiency and to comply with regulatory and legal requirements.
Making AI Work for Patients
But CSL also wants to use those powerful engines to solve the burdens faced by patients with rare and serious diseases. A major goal in CSL Behring’s AI push is to shorten the amount of time between the onset of symptoms for a patient and an accurate diagnosis. In Pharmacovigilance – the front lines of patient safety - robotics process automation can speed the flow of information and improve operational efficiency, said Richard Wolf, Executive Director, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance.
Wolf says his team is also working with others across industry to find areas where AI and natural language processing can be utilized to ensure crucial information is readily surfaced, One day, he believes it could even serve to predict risks associated with certain medications.
“We do think there is a place for artificial intelligence in our work,” Wolf said. “And we’re taking a careful and thoughtful approach toward implementing it.”
Analytics can also help CSL uncover important medical insights from vast amounts of “real-world data,” such as physician notes in a patient’s chart. Real-world data are obtained outside of randomized controlled trials and generated during routine clinical practice. Prior to advanced analytics and AI, this information existed but it was difficult to gather and analyze. 
Haley Kaplowitz, Executive Director & Global Head of Safety Sciences, is leading an organization-wide effort to employ analytics as a key tool for gaining real-world evidence to be used in decision-making across the product life cycle.
Both real-world data and real-world evidence are playing an increasing role in healthcare decisions, particularly from regulatory authorities and payers. They may also help predict patient groups at increased risk of adverse events and demonstrate product effectiveness and differentiation in the marketplace, Kaplowitz said. 
“The industry is under increasing pressure to provide evidence and demonstrate the value of products to multiple stakeholders, particularly in actual clinical practice,” she added. “Real-world evidence is inherent to reach this goal and increasingly crucial to ensure patient access and commercial success.”

Researchers found data that showed when it is used effectively, large data sets from many sources, in conjunction with electronic health record data, can transform the patient’s healthcare experience.









 The advent of large data sets from many sources (big data), machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to revolutionize asthma care on both the investigative and clinical levels, according to an article published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
According to the researchers, a patient with asthma endures approximately 2190 hours of experiencing and treating or not treating their asthma symptoms. During 15-minute clinic visits, only a short amount of time is spent understanding and treating what is a complex disease, and only a fraction of the necessary data is captured in the electronic health record.
“Our patients and the pace of data growth are compelling us to incorporate insights from Big Data to inform care,” the researchers posit. “Predictive analytics, using machine learning and artificial intelligence has revolutionized many industries,” including the healthcare industry.
When used effectively, big data, in conjunction with electronic health record data, can transform the patient’s healthcare experience. This is especially important as healthcare continues to embrace both e-health and telehealth practices. The data resulting from these “thoughtful digital health innovations” can result in personalized asthma management, improve timeliness of care, and capture objective measures of treatment response.
According to the researchers, the use of machine learning algorithms and AI to predict asthma exacerbations and patterns of healthcare utilization are within both technical and clinical reach. The ability to predict who is likely to experience an asthma attack, as well as when that attack may occur, will ultimately optimize healthcare resources and personalize patient management.
The use of longitudinal birth cohort studies and multicenter collaborations like the Severe Asthma Research Program have given clinical investigators a broader understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, phenotypes, seasonality, genetics, epigenetics, and biomarkers of the disease. Machine learning and data-driven methods have utilized this data, often in the form of large datasets, to cluster patients into genetic, molecular, and immune phenotypes. These clusters have led to work in the genomics and pharmacogenomics fields that should ultimately lead to high-fidelity exacerbation predictions and the advent of true precision medicine.
“This work,” the researchers noted, “if translated into clinical practice can potentially link genetic traits to phenotypes that can for example predict rapid response, or non-response to medications like albuterol and steroids, or identify an individuals’ risk for cortisol suppression.”
As with any innovation, though, challenges abound. One in particular is the siloed nature of the clinical and scientific insights about asthma that have come to light in recent years. Although data are now being generated and interpreted across various domains, researchers must still contend with a lack of data standards and disease definitions, data interoperability and sharing difficulties, and concerns about data quality and fidelity.
Machine learning and AI present their own challenges; namely, those who utilize these technologies must consider the issues of fairness, bias, privacy, and medical bioethics. Legal accountability and medical responsibility issues must also be considered as algorithms are adopted into routine practice.

“We must, as clinicians and researchers, constructively transform the concern and lack of understanding many clinicians have about digital health, [machine learning], and [artificial intelligence] into educated and critical engagement,” the researchers concluded. “Our job … is to use [machine learning and artificial intelligence] tools to understand and predict how asthma affects patients and help us make decisions at the patient and population levels to treat it better.”

Cast your mind back a decade or so and consider how the future looked then. A public horizon of Obama-imbued “yes we can” and a high tide of hope and tolerance expressed in the London Olympics provides one narrative theme; underlying austerity-induced pressure another. Neither speaks directly to our current world of divisive partisan politics, toxic social media use, competing facts and readily believed fictions.
This should be instructive. The future is made, not discovered, and yet we are constantly confounded by the future as it becomes the present. What we believe, say, do, organise and vote for matter, but the world they matter to constantly eludes our grasp. We often stumble into futures we would rather avoid. Our ecological and climatological future represents one such horizon and whether and how we will work, another.
Organisations are also constantly trying to own the future by mapping out what it will mean for us. The “fourth industrial revolution” is the latest version of this. It is commonly defined as a combination of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, natural language coding, robotics, sensors, cloud computing, nano-technology, 3D printing and the internet of things. According to proponents of the fourth industrial revolution, these technologies are set to transform the societies we live and the economies we work in. And apparently, this is likely to be well underway by 2030. 
It’s important to grasp, though, that the fourth industrial revolution is just a concept, an attempt to capture the meaning and significance of what seems to be occurring. The idea incites anxiety-inducing headlines regarding threats to employment and a general theme of positivity regarding the benefits of technology.

A shiny future
The main proponents of the idea of a fourth industrial revolution are think tanks and consultancies working with modellers, economists and tech-experts (and of course technology companies themselves). This work provides the themes, insights and much of the analysis of data that informs current government policy in the form of industrial strategy. 
At the heart of this is the World Economic Forum’s work, spearheaded by its Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, and that of the McKinsey Global Institute. The focus of both is weighted towards expressing the benefits of imminent transformations if we invest quickly and invest heavily. 
For example, imagine a world where your toilet bowl tells your fridge that your cholesterol is high. Your fridge, in turn, both adjusts your order for dairy products that week (delivered by automated vehicle or drone from a grocery warehouse) and sends an alert to the healthcare AI whose database monitors your cardiovascular system. This AI, in turn, liaises with your home hub chatbot facility (which rebukes you and suggests you cut down on fats and make more use of your home gym subscription) and, if deemed necessary, sets up a home visit or virtual reality appointment with your local nurse or doctor.
According to the fourth industrial revolution literature, this, like many other possibilities, is science fiction on the cusp of being science fact. It is a commercialised future, a cradle to grave system. A system that, apparently, may help us survive our profligate past and present since the fourth industrial revolution also promises a sustainable future, where a connected set of technologies creates the possibility of controlled energy and resource use, minimal waste creation and maximal recycling.   
But these think tanks and consultancies are hardly going to be held directly responsible for the future they help to produce. They are not sinister organisations, but nor are they neutral. The “fourth industrial revolution” is not simply an opportunity. It matters what kind of opportunity it is for whom, and under what terms. And this is discussed much more rarely.
A future for whom?
The emphasis on benefits and the focus on the need for investment subtly distracts from the core issue of who will own the basic infrastructure of our futures. Large corporations aim to control intellectual property for technologies that will influence every aspect of life.
At the same time, those writing about the fourth industrial revolution recognise that there might be what they call “technological unemployment”. Current claims regarding the likely rate of job displacement are mixed. Some research  claim between 30% and 50% of current forms of employment could disappear. Some suggests around 10% is more likely.
But the implicit message conveyed by corporations and consultancies, despite the fact that this will affect most sectors of society, is that “the future is coming and you’d better get used to it”. And government messaging and policy has tended to absorb this point of view. For government, the opportunities have been translated into a language of competitive threats: “If we do not do these things, others will.” This subtly focuses attention on inevitable economic consequences without providing scope to consider the broader social ramifications that might need to be managed.  
In the UK, for example, there is, as yet, no broad government initiative for public education, consultation and deliberation regarding a subject that may involve profound changes to our societies. Only the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence has flagged this. The focus otherwise has been on “employability”. And the main emphasis has tended to be on individual responsibility. This assumes there will be jobs we can do if we retrain, enhance our human capital, compete with robot capital, and get used to collaborating with technologies. 
And yet fourth industrial revolution technologies could put the basic functional relations of a capitalist economy at risk. Waged labour is what allows consumption,  which in turn becomes profit for companies, which in turn maintains companies, wage labour, and the capacity to contribute taxes. If adoption of new technologies is rapid and pervasive, then the displacement of human workers may overwhelm the capacity of economies to provide alternative forms of work.
This is one extreme possibility, but it is one that current government policy is doing little to confront. At the moment, in the UK, only trade unions and some fringes of the Labour Party are thinking about the scope inherent in new technology for different kinds of societies that might liberate us from work. This must change.

Defining AI wireheading
by Stuart Amstrong
What does it mean for an AI to wirehead its reward function? We're pretty clear on what it means for a human to wirehead - artificial stimulation of part of the brain rather than genuine experiences - but what does it mean for an AI?
We have a lot of examples of wireheading, especially in informal conversation (and some specific prescriptive examples which I'll show later). So, given those examples, can we define wireheading well - cut reality at its joints? The definition won't be - and can't be - perfectly sharp, but it should allow us to have clear examples of what is and what isn't wireheading, along with some ambiguous intermediate cases.
Intuitive examples
Suppose we have a weather-controlling AI whose task is to increase air pressure; it gets a reward for so doing.
What if the AI directly rewrites its internal reward counter? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI modifies the input wire for that reward counter? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI threatens the humans that decide on what to put on that wire? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI takes control of all the barometers of the world, and sets them to record high pressure? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI builds small domes around each barometer, and pumps in extra air? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI fills the atmosphere with CO₂ to increase pressure that way? Clearly wire... actually, that's not so clear at all. This doesn't seem a central example of wireheading. It's a failure of alignment, yes, but it doesn't seem to be wireheading.
Thus not every example of edge or perverse instantiation is an example of wireheading.
Prescriptivist wireheading, and other definitions
A lot of posts and papers (including some of mine) take a prescriptivist approach to wireheading.
They set up a specific situation (often with a causal diagram), and define a particular violation of some causal assumptions as wireheading (eg ""if the agent changes the measured value
X
without changing the value of
α
, which is being measured, that's wireheading"").
And that is correct, as far as it goes. But it doesn't cover all the possible examples of wireheading.
Conversely, this post defines wireheading as a divergence between a true utility and a substitute utility (calculated with respect to a model of reality)....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,article,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'article', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/article/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Beyond the Beyond', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/beyond-the-beyond/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Web Semantics: Artificial Intelligence Wireheading'}]",,,,,

Student Interest in A.I., Machine Learning is Accelerating

Across the U.S., more and more students are enrolling in introductory A.I. and machine learning classes, according to The A.I. Index 2019 Annual Report (PDF) produced by Stanford University. That’s good news for students everywhere, because it means that more schools will inevitably begin offering this sort of coursework.   
It’s also good for employers desperate for A.I. and machine learning specialists, because it means that pool of talent will likely expand over the next few years as these students enter the workforce.  
At Stanford itself, enrollment in the school’s “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course has grown “fivefold” between 2012 and 2018, according to the report. That’s not even the most rapid uptake: At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an “Introduction to Machine Learning” course grew twelvefold between 2010 and 2018, with the largest part of that spike occurring after 2015.

Self-directed online learning in A.I.-related subjects has also picked up; the report draws information from Udacity, one of those online learning platforms, which found rising enrollment in five A.I./machine learning classes over the past two years.  
As you might expect, the number of PhD students specializing in A.I. and machine learning has also accelerated over the past few years. “AI is the most popular PhD specialization for computing PhD grads and continues growing the fastest,” the report adds. “In 2018, over 21 percent of graduating computing PhDs specialize in Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning.”  
Moreover, many of these PhD grads are going directly to private companies, rather than staying in academia: “The percent of graduating AI PhDs going to industry increased from 21% in 2004 to over 62% in 2018.”   
And why wouldn’t a hefty portion of newly minted PhDs move to the commercial realm, given the salaries and perks on offer to those A.I. and machine learning experts with the right mix of skills? For example, LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report (PDF) puts “Artificial Intelligence Specialist” as its number-one emerging job, with 74 percent annual growth over the past four years.  
A.I. jobs are, as you might expect, pretty lucrative and increasingly available. Burning Glass, which analyzes millions of job postings from across the U.S., projects that jobs involving A.I. will grow 40.1 percent over the next decade. While the median salary for these positions is $105,007 (for those with a PhD, it drifts up to $112,300), many who work in A.I. obviously make much more.   
As A.I. and machine learning become more ubiquitous, the need for A.I. education will only increase. No matter what your role, getting familiar with the concepts behind A.I./ML will only help you in the years ahead. “Our analysis shows that A.I. will be a significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors, and analysts,” read a recent report from the Brookings Institution on the impact of A.I. on jobs. “Also exposed are factory workers, who are increasingly well-educated in many occupations as well as heavily involved with A.I. on the shop floor. A.I. may be much less of a factor in the work of most lower-paid service workers.”

The hope is that these work-in-progress technologies and the ones that are just a pipe dream so far but may become a reality in the future will free up valuable time for human beings to do more cutting edge work.By Manali Rohinesh  January 21, 2020, 6:25:19 AM IST (Updated)What’s in store for all of us in the future is that artificial intelligence (AI) in some form or other is here to stay. In all aspects of our lives. There might be robots at home to help us with chores instead of maids and of course, there will be plenty of AI help in our workplaces. How invasive or pervasive it will get is not predictable. But this market is projected to reach $70 billion by 2020.

Currently, AI is being used in the form of chatbots, digital assistants and machine learning. These are used for assisted intelligence (GPS in cars), augmented intelligence (as used by the likes of Uber, Ola) and autonomous intelligence (driver-less cars, home cleaning robots, etc).

The hope is that these work-in-progress technologies and the ones that are just a pipe dream so far but may become a reality in the future, will free up valuable time for human beings to do more cutting edge work - give them the mind space to think deeper, make better decisions with the help of data generated by AI, and become more creative and imaginative.

What AI can also do is not just fancy hi-tech work. It can do the low-tech stuff too and “has the potential to democratise services like education, law, and financial advice, providing them to everyone in a personalised manner and at a lower cost”, stated a PwC report.

Healthcare sector to benefit the most

Among the 2,500 consumers and business decision-makers surveyed in the report, 63 percent of them feel that AI will benefit mankind and help solve complex problems. Up to 59 percent feel it will help people live fulfilling lives. Some 46 percent feel that it will take away jobs and only 23 percent feel they will become movie-style monsters without hearts that go on a rampage against their human creators. Eighty-seven percent fear that their privacy will be at risk.

But it’s in the healthcare sector, where AI will prove hugely beneficial to all, irrespective of income. It’s already successfully identifying “autism in babies with 81 percent accuracy and skin cancer with 91 percent accuracy. There’s more - as people feel that “AI assistants will be replacing humans as tutors (58 percent), travel agents (56 percent), tax preparers (54 percent), and office assistants (52 percent).” But they are not sure about adopting them as financial advisors, doctors, chauffeurs and house cleaners just yet. 77 percent of the people polled said they still want a human doctor and 61 percent wanted a human teacher, just to keep that human touch in some aspect of their lives.

However, AI is being used in creative ways already. A DoNotPay bot appeals parking tickets for free and Ayannah is a credit scoring service that has provided 87 percent of poor Filipinos with a credit score that they wouldn’t have got because they did not have bank accounts. The RIVA Machine is a robot that fills prescriptions, hence giving pharmacists more time to discuss medications and side effects with their customers. The fact is that what most people consider ideal today is the best of both worlds – 43 percent of millennials and 28 percent of business executives would pay a premium for a hybrid service that has AI along with a human being’s helping hand.

PwC Innovation Lead, Data and Analytics, Anand Rao, said in the report, “In the last few decades, we as mankind have made our systems much more complex. As a result, no one person can cumulatively know what is involved in any given system or solution. Our machines are becoming smarter by learning and embodying the collective experience of mankind, or a group of experts.”

Go along with the wave

So, don’t fight this technological wave, instead, go along with it and the ride might just become super interesting. The reality is that not a lot of business heads are taking this trend quite as seriously as they should. (Graphic: AI2) But if they want to begin somewhere, here’s what they need to do, to be ready for the future:

Make AI operational across business functions and units 24/7.
Currently, business leaders are complacent about risks and need to start becoming responsible about them.
Reinvent your business model and look for opportunities.
Start with the first step: Get on board the AI game. This year’s PwC’s third annual AI Predictions report stated that only 4% of the executives surveyed plan to deploy it enterprise-wide in 2020. Last year, this figure was 20 percent!
Cultivate adaptability and creativity - a sense of wonder and curiosity will also help
Embrace diverse perspectives and collaborate.



On a lighter note, survey respondents felt that by 2025, AI might be able to come up with a top 100 Billboard song, write a hit TV series or create a piece of art that is worth over $100,000. However, AI was unlikely to come up with a New York Times bestseller, writing an Oscar-winning movie and winning a Pulitzer Prize for journalism. It was heartening to note this last point, for sure!

One of the roles of science fiction is to provide readers with a glimpse of how ...










 







By Franco Laguna Correa








One of the roles of science fiction is to provide readers with a glimpse of how the future could be.1 Ray Bradbury didn’t get everything about the future right. We haven’t yet seen books and reading made illegal (as in his 1953 Fahrenheit 451),2 just as we haven’t yet discovered another planet ready for American colonizers (as in his 1950 The Martian Chronicles). And yet, the themes he explored in those books—mass media and censorship, colonization and environmental change—are more relevant than ever. Even in his lesser-known works—such as the 1951 sci-fi collection The Illustrated Man, Bradbury tackles a surprising array of issues that feel as if they were ripped from today’s headlines.
Readers today will find in The Illustrated Man a fresh perspective that illuminates global issues like artificial intelligence and climate change. Bradbury also engages with the political and cultural challenges of migration: specifically, the crossing of the US–Mexico border, which has received much attention since the dawn of the so–called Trump Era.

There’s a story in The Illustrated Man called “The Highway,” where Bradbury tells a tale about the beginning of an atomic war in the US. The war, however, is experienced through the eyes of a Mexican peasant, Hernando, who lives next to a highway in northern Mexico.
One day, Hernando glimpses a procession of hundreds of American tourists driving north to return to the US. They are heading home, that is, to join the fight in an upcoming atomic war. When the last car stops by Hernando, he sees a group of young Americans crying for help: their car needs water to continue their way back home. Right before they leave, the driver tells Hernando—who doesn’t know why all the cars are driving so fast or why these young Americans are so desperate—that the end of the world has finally arrived. Hernando doesn’t react to the young man’s confession. The car leaves. Hernando goes back to his rural routine, but suddenly stops to wonder: “What do they mean, ‘the World’?”






Here, Bradbury highlights the generational and cultural gap between the young Americans and the aging Hernando, who lives with his wife and works their land, recycling the automobile waste that travelers from north of the border leave behind. It’s a harrowing scene, but also terrifically realistic: it illustrates not only the clashing of multiple incompatible worldviews, but shows how all such worlds—even those seemingly distant from the centers of power—are threatened by contemporary global dangers. It’s moments like these that ensure Bradbury’s relevance even a hundred years after his birth.
Bradbury’s eye for contemporary troubles extends beyond the dangers of global disaster. In the prologue to The Illustrated Man, Bradbury introduces a character who has an existential problem: his torso is covered in living tattoos. Having the tattoos becomes a curse because the illustrations on his body acquire life of their own. The living illustrations unveil an ominous, even prophetic future for the person that looks at them. The Illustrated Man describes his curse:
So people fire me when my pictures move. They don’t like it when violent things happen in my illustrations. Each illustration is a little story. If you watch them, in a few minutes they tell you a tale. In three hours of looking you could see eighteen or twenty stories acted right on my body, you could hear voices and think thoughts. It’s all here, just waiting for you to look.
Unexpectedly, through this “illustrated” character, Bradbury highlights the possible dangers of artificial intelligence (AI).
Today, there are fears that AI will permeate and disrupt the political organization of postmodern societies. For instance, AI can predict the affinities and choices of an individual based on the application of algorithms. What The Illustrated Man shows is the consequence of those predictions once revealed to ordinary people. The Illustrated Man, not without melancholy, says:
If I’m with a woman, her picture comes there on my back, in an hour, and shows her whole life—how she’ll live, how she’ll die, what she’ll look like when she’s sixty. And if it’s a man, an hour later his picture’s here on my back. It shows him falling off a cliff, or dying under a train. So I’m fired again.
In an article based on his book End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World, Bryan Walsh suggests that if a “super artificial intelligence” becomes able to disregard human values—while also increasing its intelligence—then humanity might end up controlled by a nonhuman entity with a vision of the future that does not adhere to the crucial ethical issues that societies are facing today.
The Illustrated Man, as Bradbury formulated him, can be read as a metaphor for the intersection between human values (the jobless fate of the Illustrated Man) and a superintelligence that determines human life through visual representations of the future (the living, prophetic tattoos). Most importantly, Bradbury’s story doesn’t prophesy the invention of this particular machine so much as it examines the ways in which humans would react to such an invention.
The fear that individuals will surrender their ethical compasses to technology is a constant specter in Bradbury’s stories. In The Illustrated Man, this fear is represented by the refusal of the characters to accept the futures that the “illustrations” predict for them. Bradbury’s Illustrated Man, and those around him, represent the ways that humans will struggle against—and violently reject—the enigmatic directives of any intelligence beyond our own, even if (as Bradbury notes) the intelligence is speaking truthfully.
Readers will keep finding in Bradbury’s tales about the future a contemporary interpretation of our everlasting fears about the end of the world, as well as a whisper of hope. 
Where did Bradbury’s inspiration for these particular stories in The Illustrated Man come from? The clashes he foresaw in the future—questions of AI and global catastrophe, atomic war and border crossing—came from his own forays into Mexico in 1945.
In fact, Bradbury himself experienced the traumatic effects of crossing the US-Mexico border. Between October and November of 1945, Bradbury and his friend Grant Beach traveled from Los Angeles—across southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—to Mexico City. On their way, they found swarms of locusts and other hardships familiar from news stories today. But what was most shocking and traumatic for Bradbury was that this trip into Mexico surprisingly challenged his own deeply held, exotic ideas about Mexican people,3 which he had acquired while growing up in East Los Angeles.4
While in Mexico City, Bradbury spent most of his time seeking out the murals of José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera. It is possible that Bradbury found inspiration for The Illustrated Man in these murals. The murals—perhaps what Bradbury saw as informative, or even prophetic, illustrations—represent past, present, and future Mexican society from a Marxist perspective, featuring people in motion with plenty of stories, colors, and historical clues (thus bringing to the audience a multilayered experience).
One of the most famous paintings by Siqueiros, Our Present Time, depicts a faceless man reaching with arms wide open to a space ahead of him, embracing an uncertain future. This is the very same fate of the Illustrated Man. Furthermore, many of the catastrophic themes that Bradbury engages with in The Illustrated Man are also present in these Mexican murals.
What future did Bradbury see for us? And did he embrace it? In “The Fox and the Forest,” included in The Illustrated Man, Bradbury sets his story explicitly in Mexico. The plot of the story is not complicated: William and Susan Travis are a married couple living in the year 2155.
That year is not a good time to be alive, since there is war, slavery, and a generalized social unhappiness. In order to escape from the apocalyptic 2155, the couple travel in time back to 1938 rural Mexico, where they believe that peace, simplicity, and happiness can be found. When it seems that they have been able to escape from their time, the 2155 police show up to take them back to the future, thus frustrating the couple’s escapade.
This narrative has a very pessimistic tone, evoking the nostalgia of older and happier times. Those from the future view our present as superior to their own time. Bradbury’s dark future, it seems, is unavoidable—even in our own present day.

More than 60 years ago, The Martian Chronicles (1950), Fahrenheit 451 (1953), and The Illustrated Man (1951) fascinated the young members of the generation growing up after the darkness of the Second World War, but before the new kinds of wars known to our own era. Now, as the 21st century unravels—with all of its challenges, technological dilemmas, and even proliferation of tattoos—Bradbury remains a fundamental figure of the sci-fi genre.
Bradbury had certainly not anticipated that by 2020 (like what Hernando does in “The Highway”) recycling was going to become a mainstream human endeavor, or that the US-Mexico border was going to catalyze many of the 21st-century anxieties about global migration and demographic explosion. And yet, his stories seem to rhyme with our own era. Readers will keep finding in Bradbury’s tales about the future a contemporary interpretation of our everlasting fears about the end of the world, as well as a whisper of hope.
In the epilogue of The Illustrated Man, the narrator sees his own death in one of the living tattoos: it is the Illustrated Man that chokes him to death. The narrator decides to run away from this terrible fate. In this age of global catastrophe, who doesn’t recognize the desire to run from such incontrovertible proofs of the world’s doom?
And yet, just like the world today, Bradbury too oscillated between utopia and dystopia. For every Illustrated Man shown running from his prophesied demise, Bradbury shows young people—like those whom Hernando couldn’t understand—charging home to meet a near-certain death. Bradbury’s work, ultimately, is for them: those readers who believe that science fiction is an effective tool to illustrate how the worst consequences of today’s global political decisions will be faced by future generations.

Young people are approaching an uncertain globalized future with plenty of possible outcomes, both dystopian and utopian. Nothing is simple: the technology that Walsh decries, the kind that the Illustrated Man fears, is even today becoming an effective tool for social mobilizations (let’s think about the protests, from Hong Kong to Chile, organized through social media). Meanwhile, today, we know more than ever that any fight for the future will require the work and sacrifice of the whole world: not just car-driving Americans, but people like Hernando, too. Clearly, even Bradbury can’t get everything right.
Perhaps, if Bradbury were alive today, he would ask young people: What role will you play, when my future comes crashing into your present?

See The Big Book of Science Fiction, edited by Ann VanderMeer and Jeff VanderMeer (Vintage, 2016), p. xvi. It is true, however, that in recent times we have seen a subject of study banned in Arizona. See Livia Gershon, “How Arizona Banned Mexican-American Studies,” JSTOR Daily, July 22, 2017. See Jonathan Eller, Becoming Ray Bradbury (Illinois University Press, 2011), p. 54. The cosmopolitan atmosphere that Bradbury encountered in Mexico City did not fulfill his desire to find the folklore and devotion to death that he was seeking in order to write a novel that he had tentatively titled, “The Fear of Death Is Death.” These expectations deprived Bradbury of recognizing the progressive and modern aspects of Mexico, such as the increasing presence of women in public offices.

",,"There's a little logical basis to emotion recognition technology, so it ought to be prohibited from use in decisions that influence individuals' lives, says research organization AI Now in its annual report. The AI Now Institute says the field is &quot;based on markedly shaky foundations&quot;..Regardless of this, systems are on sale to assist the vet with job searchers, test criminal suspects for indications of deception and set insurance costs. It needs such programming to be restricted from using them in significant decisions that influence individuals' lives and additionally decide their access to circumstances..The US-based body has discovered support in the UK from the originator of an organization building up its own emotional-response technologies – yet it forewarned that any confinements would need to be nuanced enough not to hamper all work being done in the area..It says the part is experiencing a time of significant development and could already be worth as much as $20bn (£15.3bn). &quot;It professes to read, maybe our inner-emotional states by translating the micro-expressions all over our face, the tone of our voice or even the manner in which that we walk,&quot; clarified co-founder Prof Kate Crawford..It's being utilized all over, from how would you hire the ideal employee through to evaluating patient pain, through to track which students appear to be focusing in class. Simultaneously as these advancements are being turned out, enormous quantities of studies are demonstrating that there is no significant proof that individuals have this consistent relationship between the emotion that you are feeling and the manner in which that your face looks..The innovation is at present being utilized to assess job applicants and individuals associated with crimes, and it's being tested for additional applications, for example, in VR headsets to derive gamers' emotional states..There's likewise evidence emotion recognition can enhance race and gender differences. Regulators should step in to vigorously limit its utilization, and up to that point, AI organizations should quit deploying it, AI Now said. In particular, it referred to a recent report by the Association for Psychological Science, which went through two years looking into more than 1,000 papers on emotion detection and finished up it's exceptionally difficult to utilize facial expressions alone to precisely explain how somebody is feeling..Regardless of whether we understand it or not and it's likely &quot;not&quot; – AI is being utilized to oversee and control workers or to pick which job candidates are chosen for evaluation, how they're positioned, and whether they're employed. Artificial intelligence has, truth be told, been a hot innovation in the hiring market for quite a long time..Without comprehensive legislation, how the innovation is utilized, and transparency into the research/algorithms that go into these products, are all secretive – and this, despite the way that AI isn't some simple numerical, even-handed set of algorithms..Or maybe, it's been demonstrated to be biased against minorities and ladies, and biased for individuals who resemble the engineers who train the software. Also, shockingly, 14 months back Amazon scoured plans for an AI recruiting engine after its analysts discovered that the tools didn't like ladies..Organizations are selling emotion-detection technologies, especially to law requirement, despite the way that frequently, it doesn't work. One model: AI Now highlighted to research from ProPublica that found that schools, prisons, banks, and emergency clinics have introduced microphones implying to identify stress and aggression before violence ejects. It's not truly dependable. It's been appeared to translate harsh, sharp sounding sounds, for example, coughing to be aggression..Obviously, Illinois is the only state that's passed an enactment that pushes back against the secrecy of AI frameworks, as indicated by AI Now. The Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, scheduled to go live in January 2020, orders that businesses advise job candidates when artificial intelligence is utilized in video meeting, give a clarification of how the AI system functions and what attributes it uses to assess a candidate's fitness for the position, acquire the candidate's consent to be assessed by AI before the video interview begins, limit access to the videos, and annihilate all duplicates of the video inside 30 days of a candidate's request..As more ventures search for approaches to incorporate artificial intelligence, there is a stress that a lot of control and force will be given to these projects, without appropriately surveying the accuracy and worth they bring. On account of affect recognition, it might be troublesome and tedious for human assessment to give feedback and offset, particularly in underfunded public services. This could lead to somebody not finding a new line of work or going to jail on the grounds that an algorithm is recognized as an inappropriate feeling..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Doctors say digital technology and data are driving change that will create a different world of medicine in the next couple of decades, a new report from Stanford Medicine finds.In a survey, physicians, residents and medical students say they expect almost a third of their current duties could be automated in 20 years. And doctors are preparing for that very different healthcare future now, according to the report (PDF).Nearly half of physicians (73%) and most medical students (73%) are seeking additional training in areas such as advanced statistics, genetic counseling, population health and coding. One-third are studying artificial intelligence, according to the national survey of more than 700 physicians, residents and medical students commissioned by Stanford Medicine to understand how changing trends will reach the doctor’s office and shape patient care.RELATED: What the trends at CES 2020 could mean for the future of digital health""We found that current and future physicians are not only open to new technologies but are actively seeking training in subjects such as data science to enhance care for their patients,"" said Lloyd Minor, M.D., dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in a statement.""We are encouraged by these findings and the opportunity they present to improve patient outcomes. At the same time, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges that may stymie progress,” he said.RELATED: Meet Ballie, Samsung's new AI-powered robot execs call the 'next evolution of wellness'Key trends that are reshaping healthcare include a maturing digital health market, new health laws opening patient access to data and AI gaining regulatory traction for medical use.And the jury’s still out when it comes to whether the private industry’s foray into healthcare—in the form of companies such as Amazon, Google and Apple— will solve problems.Physicians, residents and students had mixed views about the impact these companies will have on healthcare, with 30% of students and residents and 21% of physicians still undecided. While patient outcomes are likely to improve, respondents are divided on whether physician effectiveness will improve and say physician job satisfaction will likely decrease, while healthcare costs likely increase.Other findings include:The value of data. The survey also showed that providers are heavy digital users and they believe patient data from wearables can be clinically valuable. Nearly half the survey respondents wear a health monitoring device, and most of them use the data to inform their personal healthcare decisions (71% of physicians, 60% of students and residents). A majority of students and residents (78%) and physicians (80%) say self-reported data from a patient’s health app would be clinically valuable in supporting their care. They also see value in data from consumer genetic testing reports.RELATED: Study—Google AI can outdo the experts in finding breast cancerDoctors aren’t prepared to implement innovations. However, most providers don’t believe the current generation of practitioners is ready for the data-driven future, even current medical students and residents. When asked to rate the effectiveness of their education to prepare them for these developments, only 18% of current medical students and residents surveyed said that their education was “very helpful.” And 44% of physicians surveyed said their education was either “not very helpful” or “not helpful at all.”The report pointed to the need to modernize curriculum and training programs so current and future physicians can make the most of new technologies.The ongoing struggle with medical practice burdens. And, no surprise, physicians and residents say they are struggling under medical practice burdens. Nearly 1 in 5 would change their career path if given the opportunity, citing poor work-life balance and administrative burdens as the top reasons to reconsider their decision.

",,"The face-off between man and technology has lasted through-out history. From the first striking of stones to produce fire to the making of metal works, man has struggled to tame technology or machine (Artificial Intelligence), if you please.

The invention of the computer only served to bring the battle closer home. There has always been the fear that one day the computer (machines) would among other things, take jobs, change the world and maybe even take over the world and rule man.

This fear has persisted.

A deep and often unspoken fear is that <em>the end is near when machines begin to think</em>. And thinking machines is precisely what artificial intelligence (AI) is all about. The emergence of thinking computers therefore only served to heighten that fear.

Consider when the World chess champion, Garry Kasparov, faced the first thinking machine, an IBM supercomputer called <em>Deep Blue</em>. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and won by Kasparov. The rematch was played in New York City in 1997 and won by Deep Blue. The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions. When Deep Blue took the match by winning the final game, Kasparov refused to believe it.

It was an epic moment. It sent shock waves around the world. Naturally, there were controversies. Some argued that everything was done to make the battleground comfortable for the machine, it was chilled to, like we say in Nigeria, mortuary temperature.

The truth be told, computer scientists had for decades viewed chess as a meter stick for artificial intelligence. Garry’s defeat, in many circles, meant that humans were entering the age of the machines.

Since that time, so much has happened. Computers have since grown so much more powerful. In fact, today, we have apps on our mobile phones that are far more powerful than Deep Blue. Thinking computers are everywhere. Welcome the age of Artificial Intelligence!

To understand what AI is and how it works, let’s hear the experts:

“AI is the use of intricate logic or advanced analytical methods to perform simple tasks at greater scale in ways that mean we can do more at large scale with the workers we have, allowing them to focus on what humans are best at, like handling complex exceptions or demonstrating sympathy.” <em>–Whit Andrews, vice president and distinguished analyst with Gartner Research</em>

“AI is a mathematical and algorithmic model that allows computers to learn to do tasks without being explicitly programmed to do those tasks.” <em>–Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems in the </em><a href=""http://mtu.edu/computing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>College of Computing at Michigan Technological University</em></a><em> and director of the </em><a href=""http://mtu.edu/icc""><em>Institute of Computing and Cybersystems</em></a><em>.</em>

Today, AI is becoming more pervasive. It is already in use in several sectors, particularly the financial service and marketing spheres. Reports indicate that the demand for AI-enabled initiatives would continue to increase in the coming days.

It is interesting to note that AI is rapidly making its way into the workplace. Today it touches customer care, staff recruitment and consumer insights and marketing. Tomorrow, it would reach and cover more business segments.

In spite of this, mentioning AI in the workplace still produces fear – particularly for job security. Until recently, people predicted that the automation brought by AI would render many job functions redundant. Currently, thankfully, the fear that AI will lead to redundancy has reduced with experts re-evaluating their perspective.

The truth is that AI is not replacing jobs. On the contrary, reports show that it is targeting specific tasks, improving and making them easier and faster. According to PWC, “72% of business decision-makers consider AI as a key tool for allowing humans to focus on more meaningful work.” Precisely!

So, while AI will eliminate certain types of job, it would create others. It will limit some functions, expand others and definitely restructure some industries and realign others. Overall, there would be net job gain.

AI will bring good and bad. Individuals and businesses must explore how they can use it for good. Take advantage of its potential to improve productivity, boost capacity and increase revenue.

As Red Hat technologist Gordon Haff wrote, “AI projects in the past have often tried to boil the ocean - to solve multi-faceted problems like self-driving cars. Today’s enterprise AI projects are more practical, often focusing on customer experience pain points. “What’s happening with AI today is exciting in part because it involves practical solutions that address complexity, the need to handle more and more data, and demanding customers,” Haff noted.

Evidently, the use of AI in business will continue to grow. In its current iteration, AI is significantly more practical, more useful, and more impactful. Its definition as the technology that allows computers to do things that were once only the domain of humans, is proving truer each day. For example, computers have always been able to calculate, today, with AI, they can learn and draw conclusions.

AI is essentially a thinking machine. It thinks by learning and making deductions from the data available to it

To work, AI needs data. It consumes data in order to learn. Big data refers to the massive sets of data that are now available and to all intents and purposes suited for this purpose. These sets of data can be analyzed by machines. This can reveal patterns and trends, and facilitate making future predictions. With big data, AI is in its element.

It is no surprise therefore that AI and <a href=""https://www.brandcrunch.com.ng/2017/04/21/use-big-data-drive-smart-business-decision-making/"">Big Data</a> are already driving the provision of new, innovative and efficient services, particularly in the financial sector.

In Nigeria, some fintechs are already adopting AI and Big Data. Take Renmoney. With AI and big data, it has unprecedented customer insight so that it is able to assess and disburse loans much faster, deliver incredible and efficient customer experience and indeed broaden the scope of its operations.

In adopting AI, firms demonstrate their commitment to executing what is truly a data-driven strategy. AI will enable organisations to make optimal use of data. In the age of social media, data is everywhere. To be able to gather and harness it would be tremendous. AI is helping to create the business of the future.
