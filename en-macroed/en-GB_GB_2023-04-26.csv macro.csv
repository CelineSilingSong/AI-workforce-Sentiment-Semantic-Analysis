It means you'll be able to better make use of them, and have a better appreciation of what they're good at (and what they really shouldn't be trusted with).
Like a lot of artificial intelligence systems—like the ones designed to recognize your voice or generate cat pictures—LLMs are trained on huge amounts of data. The companies behind them have been rather circumspect when it comes to revealing where exactly that data comes from, but there are certain clues we can look at.
For example, the research paper introducing the LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) model, which Bard is built on, mentions Wikipedia, “public forums,” and “code documents from sites related to programming like Q&A sites, tutorials, etc.” Meanwhile, Reddit wants to start charging for access to its 18 years of text conversations, and StackOverflow just announced plans to start charging as well. The implication here is that LLMs have been making extensive use of both sites up until this point as sources, entirely for free and on the backs of the people who built and used those resources. It's clear that a lot of what's publicly available on the web has been scraped and analyzed by LLMs.
All of this text data, wherever it comes from, is processed through a neural network, a commonly used type of AI engine made up of multiple nodes and layers. These networks continually adjust the way they interpret and make sense of data based on a host of factors, including the results of previous trial and error. Most LLMs use a specific neural network architecture called a transformer, which has some tricks particularly suited to language processing. (That GPT after Chat stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.)
Specifically, a transformer can read vast amounts of text, spot patterns in how words and phrases relate to each other, and then make predictions about what words should come next. You may have heard LLMs being compared to supercharged autocorrect engines, and that's actually not too far off the mark: ChatGPT and Bard don't really “know” anything, but they are very good at figuring out which word follows another, which starts to look like real thought and creativity when it gets to an advanced enough stage.
One of the key innovations of these transformers is the self-attention mechanism. It's difficult to explain in a paragraph, but in essence it means words in a sentence aren't considered in isolation, but also in relation to each other in a variety of sophisticated ways. It allows for a greater level of comprehension than would otherwise be possible.
There is some randomness and variation built into the code, which is why you won't get the same response from a transformer chatbot every time. This autocorrect idea also explains how errors can creep in. On a fundamental level, ChatGPT and Google Bard don't know what's accurate and what isn't. They're looking for responses that seem plausible and natural, and that match up with the data they've been trained on.
So, for example, a bot might not always choose the most likely word that comes next, but the second- or third-most likely. Push this too far, though, and the sentences stop making sense, which is why LLMs are in a constant state of self-analysis and self-correction. Part of a response is of course down to the input, which is why you can ask these chatbots to simplify their responses or make them more complex.
You might also notice generated text being rather generic or clichéd—perhaps to be expected from a chatbot that's trying to synthesize responses from giant repositories of existing text. In some ways these bots are churning out sentences in the same way that a spreadsheet tries to find the average of a group of numbers, leaving you with output that's completely unremarkable and middle-of-the-road. Get ChatGPT to talk like a cowboy, for instance, and it'll be the most unsubtle and obvious cowboy possible.
Human beings are involved in all of this too (so we're not quite redundant, yet): Trained supervisors and end users alike help to train LLMs by pointing out mistakes, ranking answers based on how good they are, and giving the AI high-quality results to aim for. Technically, it's known as “reinforcement learning on human feedback” (RLHF). LLMs then refine their internal neural networks further to get better results next time. (These are still relatively early days for the technology at this level, but we've already seen numerous notices of upgrades and improvements from developers.)
As these LLMs get bigger and more complex, their capabilities will improve. We know that ChatGPT-4 has in the region of 1 trillion parameters (although OpenAI won't confirm,) up from 175 billion in ChatGPT 3.5—a parameter being a mathematical relationship linking words through numbers and algorithms. That's a vast leap in terms of understanding relationships between words and knowing how to stitch them together to create a response.
From the way LLMs work, it's clear that they're excellent at mimicking text they've been trained on, and producing text that sounds natural and informed, albeit a little bland. Through their “advanced autocorrect” method, they're going to get facts right most of the time. (It's clear what follows “the first president of the USA was …”) But it's here where they can start to fall down: The most likely next word isn't always the right one.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we work, learn, and interact with technology. The term AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and natural language processing. As AI technology continues to advance, it is becoming increasingly integrated into various aspects of the workplace, from automating repetitive tasks to helping professionals make more informed decisions.
The impact of AI on the future of work is a topic of much discussion and debate. Some experts believe that AI will lead to the displacement of human workers, while others argue that it will create new opportunities and lead to increased productivity and economic growth. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that AI will have a profound effect on the job market and the skills needed to succeed in the workforce.

In this context, it is crucial to understand the potential benefits and risks of AI in the workplace, as well as the ethical implications of using AI to make decisions that affect human lives. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential that individuals and organizations alike stay informed and adapt to the changing landscape of work.
AI is set to transform the future of work in a number of ways. Here are some possible angles:

The Impact of AI on Jobs: One of the biggest questions surrounding AI and the future of work is what impact it will have on employment. Will AI create new jobs or displace existing ones? What types of jobs are most likely to be affected?
The Role of AI in Workforce Development: As AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace, it’s likely that workers will need to develop new skills in order to keep up. How can companies and organizations help workers develop these skills?
The Future of Collaboration Between Humans and AI: Many experts believe that the future of work will involve collaboration between humans and AI. What might this collaboration look like? How can companies and organizations foster effective collaboration between humans and AI?
AI and Workforce Diversity: AI has the potential to reduce bias and increase diversity in the workplace. How can organizations leverage AI to improve workforce diversity?
The Ethical Implications of AI in the Workplace: As AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace, there are a number of ethical considerations that need to be taken into account. How can companies and organizations ensure that their use of AI is ethical and responsible?
AI and the Gig Economy: AI has the potential to transform the gig economy by making it easier for individuals to find work and for companies to find workers. How might AI impact the future of the gig economy?
AI and Workplace Automation: AI is likely to automate many routine tasks in the workplace, freeing up workers to focus on higher-level tasks. What types of tasks are most likely to be automated, and how might this change the nature of work?

Advantages and disadvantages of AI in the context of the future of work:
Advantages:

Increased Efficiency: AI can automate many routine tasks and workflows, freeing up workers to focus on higher-level tasks and increasing productivity.
Improved Accuracy: AI systems can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, reducing the risk of errors.
Better Decision-Making: AI can analyze data and provide insights that humans may not be able to identify, leading to better decision-making.
Cost Savings: By automating tasks and workflows, AI can reduce labor costs and improve the bottom line for businesses.
Enhanced Customer Experience: AI-powered chatbots and other tools can provide fast, personalized service to customers, improving their overall experience with a company.

Disadvantages:

Job Displacement: As mentioned earlier, AI and automation could displace many workers, particularly those in low-skill jobs.
Skill Mismatch: As AI and automation become more prevalent, workers will need to develop new skills in order to remain competitive in the workforce.
Bias and Discrimination: AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on, which could lead to discrimination in hiring, promotion, and other workplace practices.
Ethical Concerns: As AI and automation become more prevalent, there are a number of ethical concerns that need to be addressed, including issues related to privacy, transparency, and accountability.
Cybersecurity Risks: As more and more data is collected and processed by AI systems, there is a risk that this data could be compromised by cybercriminals.
Loss of Human Interaction: AI systems may replace some forms of human interaction in the workplace, potentially leading to a loss of social connections and collaboration between workers.
Uneven Access: As mentioned earlier, not all workers and organizations have equal access to AI and automation technology, which could widen the gap between those who have access to these tools and those who do not.

These are just a few of the advantages and disadvantages of AI and the future of work. As AI continues to evolve, it’s likely that new advantages and disadvantages will emerge as well.
In conclusion, the impact of AI on the future of work is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and planning. While AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and improve productivity, it also poses significant challenges, including job displacement and ethical concerns.
We must teach students to use artificial intelligence, but also be aware of its limitations and be critical of the result it generates, says the expert. Credit: Soeren Stache/picture alliance via Getty Images
To prepare for the future of work, individuals and organizations must prioritize upskilling and reskilling to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an AI-driven world. Additionally, policymakers must address the potential impacts of AI on employment and work towards creating policies that ensure the benefits of AI are shared equitably.
Ultimately, the successful integration of AI into the workplace will require collaboration and dialogue between industry, academia, and government to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits society as a whole. By staying informed and proactive, we can navigate the changes brought about by AI and create a future of work that is both efficient and equitable.

“The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, A.I., and the Future of Work,” Yossi Sheffi, MIT CTL Media, purports to link the two title concepts. It’s a frustrating book. Yossi Sheffi is a supply chain expert and he’s at MIT. I had hopes that this would be a great book about modern supply chains and how artificial intelligence (AI) can address the challenges of the sector. Sadly, I was only half right.

The Magic Conveyor BeltMIT Center for Transportation and Logistics


Let’s start with the fun. The first half of the book is focused on supply chains. Sheffi, as should be expected from the Director of the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, describes both the basics and the complexity of modern supply chains in the first two of four book sections. Actually, it’s a little surprising. It’s very rare, in my experience, for an academic to be able to create explanations that don’t look as if they came from a textbook. The author, though, succeeds admirably. The first section is the basics on the supply chain and the second section talks about the complications and complexity caused by today’s global infrastructure, and it’s done at a very accessible level. This was an excellent half and created excitement for the second half.

PROMOTED
The expectation was not met. MIT is one of the centers of AI development. I figured the author could wander over to the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and get feedback from them as to how AI could address the challenges laid out so clearly in section two. That was not to be.

The second half sections are the typical, high-level platitudes we repeatedly hear about AI. Admittedly. Yossi Sheffi comes closer to admitting it will destroy jobs, but he can’t quite do that. One example is, after talking about how there’s a partnership between people and AI, he describes “an automated warehouse the size of seven football fields” that employes four people.

Another problem is the “logic” used not long after. Remember, AI is going to remove those simple tasks and leave us with the challenging ones. As mentioned in this column last Fall, if the simple tasks are automated, how are people going to learn enough to handle the complex tasks? As a hint about the book, the flawed argument is made on page 190. Not until page 277 is there a tiny segment about the flaw in that argument.

About the only tactical discussion of AI helping supply chains is a later discussion about digital twins, and that is only two-and-a-half pages.
One, almost amusing, later discussion is the glowing description of Intel providing new and exciting career paths as an example of AI creating jobs. It might eventually do that, but it looks as if the draft of this book was written before last October’s information about thousands of job cuts at that company.

What we end up with is a tale of two halves. I think this book is good for two classes of people. First, anyone who wants an excellent, non-technical explanation of the current state of global supply chains. Since I don’t focus on that, I don’t know if there’s a book solely on that subject that is as good. The second group are people who are already in AI, people who aren’t interested in the fluff in the second half but want to see the business opportunity laid out in excellent terms. They can ignore the second half and get business ideas from the first half. If, however, you’re already very knowledgeable about the sector and want to know how AI can help, this is not the book for you. I wish this had been co-authored by Yossi Sheffi and someone from CSAIL, or elsewhere, who could have helped focus the AI section on the tactical details of using the technology to help the sector. It would have made for a wonderful book.

NYC Artificial Intelligence Rule to Take Effect July 5, 2023: New York City Issues Final Rule Regulating the Use of AI Tools by Employers


By Lindsay Burke, Libbie Canter, Jennifer Johnson, Teresa Lewi, Micaela McMurrough, Carolyn Rashby, Lindsey Tonsager & Kareem Carryl on April 26, 2023
Posted in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Technology




The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”) recently issued a Notice of Adoption of Final Rule (“Final Rule”) relating to the implementation of New York City’s law regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”) by NYC employers and employment agencies.

NYC’s Local Law 144 now takes effect on July 5, 2023.  As discussed in our prior post, Local Law 144 prohibits employers and employment agencies from using certain Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tools in the hiring or promotion process unless the tool has been subject to a bias audit within one year prior to its use, the results of the audit are publicly available, and notice requirements to employees or job candidates are satisfied. 
The issuance of DCWP’s Final Rule follows the prior release of two sets of proposed rules in September 2022 and December 2022.  The Final Rule’s most significant updates from the December 2022 proposal include an expansion of the definition of AEDTs and modifications to the requirements for bias audits.  Key provisions of the Final Rule are summarized below.

What is an Automated Employment Decision Tool?
Local Law 144 defines AEDTs as “any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.” 
Under the Final Rule, “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” is defined as a group of mathematical, computer-based techniques that:

generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on skill sets or aptitude; and
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve the accuracy of the prediction or classification.

The Final Rule clarifies which tools fall within the scope of the law by defining the phrase “to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” as:

relying “solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.) with no other factors considered”;
using the tool’s “output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted more than any other criterion in the set”; or
using the tool’s “output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.”

Employers and employment agencies should be aware of four categories of requirements related to bias audits:

(i) Structure and Required Calculations;
(ii) Permissible Data;
(iii) Independent Auditor; and
(iv) Publication of Results.

Each category is addressed in more detail below.
Structure and Required Calculations
The Final Rule details the structure and requirements for bias audits, with new requirements following prior releases of proposed rules.  An AEDT cannot be used if more than one year has passed since the most recent bias audit.  Bias audits must adhere to the following:

Where an AEDT selects individuals to move forward in the hiring process or classifies individuals into groups, the bias audit must:

(i) calculate the selection rate for each category;
(ii) calculate the impact ratio for each category; and 
(iii) indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included because they fall within an unknown category (e.g., applicants who declined to disclose demographic data). 



Categories mirror the EEO-protected categories reported on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO-1 Component 1 report.  These categories include race, ethnicity, and sex.

Where the AEDT only scores individuals rather than selecting them, the bias audit must:

(i) calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;
(ii) calculate the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample’s median score in the each category/classification;
(iii) calculate the impact ratio for each category/classification; and
(iv) indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included because they fall within an unknown category. 



The impact ratio must be calculated either as (i) a selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category; or (ii) a scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate of the highest scoring category.  Impact ratio calculations may exclude a category that makes up less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. 
The Final Rule also indicates that the required calculations described above must be conducted for standalone sex, race, and ethnicity categories (e.g., Male, Female, Hispanic or Latino, Black, Asian, White, etc.), as well as intersectional groupings (e.g., Black Females, White Males, etc.). 
Permissible Data
Bias audits must use “historical data,” which is defined as “data collected during an employer or an employment agency’s use of an AEDT to assess candidates for employment or employees for promotion.”  Under the Final Rule, a bias audit may rely on historical data of other employers or employment agencies, but only if the employer or employment agency (i) has provided the independent auditor with historical data from its own use of the AEDT or (ii) has never used the AEDT.
Alternatively, test data may be used if there is insufficient historical data available for a statistically significant bias audit.  If test data is used, a summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used, as well as describe how the test data was generated and obtained.
Independent Auditor
An “independent auditor” must perform bias audits.  The Final Rule clarifies that an “independent auditor” is “a person or group that is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues within the scope of a bias audit of an AEDT.”  An auditor is not independent if the auditor:

(i) is or was involved in using, developing, or distributing the AEDT;
(ii) has an employment relationship with an employer or employment agency that uses AEDT; or
(iii) has a direct or material indirect financial interest in an employer or employment agency that uses the AEDT. 

Similarly, an auditor is not independent if it has an employment relationship with or financial interest in a vendor that developed or distributes the AEDT.
Publication of Results
Local Law 144 requires that the results of a bias audit must be “made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency.”  The Final Rule clarifies that the published results — the date of the most recent bias audit, summary of results, and distribution date of the AEDT — must be posted on the employment section of the entity’s website in a “clear and conspicuous manner.” 
The summary of results must include the source and an explanation of the data used to conduct the audit; the number of individuals who fall within an unknown category; and the number of individuals, selection or scoring rates, and impact ratios for all categories.  If a category comprising less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit is excluded from the required calculations for impact ratios, the summary must include the independent auditor’s justification, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.
The published results must remain posted for at least six months after the AEDT was last used to make an employment decision.
Any changes to the notice requirements?
Local Law 144 requires that any employer or employment agency that uses an AEDT to screen an employee or a candidate who has applied for a position for an employment decision must notify individuals who reside in New York City that the AEDT will be used in connection with their assessment or evaluation, as well as the job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will consider.  Notice must be provided at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT and, notably, must include instructions for how to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
The Final Rule’s notice provisions remain similar to those included in the proposed rules in September 2022 and December 2022.  Importantly, the Final Rule clarifies that Local Law 144 only requires employers or employment agencies to include how an individual might request alternative selection processes or accommodation to the extent such options are “available.”  While employers or employment agencies must still comply with reasonable accommodation obligations under other laws, the Final Rule states that “[n]othing under [Local Law 144] requires [them] to provide an alternative selection process.”
Looking Ahead
As an immediate next step, employers and employment agencies should identify whether their hiring and promotion efforts leverage AI tools that fall within the scope of NYC Local Law 144 and adjust their processes accordingly in advance of the July 5, 2023 enforcement date.
While NYC’s Local Law 144 is groundbreaking, it is likely only a small part of what will become an increasingly complex regulatory environment related to AI and machine learning.  Companies should prepare to comply with more laws and regulations as federal, state, and local legislatures take stock of the use of AI in various decision-making processes.  Covington will continue to monitor developments and publish relevant updates.  In the interim, if you have any questions about the material covered above, please contact Covington members of our Employment, Data Privacy, and Technology groups.

Jobs Most Impacted by ChatGPT and Similar AI Models
On November 30, 2022, OpenAI heralded a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) by introducing ChatGPT to the world.
The AI chatbot stunned users with its human-like and thorough responses. ChatGPT could comprehend and answer a variety of different questions, make suggestions, research and write essays and briefs, and even tell jokes (amongst other tasks).
Many of these skills are used by workers in their jobs across the world, which begs the question: which jobs will be transformed, or even replaced, by generative AI in the coming future?

This infographic from Harrison Schell visualizes the March 2023 findings of OpenAI on the potential labor market impact of large language models (LLMs) and various applications of generative AI, including ChatGPT. 
Methodology
The OpenAI working paper specifically examined the U.S. industries and jobs most “exposed” to large language models like GPT, which the chatbot ChatGPT operates on.
Key to the paper is the definition of what “exposed” actually means:

“A proxy for potential economic impact without distinguishing between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects.” – OpenAI
Thus, the results include both jobs where humans could possibly use AI to optimize their work, along with jobs that could potentially be automated altogether.
OpenAI found that 80% of the American workforce belonged to an occupation where at least 10% of their tasks can be done (or aided) by AI. One-fifth of the workforce belonged to an occupation where 50% of work tasks would be impacted by artificial intelligence.
The Jobs Most and Least at Risk of AI Disruption
Here is a list of jobs highlighted in the paper as likely to see (or already seeing) AI disruption, where AI can reduce the time to do tasks associated with the occupation by at least 50%.

Analysis was provided by a variety of human-made models as well as ChatGPT-4 models, with results from both showing below:

Editor’s note: The paper only highlights some jobs impacted. One AI model found a list of 84 additional jobs that were “fully exposed”, but not all were listed. One human model found 15 additional “fully exposed” jobs that were not listed.
Generally, jobs that require repetitive tasks, some level of data analysis, and routine decision-making were found to face the highest risk of exposure.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, “information processing industries” that involve writing, calculating, and high-level analysis have a higher exposure to LLM-based artificial intelligence. However, science and critical-thinking jobs within those industries negatively correlate with AI exposure. 
On the flipside, not every job is likely to be affected. Here’s a list of jobs that are likely least exposed to large language model AI disruption.



Jobs Least Exposed to AI




AthletesShort-order cooks


Large equipment operatorsBarbers/hair stylists


Glass installers & repairersDredge operators


Automotive mechanicsPower-line installers/repairers


Masons, carpenters, roofersOil field maintenance workers


Plumbers, painters, pipefittersServers, dishwashers, bartenders



Naturally, hands-on industries like manufacturing, mining, and agriculture were more protected, but still include information processing roles at risk.

Likewise, the in-person service industry is also expected to see minimal impact from these kinds of AI models. But, patterns are beginning to emerge for job-seekers and industries that may have to contend with artificial intelligence soon.
Artificial Intelligence Impacts on Different Levels of Jobs
OpenAI analyzed correlations between AI exposure in the labor market against a job’s requisite education level, wages, and job-training.
The paper found that jobs with higher wages have a higher exposure to LLM-based AI (though there were numerous low-wage jobs with high exposure as well).

TrainingInverse



Professionals with higher education degrees also appeared to be more greatly exposed to AI impact, compared to those without.
However, occupations with a greater level of on-the-job training had the least amount of work tasks exposed, compared to those jobs with little-to-no training.
Will AI’s Impact on the Job Market Be Good or Bad?
The potential impact of ChatGPT and similar AI-driven models on individual job titles depends on several factors, including the nature of the job, the level of automation that is possible, and the exact tasks required. 

However, while certain repetitive and predictable tasks can be automated, others that require intangibles like creative input, understanding cultural nuance, reading social cues, or executing good judgement cannot be fully hands-off yet.
And keep in mind that AI exposure isn’t limited to job replacement. Job transformation, with workers utilizing the AI to speed up or improve tasks output, is extremely likely in many of these scenarios. Already, there are employment ads for “AI Whisperers” who can effectively optimize automated responses from generalist AI.
As the AI arms race moves forward at a rapid pace rarely seen before in the history of technology, it likely won’t take long for us to see the full impact of ChatGPT and other LLMs on both jobs and the economy.

Note: PDD Holdings says its headquarters remain in Shanghai, China, and Ireland is used for legal registration for its overseas business.
 
Apple is the largest tech company at the moment, having competed with Microsoft for the top of the leaderboard for many years. The company saw its market cap soar after announcing its generative AI, Apple Intelligence. Analysts believe people will upgrade their devices over the next few years, since the new features are only available on the iPhone 15 Pro or newer.
Microsoft is in second place in the rankings, partly thanks to enthusiasm for its AI software which is already generating revenue. Rising profits also contributed to the company’s value. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Microsoft increased its net income by 20% compared to the same quarter last year.
Nvidia follows closely behind with the third-highest market cap, rising more than eight times higher compared to its value at the start of 2023. The company has recently announced higher profits, introduced a higher dividend, and reported that its next-generation GPU chip will start generating revenue later this year.
AI a Driver of the Biggest Tech Companies
It’s clear from the biggest tech companies that involvement in AI can contribute to investor confidence.
Among S&P 500 companies, AI has certainly become a focus topic. In fact, 199 companies cited the term “AI” during their first quarter earnings calls, the highest on record. The companies who mentioned AI the most were Meta (95 times), Nvidia (86 times), and Microsoft (74 times).

These tools can save time and money, and are creating excitement among tech experts – but they also raise a lot of questions.     ""I started using ChatGPT in January,"" said Pierre, a communications manager in a small administrations business, talking about the now-famous conversational robot launched in November 2022 by the company OpenAI. ""At first, the results were not too impressive, but by honing my skills through YouTube videos, I've managed to automate about 30% to 40% of my workload, which consists of writing articles and social media posts."" Although the person who said this – following a public call for people's experiences put out on Le Monde's French website – was enthusiastic about the technology, they did not want their name to be published, because the boss of their small company ""struggles to think of using artificial intelligence [AI] as real work."" The trend for generative AIs – capable of creating text, like ChatGPT, or highly realistic photos, like Midjourney, from a simple written instruction – is starting to affect businesses. ""Today, all the creatives in our agency play around with this software. And particularly those under 35,"" said Bertille Toledano, president of the advertising agency BETC and co-president of the Association des Agences-Conseils en Communication (Association of Communication Consulting Agencies, AACC). But beyond these initial technophile converts, will these tools disrupt the world of work? Or will they join the list of innovations that have been the subject of farfetched hype, only to disappoint, such as the metaverse or the virtual reality headset? ""Generative artificial intelligence is having an effect on jobs that seemed immune to automation, especially in the service sector,"" said sociologist Yann Ferguson, a teacher and researcher at ICAM in Toulouse and scientific leader of LaborIA, a program to analyze the impact of AI on work launched in 2021 by the government and the Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology). Businesses such as the investment bank Morgan Stanley and e-commerce platform Cdiscount have already started its initial rollout. Digital giants such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta are also pushing the technology.  ""Companies are mostly won over, but they also have questions,"" said Laurent Daudet, co-founder of LightOn, a French developer of large language models, the drivers behind interfaces like ChatGPT. What will generative AI really contribute? What are the risks? A February JobTeaser-Kantar survey summarized the ambivalence of feelings about this technology: Most people in employment between 18 and 27 thought that it would free up work time or create new jobs – but 61% also feared it would have an impact on their careers.

I recommend starting with the first article, which you can find here:Generative AI for Social Work Students: Part IA paradigm shifttowardsdatascience.comMastering AI tools like ChatGPT offers MSW students a range of career advantages. Proficiency in these technologies streamlines work processes, increasing efficiency and accuracy in tasks like case management, data analysis, and resource allocation. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into social work practice, organizations will value professionals who seamlessly blend traditional skills with AI’s innovative capabilities. Proficiency in AI tools demonstrates a commitment to staying current with technological advancements, making students more marketable to potential employers.The ability of AI to revolutionize social work practice depends on professionals having a solid grasp of the technology, which includes understanding how AI models function, their strengths and weaknesses, and the potential issues and biases they may introduce. Even though ChatGPT has only been publicly accessible for under six months, I have observed problematic usage among my students. Some of these issues stem from overconfidence in their abilities while lacking the required skill to effectively use these powerful tools, a phenomenon known as the Dunning-Kruger effect.As the social work curriculum has yet to incorporate this technology fully, this article serves as a stop-gap measure, offering guidance on essential knowledge, skills, and practices for working with generative AI. While not a comprehensive roadmap, this article provides a starting point that will evolve with the technology. By refining their abilities in AI applications like ChatGPT, social work students can contribute to developing novel, cutting-edge interventions and practices, positioning themselves as thought leaders. This expertise can open doors for career growth, professional recognition, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams to effect lasting, positive change for individuals and communities.Given the swift advancements in AI technologies and abundant available resources, I refrain from offering a specific reading list, as it would quickly become outdated. Instead, I present these areas as general competency domains, which you should consistently monitor for the most up-to-date resources.Understanding how artificial intelligence worksIn today’s fast-paced technological environment, social work students must develop an understanding of artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models like ChatGPT. As AI tools become more prevalent in social work practice, professionals with expertise in this area can make well-informed decisions about their usage. This knowledge helps social workers use AI responsibly and ethically while integrating their content expertise and interpersonal skills.A key component of understanding AI is knowing the underlying training procedures and data, which can help you make informed decisions about when and how to use AI-generated content. This knowledge also enables you to identify potential inaccuracies, biases, and outdated information. Evaluating an AI model’s performance for specific use cases is essential. Disappointment with AI models often arises from using them for tasks they were not trained to perform, such as researching highly specialized topics.It is important to note that understanding AI and large language models does not require a background in math, statistics, or computer programming. While achieving proficiency involves time and effort, it is an attainable goal for any social work student committed to learning. A wealth of resources, including online courses, tutorials, and articles, is available to help students develop their AI knowledge at their own pace without requiring specialized prerequisites.By investing in this learning process, social work students can enhance their skill sets and contribute to advancing the field. In doing so, they ensure that they harness the power of AI to benefit individuals, families, and communities in a way that aligns with the principles of social work.Ethical issuesThe significance of actively engaging with and staying informed about ethical issues related to artificial intelligence cannot be overstated. Ensuring the responsible use of AI, especially large language models like ChatGPT, is critical to aligning the technology with the core values and principles of social work practice, such as social justice, the dignity and worth of individuals, and the significance of human relationships.Ethical concerns in AI use cover a wide range of issues, including:Data privacy: Safeguarding the sensitive information of clients and communities is essential to maintaining trust and upholding ethical standards in social work practice.Biases in AI systems: AI models can inadvertently perpetuate and reinforce existing biases, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes. Social workers must be aware of these biases and actively work to mitigate their impact.Potential misuse: Unintended or unethical use of AI tools can harm individuals and communities, making it vital for social workers to understand and adhere to appropriate guidelines for using such technology.Equitable distribution of AI benefits: Ensuring that the advantages of AI technology are accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status or other factors, is critical to fostering social justice and addressing systemic inequalities.As social workers, our responsibility is to continuously examine and question the effects of AI technology on vulnerable populations, ensuring that the tools we use do not contribute to harm or injustice. Cultivating a deep understanding of these ethical challenges enables social work professionals to advocate for developing and implementing policies and guidelines that support ethical AI use in their practice settings. This commitment to ethical AI integration is essential for upholding the core values of social work and promoting the well-being of individuals and communities.Prompt engineeringCurrently, “prompt engineering” is one of the most important practical skills to learn to harness the power of generative AI tools. Prompt engineering may sound complicated, but the concept is straightforward. In the context of generative AI and large language models, prompt engineering refers to crafting practical questions or input statements (i.e., prompts) to guide the AI model in generating useful, relevant, and accurate responses.Learning to write effective prompts is essential for using generative AI tools to their full potential. Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the quality of the AI-generated content, making it more focused, accurate, and applicable to the task at hand. Conversely, poorly designed prompts may lead to irrelevant, ambiguous, or misleading responses from the AI model.To engineer effective prompts, one must deeply understand the subject matter and anticipate potential pitfalls and inaccuracies that may arise in AI-generated content. In this regard, content expertise plays a significant role. Professionals with solid knowledge in a content area can design prompts that will lead to meaningful and insightful AI-generated content more effectively.The significance of subject matter proficiency in designing AI prompts emphasizes that generative AI cannot substitute for social workers. AI models depend on human experts’ insights and experiences to shape their responses and guarantee the produced content is pertinent and suitable for a particular context. Social workers’ expertise enables them to efficiently utilize AI tools to improve their work while ensuring the AI-generated content adheres to the profession’s values, principles, and ethical guidelines.As generative AI continues to play a more prominent role in various fields, including social work, prompt engineering is emerging as one of the essential AI-related skills for professionals to learn. By mastering prompt engineering, social workers can unlock the full potential of AI tools, enhancing their practice and driving more effective, efficient, and ethical outcomes for their clients and communities.Design thinkingDesign thinking is an approach that emphasizes a human-centered methodology for addressing complex problems. This approach emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and experimentation to understand the unique needs and contexts of the communities involved. We can create more effective and tailored AI-driven solutions to address intricate social issues by incorporating design thinking principles into generative AI tools.This fusion of design thinking and generative AI fosters a creative environment that encourages idea generation and exploration of diverse solutions. It also supports an iterative process of prototyping and testing, allowing for the continuous refinement and adjustment of interventions based on real-world feedback. Adopting a design thinking mindset when utilizing generative AI tools facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration and promotes a culture of continuous improvement. This enables the development of comprehensive solutions to complex social issues by drawing on a wide range of perspectives and expertise from different fields.Moreover, by learning from failures and iterating on solutions, we can ensure that AI-driven interventions are consistently refined and adapted to meet the changing needs of the target population. This approach ultimately leads to more effective, responsive, and sustainable solutions that address the root causes of social issues and improve the well-being of the communities served.Next stepsThe following two articles in this series will focus on strategies for enhancing your educational experience with AI and a concluding article on the art and science of prompt engineering. As I prepare these articles, I’m also actively examining the problems of the ASWB national social work licensing exam using large language models. This work is highly relevant to this series and the field of social work.

Could artificial intelligence be about to take over your job?
Two studies point out the challenges ahead for work positions in the AI era

By Elaine Burke 
April 27, 2023 at 9:01 AM















Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.
 TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust.


Preliminary research published at the end of March claimed that up to 80% of the US workforce could see at least 10% of their tasks impacted by large language models such as the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) underpinning ChatGPT.
First, note the caveats. A preprint paper has not yet been peer reviewed, though the open access ArXiv server where it was posted does have a moderation process. This particular preprint comes from OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, along with OpenResearch, a research lab chaired by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the University of Pennsylvania. And it just happens to be the case that GPT-4 technologies were even used for some of the writing and coding on this research.
That said, some of the paper's conclusions chime with an economic study issued in December 2022 by the White House and the EU, which examined the potential impact of AI on future workforces.
This report didn't just look at the roles and tasks at risk of being overtaken by AI, but also at the broader impacts this technology might have across the workforce, such as the possible increase in surveillance of workers using AI, algorithmic management of work, income loss, the evolution of worker skills and mobility across jobs.

OpenAI is in talks with Broadcom about developing AI chip 



What both reports have in common is a warning that AI is not just a threat to jobs comprising repetitive digital tasks that are easily automated. In fact, many high-skill and high-paid jobs are highly exposed to AI. The economic report also warns that this leaves older workers particularly exposed, as they have had time to accrue the education and experience that can potentially be supplanted by an AI that is cheaper to employ or incredibly speedy with results – or both.
High-risk roles
When it comes to the specifics, both reports differ as to which roles are most at risk. OpenAI's research concludes that mathematicians, tax preparers, writers, web designers, accountants, journalists and legal secretaries are those most vulnerable to an AI takeover. The US-EU study says clinical lab technicians, chemical engineers, optometrists and power plant operators are most exposed.
Really, it all comes down to what these tools are capable of doing with a level of speed and accuracy that rivals or far supersedes human workers. In terms of skills, OpenAI's report identifies programming and writing as highly susceptible to the influence of large language models.

However, it's important to note that while generative AIs continue to ""hallucinate"" (generating confident responses that are counter to facts), its outputs can only be trusted under the supervision of trained and experienced professionals capable of calling out any missteps. That is to say, AI journalism will need good editors and fact-checkers to review content before publishing, and AI coding will need thorough testing and validation before deployment.
This is the knowledge gap AI may never be able to overcome. Even the most advanced AI systems, reaching more than 90% accuracy, appear to plateau at that level, unable to reach the ideal of 100% reliability. And therein lies a conundrum. If the future needs expert oversight of AI-generated outputs to ensure accuracy and trust, where will those experts come from if a generation of workers skips the learning and experience gained from doing the groundwork over years and years?
If lower-level tasks are farmed out to AI as an assistance to workers in the long-term, their experience may not be as valuable in the long-term. This has already been flagged as an issue among pilots, a profession where much of the work has been handed over to automation.
A 2013 report from a US working group examining flight deck automation identified vulnerabilities in pilots' knowledge and skills driven by an over-reliance on computer-assisted piloting and passive training in its use. This can leave pilots unprepared to take control of a flight when things went wrong, which can have disastrous results. The working group found that more than 60% of accidents reviewed involved a manual error.
AI-proof skills
Being more hands-on with your work is certainly a major advantage amid the AI revolution. While generative AI is racing ahead with the creation of digital content, plenty of work in the physical realm is being left to the dexterity of skilled human hands and creative thinking.
The joint US-EU report also cites jobs that require interpersonal skills – such as childcare and hospitality – as having very limited exposure to AI. According to OpenAI's research, jobs with a greater need for skills in science and critical thinking are less likely to be impacted by large language models. It concludes that the jobs least likely to be impacted by GPTs overall are in graphic design, search marketing strategy and financial management.

The release of GPT-4 is a clarion call for communicators. It’s becoming increasingly critical to understand how AI can enhance our work.
Yet with so much hype surrounding AI, it’s challenging to separate buzz from brass tacks. Here are five quick tips to bring you up to speed without getting caught up in the hype cycle:

Understand what AI is—and AIn’t. “We’re going through a generative AI hype cycle,” says Web3 strategist Cathy Hackl, who keynoted PR Daily’s Social Media Conference at Disney World in March. “With all the buzz, it’s easy to get intimidated by the terms and technology.”

The solution is settling on a clear definition. She believes the World Economic Forum defines it best: “Generative AI refers to a category of AI algorithms that generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. Unlike traditional AI systems designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, generative AI creates new content in the form of images, text, audio, and more.”
She also suggests thinking of artificial intelligence as a pie, with generative AI as one of the slices.
“Robots, deep learning, machine learning and conversational artificial intelligence are all slices of the AI pie,” Hackl explains. “Look at it as form of automation that can help your company have more effective processes, freeing up resources to work in a more innovative way. While this is a much too simple way to reduce what AI is, it can help you and your teams start to wrap their heads around this.”

Experiment with AI—starting now. “Generative AI will transform jobs, help us process data faster and enhance tasks,” assures Hackl. “The question is, ‘Why not start experimenting now?’ Why wait if you can use generative AI to create engaging content and personalized customer experiences faster?’”

Perhaps nobody has put the AI call-to-action better than Max Penk, creative innovation director at David+Martin, who recently said: “The good news is that AI won’t replace you. The bad news is that a person using AI probably will.”
So where to start? Hackl suggests focusing in on these top generative AI benefits for brands and their communications teams:

Hyper-personalization: Increased targeting can lead to more engagement with audiences and translate to more conversions.
Greater customer choice: Improved customization can help organizations reach their audiences in new ways.
Increased innovation: Predictive modeling and analytics can help teams identity patterns and find fresh ways to interact with their communities.
Augmented creativity: Using generative AI tools for inspiration can help improve ideation, especially when a team is stuck in the creative process.


Familiarize yourself with these tools. “It can be tough to find the best AI tool for your needs, because there are so many out there,” says Hackl.  “The good news is that a lot of them have free versions.”

Here are the AI tools she believes will benefit marketers and communicators:

Chat GPT: A text generative AI tool that uses OpenAI to answer questions, write code, write poetry and posts, create summaries and outlines, etc. Upgraded via its GPT-4 release to include image processing and more.
Midjourney: An image generative AI tool. Based on a text prompt, MidJourney will create a set of images. Marketers use this tool to create graphics for blogs or prototype images for design teams.
DALL-E: Another generative AI tool based on OpenAI. It creates images based on a natural text description. Marketers can also use Dall-E to edit images that already exist.
Stable Diffusion: A latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.
D-ID: A video generative AI tool. Marketers can create video avatars with natural language.
Hypewrite: An AI-generated document editor and browser extension can help you write better content faster.
Artifact: From the founder of Instagram, this new app offers a personalized news feed powered by artificial intelligence.

“It’s hard to keep up, since new generative AI tools are introduced every day,” Hackl concedes. “My advice is to not get overwhelmed by the volume of tools and focus instead on finding those that will enhance your current role.”

Know the risks—and check with legal. Hackl doesn’t believe AI poises an immediate threat to brands. She does, however, recommend having a plan in place to prevent copyright infringement and protect intellectual property rights.

“Also be aware that some of the data used train some of these models can be highly biased,” she warns. “Generative AI is a powerful tool and could bring forth success when used responsibly. It’ll be up to everyone using the tools to weigh out the cost and benefits of adding them to their marketing strategy.”
Hackl’s parting advice: “Engage with your legal teams and find out what your brand’s positioning is when it comes to content created and co-created with AI.”

In a few short months, generative AI has become a very hot topic. Looking beyond the hype, generative AI is a groundbreaking technology, enabling novel capabilities as it moves rapidly into the enterprise world. 
According to a CRM survey, 67% of IT leaders are prioritizing generative AI for their business within the next year and a half—despite looming concerns about generative AI ethics and responsibility. And 80% of those who think generative AI is “overhyped” still believe the technology will improve customer support, reduce workloads and boost organizational efficiencies.
In the enterprise world, generative AI has arrived (discussed in my previous CIO.com article about enterprises putting generative AI to work here).
Preserving trust
As enterprises race to adopt generative AI and begin to realize its benefits, there is a simultaneous mandate in play. Organizations must proactively mitigate generative AI’s inherent risks, in areas such as ethics, bias, transparency, privacy and regulatory requirements.
Fostering a responsible approach to generative AI implementations enables organizations to preserve trust with customers, employees and stakeholders. Trust is the currency of business. Without it, brands can be damaged as revenues wane and employees leave. And once breached, trust is difficult to regain. 
That’s why preserving trust—before it is broken—is so essential. Here are ways to proactively preserve trust in generative AI implementations.
Mitigating bias and unfairness
Achieving fairness and mitigating bias are essential aspects of responsible AI deployment. Bias can be unintentionally introduced from the AI training data, algorithm and use case. Picture a global retail company using generative AI to personalize promotional offers for customers. The retailer must prevent biased outcomes like offering discounts to specific demographic groups only. 
To do that, the retailer must create diverse and representative data sets, employing advanced techniques for bias detection and mitigation and adopting inclusive design practices. Ongoing, the continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI systems will ensure fairness is maintained throughout their lifecycle.
Establishing transparency and explainability
In addition to mitigating bias and unfairness, transparency and explainability in AI models are vital for establishing trust and ensuring accountability. Consider an insurance company using generative AI to forecast claim amounts for its policyholders. When the policyholders receive the claim amounts, the insurer needs to be able to explain the reasoning behind how they were estimated, making transparency and explainability fundamental.
Due to the complex nature of AI algorithms, achieving explainability, while essential, can be challenging. 
However, organizations can invest in explainable AI techniques (e.g., data visualization or decision tree), provide thorough documentation and foster a culture of open communication about the AI decision-making processes. 
These efforts help demystify the inner workings of AI systems and promote a more responsible, transparent approach to AI deployment.
Safeguarding privacy
Privacy is another key consideration for responsible AI implementation. Imagine a healthcare organization leveraging generative AI to predict patient outcomes based on electronic health records. Protecting the privacy of individuals is a must-have, top priority. Generative AI can inadvertently reveal sensitive information or generate synthetic data resembling real individuals. 
To address privacy concerns, businesses can implement best practices like data anonymization, encryption and privacy-preserving AI techniques, such as differential privacy. Concurrently, organizations must remain compliant with data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Complying with regulatory requirements
Finally, the evolving regulatory landscape for AI technologies demands a robust governance framework that guides ethical and responsible AI deployment. 
Organizations can refer to resources like the European Union’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) AI Principles to help define AI policies and principles. Establishing cross-functional AI ethics committees and developing processes for monitoring and auditing AI systems help organizations stay ahead of regulatory changes. By adapting to changes in regulations and proactively addressing potential risks, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI practices. 
Responsible AI deployment
At Dell Technologies, we have articulated our ethical AI principles here. We know that responsible AI use plays a crucial role in an enterprise’s successful adoption of generative AI. To realize the extraordinary potential of generative AI, organizations must continuously improve and adapt their practices and address evolving ethical challenges like bias, fairness, explainability, transparency, privacy preservation and governance.

A Generative AI Upped Worker Productivity and Satisfaction—and the Lowest-Skilled Benefited Most



By Vanessa Bates Ramirez
April 26, 2023 







Since OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT last November, the buzz around generative AI has been steadily ramping up. Some are excited about its potential to transform the way we work, create, and live, while others are wary of the dangers it poses and the nefarious ways it can be used. We know that programs like Midjourney, DALL-E, and GPT-4 are enabling millions of people to generate images and text, but not many studies have dug into the impact these tools are having, be it positive or negative.
One such study was released this month. Titled “Generative AI at Work,” the paper, by teams from Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the first times researchers take a microscope to the way generative AI is actually affecting peoples’ jobs. The team looked at how employees of a Fortune 500 company were impacted by generative AI when they started using it as part of their day-to-day work.
Tell Me What to Say
The study followed 5,179 customer service agents at a large software firm (whose name wasn’t disclosed) over the course of a year. The employees, mostly based in the Philippines, were split into two groups; one was given access to an AI whose help they could choose to integrate into their work, while the other continued as usual.
The AI was trained on data from over 5,000 successful customer service interactions, likely in the form of recordings of high-performing employees having conversations with customers and resolving their issues. The AI then monitored customer interactions in real time and gave agents suggestions of what to say. The employees could choose to use the suggestions word for word, dismiss them altogether, or use a tweaked version.
The researchers looked at how long it took for agents to solve customers’ issues and how successfully they did so. The results? Good things all around.
For one, the AI enabled customer service agents to get through calls more quickly, resolve more customer complaints successfully, and even handle multiple customer calls at once. The agents using the AI resolved 13.8 percent more issues per hour than they’d been able to without the AI.
And that’s not all. Since the AI’s suggestions skewed towards helping agents be patient and empathetic with frustrated customers, the customers treated the agents better, losing their tempers and raising their voices less (it’s not pretty, but let’s be honest, we’ve all been there). As a result, the agents were happier and more satisfied with their work.
Closing the Skills Gap?
Perhaps not surprisingly, the AI was the most helpful for the least-skilled workers and those who had been with the company for the shortest time. Meanwhile, the highest-skilled and most experienced agents didn’t benefit much from using the AI. This makes sense, since the tool was trained on conversations from these workers; they already know what they’re doing.
“High-skilled workers may have less to gain from AI assistance precisely because AI recommendations capture the knowledge embodied in their own behaviors,” said study author Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab.
The AI enabled employees with only two months of experience to perform as well as those who’d been in their roles for six months. That’s some serious skill acceleration. But is it “cheating”? Are the employees using the AI skipping over valuable first-hand training, missing out on learning by doing? Would their skills grind to a halt if the AI were taken away, since they’ve been repeating its suggestions rather than thinking through responses on their own?
It’s possible that an over-reliance on the tool could be detrimental to employees’ ability to build up and retain skills. But ideally they are learning by doing, just in a faster way, since they’re skipping over the drudgery of many unpleasant interactions with angry customers.
Where does this leave high-skilled employees, though? If their work is being used to train AIs that then freely give their skills to inexperienced employees, that could create issues around fairness and compensation. If you’ve been honing your soothing one-liners for years then a newbie comes in saying all the same things by month two on the job, you’re not going to be thrilled—especially if you’re not getting paid a lot more than the newbie.
Generating More Than Words
Finally, since the AI was essentially training newer employees, their managers didn’t need to spend as much time training them—and more of their time was thus freed up. That means managers could take on bigger teams, which means the company could ultimately hire more employees (if it’s selling enough of its products) and do more business. It seems this particular “generative AI” generated a lot more than just conversation suggestions: it generated employee satisfaction, skill acquisition, and free time.
Will the same hold true for other scenarios where these tools are implemented? Could be, but they should be introduced with caution and oversight nonetheless, as there are likely many secondary effects generative AI could have on a workplace that wouldn’t become apparent right away, and may not be wholly positive.
“We need far more research here,” said Brynjolfsson. “The impact of AI on productivity may vary over time, and adding these tools to the office could require complementary organizational investments, skills development, and business process redesign. And AI systems may impact worker and customer satisfaction, attrition, and patterns of behavior. There’s so much we don’t know.”

7 generative AI challenges that businesses should consider


The promise of revolutionary, content-generating AI models has a flip side: the perils of misuse, algorithmic bias, technical complexity and workforce restructuring.

Published: 27 Apr 2023


 
The mainstreaming of generative AI offers here-and-now-capabilities, the promise of future advances -- and more than a few pitfalls.
This form of artificial intelligence technology hit its stride in 2022 with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Dall-E 2. Those tools, and successors such as Google's Bard, make high-quality, AI-generated content an everyday reality. Each of those products is built on a language model, a type of machine learning model honed on massive amounts of training data.







Users can now tap AI models for a range of content creation chores: Text, image, video, audio and synthetic data are all in the mix. But the potential benefits of the technology come at some cost. Here are seven generative AI challenges business leaders should take into account.

1. Handling technical complexity
Generative AI models may contain billions or even trillions of parameters, making them a complex undertaking for the typical business.
""These models are impractically large to train for most organizations,"" said Arun Chandrasekaran, vice president, analyst, tech innovation, at Gartner. The necessary compute resources can make this technology expensive and ecologically unfriendly, he said, so most near-term adoption will likely see businesses consuming generative AI through cloud APIs with limited tuning.
The difficulty in creating models leads to another issue: the concentration of power in a few, deep-pocketed entities, Chandrasekaran added.


2. Tackling legacy systems
Incorporating generative AI into older technology environments could raise additional issues for enterprises. IT leaders will face decisions on whether to integrate or replace older systems.

19 of the best large language models in 2024




For example, financial institutions considering how a language model could be used to determine fraud will probably find the emerging technology at odds with how its current systems handle that task, said Pablo Alejo, partner at consultancy West Monroe.
Legacy systems ""have a very specific way of doing that, and now you've got generative AI that's leveraging way different types of thinking,"" Alejo explained. ""Organizations have to find new ways to either create integrations or adopt new capabilities, with new technologies, that enable them to reach the same outputs, or outcomes, faster and more effectively.""



Generative AI technology will engage enterprises across their core aspects.







3. Avoiding technical debt
Generative AI could end up joining legacy systems as technical debt if businesses fail to achieve significant change through its adoption.
An enterprise deploying AI models for customer support might declare an optimization victory on the grounds that human agents will handle fewer cases. But workload reduction isn't going far enough, according to Bill Bragg, CIO at enterprise AI SaaS provider SymphonyAI. A business would need to significantly reduce the number of agents in front-line support roles to justify the investment in AI, he noted.
""If you don't take something away, how have you optimized?"" Bragg said. ""All you've done is add more debt to your processes.""


4. Reshaping some of the workforce
Generative AI will likely restructure how work gets done in many fields, a prospect that raises job-loss concerns. An article on the Chinese video game industry states job opportunities for artists are vanishing as companies employ AI-based image generators.



If you don't have a team working on how to understand [generative AI's] capability and take advantage of it, you are risking obsolescence.


Pablo AlejoPartner at West Monroe




But some executives suggest it's not all doom and gloom. AI might reduce the number of agents in the customer support example, but the technology would also create other roles, Bragg said. A business would need staff to oversee and improve the AI-assisted customer experience, he reasoned. Employees who once fielded customer questions on slow laptops would instead drive the next data and technical improvements. Bragg referred to this transition as ""going from the doer to the trainer.""
Similarly, Alejo said generative AI will remove some types of jobs but also ""open up brand new types of jobs that those same people can take advantage of.""


5. Monitoring for potential misuse and AI hallucinations
AI models lower the cost of content creation. That helps businesses but also helps threat actors who can more easily modify existing content to create deep fakes. Digitally altered media can closely mimic the original and be hyperpersonalized. ""This includes everything from voice and video impersonation to fake art, as well as targeted attacks,"" Chandrasekaran said.
While threat actors are able to misuse generative AI systems, the models themselves can lead users astray: AI hallucinations provide misinformation and make up ""facts."" Hallucination rates, depending on the domain, could be 10% to 20% of the AI tools' responses, Chandrasekaran added.





6. Keeping tabs on legal concerns and algorithmic bias
The emerging technology can also bump into intellectual property issues, exposing businesses to legal action. ""Generative AI models have the added risk of seeking training data at massive scale, without considering the creator's approval, which could lead to copyright issues,"" Chandrasekaran said.
Algorithmic bias is another source of legal risk. Generative AI models, when trained on faulty, incomplete or unrepresentative data, will produce results that are systemically prejudiced. Unchecked, AI bias spreads through the systems and influences decision-makers relying on the results, potentially leading to discrimination.
Flawed AI models ""can propagate downstream bias in the data sets, and the homogenization of such models can lead to a single point of failure,"" Chandrasekaran said.


7. Providing coordination and oversight
Newer technologies often compel organizations to launch centers of excellence (CoE) to focus on effective adoption and rollout. Such centers could play an important role in generative AI.
""If you don't have a team working on how to understand this capability and take advantage of it, you are risking obsolescence,"" Alejo warned. ""Centers of excellence should be existing across every industry, across every organization.""
Such a specialized group can also craft policies for governing the acceptable use of generative AI. ""The CoE,"" Alejo advised, ""should lead policy design and decisions for how different individuals across an organization can use it."" The center, he added, should enlist the review and input of key stakeholders, including legal, IT, risk and, potentially, other departments such as marketing, HR and R&D.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



“AI is already transforming business, and generative AI has not only captured the world’s attention, but it also represents an important tipping point in bringing this powerful technology to everyone,” Joe Atkinson, chief products and technology officer at PwC, told VentureBeat. “We believe that AI, used in a responsible and trusted way, will revolutionize how we all live and work. This is why we decided to invest $1 billion over the next three years to expand and scale our artificial intelligence offerings.”
The investment will enhance the company’s internal platforms, incorporating an all-new generative AI environment that will streamline the firm’s tax, audit and consulting services.
Just last month, PwC’s global legal practice announced that it is embracing the OpenAI-based Harvey application, which helps automate and enhance various aspects of legal and tax work for clients. 
PwC has already hit the ground running, implementing advanced capabilities within Azure OpenAI Service for clients across an array of industries, from insurance to aviation, healthcare and beyond. 
Recently, the company built a custom generative language model for a pharmaceutical company that automated its drafting of safety narratives and claims that this solution resulted in over 50% savings in end-to-end processing time, enabling clinicians to focus on higher-value work.
“We are excited that PwC will utilize Azure OpenAI Service to transform the way they work, and to deliver innovative customer solutions that take advantage of the world’s most advanced AI models, backed by Azure’s trusted enterprise-grade capabilities and AI-optimized infrastructure,” said Eric Boyd, corporate vice president, AI platform at Microsoft, in a written statement. “Our collaboration with PwC and OpenAI will be a game-changer that opens the floodgates for businesses to experience generative AI applications in a safe and secure manner.”
The ambitious plan also includes a major upskilling program for PwC’s 65,000 employees, allowing them to leverage the full potential of AI tools and capabilities through the company’s proprietary My+ program.
PwC’s generative AI focus
PwC’s Atkinson said that the company is proactively working with Microsoft to implement Microsoft 365’s generative AI capabilities as they become available. 
“We believe generative AI has the potential to transform virtually every aspect of how work gets done,” Atkinson told VentureBeat. “We are building AI for ourselves and clients in a secure, enterprise environment on Azure OpenAI, and we are leveraging our responsible AI framework to ensure that we do this with sufficient focus on bias, ethical use and data privacy and to adapt to changing regulations.” advertisement
The company is now taking a bold leap forward, using generative AI to revolutionize how it serves clients. It claims that the technology is already yielding impressive results, saving time and costs while accelerating revenue growth for its clients. 
“We recently applied AI to an auto insurer’s claim estimation process and helped them realize 29% efficiency savings,” Atkinson explained. “We have also worked with a Fortune 500 telecom company to develop end-to-end data and analytic modeling to improve their tech support call center experience. Our work yielded an estimated Year 1 saving of $18 million with 2% revenue acceleration for the client.”
Talking about the upskilling program, he said that nurturing its talent through AI is integral to PwC’s current vision, and the company recognizes that the best way to ensure that its teams continue to deliver exceptional work is by equipping them with cutting-edge technology and expertise. advertisement
“Providing our team with a better understanding of AI, its continued evolution, and how it can be applied in trusted and responsible ways will be key to helping solve our clients’ most complex problems while at the same time helping our people grow professionally throughout their career,” Atkinson said.  
Streamlining business workflows through responsible AI 
While AI presents immense opportunities, it is also fraught with risks, and proper governance is crucial in mitigating these risks. PwC believes that tapping into the power of AI technology — in a responsible and trusted way — will be a key challenge for businesses across every sector and geography.  
New data from the company’s latest Trust Survey paints a fascinating picture of the current state of affairs in the tech world. The survey reveals that almost every business leader is investing in AI-related initiatives and systems in the short term, signaling a clear trend toward the integration of AI in various industries.
However, upon closer examination of the report it becomes evident that a mere 35% of executives have intentions to prioritize the improvement of governance for AI systems and reporting on AI model performance.
“Across the portfolio of services we provide our clients, we believe AI holds the power to create greater efficiency, to improve quality, and to unlock our people’s capacity, freeing them from more routine tasks and allowing them to focus on creating the value and trust our clients and stakeholders expect,” Atkinson said. “Helping our clients understand and apply this technology — not just with point solutions, but at enterprise scale — will help create competitive differentiation for organizations and help them manage their businesses more efficiently.”
In 2019, the company made waves with the launch of its Responsible AI toolkit, offering clients a customizable suite of resources to help them adopt ethical and responsible AI practices. PwC’s framework for responsible AI is centered around promoting governance and accountability for clients as they develop and deploy OpenAI’s cutting-edge generative AI technology for various use cases.
“Responsible AI at its core is good data science, governed by key guiding principles from strategy to execution,” he said. “Our Responsible AI (RAI) team helps clients build AI their stakeholders can trust from wherever they are on their AI journey.”
He emphasized that It is essential for every organization to align on an ethical AI framework and create a responsible-use policy. 
“Transparency and trust are critical to the application of any technology, but it is particularly true with AI,” he said. “The guardrails should extend beyond good intentions and policy statements — they must align on practices and actions that serve the organization and their constituents, not only in their current state, but as the technology continues to evolve.”
An AI-driven future
Atkinson believes that over the longer term, every industry will be transformed by the continued advances in AI.
“Every company will face decisions on how quickly to embrace and adopt these technologies, and they’ll face the challenges of doing that responsibly. PwC is uniquely positioned to help,” he said. 
He believes that empowering professionals to harness the full potential of emerging technologies, such as generative AI, will be the key to driving innovation and achieving organizational goals. 
“While AI will likely impact every role in some way, we believe that with the right skills and tools, the advance of these powerful technologies will create more opportunities not just for companies, but for their people,” he said. ”By unlocking the capacity of these technologies, professionals across all roles can perform their duties more effectively, paving the way for continued growth and career advancement.”

Generative AI has become the proverbial monkey wrench in the technology plans for executives who look to keep their organizations on the cutting edge. With tech companies offering full automation of various accounting processes, banking as a service (BaaS) to vendors and their customers, and even unprecedented cybersecurity initiatives, technology’s role within corporate finance becomes even more ambiguous with the emergence of technologies like ChatGPT. The value of the human element is in question now more than ever before, leading CFOs to inquire what types of benefits this type of technology can bring to their business.



















Most leaders are still learning the basics of generative AI technology. Even Google’s CEO said no one fully understands how ChatGPT works. Despite this, the notion is clear — executives want generative technology in their businesses, or at least don’t want to be the only ones without it. Whether it’s a legitimate interest in the technology or fear of missing out (FOMO), new data from a KPMG survey of 300 global executives say that nearly two-thirds (65%) of executives say this type of technology will have a high impact on their company in 3-5 years. Balancing Technology and Risk ManagementTechnology’s role, like any business investment, must be evaluated in part by the risks it brings with it. While nearly three-quarters (72%) of executives believe generative AI can play a critical role in building and maintaining stakeholder trust, nearly half (45%) say it can have a negative impact on their organization’s trust should commensurate risk management tools not be implemented. “Generative AI, like many technologies, creates great opportunities for organizations,” said KPMG U.S. trusted imperative leader Emily Frolick. “However, the ease of use and open nature of generative AI amplifies the risk. As organizations are exploring potential use cases, giving attention to the risks or exposures associated with generative AI should be equally prioritized.” Generative AI, like many technologies, creates great opportunities for organizations ... However, the ease of use and open nature of generative AI amplifies the risk. — Emily Frolick, KPMGThe risks associated with this type of technology can be extensive. Such risks include unpredictability in implementation, potential cybersecurity breach exposure, and company morale around those who are worried about generative AI’s impact on their roles and overall job security. CFOs, much like the employees who will be using generative AI, must learn how this type of technology can improve their skills, not replace them.

Development of AI GovernanceAI Governance — a set of rules, regulations, and ethical considerations that guide the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems — is being incorporated at an extremely low level. Many executives don’t have a plan to attempt to control its use in their workflows.According to KPMG, only 5% of executives say their companies have an AI governance protocol in place. While nearly half (49%) say they have plans to develop these guidelines, they have yet to do so. Executives who are looking to implement may want to create an oversight committee to manage AI’s use within the early stages. These initiatives may come with time, data suggests. According to the KPMG, more than a quarter (27%) say they do not currently see a need or have not reached enough scale that would call for the development of a responsible AI governance program.  Social Interactions at Work May FadeWhile workforces that adapt this type of technology will hybridize the human and AI elements together in some roles, executives are aware of the various impacts — some positive, some negative — it will have outside of the workflows it is attempting to improve.  According to surveyors, executives are most optimistic about the opportunities generative technology will have on how work is completed. The majority said it will increase productivity (72%) while two-thirds (66%) said it will change the way people work. Over six in 10 (62%) also said these technologies will encourage innovation in their workforce. The unclear aspects are the areas in which ChatGPT has a small direct impact. Almost four in 10 executives (39%) believe generative AI could lead to decreased social interactions and human connections between employees. With companies trying hard to get their employees to want to return to the office and have fun at work, generative AI may alienate some staff, countering the cultural effort.

A study of a generative AI system used by 5,000 customer support agents found that those workers experienced an increase in productivity and retention, and a reduction in stress. But the workers who gained the most from this automation were newer and less experienced. 







Customer service work is aptly suited for generative AI, according to this just-released study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research group based in Cambridge, Mass. 
Customer support is a stressful job. ""A key part of agents' jobs is to absorb customer frustrations while restraining one's own emotional reaction,"" the paper noted. But generative AI can act as an aide, using the customer's chats as input and providing suggestions for empathetic responses and problem solving in real time. The study found that the use of generative AI reduced the likelihood of customers wanting to escalate issues to a supervisor. 
The research paper's authors are Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the Stanford University Digital Economy Lab; Danielle Li, an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management; and Lindsey Raymond, a Ph.D. candidate at MIT Sloan. 
The company that allowed researchers to study the effects of generative AI on its contact center wasn't identified, other than as a Fortune 500 that provides business process software. Customer service work generally includes everything from product support to answering employee HR questions. 



It's too soon to start making conclusions about where this will have an impact and how big that impact will be.


David CreelmanCEO, Creelman Research




The increase in productivity -- nearly 14% -- wasn't surprising to industry analysts, but it also has limits. 
David Creelman, CEO of Creelman Research in Toronto, cautioned against putting too much weight on one study. ""It's too soon to start making conclusions about where this will have an impact and how big that impact will be,"" he said.
""But it does seem reasonable to expect that it'll be easier to get these new technologies to do an average job than it will be to get them to do an excellent job,"" he added. ""This means that new or lower-performing employees who are doing an average or below-average job are more at risk than those who are doing an excellent job.""
He compared generative AI to a grammar checker, which helps someone avoid errors, ""but it won't make you a great writer. ""
The study also stated, ""the AI tool we study is meant to augment -- rather than replace -- human agents."" 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects customer service representatives to decline by 4% through 2031 because of automation. 
Ian Jacobs, a research director at Forrester Research, said the consultancy expects generative AI to increase customer team productivity. But the technology is ""not yet automating away most human-to-human interactions,"" he said, pointing to its accuracy problem. 
""The biggest boon for productivity from generative AI today comes from augmenting the humans who actually serve customers,"" Jacobs said. ""Agent augmentation is the name of the game right now.""
He said generative AI can summarize a body of text effectively, saving agents time and letting them move on to their next calls. 
Ben Eubanks, chief research officer at Lighthouse Research & Advisory, said he believes generative AI ""will make HR better and faster, just like chatbots have done.""
Generative AI plus humans can help with tier-one support requests, which are routine, common and straightforward. He said the more complex tier-two requests, which are specialized, unique and unexpected, will need to be addressed by HR professionals.

Most of us use tools like search engines (Google or Siri) to make our research efforts more effective. Modern AI will only increase the ways technology can augment our abilities. For example, if you have writer’s block or struggle with how to frame a topic you need to write about, an AI like ChatGPT can help you get started. Provided it has been given good information, AI tools synthesize exponentially more information than most of us can imagine before providing recommendations. You still need to review and customize the suggestions for relevance, accuracy, plagiarism, specificity, incorporating your viewpoint, etc. Humans are needed to review and apply the results. The tools improve performance in areas that are not natural strengths.Similar to the calculator example – where humans can make calculations, but it is accepted that a calculator does it faster and more accurately – AI tools reduce or improve the outcomes of repeatable processes or tasks.For example, DALL·E 2, another AI tool, creates “original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles,” according to its website. The benefits of it include the visual expression of what users are thinking – i.e., it can bring a unique or novel idea to life visually. Previously, if you were not an artist or a graphic designer, your options to create a visual representation would require partnership with an artist to create your idea. But now, the tool is accessible to anyone who has a computer and it's not limited to those who have an artist on staff.“As artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT become more powerful and widely available, they will likely affect labor market outcomes. Depending on the roles and industries, we can expect algorithms to either complement workers’ competencies and increase their productivity or reduce the employability of humans altogether,” notes the Brookings Institution. Roles that include manual processes that can be easily automated will be at risk (and have been for a while now). For example, if you work at a bank and your primary role is taking deposits, digital banking will continue to decrease the number of tellers needed. However, if you are responsible for relationship management with customers, product and service recommendations for their unique banking needs, and resolving problems that are not typical, your role will only get better with automation, which can send reminders to contact people, include customized product recommendations and more. With the recent advancements in writing and visual representation brought about by ChatGPT and DALL·E 2, roles that involve research, writing summaries or templates, or creating visual designs will decline. But roles that require insights and interpretation after reviewing research summaries or weaving visual ideas together to make a campaign or create a persuasive presentation, will increase. Engineers will continue to flourish, but so will the roles that incorporate, interpret, analyze and customize the output of AI technology.The future of work has ample opportunity, provided workers embrace a growth mindset toward where technology can take us.

Job seekers with AI-boosted resumes more likely to be hired

Why It Matters		



Algorithmic writing assistance can help new job seekers find and fix spelling, grammatical, and usage errors in their resumes. Employers approve, research shows.

New job applicants who were randomly assigned algorithmic assistance with their resumes — that is, received help from an interface that offered suggestions to improve spelling and grammar — were 8% more likely to be hired, according to an experiment conducted by MIT Sloan PhD student Emma van Inwegen and co-researchers.

“If you take two identical workers with the same skills and background, the one with the better-written resume is more likely to get hired,” van Inwegen said. “The takeaway is that employers actually care about the writing in the resume — it’s not just a correlation.” That means that AI assistance can be a useful tool for those hoping to get hired, she said.
The results were summarized in a working paper titled “Algorithmic Writing Assistance on Jobseekers’ Resumes Increases Hires,” which was co-authored by MIT Sloan PhD student Zanele Munyikwa and MIT Sloan professor John J. Horton.
More offers and higher wages
To examine how the quality of writing on a resume affects hiring, the researchers studied new users participating in a global online labor market for contract work.
The researchers studied 480,948 job seekers who first signed on to the marketplace between June 8 and July 14, 2021. In order of frequency, applicants’ primary job categories were design and creative, writing, administrative support, and software development.





7.80%


Share
























Job seekers who had algorithmic assistance in writing their resume received 7.8% more job offers than those with no help. 
While 14% of the job seekers were based in the U.S., more than 80% lived in a country where English is not the native language, including India and Bangladesh. The labor market’s primary language is English.
The researchers intercepted job seekers at the resume-writing stage of the sign-up process and randomly offered half of them algorithmic writing assistance; the other half filled in the resume section of the site without assistance.
Applicants in the treatment group were presented with a tool that offered suggestions for fixing spelling and grammatical errors and gave advice on punctuation, word usage, phrase overuse, tone, and style.
Van Inwegen and her co-authors found that job applicants who had algorithmic assistance received 7.8% more job offers and were more likely to be hired in their first month on the platform than the unassisted control group.
And those with assistance earned wages that were 8.4% higher than the control group’s, making $18.62 per hour on average versus $17.17 per hour for those who had received no resume help.
Errors that turn employers off 
The researchers also explored the types of resume writing errors that are most likely to harm applicants’ chances.
Spelling, which the authors called “the most unambiguous measure of writing quality,” topped the list.
Job seekers with more than 99% of the words in their resume spelled correctly were hired nearly three times more in their first month on the platform than those with fewer than 90% spelled correctly. Applicants with fewer than 90% of the words in their resume spelled correctly had only a 3% chance of getting hired in their first month.





3%


Share
























Applicants with fewer than 90% of the words in their resume spelled correctly had only a 3% chance of getting hired in their first month. 
Job seekers whose resumes included commonly confused words and errors in capitalization, grammar, and typography were also less likely to receive job offers.
But when it came to style errors, specifically “flowery language” — for example, “I will give a task my 100% focus and attention and will only be satisfied once the implementation of the project is finished to your standards or higher” — employers were more forgiving. In fact, they actually preferred this type of language and tended to hire job seekers who used it.
“This implies that despite employers’ dislike of most writing errors, they forgive or even prefer this kind of flowery language,” the researchers write.
Controlling for quality 
Concerned that candidates with newly improved resumes may change their job-search behavior and skew the results of the study, the researchers compared the job-search strategies of the assisted group with the nonassisted control group.
“We find no evidence that job seekers changed their search behavior due to the treatment,” they write in their paper. “Treated workers did not send out more applications than workers in the control group, nor did they propose higher wages.
And knowing that employers often use resume writing as a “signaling tool” for the quality of a worker’s overall abilities, van Inwegen and her co-authors were curious to see whether employers ended up feeling less satisfied with the quality of the work performed by people whose resumes were burnished by algorithmic assistance.
The researchers found no evidence that employers were less satisfied with the assisted workers’ services, based on post-work employer ratings or reviews and ongoing demand for their work on the online market.
AI throughout the hiring process
For job seekers, the message is clear: It’s worth taking the extra time to eliminate spelling and grammatical errors and present a higher-quality resume. Algorithmic writing assistance may be a more affordable option than hiring a writer to help, said van Inwegen. “It scales cheaply, and it’s available to the masses,” she said.
Writing help from an algorithm can be especially useful for non-native English speakers applying for jobs, according to the researchers. For example, it could help a skilled coder who lives in Bangladesh and struggles with English spelling and grammar.

“This type of intervention has the potential to level the playing field for applicants who otherwise may not be able to present themselves as well to English-speaking employers,” van Inwegen said.
Employers, too, could benefit; clearer writing would allow them to better identify applicants’ skills, leading a wider pool of qualified applicants from which to hire. “We argue that better writing makes it easier for employers to decide to hire a particular worker,” the researchers write.
Companies could also use algorithmic writing assistance themselves to improve the hiring process. For instance, they could put AI to work writing job descriptions or generating interview questions.
“Employers could use it throughout the hiring process,” van Inwegen said, “and that could potentially make them a more attractive employer.” It’s an area for future research, she added.

LSTMs are long short-term memory networks that use (ANN) artificial neural networks in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. In contrast to normal feed-forward neural networks, also known as recurrent neural networks, these networks feature feedback connections. Unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, robot control, video gaming, speech recognition, machine translation, and healthcare are all applications of LSTM.
What is LSTM?
LSTMs Long Short-Term Memory is a type of RNNs Recurrent Neural Network that can detain long-term dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs are able to process and analyze sequential data, such as time series, text, and speech. They use a memory cell and gates to control the flow of information, allowing them to selectively retain or discard information as needed and thus avoid the vanishing gradient problem that plagues traditional RNNs. LSTMs are widely used in various applications such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.

What is RNN?
RNNs Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that are designed to process sequential data. They can analyze data with a temporal dimension, such as time series, speech, and text. RNNs can do this by using a hidden state passed from one timestep to the next. The hidden state is updated at each timestep based on the input and the previous hidden state. RNNs are able to capture short-term dependencies in sequential data, but they struggle with capturing long-term dependencies.
Types of Gates in LSTM
There are three types of gates in an LSTM: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. 
The input gate controls the flow of information into the memory cell. The forget gate controls the flow of information out of the memory cell. The output gate controls the flow of information out of the LSTM and into the output.
Three gates input gate, forget gate, and output gate are all implemented using sigmoid functions, which produce an output between 0 and 1. These gates are trained using a backpropagation algorithm through the network.
The input gate decides which information to store in the memory cell. It is trained to open when the input is important and close when it is not.
The forget gate decides which information to discard from the memory cell. It is trained to open when the information is no longer important and close when it is. 
The output gate is responsible for deciding which information to use for the output of the LSTM. It is trained to open when the information is important and close when it is not.
The gates in an LSTM are trained to open and close based on the input and the previous hidden state. This allows the LSTM to selectively retain or discard information, making it more effective at capturing long-term dependencies.
Structure of LSTM
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is a type of RNN recurrent neural network that is capable of handling and processing sequential data. The structure of an LSTM network consists of a series of LSTM cells, each of which has a set of gates (input, output, and forget gates) that control the flow of information into and out of the cell. The gates are used to selectively forget or retain information from the previous time steps, allowing the LSTM to maintain long-term dependencies in the input data.

The LSTM cell also has a memory cell that stores information from previous time steps and uses it to influence the output of the cell at the current time step. The output of each LSTM cell is passed to the next cell in the network, allowing the LSTM to process and analyze sequential data over multiple time steps.
Applications of LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a highly effective Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that has been utilized in various applications. Here are a few well-known LSTM applications:

Language Simulation: Language support vector machines (LSTMs) have been utilized for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and text summarization. By understanding the relationships between words in a sentence, they can be trained to construct meaningful and grammatically correct sentences.
Voice Recognition: LSTMs have been utilized for speech recognition tasks such as speech-to-text-to-text-transcription and command recognition. They may be taught to recognize patterns in speech and match them to the appropriate text.
Sentiment Analysis: LSTMs can be used to classify text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral by learning the relationships between words and their associated sentiments.
Time Series Prediction: LSTMs can be used to predict future values in a time series by learning the relationships between past values and future values.
Video Analysis: LSTMs can be used to analyze video by learning the relationships between frames and their associated actions, objects, and scenes.
Handwriting Recognition: LSTMs can be used to recognize handwriting by learning the relationships between images of handwriting and the corresponding text.

Explainer

 We missed this earlier: Can a person claim copyright over an AI-generated work? That’s the question Dr. Stephen Thaler asked in a recent lawsuit.
Thaler’s Creativity Machine AI—which he created—produced a piece of art called “A Recent Entrance to Paradise”. In 2018, Thaler applied to the United States Copyright Office to claim copyright over the AI-generated work. But, the copyright office repeatedly refused to grant this request—stating that copyright could only apply to “human-made work”.

The suit followed in June 2022. Thaler disagreed, arguing that the agency had misread the purpose of US copyright laws, which would arguably protect AI-generated works. In January 2023, Thaler asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the copyright office’s decision, or allow the AI-generated work to be registered for copyright.
Why it matters: “Allowing copyright on AI-Generated Works encourages the development and use of creative AI which results in the generation of more works, and provides incentives for those works to be disseminated,” Thaler added in his petition. Paying attention to Thaler’s arguments may be necessary, especially with creative AI tools churning out more “original work” that could post legal challenges in the future. 
Thaler had previously moved the United States Supreme Court to overthrow a lower court’s ruling that patents can only be issued to human inventors, and not to the DABUS AI system he’d created. The Court declined to hear the suit last week. 
What did Thaler argue?
The copyright of this “fixed, visual artwork” would have been protected had it been created by traditional human labour: The copyright office’s refusal is based on the idea that the “creations of human authors” alone can be protected by copyright. 
Creativity Machine meets minimum standards for copyright protection: AI can’t create objectively creative or original work, the copyright office added. Thaler rebutted that the bar here is low—the only thing a work requires for copyright protection is for it to be original to an author. Here, original means that the author independently created a work with at least a “minimal” level of creativity. 
On facts alone, the AI system created a piece of art that meets these originality standards, Thaler argues. The artwork’s “origin” is the Creativity Machine system, and it also produced the work, satisfying “the small hurdle required to reach copyrightability”.
Copyright Act isn’t specific that creators should be human: The Copyright Act’s language never explicitly suggests that the author of a work should be a human being. According to Thaler, this means that the entity generating a creative work is its author—an entity could be a person, business, or machine. Just because courts typically refer to creative work in “human-centric terms” doesn’t mean that there’s a legal requirement for it. So, creative works that are uniquely produced by their creators are subject to copyright unless explicitly restricted by a law. 
Outdated precedents can’t be used to inhibit technology: The copyright office wrongly and “grandiosely” uses centuries-old court verdicts to argue that AI can’t be protected by copyright, Thaler argued, wrily adding that some of the cases it cited are from the 19th century which “greatly predate[s] even the invention of the first modern computers”.

Courts themselves realise that technology complicates copyright law: The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that copyright law needs to be balanced against technological advancements, Thaler added. It’s necessary to examine how the copyright law’s purpose can be best achieved with technological innovations—like AI-generated pieces of work. 
Ergo, AI-Generated work is constitutionally “required” to be protected by copyright law: The copyright office’s stance rewrites not just the Copyright Act, but the United States Constitution’s clauses on copyright, Thaler argues. 
What that means: the United States Constitution breathes life into the Copyright Act through its mandate promoting “the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries”. This mandate encourages creating and disseminating work to both the author’s and public’s benefit, argues Thaler citing past verdicts. 
Protecting AI works is in line with this mandate—especially given the court’s repeated reading that copyright stimulates “artistic creativity for the general public good”. Similar interpretations were followed by the United States Congress especially while drafting the Copyright Act during a time of technological transformation, the 1970s: 
The history of copyright law has been one of gradual expansion in the types of works accorded protection, and the subject matter affected by this expansion has fallen into two general categories. In the first, scientific discoveries and technological developments have made possible new forms of creative expression that never existed before. In some of these cases the new expressive forms– electronic music, filmstrips, and computer programs, for example- – could be regarded as an extension of copyrightable subject matter Congress had already intended to protect, and were thus considered copyrightable from the outset without the need of new legislation. In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures, statutory enactment was deemed necessary to give them full recognition as copyrightable works [Emphasis added]. — House of Representatives report cited in Thaler’s petition.

The copyright office interprets copyright regressively, unlike the Supreme Court: Thaler added that the Supreme Court has observed in copyright cases in the past that “[w]e must read the statutory language of 60 years ago in the light of drastic technological change.” Both the Court and US Congress have read the Copyright Act to increase the spectrum of copyrightable material under the Copyright Act—the copyright office’s narrow perspective flies in the face of this. 
The Court doesn’t need to “defer” to the copyright office’s stance: The US Supreme Court reviews any agency’s interpretations of law without deference, Thaler explains. So, if a body’s stance lacks “reasoned decisionmaking” it’s not necessarily entitled to being treated as unchallengeable by the Court. Or, as Thaler puts it in the context of the copyright office, “in this instance, relying on gilded age discussions of quasi-metaphysical creative sparks and dicta, in defiance of the agency’s mandate to promote the dissemination and generation of works, is not reasoned decisionmaking”.
Thaler owns Creativity Machine’s copyright under “common law” property principles: Thaler argued that the copyright office incorrectly held that the Creativity Machine’s hypothetical copyright cannot be transferred to him. He cites the “doctrine of increase”—where the output of any work owned by Thaler automatically belongs to him. So, in this case, if Thaler’s AI makes a painting, then Thaler owns that painting too. Or, as the petition illustrates:
For instance, if Dr. Thaler owned a fruit tree, he would own the fruit from that tree. This does not require the tree to execute a written agreement to transfer the fruit, the fruit belongs to Dr. Thaler by virtue of his relationship to the tree.
Thaler has “first possession” rights: Another important concept in common law, this means that “the first person to possess an object is its owner”. In short: finders, keepers. So, Thaler owns the copyright over the painting simply by virtue of being the first person to possess it. “Dr. Thaler possesses the machine, owns the machine, developed the machine, operated the machine, possesses the Work, and possesses every indica of ownership of the Work,” the suit notes. “In its possession he holds more than just the digital copy, but also the rights to the copyright embodied within it as well, certainly as to anyone who could bring a lawsuit to challenge him.”
The AI was ‘working’ for Thaler: Even if the Court agrees with the copyright office’s stance that copyright cannot be owned by AI, Thaler argues that the property initially vests in the party that employed the AI. Created and controlled by Thaler, Creativity Machine only works at Thaler’s command, making it “unquestionable” that he was the “person for whom the work was prepared”. Therefore, within the scope of the Work for Hire doctrine, Creativity Machine was acting as an employee. Ergo, Thaler owns the copyright.

Most of the respondents in the survey believe that their career progression will be hindered if they do not acquire skills in artificial intelligence (AI). The survey was conducted among 3,050 respondents, comprising young professionals in the technology space and students with an interest in technology, between March 24 and April 10.  The survey also revealed that 59 per cent of Indians perceive AI as a combination of both opportunities and threats, with 11 per cent seeing it as a significant threat that could lead to job displacement and increased competition. The perceived threat level is even higher among students, at 40 per cent, compared to working professionals at 36 per cent,  the Digit survey said. The survey found that 67 per cent of participants were highly familiar with generative tools like ChatGPT, with 23 per cent reporting moderate familiarity and only 10 per cent indicating no familiarity at all. According to the survey, 75 per cent of respondents believed that their career growth would be impeded if they did not learn about AI, machine learning and other related fields.  Although there are concerns about the potential risks of AI, the opportunities for growth and innovation are enormous. Digit is thrilled to demonstrate the power of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, by creating an entire issue of our magazine using this cutting-edge technology.  We are excited to witness how AI will continue to transform the way we work and learn,  Digit's parent firm 9.9 Group founder and director Vikas Gupta said. The survey found that 62 per cent of Indians recognise the significant role of AI in personalised and accelerated learning processes through targeted feedback. It also revealed that respondents believe the Indian education system should prioritise the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills (54 per cent), establish strong foundations in digital literacy (49 per cent), integrate AI-related subjects into the curriculum (46 per cent) and encourage interdisciplinary learning to foster adaptability (30 per cent) to better prepare students for a future that includes AI.",,Tech,"{'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'PTI'}",2023-04-29T17:14:00+05:30,2023-04-29T17:11:00+05:30,Threat perception of job loss from AI higher among students: Survey,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-99870484,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-71074,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}",,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/threat-perception-of-job-loss-from-ai-higher-among-students-survey/articleshow/99870484.cms,,,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/threat-perception-of-job-loss-from-ai-higher-among-students-survey/articleshow/99870484.cms,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Economic Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,N/A,N/A,"iStockThe threat perception of job loss due to artificial intelligence is higher among technology-inclined students compared to working professionals, a survey by Digit Research Lab said on Friday.

Addressing hundreds of participants at this year’s summit underway in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, Kagame said that transforming Africa means digitizing the continent’s economies. ALSO READ: Kagame in Zimbabwe for Transform Africa Summit “Already many of the new quality jobs being created in Africa are powered by technology and connectivity. That applies even to traditional sectors like Agriculture, mining and retail” Kagame told a packed hall at Elephant Hills Resort, adding that the trend is “only going to speed up.” At the summit, he was also joined by several Heads of State including host President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Lazarus Chakwera of Malawi, His Majesty King Mswati III of the Kingdom of Eswatini, and Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia, among other high-ranked officials. To step up digital transformation on the continent, Kagame said that everyone has to be connected to affordable broadband and also be able to have a smart device. Mobile broadband penetration has been spreading rapidly, but more than 60 percent of Africans who have access don’t use it. We need to also keep reducing costs, Kagame urged participants. ALSO READ: Kagame: Broadband progress should serve as demonstration of possibilities Equally troubling, he said, is that a big piece of the puzzle is digital skill and literacy. “One reason many Africans are not taking full advantage of the internet is that they are not yet comfortable with the interface or sometimes the language barrier factor.” According to President Kagame other bottlenecks include digital identity and cyber security as well as continental integration such as the African Continental Free Trade Area or the One Africa network. “We need to make digital identities of individuals and businesses portable across borders while using technology to reduce barriers to trade.” “All of this is within our power to achieve. We just need to move faster with a sense of urgency.” Embracing AI is key President Kagame also urged African leaders to open their doors and explore the potential that artificial intelligence can have in critical sectors like agriculture, health and education. “This powerful technology has made headlines in recent weeks, for the right reasons, at most. It is still unclear how it will affect existing jobs and what safety concerns there will be, but it is also already possible seeing that Africa has the most to gain.” ALSO READ: Rwanda to use artificial intelligence in disaster management This is because AI applications can narrow productivity gaps between African firms and their competitors on other continents. “We should therefore move quickly to embrace AI and make it work for us.” Kagame’s call comes just a few days after Rwanda adopted the national Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy, that among others aims to harness AI, digital and emerging technologies to support the country’s development goals (including sustainable and inclusive growth), become an ICT and Innovation Hub, and position Rwanda as a leader on the African and global stage. Africa lagging behind For Lacine Kone, Chief Executive at Smart Africa, despite digitization having a foothold in every sector in Africa, integration remains low on the continent. This, he said, calls for a collective effort to transition and transform Africa. According to Kone, this year’s summit, which also marks 10 years of Smart Africa Alliance existence, comes at a time when Africa needs to leapfrog emerging technologies such as AI applications. “10 years is a major milestone. Our celebration is not a festivity but an occasion to look back and look ahead at the mountains we must still climb. From seven founding members to 36 members representing 1,1 billion people, we are still growing.” For instance, he said, Africa, among other factors, remains the lowest in internet penetration at roughly 38 percent–less than 60 percent of the average. “This is not the Africa we want; we need to move faster. And the 4th industrial revolution allows us to. We must redesign ourselves for the challenge and opportunity Africa faces.”",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Edwin Ashimwe'}",2023-04-26T20:34:13+02:00,2023-04-26T18:44:34+02:00,Make Artificial Intelligence work for Africa – Kagame,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/04/26/17257.jpg'}",https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/04/26/17257.jpg,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/6978/news/technology/make-artificial-intelligence-work-for-africa-kagame,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/6978/news/technology/make-artificial-intelligence-work-for-africa-kagame'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The New Times', 'url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/', 'https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png', 'width': 270, 'height': 57}}",,News,N/A,N/A,,,,,,2023-04-26T18:44:34+02:00,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The New Times', 'url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/'}",,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
