From the development of writing, to Gutenberg’s printing press – which advanced the spread of knowledge to the masses and ushered in the enlightenment and scientific revolution – to the first programmable digital computer Colossus, the cost of reproducing and communicating information, or data, has fallen again and again. At the same time, tools for processing and making sense of large quantities of data have developed exponentially – with artificial intelligence (<abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>) representing the latest leap. In the same way that Gutenberg’s press ushered in a new era of growth, data-driven technologies such as <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> will underpin our future prosperity.</p><p>There is no doubt that machine learning and <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is already improving peoples’ lives, from intelligent personal assistants that can prepare us for changes in the weather, to systems that protect our money from criminals, or devices that offer medical advice from the comfort of our own home. And this is only the start; the potential of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is undeniable. Our next challenge will be to harness this technology to transform how we diagnose diseases, manufacture goods and build our homes.</p><p>Using advanced algorithmic techniques such as ‘deep learning’, <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> has the potential to solve complex problems fast, and in so doing, free up time and raise productivity. But we also need to make sure <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> benefits everyone in the UK, which is why – in addition to this Sector Deal – the government is establishing a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to advise on the ethical use of data, including for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>.</p><p>The huge global opportunity <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> presents is why the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future"" class=""govuk-link"">Industrial Strategy white paper</a> identified <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data as 1 of 4 Grand Challenges – in which the UK can lead the world for years to come.</p><p>The UK is well placed to do this. We are already home to some of the biggest names in the business such as Deepmind, Swiftkey and Babylon.</p><p>And it’s not just the established players – Kwiziq, Cleo and Mindtrace are examples of UK <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> startups leading the way in areas as diverse as education, personal finance and autonomous vehicles. Major established companies in the tech sector, but also increasingly beyond, are using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to tune up their operations and services.</p><p>To realise all the social and economic benefits, we will need a strong partnership between business, academia and government. This sector deal establishes the beginning of that partnership. It responds to the recommendations of the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Review, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk"" class=""govuk-link"">‘Growing the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Industry in the UK’</a>, led by Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti, which articulated how the government and industry can work together on skills, infrastructure and implement a longterm strategy for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the UK.</p><p>We need to be strategic and focused: recognising the increasing convergence of technologies and focusing on the areas where we can compete globally.</p><p>While robotics, a complementary technology to <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, was outside the scope of the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Review, recommendations on the robotics industry have been made in the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/2903012/16074728/RAS%20UK%20Strategy?version=1.0"" class=""govuk-link"">Robotics Review RAS 2020</a>, and in <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/made-smarter-review"" class=""govuk-link"">‘Made Smarter’</a>, a review on digitising the manufacturing industry. Moving forwards, identifying and making the most of these synergies will be crucial for success.</p><p>A revolution in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technology is already emerging. If we act now, we can lead it from the front. But if we ‘wait and see’ other countries will seize the advantage.

Their review, published in October 2017, engaged widely with businesses, academia, investors and other stakeholders on ways to boost the UK’s emerging <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> sector at home and across the world. It sets out proposals to improve the institutions that support <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the United Kingdom, to build a skilled workforce, and to stimulate access to data – collectively the lifeblood of any <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> business.</p><p>This Sector Deal reinforces the 5 foundations of the Industrial Strategy:</p><ul>\n  <li>ideas</li>\n  <li>people</li>\n  <li>infrastructure</li>\n  <li>business environment</li>\n  <li>places</li>\n</ul><p>It also draws on the government’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">Digital Strategy</a>, which focuses on reinforcing our strengths in telecoms, data and enterprise. A key ambition of the industrial strategy is for the UK to be the world’s most innovative economy – this Sector Deal aims to attract and retain both domestic and global <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> talent; deliver major upgrades to our digital and data infrastructure; ensure that the UK is the best place to start and grow an <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> business; and contribute to communities’ prosperity by spreading the benefits of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> across the country.</p><h3 id=""people-1"">People</h3><p>The Industrial Strategy has people at its core: it is focused on creating good jobs and greater earning power for all people in the UK. To do this, we must equip citizens for jobs shaped by next generation technology. Growing the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> industry in the UK outlined the fast-growing demand for expertise to develop and apply <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technologies, and proposed ways to increase the supply of skills at different levels. Building on these recommendations and the commitments in the Industrial Strategy and Digital Strategy to grow science, technology, engineering and maths (<abbr title=""science, technology, engineering and maths"">STEM</abbr>) and digital skills training, this Sector Deal sets out how the government, universities and industry will work together to greatly improve the supply of skills. It also sets out how we will attract the best, and most diverse, global <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> talent to the UK.</p><h3 id=""infrastructure-1"">Infrastructure</h3><p>Ensuring the UK has the right digital infrastructure – both physical and, crucially, data infrastructure – is critical to meeting our ambition of leading the world in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>. That is why, as part of our Industrial Strategy, we are investing over £1 billion to create a country with world class digital capabilities: from 5G mobile networks to full-fibre broadband. Equally important is the availability of data, which is required on a vast scale to train machine learning systems. The government and public bodies are already leading the way in making public datasets open and available. But there remain significant challenges to sharing private sector datasets. Through this Sector Deal, we will tackle both the practical and cultural barriers to sharing both publicly and privately held data. As part of this we will explore data sharing frameworks such as Data Trusts – mechanisms where parties have defined rights and responsibilities with respect to shared data – in order to protect sensitive data, facilitate access to data, and ensure accountability. This will allow and ensure fair and equitable data sharing between organisations in the private sector, and between the private and public sectors.</p><h3 id=""ideas-1"">Ideas</h3><p>The government set out a vision in the Industrial Strategy to make the UK the world’s most innovative economy. To achieve this, we are committing to work with the private sector to boost research and development (<abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr>) spending to 2.4% by 2027, and 3% over the longer term. This begins with a £725 million investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund competition, designed to capture the value of innovation by commercialising a great idea in the lab to a successful business. For example, one early commitment is our £210 million Challenge on research into the early diagnosis of chronic illness – including a substantial investment in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> diagnostics techniques<sup id=""fnref:2"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:2"" class=""govuk-link"" rel=""footnote"">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is central to this work, which includes programmes applying <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to raise output in sectors of the economy that have struggled with productivity, from reducing crop disease in the agriculture sector, to delivering services digitally in the public sector. We are seeing industry respond to our commitment to <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> innovation with investments in <abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr> in the UK, such as those from major players like Beyond Limits and Element <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>.</p><h3 id=""business-environment-1"">Business Environment</h3><p>Our intention is to be the best place to start and grow a business in the world. With a new business starting up every 75 seconds in the UK, and a massive increase in the finance available to knowledge-intensive and innovative firms – such as those developing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> – through the British Business Bank, we are in a strong starting position.</p><p>As at September 2017, over £350 million<sup id=""fnref:3"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:3"" class=""govuk-link"" rel=""footnote"">[footnote 3]</a></sup> has been invested in 243 technology companies through the British Business Bank’s venture capital programmes.</p><p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is emerging in its own right as a nascent industry with the potential to raise the productivity of diverse sectors and create entirely new jobs. To maximise this potential, this deal will establish a new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Council to bring together respected leaders in the field from across academia and industry; a new delivery body within the government – the Office for Artificial Intelligence – to support it; and a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. The deal will also increase promotion of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> businesses globally and take steps to attract <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> entrepreneurs to the UK. A recent report by Oxford Insights ranked the UK top for government readiness to implement <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, and these measures will allow us to capitalise on the UK’s worldclass <abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr> and tech entrepreneur base<sup id=""fnref:4"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:4"" class=""govuk-link"" rel=""footnote"">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id=""places-1"">Places</h3><p>The Industrial Strategy set out the goal of helping communities prosper throughout the UK. Growing the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> industry in the UK outlined the thriving <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> ecosystem that already exists. London is the European capital of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, while significant clusters exist in places such as Edinburgh, Belfast, Bristol and Cambridge. As important as the growth of these clusters of expertise is, our ambition is for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to be adopted by businesses across the country.

We announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget £84 million of new funding to deliver a comprehensive 4 year programme to improve computing education and drive up participation in computer science, including upskilling up to 8,000 computer science teachers, to ensure there is a suitably qualified GCSE teacher in every school. The government has also supported the creation of Ada, the National College of Digital Skills, which will train up to 5,000 students over the next 7 years for a wide range of digital careers. At a higher level, industry will be investing to fund a Masters degree programme with an integrated internship, targeting an initial cohort of 200 students per year. The government will be funding 450 new PhD places, and establishing a prestigious Turing Fellowship to support an initial cohort of 10 <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Fellows, to keep the best and brightest <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> researchers in the UK.

It enables all kinds of services we use everyday from maps on our smartphones, to social media and payment processes. Without access to good quality data from a range of sources (whether privately or publicly held), <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technologies cannot deliver on their promise of better, more efficient and seamless services.</p><p>Open data published by organisations across a range of sectors have enabled other businesses to innovate and build new services, which in turn can make significant contributions to the economy. Transport apps such as CityMapper, for example, make journeys more efficient and have led to the creation of ‘pop-up’ bus routes for commonly made journeys that were previously unserved.</p><p>Similarly, open environmental data has been used to create flood risk and water quality apps. To test the autonomous vehicles of the future we will need good quality 3D topographic data on road conditions and roadside obstacles.</p><p>The government is committed to opening up more data in a way that makes it reusable and easily accessible. A good example is geospatial data. The Geospatial Commission announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget will provide strategic oversight to the various public bodies who hold geospatial data, seeking to maximise the growth of the digital economy and consolidate the UK’s position as the best place to start and grow a digital business. To further boost the digital economy, the government is working with the Ordnance Survey (<abbr title=""Ordnance Survey"">OS</abbr>) and the new Commission to establish how to open up freely the <abbr title=""Ordnance Survey"">OS</abbr> MasterMap data to UK-based small businesses in particular.

Organisations looking to access or share data can often face a range of barriers, from trust and cultural concerns to practical and legal obstacles. To address these issues, we are working with industry to pioneer mechanisms for data sharing such as Data Trusts. These frameworks will ensure that all parties involved have defined rights and responsibilities towards the data and individuals’ personal data, and other sensitive data, is protected. For example, the vision for Data Trusts is that they will allow 2 or more parties in any sector to partner in data sharing agreements, shape the agreements according to their needs and enable multiple organisations to work together to solve a common problem.</p><p>In addition to Data Trusts, we will explore how to improve data sharing generally, through sharing frameworks and consideration of data portability.</p><h3 id=""deliver-a-strong-digital-infrastructure-across-the-uk"">Deliver a strong digital infrastructure across the UK</h3><p>The government will work with the telecommunications industry to extend coverage of superfast broadband across the UK, achieving a baseline speed of 24 Megabits per second (<abbr title=""Megabits per second"">Mbps</abbr>).

Ford believes “freedom of movement drives human progress.” While it is now a global company, Ford started out more than 100 years ago in Dearborn, Michigan. The company revolutionized manufacturing by introducing the moving assembly line and made car ownership possible for everyday folks and not just the wealthy. Today, the company focuses on technology first and uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in many ways from connected car solutions to the development of autonomous vehicles.








The Amazing Ways The Ford Motor Company Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning

AI in the Manufacturing Process & Operations
The Ford research lab has conducted research on computational intelligence for more than 20 years. About 15 years ago the company introduced an innovative misfire detection system—one of the first large-scale industrial applications of neural networks. Ford uses artificial intelligence to automate quality assurance as well; AI can detect wrinkles in car seats. In addition, neural networks help support Ford’s supply chain through inventory and resource management.
Ford also uses AI technology to understand the inventory data for used cars with an artificial intelligence platform called CarStory. Now dealerships can learn details about the condition of vehicles, owner history and see how pricing is in the marketplace. The reports from CarStory use analytics to determine what makes each previously owned car unique.

Smart Technology for Cars on the Road
The 2019 Ford Edge model will have artificial intelligence as part of its all-wheel-drive system. By using dozens of high-tech sensors, the system can determine quicker than a human brain if all-wheel drive is needed. It's able to shift between two- and four-wheel drive automatically. Machine learning techniques added to vehicles help provide the new features, personalization and product improvement consumers desire. Many of the AI applications interact directly with the drivers to monitor acceleration or braking, help improve fuel efficiency and the driver's preferences for seat position, climate control, and infotainment.

In China, Ford launched SYNC infotainment system that relies on Baidu’s artificial intelligence. Ford is working very closely with Baidu to give Chinese consumers (the largest emerging auto market) what they demand in connectivity. It features an intelligent voice assistant, access to video streaming, easier info exchange between the in-vehicle system and FordPass as well as the ability to pay for services. All of Ford’s products in China will be connected by the end of 2019.
Ford Motorsports Moves to Pole Position Thanks to AI
Another way Ford takes advantage of artificial intelligence is on the racecourse. Ford Motorsports uses simulation technology (NVIDIA DGX-1 artificial intelligence supercomputer) to understand the performance of a race car before it ever hits the track. The insights inform the race strategy and have produced incredible results—given Ford 300x performance improvements.
Investments in AI
With an investment of more than $1 billion in Argo AI, Ford has backed up its commitment to technology with funding. Although Argo AI is an independent company and its innovations will help other car manufacturers as well, Ford uses Argo AI technology in its vehicles. In addition, the partnership is exploring how driverless cars and trucks could transform the transportation and delivery industries. Currently, Walmart uses Argo AI-powered Ford vans for some home deliveries. Argo AI was founded in 2016, but thanks to Ford's investment the company has been able to quickly develop its self-driving car technology. Argo's systems use technologies such as lane-keeping systems and adaptive cruise control as well as a variety of sensors including LIDAR, radar, infrared to improve the way the self-driving vehicles ""see"" the world around them and respond to the environment.
Ford has also invested in several centers of excellence to focus on machine learning and AI. These centers are where engineers determine the AI tools and methodology that should be dispersed throughout the company and to further advance AI applications. The company also has partnerships with several high-tech companies and start-ups around the world plus a Research & Innovation Center in Palo Alto.
Autonomous Vehicles
Ford expects to launch its self-driving car fleet in 2021, but they will be “geo-fenced,” Ford CEO Jim Hackett confirmed. Currently, the company is testing its autonomous vehicles on the streets of Detroit, Miami, and Washington, D.C.
With all of this technological development coming from car manufacturers, CES, one of the world’s biggest tech shows, has become one of the biggest auto shows. The pace of AI innovation is brisk. Companies such as Ford that are proactive with investments, research, and product development will be the ones that enable their continued success.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",http://schema.org,,BreadcrumbList,,The Amazing Ways The Ford Motor Company Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning,2019-05-17T01:16:00-04:00,2021-12-10T08:30:40-05:00,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Forbes', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/', 'logo': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/i-forbesimg/media/amp/images/forbes-logo-dark.png?format=png&height=455&width=650&fit=bounds'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/bernardmarr/files/2019/05/The-Amazing-Ways-The-Ford-Motor-Company-Uses-Artificial-Intelligence-And-Machine-Learning-1-1200x796.jpeg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bernard Marr', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/', 'description': 'Bernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has figured in many works of fiction as well as documentaries because what they do fascinates people. The representations have not always been favorable, but most people agree they have spearheaded many advances in science and technology in law enforcement. It seems that either that has not been the case when it comes to artificial intelligence or the FBI is keeping their AI projects mostly under wraps. If they have fallen behind on that front, it’s perhaps understandable. As a federal agency overseeing domestic crime and investigations as well as foreign threats within its borders, it has to answer to a whole slew of oversight committees for everything it does, such as using facial recognition software. The FBI cannot simply use technology as a commercial company such as Facebook would. Nevertheless, AI at the FBI has been gathering steam in some areas of law enforcement. In fact, senators from both parties collaborated on a bill, the AI in Government Act of 2018, that would look more closely into the potential of AI technology for government use. If it passes, it could pave the way for developing AI at the FBI. At around the same time, the FBI secured funding that would enable them to secure AI talent for their field offices, primarily for data management, but possibly for other areas as well. Current AI applications that could benefit the FBI include: Facial recognition Fingerprint identification DNA matching Cybersecurity Insider threat identification Business process management We discuss each in detail below, starting with facial recognition. Facial Recognition Facial recognition software is taking off in the commercial sector, and some of the biggest companies in banking and finance are reaping the rewards. Many people have heard about the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), perhaps from watching true crime television shows. The FBI, through its Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), developed it over many years, and it has been a great boon in criminal investigation. However, with big data comes great responsibility, so the FBI turned to AI to develop the Next Generation Identification (NGI) technology. One of its capabilities is comparing images to identify those associated with criminal activities using the Interstate Photo System database. Below is a short 1.5-minute video showing how the NIG-IPS system works:  The FBI use of facial recognition software has had its successes, but some people are not convinced they should use it due to civil liberty issues. The FBI is also looking into commercially available software for video surveillance, particularly Rekognition by Amazon. While this is still exploratory, this move has come in for its share of criticism from numerous advocacy groups. Fingerprint Identification The FBI has been using IAFIS primarily to match fingerprints from a known ten print database, and the NGI has expanded that capability. The new system, known as the Advanced Fingerprint Information Technology (AFIT), also looks at latent palm prints. This 10-minute video shows how law enforcement in Texas was able to use AFIT to solve an actual case in Texas from time mark 2:51 to 3:24.  However, the FBI has frequently encountered cases of obliterated or otherwise changed fingerprints that prevented identification. To circumvent that, the agency has put out requests for information about AI technology that might be able to make a match despite these intentional or unintentional alterations. Other capabilities of NGI include: Repository for Individuals of Special Concern (RISC) – this is an early program for identifying wanted and other dangerous individuals using a fingerprint database; designed to provide law enforcement personnel with on-scene and instant access via a mobile device Friction Ridge Investigative File – contains all relevant images and events associated with an individual to improve latent search accuracy, including tenprint, RISC, supplemental fingerprints, and palm prints under the National Palm Print System (NPPS) Rap Back service – regularly monitors and reports on the activities of people under government investigation or supervision, or holding a position of trust such as daycare workers and schoolteachers to authorized organizations to avoid having to repeat background checks Cold Case/Unknown Deceased – enables latent examiners and law enforcement investigators to use the NGI database and search algorithms to identify unknown deceased people in cold cases, such as this1995 case Iris Pilot – launched in late 2013 to assess its effectiveness, the idea is to use the human iris as biometric identification in correctional facilities, border security, supervised release programs, onsite mobile identification, and investigations involving video evidence; the difficulty is in capturing and compressing the image within acceptable limits DNA Matching Genomics revolutionized many things, including criminal investigation, by establishing the idea of DNA profiling. Just like fingerprints, no two DNA profiles are the same. However, it was much more difficult to guard against leaving DNA behind in a crime scene than it was to leave fingerprints behind. Hair, semen, blood, and sweat could contain enough biological material to generate a DNA profile, especially with more advanced technology. The FBI saw the value of DNA profiles early on in criminal investigation, and eventually built a database called Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Before there were machine learning algorithms, law enforcement would send trace evidence to special labs to process it, and then submit the DNA profile to the FBI to make a match. The whole process was a slow one, taking days or weeks, depending on the backlog of the forensics lab, and the difficulty of finding a match. Labs capable of generating DNA profiles were few, and the backlog of cases could be as much as five years in some areas. Additionally, DNA profiles contain a complex set of data, and CODIS has almost 14 million profiles as of February 2019, so it takes time for standard computer programs to wade through all the data to identify one profile, if it is there. In many cases, the long wait could be justice delayed, justice denied. A new machine could change all that. Law enforcement has been using fully automated and portable Rapid DNA machines to speed up the process of generating DNA profiles from cheek swabs, cutting it down to just 90 minutes instead of days or weeks. With machine learning software, police could take specimens, generate a profile, and make a match within two hours provided they had access to CODIS. That is precisely what the FBI means to do by authority of the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. Among other things, this allows the agency to establish a network of these machines to gain access to CODIS. Here is a 1-minute video showing how the Rapid DNA machine works.  Different Rapid DNA machines came under assessment by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2018.  Resultsshowed that while the machines are capable of running on its own, a modified analysis with some human intervention yielded results with higher accuracy. Cybersecurity The FBI is the repository of much data spread out over many field offices, so like any big organization, cybersecurity is a major issue. A recent hack by a researcher for a security company revealed just how easy it was to access terabytes of data from the FBI files. The breach allowed access to a multitude of confidential files, from agent interviews to banking transactions. This is ironic, as the FBI has an entire division dedicated to investigating cybercrime, from ransomware to identity theft. The FBI started contracting cybersecurity company ECS to manage its network security using AI. AI is particularly indicated when it comes to cybersecurity, primarily because of the rapid evolution of malware. Deep Instinct CTO and co-founder Eli David claimed in an Emerj interview “the conservative estimate is about one million new malwares every single day and it is probably much more than that.” Security software has to be able to keep up with changing parameters, and that is the core of AI. The $38 million deal would involve six years of ECS will be using machine learning to enable teams of security experts to go through the FBI’s networks to detect weak spots, scan for potential problem areas, and set up staff to assess and manage the security needs of the different networks continuously. ECS would specifically manage the Cybersecurity Red and Blue Team (REBL) and Enterprise Compliance and Continuous Monitoring Support programs. Insider Threat Identification Threats from without are bad, but so are threats from within, and maybe much more so. The FBI has been subject to numerous instances of insider threats since the 1980s, a period former Naval Criminal Investigative Service Chief Psychologist and Deloitte Managing DirectorMichael Gelles calls the “Decade of the Spy.” He described the method of dealing with insider threats as “reactive.” Gelles further stated: With the advent of technology and the movement of information, if you will, and the infusion of a new generation into the workforce, information is perceived, managed and shared in a very different way than it was in a world of bricks and mortar — where things now are just instantaneous. The FBI addressed this need for a more proactive approach to insider threats by launching two programs using data analytics to deal with the problem. One is Javelin, which keeps tabs on internal misconduct, security violations, and internal espionage. The other one is the Insider Threat Analysis Platform (InTAP), which combs through large volumes of data to find patterns that indicate suspicious activities and potential threats to the organization. Both these programs are underway, but the FBI is still actively trying to recruit AI talent to handle the big data side of them. The problem is competing for the right talent with private companies that can pay more and provide better benefits. Business Process Management The FBI is a large organization of multiple field offices across the globe with a staff of more than 51,000 people working around the clock. The old ways of managing the business side of things are bound to fall short with the increasing demands o the times. To reboot its operational efficiency, the FBI has awarded a contract to software company Pega Systems. Pega would help the FBI streamline operations and cut costs with the use of two of its customizable business solutions: Pega Government Platform and Pega Robotic Process Automation. The platform would be used to develop scalable and flexible apps to meet business process needs. The automation component is to free human staff from repetitive tasks through automation. According to Pegasystem’s Global Government Business Line Leader Doug Averill: By overhauling their enterprise business processes with Pega, the FBI can improve the experience for employees so they can spend more time on critical missions that help keep US citizens safe. The FBI has a long and interesting history, over which it has evolved quite extensively in terms of technological capabilities. AI provides an excellent opportunity for the bureau to maximize the potential of the available data in its various repositories and databases.   Header Image Credit: FBI.gov Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Citibank - Current InitiativesBanks and other financial institutions can be tight-lipped about how they implement AI technologies within… Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Artificial Intelligence at Barclays - Current InitiativesBarclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks.… Artificial Intelligence at JPMorgan - Current InitiativesAccording to Fortune, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S. and controls over… Artificial Intelligence in the Chinese Military - Current InitiativesThe Chinese military, or People's Liberation Army, is focusing heavily on artificial intelligence.

 How Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Will Affect the Future of PR





		Posted on May 20, 2019 by  










This blog posts appears as part of a new series by the IPR Street Team. The IPR Street Team focuses on new and emerging topics that will affect the future of the PR industry. 
Public relations, as well as other branches of communications, has seen a rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field. AI is fairly new and is still quite a controversial topic, but advancements in the technology may persuade public relations practitioners to use it more frequently in their own practices.
Artificial intelligence has its origins in 1956, when Dartmouth College students began inventing the new field of science (Cristianini). Over the years, artificial intelligence has developed its way into daily life, including traffic predictions, speech translations, and much more. There are two types of artificial intelligence: weak artificial intelligence and strong artificial intelligence. Weak artificial intelligence is also known as narrow artificial intelligence and is used for specific or familiar functions. Strong artificial intelligence is also known as artificial general intelligence and has the ability to improve itself because it can find solutions, making it able to perform unfamiliar and familiar tasks (Singh). Public relations commonly uses automation in its work. Automation is, according to the article, “The process of control systems and technologies by which the system can work automatically; hence it reduces the human work.”
In “AI’s PR Problem,” author Jerry Kaplan describes how artificial intelligence has a bad reputation and connotation among consumers, mostly due to its intimidating and futuristic-sounding name. He further explains that machines have been taking over skilled work for centuries, but they do not want better jobs and/or higher employment, as many people are scared into believing. He gives the example of how jacquard looms replaced needle-workers (but not tailors). He also explains how computers replaced mathematicians/computers, but it now allows them to focus on tasks that require broader skills. Basically, newer technology will always replace the older methods of completing tasks, but not all hope for the industry and its workers are lost. They must simply adapt their procedures in order to stay productive and relevant.
Sam Frizell, author of “At Your Service,” a Time article, also described a current use for artificial intelligence that is used in the current day. This particular piece of artificial technology, SmartThings, is similar to Siri and Alexa, other forms of home installations of artificial intelligence by Apple and Amazon, respectively. This device connects, monitors and controls other devices, right from your phone. SmartThings goes the extra mile by connecting to other forms of technology, such as a moisture detector, and alerts you when something goes wrong. It only requires a smartphone and a $200 starter kit, which includes sensors and the hub they sync with in order to complete commands. Creator Alex Hawkinson said that more creative uses of the device “makes you start to see the world … as programmable.” Some more functions that could help communicators in the workplace include automatically starting programs as the workday begins to simply even brewing coffee while practitioners complete their work.
In terms of communications, Melanie Peters describes Microsoft’s most popular newsroom artificial intelligence, a Chinese chatbot called Xiaoice, in the article “Making Sense of Social Media Requires Brains and Robots.” As one of the newest innovations in journalism, Xiaoice is helping to tackle fake news posted online. “She” can complete tasks such as completing weather reports, working as a news anchor and writing her own columns. According to the article, “Print journalists can’t compete with news which is put out almost instantly on social media and the web. For example, 400 million tweets flow through Twitter a day. It is a constant challenge for traditional media. However, much of the news on social media was fake.” Artificial intelligence helps communicators by weeding out fake news and any information posted by the “water army,” a group of ghostwriters paid to post information online. Although Xiaocie is popular, she is imperfect and steers clear of sensitive and controversial topics. Still, Xiaocie is a great tool for journalists and is just the beginning of artificial intelligence in the newsroom.
One use for artificial intelligence in public relations is that AI will be able to send direct, relevant messages to specific audiences. Real-time big data offers practitioners the information they need to provide current content that consumers want to see. It is already being used by servers like Facebook, which use it to filter advertisements and in chatbots, and the Associated Press, which uses it for writing full earnings reports. According to the article How Advancements in Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Public Relations, “Savvy PR professionals will understand that big data and AI can provide their readership with amazing, data-rich research on a myriad of topics. Companies should not fear big data and AI, they should instead embrace the trend and experiment with new stories that match big data analysis and messages to the audience.” Meaning that artificial intelligence is a tool for public relations practitioners, not a threat. Using artificial intelligence in the public relations industry will mean faster, optimized results that will in turn allow practitioners to meet their goals faster than ever.
When applied to public relations, artificial intelligence is able to process data and statistics much faster than any public relations practitioner would. Artificial intelligence has already been introduced to public relations throughout the use of automated social media platforms and paid media and marketing analytics, thanks to digital advertising and programmatic buying. According to the article How Will Artificial Intelligence Affect PR?, “Although artificial intelligence offers benefits to PR, with the potential of removing some of the more timely processes, creative thinking and messaging are aspects that would fundamentally need human input.” Meaning that while artificial intelligence will be able to make public relations more efficient while dealing with numbers, it ultimately cannot replace human creativity, which is essential to public relations.
Some companies, such as The Washington Post and the Associated Press, have already begun to use AI. Both companies use AI to write full earnings reports. The Associated Press is also working to generate AI-written articles for minor league baseball games (Whitaker). Shift Communications also uses AI for natural language processing, sentiment analysis and more (Chen).
Artificial intelligence is an ever-developing tool that can aid communicators in many of their day-to-day tasks, allowing them to put more time and energy into more creativity-based duties. Practitioners should stay open-minded about the introduction of artificial intelligence in their practice because it has many benefits for efficiency and productivity. Like Kaplan said, “Yes, we should be careful about how we deploy AI…Instead, we should accept these remarkable inventions for what they really are—potent tools that promise a more prosperous and comfortable future.

Artificial intelligence was just as good, and sometimes better, than doctors in diagnosing lung tumors in CT scans, a new study indicates.Credit...Voisin/Science SourceBy Denise GradyMay 20, 2019Leer en españolComputers were as good or better than doctors at detecting tiny lung cancers on CT scans, in a study by researchers from Google and several medical centers. The technology is a work in progress, not ready for widespread use, but the new report, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, offers a glimpse of the future of artificial intelligence in medicine.One of the most promising areas is recognizing patterns and interpreting images — the same skills that humans use to read microscope slides, X-rays, M.R.I.s and other medical scans.By feeding huge amounts of data from medical imaging into systems called artificial neural networks, researchers can train computers to recognize patterns linked to a specific condition, like pneumonia, cancer or a wrist fracture that would be hard for a person to see. The system follows an algorithm, or set of instructions, and learns as it goes. The more data it receives, the better it becomes at interpretation.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe process, known as deep learning, is already being used in many applications, like enabling computers to understand speech and identify objects so that a self-driving car will recognize a stop sign and distinguish a pedestrian from a telephone pole. In medicine, Google has already created systems to help pathologists read microscope slides to diagnose cancer, and to help ophthalmologists detect eye disease in people with diabetes.“We have some of the biggest computers in the world,” said Dr. Daniel Tse, a project manager at Google and an author of the journal article. “We started wanting to push the boundaries of basic science to find interesting and cool applications to work on.”In the new study, the researchers applied artificial intelligence to CT scans used to screen people for lung cancer, which caused 160,000 deaths in the United States last year, and 1.7 million worldwide. The scans are recommended for people at high risk because of a long history of smoking. Studies have found that screening can reduce the risk of dying from lung cancer. In addition to finding definite cancers, the scans can also identify spots that might later become cancer, so that radiologists can sort patients into risk groups and decide whether they need biopsies or more frequent follow-up scans to keep track of the suspect regions.But the test has pitfalls: It can miss tumors, or mistake benign spots for malignancies and push patients into invasive, risky procedures like lung biopsies or surgery. And radiologists looking at the same scan may have different opinions about it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe researchers thought computers might do better. They created a neural network, with multiple layers of processing, and trained it by giving it many CT scans from patients whose diagnoses were known: Some had lung cancer, some did not and some had nodules that later turned cancerous.Then, they began to test its diagnostic skill.“The whole experimentation process is like a student in school,” Dr. Tse said. “We’re using a large data set for training, giving it lessons and pop quizzes so it can begin to learn for itself what is cancer, and what will or will not be cancer in the future. We gave it a final exam on data it’s never seen after we spent a lot of time training, and the result we saw on final exam — it got an A.”Tested against 6,716 cases with known diagnoses, the system was 94 percent accurate. Pitted against six expert radiologists, when no prior scan was available, the deep learning model beat the doctors: It had fewer false positives and false negatives. When an earlier scan was available, the system and the doctors were neck and neck.The ability to process vast amounts of data may make it possible for artificial intelligence to recognize subtle patterns that humans simply cannot see.“It may start out as something we can’t see, but that may open up new lines of inquiry,” said Dr. Mozziyar Etemadi, a research assistant professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and an author of the study.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., who has written extensively about artificial intelligence in medicine, said, “I’m pretty confident that what they’ve found is going to be useful, but it’s got to be proven.” Dr. Topol was not involved in the study.Given the high rate of false positives and false negatives on the lung scans as currently performed, he said, “Lung CT for smokers, it’s so bad that it’s hard to make it worse.”Asked if artificial intelligence would put radiologists out of business, Dr. Topol said, “Gosh, no!”The idea is to help doctors, not replace them.“It will make their lives easier,” he said. “Across the board, there’s a 30 percent rate of false negatives, things missed. It shouldn’t be hard to bring that number down.”There are potential hazards, though. A radiologist who misreads a scan may harm one patient, but a flawed A.I. system in widespread use could injure many, Dr. Topol warned. Before they are unleashed on the public, he said, the systems should be studied rigorously, with the results published in peer-reviewed journals, and tested in the real world to make sure they work as well there as they did in the lab.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnd even if they pass those tests, they still have to be monitored to detect hacking or software glitches, he said.Shravya Shetty, a software engineer at Google and an author of the study, said, “How do you present the results in a way that builds trust with radiologists?” The answer, she said, will be to “show them what’s under the hood.”Another issue is: If an A.I. system is approved by the F.D.A., and then, as expected, keeps changing with experience and the processing of more data, will its maker need to apply for approval again? If so, how often?The lung-screening neural network is not ready for the clinic yet.“We are collaborating with institutions around the world to get a sense of how the technology can be implemented into clinical practice in a productive way,” Dr. Tse said. “We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”Denise Grady has been a science reporter for The Times since 1998.

Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream


 


By: Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson
Description (Amazon): “The American economy glitters on the outside, but the reality is quite different. Job opportunities and economic growth are increasingly concentrated in a few crowded coastal enclaves. Corporations and investors are disproportionately developing technologies that benefit the wealthiest Americans in the most prosperous areas – and destroying middle class jobs elsewhere. To turn this tide, we must look to a brilliant and all-but-forgotten American success story and embark on a plan that will create the industries of the future – and the jobs that go with them. Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson tell the story of this first American growth engine and provide the blueprint for a second.”

IT Savvy: What Top Executives Must Know to Go from Pain to Gain


 


By: Peter Weill and Jeanne W. Ross
Description (Amazon): “Digitization of business interactions and processes is advancing full bore. But in many organizations, returns from IT investments are flatlining, even as technology spending has skyrocketed. These challenges call for new levels of IT savvy: the ability of all managers-IT or non-IT-to transform their company’s technology assets into operational efficiencies that boost margins. Companies with IT-savvy managers are 20 percent more profitable than their competitors. In IT Savvy, Peter Weill and Jeanne Ross – two of the world’s foremost authorities on using IT in business – explain how non-IT executives can acquire this savvy. Concise and practical, the book describes the practices, competencies, and leadership skills non-IT managers need to succeed in the digital economy.”
Ross will review her upcoming new book, “Designed for Digital,” highlighting five building blocks companies will need for a successful transformation at the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium. 
The Technology Fallacy: How People Are the Real Key to Digital Transformation (Management on the Cutting Edge)


 


By: Gerald C. Kane, Anh Nguyen Phillips, Jonathan R. Copulsky, and Garth R. Andrus
Description (Amazon): “Digital technologies are disrupting organizations of every size and shape, leaving managers scrambling to find a technology fix that will help their organizations compete. This book offers managers and business leaders a guide for surviving digital disruptions – but it is not a book about technology. It is about the organizational changes required to harness the power of technology. The authors argue that digital disruption is primarily about people and that effective digital transformation involves changes to organizational dynamics and how work gets done. The best way to respond to digital disruption is by changing the company culture to be more agile, risk tolerant, and experimental.”
Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future


 


By: Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson
Description (Amazon): “We live in strange times. A machine plays the strategy game Go better than any human; upstarts like Apple and Google destroy industry stalwarts such as Nokia; ideas from the crowd are repeatedly more innovative than corporate research labs. MIT’s Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson know what it takes to master this digital-powered shift: we must rethink the integration of minds and machines, of products and platforms, and of the core and the crowd. In all three cases, the balance now favors the second element of the pair, with massive implications for how we run our companies and live our lives.”
McAfee will give an advance look at his upcoming new book “More From Less” during his closing keynote at the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium. 
Real Business of IT: How CIOs Create and Communicate Value


 


By: Richard Hunter and George Westerman
Description (Amazon): “If you’re a general manager or CFO, do you feel you’re spending too much on IT or wishing you could get better returns from your IT investments? If so, it’s time to examine what’s behind this IT-as-cost mind-set. Richard Hunter and George Westerman reveal that the cost mind-set stems from IT leaders’ inability to communicate about the business value they create-so CIOs get stuck discussing budgets rather than their contributions to the organization. The authors explain how IT leaders can combat this mind-set by first using information technology to generate three forms of value important to leaders throughout the organization.”

      Highlights
  
As a partner in the Generation AI initiative, the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley School of Law spent the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters researching how artificial intelligence technologies are being used in ways that impact children at home, at school, and at play. After reviewing and identifying the disparate child rights that might be disproportionately impacted, both positively and negatively, by its use, the team drafted a memo exploring the potential impacts AI is having and may have on children. This document summarizes the memo, providing a series of case studies to illustrate the various ways that artificial intelligence-based technologies are beginning to positively and negatively impact children’s rights, and spotlighting critical questions that researchers, corporations, governments, educators and parents should be asking now in order to better promote children’s rights and protect children from negative consequences. We hope that this memo will help a range of stakeholders better understand and begin to lay a framework for addressing the potential impact of artificial intelligence on today’s children and on future generations.

The authoring team of this memorandum are Mélina Cardinal-Bradette, Diana Chavez-Varela, Samapika Dash, Olivia Koshy, Pearlé Nwaezeigwe, Malhar Patel, Elif Sert, and Andrea Trewinnard, who conducted their research and writing under the supervision of Alexa Koenig of the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center.
The authors thank all of members of the Child Rights Working Group for their advice and input, and especially thank Jennie Bernstein for her careful edits and patient guidance throughout the process of researching and drafting this memo.

She previously held various roles at Accenture. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The fashion industry has grown at 5.5 percent annually in the past decade, according to the McKinsey Global Fashion Index, and in 2016 was estimated to be worth $2.4 trillion. It has been hounded by challenges, the same report said. Sales growth slowed to at most three percent by the the end of 2016. The report also said that apparel companies have been innovating internally to reshape the industry, such as shortening the fashion cycle Email marketing tools for clothing retailers offer personalized messaging, targeting distinct segments such as regular shoppers or inactive shoppers, as well as those that abandon carts.  Away from the fashion front, robotics have entered the retailers’ factories and warehouses to boost productivity and efficiency. This article will highlight how applications are using AI for the strategies of: Marketing and Purchase Recommendations Market Intelligence and Trend Prediction Robotics in Clothing Production The below applications for retail fashion use a variety of AI technologies — from computer vision to robotics. All still require inputs from the individual shoppers or enterprise operators, whether it is providing personal data, email address, uploading images. Marketing and Purchase Recommendations Affinity One standalone recommendation engine is Affinity, a mobile app that uses machine learning and human user input regarding personal style, fit, body shape and even event attire appropriateness to suggest a variety of looks. To start, users take a survey that asks them to rate fashion items by tapping a heart or an X symbol. The company claims this process teaches the algorithms about the user’s personal style preferences and sends this data to the app’s fashion search and recommendation tool.  Once the user has signed up, she will receive weekly recommendations of curated items that match her style and preferences. Affinity follows an affiliate program business model where users click an item on the Affinity site or app, which brings them directly to the retailer’s site. When a customer makes a purchase, this provides Affinity with a cut of the retailer’s profit. On the IOS mobile app or the website, the company presents a variety of products from athletic wear, shoes, dresses, jeans, bags, jewelry and eyewear. Among the brands available are Stella McCartney, Neiman Marcus, J Crew, Louboutin, Barneys New York and Jimmy Choo. At the moment, the app is not available on Android phones. CEO Abigail Holtz said in an interview:  “We use technology for things like big computations and analyses — uncovering preferences, ranking and scoring algorithms, etc. The biggest issue [with computer vision and machine learning] is quality/accuracy, though it is also the case that building even moderately good models to categorize all our attributes would likely take years and require constant turning and re-training. Over time, we will utilize more and more computer vision and machine learning to replace manual human processes, but we will always prioritize solving problems well above full automation.” Prior to founding Affinity, Holtz was a product manager at Google from 2010. It is not clear however, who is responsible for AI advancements in the company or if Holtz managed AI related projects. From our research, we could not find any case studies relating to this company’s work with retailers. Finery Finery is a wardrobe management application that asks users for their email address and permission to access email receipts of fashion purchases. It then claims to be able to determine what apparel are already in the user’s wardrobe. Using this data, the company claims that its algorithms can suggest looks using the user’s existing pieces, and clothing recommendations that could match the user’s current style. According to the company, the application’s Wishlist feature recommends identifies aspects of a wardrobe that have not been purchased and can recommend items that could complete the user’s wardrobe. The 3-minute video review of the application shows how the user can add items to the Wardrobe and Wishlist. Clicking on a product image gives the user details about the item. The application or site also features some stylists from whom the user might find tips.   Within the company, Oscar Mejia leads the machine learning development. He has a Master of Science degree in computer software engineering from Harvard University. From the site, it is not clear which brands and retailers are clients of Finery. We could find no case studies on this product. Hook Hook is a search engine marketed to consumers which, the company claims, can keep track of global fashion trends, collect customer data points and find similar looking items from multiple retailers.  Developed by Intelligence Node, the application claims to use deep learning algorithms to give retailers the benefit of collecting and analyzing customer data points — specific keywords, online navigation patterns, price points on their shopping cart, actual purchases, and their “likes,” among others — to determine what users are searching for.  In addition, the application is reported to be able to track exact and close matches to their product, potentially giving retailers the opportunity to differentiate themselves, the company claims. According to the website, the application carries items from more than 5,000 brands such as Gap, JC Penny, H&M, Old Navy, TopShop and Nike. On the consumer side, using the mobile app or online website enables them to compare prices, find similar products, receive alerts about sales, and keep track of fashion trends from hundreds of brands. To start, users can upload an image of an outfit they want to search and purchase. The application’s algorithms accesses the online catalogs it carries and comes up with curated recommendations, as shown in the short video below. The video also compares Hook with another recommendation engine called Tailor.   Yasen G. Dimitrov is the Chief Analytics and Chief Data Officer at Intelligence Node for four years. Within the company, he leads the the data science team, responsible for operationalizing the analytics using machine learning. From our research, we could not find any case studies about Hook’s work with any retailers. We also could not find case studies about this specific product on Intelligence Node’s website. Vue.ai Vue.ai, an eCommerce platform developed by Mad Street Den, claims that its AI-driven email marketing solution called VueMail offers email personalization in real time to keep customers engaged after they leave the Vue eCommerce site.  Similarly to the other applications, Vue’s site claims to allow a user to make a preference profile, while also shopping around for different products. When the user abandons a cart, the machine learning algorithm takes note of product details and sends a personalized email which recommends similar products with similar colors, patterns, cuts and styles.  The company claims the algorithms also have the capability to distinguish regular shoppers and sends personalized emails with outfit recommendations. The algorithms choose the recommendations based on products previously purchased by the shopper. Another type of personalized email contains product promotions, aimed at increasing the chances of shoppers’ continued loyalty. According to the website, these emails are sent to inactive customers, and showcase curated recommendations and offers based on their purchase history. The 2-minute video below shows the Vue.ai eCommerce website and explains how machine learning, deep learning and computer vision technologies work together to personalize the content for each site visitor.   According to the video, first-time users are initially shown popular brands or product categories on the homepage. The algorithms take note of the user’s behaviour such as browsing through product categories, including cameras, or brands, like Samsung. The more time a shopper spends on the site, the more data is gathered about their behaviour, which trains the AI technologies better.  In case study, Vue.ai claims that an eCommerce marketplace achieved a 5- to 15-percent increase in revenue after sending VueMail personalized emails to its customers. Another unnamed US apparel eCommerce retailer saw 46-percent increase in click-to-open rate and double the industry average revenue after implementing VueMail. The clients are unnamed, so we advise readers to take the results with some reservation. On top of personalized email, Vue.ai by Mad Street Den also claims to offer solutions for AI-powered catalog tagging, styling and searching and is targeted at catalog managers, merchandisers, and product managers. One solution called VueTag is used to curate items in online catalogs with attributes such as category, gender, color, pattern, dress length, sleeve length and neckline.  To start using VueTag, the user first uploads the images and product descriptions to the application. The application’s computer vision algorithms have been trained to extract visual attributes of the products such as category, gender, color, pattern, sleeve length, necklines, silhouette. They can also tag the image based on textual information. Once the tags have been extracted, the program sends the tags to members of the Vue team for quality assurance. If they find that an image has been inaccurately tagged, it is sent back into the system for retraining. Finally, the tagged images are delivered to the online catalog.  Zilingo is an eCommerce marketplace that brings together fashion brands from Southeast Asia. The company used a suite of Vue.ai applications when it was setting up the website. To help its merchants streamline curation of product descriptions and images, the company says that it used VueTag. This helps the company’s thousands of sellers, who each put up 5,000 to 10,000 products per month.  The client claims that the application has made the process simple for its sellers as it eliminates the need for a human army to type product details manually. The client added that this makes curation not only faster but also more accurate. “Shoppable videos and auto-tagging have made our lives significantly better,” said Zilingo’s CEO Ankiti Bose. The company lists Levis, Macy’s, Diesel and Cosabella as among its clients. Costa Colbert, Chief Science Officer at Mad Street Den, has Master of Science degrees in electrical engineering and computer science; as well as biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University. He also holds a Doctor of Medicine in neuroscience from the University of Virginia.  Market Intelligence and Trend Prediction Stylumia Stylumia is a market intelligence application which the company claims can attempt to predict fashion trends with the help of deep learning and AI technologies. According to the company website, the application is able to take unstructured computer vision, natural language processing, behavior data and converts it to fashion insights. This application is targeted at clothing and apparel manufacturers, brands, retailers or fashion and lifestyle influencers who could potentially use the insights to make informed decisions and insights about future fashion trend.  To use the application or website, a retail client can log in and search colors, products or styles. The company claims that its the application can then collect photos a retailer’s eCommerce sites, text descriptions on social media and customer behavior data to show the client a dashboard of data and visualized graphs centering around a product or style they’ve searched. The company claims it can also use these analytics to offer a future outlook graph visualizations and suggestions of whether a certain fashion trend will be successful. An example of a use case for this application would be at a fashion show. In a blog post on the Stylumia website, the company describes how the application can extract data from major fashion events where 40 designers could present a total of 24,000 outfits for one season.  Stylumia’s blog noted that the application also has the capability to capture images of clothing using a computer vision-enabled lens. While the fashion show is ongoing, the application’s algorithms will start grouping images of similar clothing items by color and shape: animal print dresses, deconstructed kimonos and coats, black-and-red themed clothes, and other similar trends at the event.  According to the company, this data can then be analyzed by fashion show organizers and designers who need to discover the trends and make predictions for the coming season. Another use case described by Founder and CEO Ganesh Subramanian is for text-based keyword search by designers or clothing manufacturer. The user can describe the style they are looking for, for instance “yellow and purple striped shirt.” The application’s natural language processing algorithms will crawl through the web to find images of the item.  The company claims that the machine learning application can recognize trends on social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest, and can be trained for colors and silhouettes. It will also search for the correct items even though the keywords are spelled incorrectly. The application’s computer vision technology can distinguish the right color of items, having been trained in in the exact attributes and color values of the RGB (red, green, blue) system. Subramanian also claims that the algorithms can crawl through videos, determine the color of garments through optic mapping using deep learning neural network, and extract a color histogram of the garments in the video. In a case study, an unnamed client wanted to design a T-shirt collection at the beginning of 2017, using designs launched in past two months by local and international brands as inspiration. The client specified the top 10 percent best-selling designs and Stylumia returned with designs ranked according to popularity. The designs included camouflage print, contrast-colored pockets, round neck raglan and horizontal stripes. The designer then combined these trends, and received approval from the business team to produce a certain quantity after seeing the rankings provided by the application. The case study claims that the shirts sold out within three weeks at five marketplaces by the end of the season. The company claims that has 40 clients including Aeropostale, Myntra, Wrogn, Fastrack, W, Biba, Global Desi and Puma. At present, none of the company’s executives have deep AI expertise. Abhishek Thakur, Chief Data Scientist at boost.ai, serves as AI advisor to Stylumia. He holds a Master’s degree in computer science from the University of Bonn. Robotics in Clothing Production Grabit Grabit claims its robot called Stackit is an automation system that uses robotics, machine learning, computer vision and algorithms to automate shoe production. The company says that the robot’s machine learning algorithms are capable of layering items 20 times faster than humans.  Its hands are fitted with an electroadhesive gripper that produces static electricity that can handle materials such as leather; meshes and composite fibers; and other materials thinner than one milimeter. It can also handle boxes that weigh up to 50 kg. Stackit is designed to work with factory employees. The computer vision algorithms determine how the materials should be stacked, and lights up portions of a connected glass table where the factory employee should set products down. The robot’s electroadhesive platform picks up the materials, while computer vision-equipped cameras monitor the progress. The machine can also move over to a partially finished shoe shoe and drop it into a heat press.  The short video below demonstrates how Stackit can handle various types of materials from metal to fabric, glass and printed circuit boards, among others. The robot’s gripper uses electroadhesion technology, which is adhesion of two surfaces when they are subjected to static electricity.  The company has raised $25 million in funding, with Nike among its investors. The company has no official case study, but a news report claims that assembling a pair of Nike shoes involves stacking up to 40 pieces of material to create the shoe upper, a process that takes a human worker up to 20 minutes to arrange. Using Stackit, the report claims this process will take 20 times faster, at a rate of 50 seconds per shoe upper or 300 to 600 pairs of Nike uppers in eight hours, machine learning. At this pace, the report claims that Nike will receive its return on investment in two years. Aside from shoes, the company website claims that the robot can also be applied in manufacturing processes of apparel, automotive and aerospace. A Nike press release reports that Grabit’s current customers include some Fortune 500 companies in industries such as warehouse automation, parcel handling, consumer products, and textiles. Current investors include Formation 8, Draper Nexus, Danhua Capital, Nike, Samsung, Brother Industries, ABB, Shanghai Electric, Flex, NTT Docomo and the Esquel Group Harsha Prahlad, is the Co-Founder and Chief Technology and Products Officer at Grabit. He previously led the Advanced Components Group at SRI International and invented Artificial Muscle, Inc., acquired by Bayer Material Science. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in aerospace engineering from the University of Maryland, and his B.S. in mechanical engineering from National Institute of Technology in Trichy, India. SewBots SewBots by SoftWear Automation is a computer vision-powered robot that sews footwear, t-shirts, pillows, bath mats, automotive mats and towels, according to the company. The company website explains that the robots are designed to stabilize and sew cloth and other materials by “mapping” the surface of the material as it sews. Sewbot’s computer vision algorithms detect distortions in the fabric and adjusts it robotically. The computer vision also guides the robot in cutting, sewing a seam, adding a sleeve, and inspecting the quality of items across a 70-foot long t-shirt production line. The sewing process move the needle rather than the fabric moving through a stationary sewing machine. The robot’s machine vision system is capable of tracking exact needle placement to within half a millimeter of accuracy, the company claims. Its image processing algorithm-driven camera can capture more than 1,000 frames per second to view each thread, the CEO added. The Atlanta-based machine vision and robotics startup spun out of Georgia Tech after seven years of research and development working on projects with DARPA and the Walmart Foundation. CEO Palaniswamy Rajan describes the robot’s sewing process like that of a human seamstress,  “The first thing they do is use their eyes, and based on their eyes, they do micro and macro manipulations of the fabric with their fingers and hands and elbows and feet. So a robot replicates all of those functions.”  The video below has former CEO KP Reddy explains how the robot sew a buttonhole using computer vision cameras at the top and bottom of the fabric:  At the moment, Sewbots are limited to mass-producing simple pieces that require limited sewing skill such hemming and binding. According to the website, the machines are able to produce one T-shirt in 22 seconds. The footwear upper workline can produce one sewn upper in 26 seconds. One client is Tianyuan Garments Company, of Suzhou, China, which mass produces shirts for Adidas worldwide. The company also counts among its clients Avery Dennison: A company which offers pressure-sensitive, functional materials; branding; weaving and labelling solutions for the retail apparel market. CTO Barrett Clark oversaw the development and deployment of Sewbot. He obtained his Master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Ohio State University. Concluding Thoughts From our research, we are seeing that many marquis fashion retailers have given payments, such as a cut of purchase, in order to have their products featured and sold on eCommerce sites with recommendation engines. This seems to be the case when looking into applications like Hook and Finery. Through other research, we have also seen that many retailers have brought third-party built recommendation engines exclusively to their own websites. We are also seeing a growth in robotic design and design trend prediction applications, which may correlate with how marquis companies like Amazon and Facebook are both experimenting with AI technology to design clothes.While IBM has also partnered with Tommy Hilfiger and the Fashion Institute of Technology, Google presented its line of clothing via Project Muze.  However, it may take a while for design work to leave the human hands and passed to robots, according to the MIT Technology Review, as humans still have the stronger edge when it comes to innovation. With robotic applications noted on this list, we’ve similarly seen that the robots detect and manage simple needed tasks, while still requiring humans to handle complex design strategies.   Header image credit: Pixabay Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Stock Brokerage Firms and Artificial Intelligence - Current ApplicationsThis article aims to explore the current state of artificial intelligence applications in stock brokerage… Artificial Intelligence for Credit Card Companies - Current ApplicationsCredit card companies could make use of AI applications across multiple business areas.

He previously worked for Frost & Sullivan and Infiniti Research. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Businesses today around the world have some portion of their operations being automated, which concurrently has meant that a lot of data about these processes is being collected (from sensors or internal company data etc). A combination of AI, big data analytics, and data science techniques seem to be a growing trend in many industry sectors, with predictive analytics being one of the most well-known. According to a definition from SAS, predictive analytics uses statistical analysis and machine learning to predict the probability of a certain event occurring in the future for a set of historical data points. Businesses today seem to have a multitude of product offerings to choose from predictive analytics vendors in every industry, which can help businesses leverage their historical data store by discovering complex correlations in the data, identifying unknown patterns, and forecasting. This is hardly surprising considering the fact that predictive analytics can help businesses answer questions such as “Are customers likely to buy my product?” Or even “Which marketing strategies might be most successful?”   We highlight some use cases from the following industry segments with the aim of painting a possibility space for what predictive analytics can really do for business: Finance Healthcare Heavy Industry Transportation Consumer Goods Below are five brief use cases for predictive analytics applications across five industry sectors. Each provides a fraction of a glimpse as to how AI technologies are being used today and which are being created and piloted as potential predictive analytics standards in these industries. Applications of Predictive Analytics in Different Industries Finance Rapidminer Boston-based Rapidminer was founded in 2007 and builds software platforms for data science teams within enterprises that can assist in data cleaning/preparation, ML, and predictive analytics for finance. The 102-employee company provides predictive analytics services such as churn prevention, demand forecasting, and fraud detection, and they recently worked alongside PayPal. They claim that their predictive analytics software might help businesses with: Predicting the impacts of customer engagement for a particular direct marketing promotion in a retail environment using historical promotional engagement data such as customer information, their location, their responses to a promotional campaign or how actively they have been engaging with websites or apps Identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions for banks by monitoring of customer transactions and flagging transactions which deviate from a standard customer behavior, identified for each customer of the bank from data such as transaction history and the geographical locations of those transactions RapidMiner claims that they can help businesses achieve the above results by leveraging the client’s historical enterprise data. For example, In predicting the impacts of customer engagement for a retail firm, RapidMiner would first have to work with the retailers marketing team to gather all historical promotional and transactional data, including any marketing flyers, in-shop promotions, and purchase histories for a particular product.  The data is then cleaned in order to mold it into a structure that can be plugged into the machine learning algorithms. Those algorithms then perform statistical operations such as regression, classification, and frequent item-set mining aimed at identifying patterns in the historical data. These patterns can allow for determining the effect of perhaps promoting hamburger buns over hot dog buns for a particular week. The system then derives actionable insights by working with a retailer’s marketing and IT teams in order to suggest the potential best practices for new promotional campaigns. The marketing team can then create a dashboard based on these and other insights that provides them metrics and analytics related to decisions such as choosing which products to market in the coming week or to whom they should market based on past history. RapidMiner claims their software can learn more such patterns over time, improving the accuracy of its predictions.  Below is a 3-minute video from Rapidminer giving a brief demonstration of how their predictive analytics software can help businesses:  PayPal collaborated with Rapidminer to gauge the intentions of top customers and monitor their complaints. According to a case study from Rapidminer, Han-Sheong Lai, Director of Operational Excellence and Customer Advocacy, and Jiri Medlen, Senior Text Analytics Specialist at PayPal, wanted to gain a better understanding of what drives product experience improvement. They needed to analyze customer feedback in order to do this successfully.  The challenge for PayPal lay in the sheer number of customer comments they had to analyze. Rapidminer worked along with AI and data science engineers at PayPal to develop a system that could perform sentiment analysis for customer comments in over 150,000 text-based forms in several different languages including 50,000 tweets and facebook posts.  The RapidMiner platform was first used to extract the list of the most frequently mentioned words in every customer complaint from the dataset shared by PayPal. RapidMiner then worked alongside a team of software engineers from PayPal to identify the top two password and PayPal login access-related issues from the list, along with actionable insights on possible resolutions to the issues.  According to the case study, Paypal learned the login issues seemed to spike during November and December (holiday season) when users were more actively making purchases and instances of forgotten passwords were high.  RapidMiner claims they were then able to work with PayPal engineers to design fixes for the login issues. 2 or 3 weeks after integrating RapidMiner into their system, PayPal customers succeeding in recovering their passwords 50% more often than before the integration. After 2 to 3 months working with the software, PayPal was reportedly able to classify customers as “top promoters” and “top detractors”. This enabled them to arrive at the top complaint areas (customer login issues). Founder and President of RapidMiner Ingo Mierswa earned a PhD in Data Mining from the Technical University of Dortmund. For a deeper understanding of the possibilities for AI in finance, read our comprehensive overview of the sector. Healthcare Health Catalyst Health Catalyst in Salt Lake City was founded in 2008 and has around 565 employees today. The company claims to provide predictive analytics services specifically for the healthcare domain through their offerings Catalyst.ai and Healthcare.ai. The company claims they have been involved in several successful collaborations with hospitals and other healthcare companies in projects such as: Preventing hospital-acquired infections by predicting the likelihood of patients susceptible to central-line associated bloodstream infections Using machine learning to predict the likelihood that patients will develop a chronic disease Assessing the risk of a patient not showing up for a scheduled appointment using predictive models For example, a hospital might use the Health Catalyst software to predict which of it’s patients is most likely to develop a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) so that healthcare professionals can act much faster in such cases.  The hospitals historical Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, along with Health Catalyst’s internal data warehouse records on historical CLABSI cases, can be utilized to gain insights on patterns that might lead to a higher likelihood of infection. A team from Health Catalyst might work alongside hospital staff to gather patient data and, using machine learning algorithms, coax out a CLABSI risk prediction model that is built into a dashboard. The nursing staff might use the dashboard to identify gaps in patient care that might lead to an infection for each patient. The 2-minute video below from Health Catalyst gives an overview of some of the applications for their predictive analytics software:   Health Catalyst Analytics reportedly assisted Texas Children’s Hospital in predicting the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes,  to allow care team members to intervene in time before patients suffered a severe episode. According to the case study, Health Catalyst used data from a risk index for children with poor glycemic control who were recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes to predict the risk of a DKA episode for each patient. This allowed caregivers to monitor high-risk patients more closely. Health Catalyst claims their software lead to an eventual 30.9% relative reduction in recurrent DKA admissions per fiscal year, although how much of this was solely due to the analytics and how much might have been due to other healthcare measures taken by patients was unclear at the time of writing. Health Catalyst claims to have worked in projects with customers such as Orlando Health in Florida, Piedmont Hospital in Georgia, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Virginia Piper Cancer Institute among others.  Aaron Neiderhiser the Senior Director of Product and Data Scientist at Health Catalyst has earned an MA in Economics from the University of Colorado Denver and previously served as a Statistical Analyst with Colorado Department of Healthcare Policy and Financing. We explore what AI can do in healthcare in broadly in our comprehensive overview: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare. Heavy Industry Rockwell Automation Rockwell Automation, one of the largest automation players today, offers the Pavilion8 MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC), which the company claims can analyze historical operational data from industrial manufacturing sectors, such as oil and gas or food and beverage, and predict future values for that operational data.  When compared with desired predefined targets for that data, Rockwell Automation claims their software can help these manufacturers automatically schedule the most optimized points in time to supervise a specific project.  For example, in their offering tailored to the oil and gas industry, Rockwell Automation claims their MPC software can help in maximizing the efficiency and stability of the natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionation process. The challenge in NGL fractionation lies in optimizing the composition of the various components in order to achieve specific quality.  An oil and gas company might use the Pavillion8 MPC software to help its maintenance engineers stay ahead of maintenance issues and improve the process efficiency in the plants. A team from Rockwell would first work with domain experts and IT personnel from the oil and gas firm to gather historical data from any existing sensors in the refineries.  The software has a browser-based user interface which can be used by the oil and gas company’s maintenance managers to monitor key plant variables, such as capacity utilization, and predict the most optimal composition control parameters for the process in terms of end-product stability and process efficiency.  Most industrial plants with any kind of automation in their processes have numerous sensors which collect data about pressures, temperatures, levels of vibration in machines, and so on. The MPC uses this historical data and real-time data from these sensors to find anomalies in plant variables by comparing them to data patterns during normal operating conditions. The software then prompts the maintenance managers with reports on the anomalies along with a possible recommendation on what might have caused the issue and suggest replacement parts when required.  The 3-minute video from Rockwell Automation goes into more detail about their Pavilion8 MPC offering, specifically tailored for improving NFL fractionation efficiency:  Rockwell claims that their software can help oil and gas companies engaged in NGL fractionation to separate the NGL liquids into component streams of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, pentane, and heavier chemicals in the following ways:  Increasing process stability and reducing variation in quality of the end product  Increasing the yield of NGL components by an avg. of 1 – 3%  Reducing the reboil energy consumption by an avg. of 5 – 10%  Increasing production capacity by an avg. of 3 – 5%  However, we could find no robust case studies or projects with marquee oil and gas companies on Rockwell’s website for their Pavilion8 MPC software, although Rockwell is one of the largest automation products and services providers in the world. We were also unable to find the data science professionals involved in the development of the MPC software in Rockwell.  Consumer Goods Presidion (Formerly SPSS Ireland) Set up as a regional office for SPSS in Ireland, Dublin-based Presidion now offers predictive analytics software for the retail industry in applications such as improving customer engagement, optimization pricing, inventory management and fraud detection to name a few. Presidion’s Customer Analytics Solutions offering seems to be aimed at helping enterprises target the right audience and identify customer issues by uncovering patterns of buying behavior from historical data. For example, Presidion claims to have worked with Belgium’s second largest insurance provider, Corona Direct, to improve long-term customer profitability. The case study describes the following: To improve profitability, Corona Direct needed their customer acquisition campaigns to be effective enough for the first-year revenues generated from new insurance policies to cover the cost of the acquisition campaign. Corona Direct input historical customer acquisition data, such as that from promotional campaigns, into Presidion’s IBM SPSS software. Presidion claims their software helped Corona Direct’s marketers to efficiently create, optimize, and execute their outbound marketing campaigns by churning out a predictive analytics dashboard.   The dashboard helped the marketing team at Corona identify customer groups that were more likely to respond to a particular campaign and to predict the most balanced growth targets for optimal profit margins.  Presidion claims that Corona was able to reduce campaign costs and improve long-term customer profitability and eventually the cost of the implementation was covered by new insurance policies taken out within six months after the integration.  Presidion also claims to have worked with O’Brien’s Sandwich Bar in Ireland to assist with customer satisfaction, product development, and product marketing. O’Brien’s needed a way to track their customer feedback (which was being done through comment cards) more efficiently and to digitize the process. This led them to adopting Presidion’s predictive analytics platform. The system was set up so that information from the comment cards was directly entered into Presidion’s SPSS-IBM Statistics and SPSS-IBM Text Analysis for Surveys. Presidion claims this change aided O’Brien’s in leveraging predictive analytics to ensure a fast turnaround time in identifying and resolving customer issues. The way they claim to have done this is described below: Each of their stores received a monthly report on their performance detailing the top issues that customers faced during that month. The information received from the comment cards was also used to inform the development of new products and campaigns. Presidion claims to have worked in projects with companies such as Daimler, HONDA, and banks like Bancolombia and Rabobank, among others. However, we could not find any evidence of previous AI-related experience in Presidion’s leadership team.  Transportation Dataiku Dataiku is headquartered in New York and offers Dataiku DSS (Data Science Studio), which the company claims can be used effectively in many applications for air freight, sea freight, road freight, and passenger transport. According to Dataiku, their DSS software can aid in some of the following applications: Predictive Maintenance: Using vehicle sensor data (for cars or trucks), DSS can potentially help customers develop a predictive analytics solution, which can take this raw data and cleanse, format, and model it to predict which components might fail or not perform as required.  Dynamic Pricing: Using Dataiku DSS predictive analytics, transportation businesses might be able to optimize the end-product costs based on real-time changes in operating factors such as fuel costs, security-related delays in shipments, and external factors, such as weather.  Dataiku’s software might help supply chain managers for a truck-based transportation company reduce the downtime that results when trucks break down. Dataiku’s DSS is used to create a data pipeline of both historical and ongoing maintenance data and the data from the electronic control unit (ECU) inside the trucks.  The software then parses the data automatically using machine learning techniques to identify patterns which lead to the failure of a particular part on the truck, such as when a defective or poor quality spare part is installed in the truth and leads to an engine failure during a delivery in rough terrain. DSS then provides insights that transportation maintenance managers can use to proactively order the right kind of spare parts for a particular issue in case of a failure. For example, Dataiku worked alongside French company Chronopost, a member of the La Poste group, which provides express delivery services. Chronopost’s differentiation strategy revolved around ensuring the delivery of all parcels before 1 PM the next day, and with increasing scale, especially during holidays or festivals. The company needed a way to ensure that their delivery promise was met even during peak hours. According to the case study, Chronopost used historical internal delivery data and retrieval data (such as shipping data for each geography) to create a predictive model that continuously optimizes production costs and delivery times.  Chronopost claims they were able to ensure delivery of all parcels, even during peak post-traffic, after integrating Dataiku’s predictive analytics software. However, the study did not go into further detail. The 14-minute video below from Dataiku explains how to use Dataiku’s DSS software:  Louis-Philippe Kronek the VP of Data Science at Dataiku earned a PhD in Operations Research from the Grenoble Institute of Technology, and the company claims to have worked in projects with companies such as Kuka, FOX Networks group, GE, Unilever, BNP Paribas among others.

Concluding Thoughts Near-Term Impact Predictive analytics is being applied to many existing and new use cases across industries, especially in the healthcare, marketing, and finance domains. In the manufacturing sector, predictive analytics also seems to be leading more industries to adopt predictive maintenance best practices. Takeaways for Business Leaders Predictive analytics requires the use of historical data which has to be cleaned and parsed before any analytics algorithms can be used to analyze the data.  Predictive analytics also requires a great deal of domain expertise for the end results to be within reasonable accuracy levels and this would involve enterprise employees working alongside AI vendors or consultants. A typical collaboration for an AI predictive analytics project might last around 2-3 months. Prediction results would incrementally become more accurate over time after the integration is complete.   Header image credit: metering.com Related Posts Predictive Analytics in Insurance - An Overview of Current ApplicationsThe insurance industry is making use of various artificial intelligence applications to solve business problems,… Predictive Analytics in Pharma - Current ApplicationsIt may feel as though AI applications like machine vision and natural language processing hold… Predictive Analytics in the Military - Current ApplicationsThe military has always been at the forefront of advanced technology.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Episode summary: Unlike the field of self-driving cars, the fields of construction, mining, agriculture, and other classes of “heavy industry” involve a huge variety of equipment and use-cases that go beyond traveling from A to B. The heavy industry leaders of today are no farther behind automakers in their understanding that AI and automation will be essential for the future of their companies. In this episode, guest Dr. Sam Kherat discusses the applications of AI in heavy industry, including: What type of capabilities and functions are automate-able, and at what level. He also shines a light on how AI might affect the future of the industry within the next 2-3 years, and in what ways we can expect large equipment to become more autonomous.  We’d like to thank RE-WORK for introducing us to Dr. Kherat at their autonomous vehicles conference in San Francisco.

Big Idea: Autonomous equipment in heavy industry may be widely adopted well before most consumer vehicles are self-driving. Emerj founder Dan Faggella interviewing Dr. Sam Kherat at the RE•WORK Autonomous Vehicles Conference The key application for AI in heavy industry is related to how vehicles can perceive their surroundings and each other. For the time being vehicle automation within heavy industry is limited to the use of GPS and a fusion of sensors such as RADAR and LiDAR. Full automation is only currently in place for heavy vehicles that have to make repetitive maneuvers, such as hauling ore. However, in the future this is set to change and it may happen sooner in the heavy industry space than in the arena of autonomous personal vehicles, for a number of reasons: First, while there is an erie strangeness to sitting in a compact car that drives itself down the highway, there is absolutely nothing strange or unusual about automating heavy machinery work. Manufacturing, mining, and agriculture have always eagerly automated tasks whenever possible, and there is little resistance to doing so now with the advent of AI. We’ve covered a number of applications of machine learning in robotics in previous articles, it’s worth noting that as industrial robots gain dexterity, their heavy equipment counterparts are likely to gain autonomy. Second, the operation of heavy equipment requires specific, valuable skills (the operation of a crane or of an industrial earth-moving vehicle is not something taught in a weekend seminar). Some of these skills are hard to come by, and expensive. Corporations eager to get more work done at less cost are benefitted financially by automation – much more so that an individual person would be financially benefitted by having an autonomous car of their own. Third, while the self-driving car field may be seen to have a safety “barrier” preventing adoption, the heavy industry world could be seen to have a safety “imperative.” Commercial vehicles on the highway must constantly handle interactions with other cars, pedestrians, crossing guards, signs, lights and more. For the most part, heavy equipment operates on private property (such as mines, construction sites, factories) that doesn’t require the same number of dangerous and unpredictable interactions. Similarly, heavy industry work such as mining is inherently dangerous, and autonomous systems would likely save lives. These advances are bound to have a knock-effect in many industries including mining where automation will increase speed and safety, the factory where it will make moving products more efficient and in warehousing to facilitate storing and locating inventory. Bringing Insight to Action: In order for us to see more rapid advances with AI in the heavy industry changes may need to be made in the way companies conduct their research and development. While currently, independent companies are using the same hardware and repeating the same tests, the development of a centralized data bank could save everyone time and money. It would mean that companies can dip into the consortium of information and use it to create algorithms to suit their individual applications (Dr. Kherat goes into detail on such a common data bank in the full interview audio, embedded above). There will be much more creative freedom for autonomous developments in heavy industry as compared to commercial self-driving cars. Businesses involved in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, or other heavy industries may be benefitted by looking at the autonomous innovations of industry leaders in their sector – and better understanding how equipment autonomy (and it’s resulting efficiencies) may impact their operations and finances. Interview Highlights from “AI in Heavy Industry” with Dr. Sam Kherat: The following is a condensed version of the full audio interview, which is available in the above links on Emerj’s SoundCloud and iTunes. (4.28) What are the aspects of machine learning and AI in heavy industry that are starting to drive business value? Sam Kherat: In the heavy industry business…we have mobility, that’s the power train, the chassis, what drives the machine. The second component is the controls, which play a huge role in the stability of the machine, and making it go from point A to point B in a safe manner. The third component is tools. You have to have some way to quickly interchange your tools to continue doing the job. The fourth component is really behind in terms of development, and that it perception. That’s the ability of a machine to sense its surroundings…such as infrastructure.  That’s what created this need to have some autonomous operations for the military because you want to be able to sense the distance and to sense when you have an intrusion coming in front of you and to be able to adequately swerve that. We’ve seen tremendous improvements in sensing technologies, whether it’s light-based like LiDAR also some improvements in RADAR systems. These systems complement each other…fusing has become a trend to enable a better sensing of the surroundings (for readers with a keen interest with sensor technology may want to listen to our machine vision interview with Cortica CEO Igal Raichelgauz). (11.04) With an excavator or in a factory setting with some fork lift truck action…where do we see perception beginning to emerge meaningfully? Sam Kherat: The industry is evolving so fast it’s amazing that just about a decade ago when you had a job, for example a construction site…where a foreman guides a machine operator, whether it’s a grader or a tractor, with some stakes that they dump on the ground so that the operator can see where to grade. Currently we have an automated system using GPS where the antennae are on eh blade itself and the whole thing is automated. (12.18) So the machine can drive itself over there, know where it’s inserting the scoop and can pick the stuff up and know where to put it. Is this what’s happening? Sam Kherat: Based up on a plan. Say you have a plan from somebody who wants to build a golf course…so the blade knows exactly where and how deep it needs to go to start pushing the dirt…The motion of the vehicle is controlled by the operator, but the operator has no control over its blade…Now with the future technologies that are being implemented we’ll see more automation. The machine is going to be able to perform all these tasks on its own and that is going to happen before we have autonomous vehicles. (13.33) Yes, because we don’t have as many crashing into each other..? You own your own construction site; you own your mine, so you can do what you want. Plus the social acceptance, When you really ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, how many tell you I want to be a miner, I want to be a construction worker? They would really rather do something else. It’s really not something that is appealing to a lot of high school students. So we want to take advantage of some of the skills that kids are growing up with, for example playing video games…give them a remote control and then the machine is away and they will do a good job. (14.48) So we’re talking about in the future of AI in heavy industry and agriculture, because I’m sure that agriculture is big in heavy industry as well, to the best of my knowledge there are probably tractors that can drive perfect back and forth harvesting of a certain grain by itself, no people in it based on GPS. You’re talking about excavators doing something similar. The level of the blade and the adjustment of how earth is being moved is being done by a computer and sensors and a person is just controlling movement. Eventually the movement will be automated. And I’ve heard of dump trucks that have GPS and at the push of a button they can just perfectly align with where they have to be. Is this true? Sam Kherat: Yes but it’s not just GPS, there has to be some sensing device on the machine itself because GPS gives you your location but you need some coordination. You mentioned the loading, so when you have a loader, putting whatever it is you need to put on a dump truck…then you have this coordination between the machines so they don’t bump into each other. (16.19) I’d like to talk about these other kinds of sensors as well. Sam Kherat: We’re really still at the infancy stage. We do have warning systems, just like you would have advanced cruise control on a car that slows down. We have an ability to tell the operator, “listen, you’re getting too close.” But there is no action. It’s not completely automated. The automation happens on the hauling systems where the truck goes from point A to point B. But it’s coming very quickly. The industry is actually an early adopter of these technologies… The haulage system now is completely autonomous, in the mine. Those big trucks hauling ore are completely autonomous, so they brake, they accelerate; they do the whole thing by themselves. Future work includes coordination with our machinery. (21.42) When perception really kicks in….where will that really hit the ground running? I think the issue is very similar to the on-road applications where perception is a stage of a threshold where we have a particular development that is being done by each company. And that is something that needs to be addressed, in order for us to have a better perception system. When you look at the perception systems we have, you can actually number the suppliers in that space because they are not really very many, so most of the companies, whether it’s on-road or off-road, use the exact same hardware. When any company is looking at using a particular sensor…they go through certain tests because they have to really make sure it does what it does. The problem, I see, is that everybody is doing exactly the same tests, so we’re really doing some redundant stuff just because we have this competitive mode. So now we spend a lot of money doing the exact same thing, plus we need to have the data that we have recorded and put that in the algorithm to make it work in the applications we’re using. So why don’t we think about having a center where everybody has a common understanding of what a piece of hardware can do for the entire industry?
