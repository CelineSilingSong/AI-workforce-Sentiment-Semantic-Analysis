With the rise of artificial intelligence we ask: 'can AI be creative?' There is a new wave of artists using AI as part of their artistic process and truly opening up both debates.
In June 2018, I commissioned the fabulous Luba Elliott to curate an exhibition for CogX called 'Machine Dreams.' The show looked at the state of art in the age of AI and as Luba describes it, brought together “a range of aesthetic experiments, critical reflections and future predictions.”

The exhibition artists included Libby Heaney, Mario Klingemann, Gene Kogan, Sarah Meyohas, Sascha Pohflepp, Fabrizio Poltronieri, Anna Ridler, Mike Tyka and Pinar Yoldas. It’s clear from these artists that there are many ways AI can be incorporated into the artistic process. Luba described how AI can be used to “generate images, text and sounds based on chosen data”. It can also be used to “suggest plot lines and concepts for further development or creating interactive work that responds to an individual’s movements”. The possibilities are endless - so I asked a handful of the artists who exhibited to elaborate on their work - in the hope it will inspire you to see AI in another light.

Tabitha Goldstaub: How are you using AI to augment your art practice?
Anna Ridler (artist, researcher, DARE Art Prize winner - London): When I work with technology, I’m never interested in making work about technology for its own sake, but rather how I can use technology as a tool to talk about other things - memory, love, decay - or to augment or change the story in a way in that otherwise would not happen. 

I’m really interested in how producing an image using machine learning, as opposed to any other method, creates different experiences, expectations, histories, traces and contexts for the viewer to consider. I’m interested in the form these associations may take and how they might be registered. For me, quite a lot of this is to do with the training set, or the information that is given to the algorithm to learn.
Libby Heaney (artist, quantum physicist and lecturer at the Royal College of Art - London): My most recent work, a Sky Art Arts 50 commission called Britbot, is an online voice or text activated chatbot that asks open-ended questions about ‘Britishness’ and through its conversations develops its own ideas of what constitutes Britishness. The bot’s initial training has been based on the UK government’s citizenship test and the corresponding text-book “Life in the United Kingdom 2017” which is largely a white male privileged version of British history and culture.

I use AI to explore how chatbots can reimagine and reinterpret existing stories, like the story of British history and culture in the citizenship test, revealing new insights and knowledge about the world and our place in it. In these unsettling times, how can human interactions with chatbots create a dada-esque poetry gleaned from the rules of algorithmic systems and fragmented data?

Goldstaub: The act of training AI systems to create artwork raises fascinating questions about the nature of creativity. Can machines ever truly be creative? 
Mario Klingemann (artist, neurographer, coder, data collector - Munich): That depends on how you define creativity. If commodified creativity like applying Instagram filters, the curation of Pinterest boards or drawing in adult painting books are the bar, then machines can already accomplish that. But if you set the bar higher and define creativity as the creation of something original, that is at the same time relevant to a human audience, then we still have a long way to go. Ultimately, I believe that machines will be able to accomplish that, but just as it is with the definition what ""intelligent"" means this will remain a moving target and once machines reach a certain milestone, like generate a song, make a movie or write a book we will probably find some explanation why that act was not ""truly"" creative.
Mike Tyka (visual artist, sculptor, Google researcher - Seattle): As a computationalist, I'd say, yes, of course. But the machines that we can currently build? No, not strongly. However, eventually, I see no reason they couldn't, after all we're also just machines. But I think it all depends on your definition of what exactly you mean by creativity. The recent AlphaGo matches against Lee Sedol featured a number of moves by AlphaGo which were missed by the human players and later lead to wins by the machines. The moves were subsequently studied and described as ""beautiful"" by expert human players. That sounds like the machine had created something novel, surprising and of value; to me that’s creativity.

Goldstaub: Large tech firms remain at the forefront of AI. What part can big companies play in the world of art, as it bleeds into the world of emerging technology?
Klingemann: The beauty of AI is that the technical entry barriers to get one's hands dirty with it, learn how to use it and make something with it are very low. That is not the least thanks to the open source movement and big companies that finance the research and then make the tools and knowledge available for free to everyone who is willing to learn.
Ridler: Large tech firms are at the forefront but actually it is relatively easy to get hold of cutting edge code on places like github or arxiv. What is harder is to get hold of the data or information that they use to train their AIs. Perhaps open-sourcing this would create new opportunities for artists.  
Goldstaub: The Old Masters’ use of camera obscura has drawn both criticism and praise. What other historical parallels are there between artists’ adoption of AI?
Klingemann: New directions in art are often the consequence of a new technology that suddenly allows everyone to do something that was previously limited to an exclusive circle or required a particular talent. So, the question is of course: will AI be such a technology that forces us to reconsider what makes us unique as humans? Will it give birth - either active or passive - to new art forms?








Anna Ridler: Fall of the House of Usher (2017)
Luba Elliott





Goldstaub: Should AI be seen as an opportunity, that enhances artistic capabilities, or a threat, that could supersede human artists?
Ridler: It is most definitely an opportunity! Using AI has allowed me to create work that is looser and wilder than I ever would have been able to make myself. It is my work but also not my work - recognisably me but nothing I would have been able to do by myself. Watching it is a very odd sensation, like catching a glimpse of yourself in a mirror before you realise it is you.
Tyka: It is an opportunity, a new tool, a new way to make art. Just like other new technologies before (like photography), I think it will become a field of its own instead of displacing existing forms of art. And it will get incorporated into other art fields, just like painters use photographs to practice and study. But of course, the emergence of new technologies can change existing fields - photography for example had a tremendous (and arguably positive) impact on painting, helping to spur non-representative forms of painting around the turn of the last century.
Heaney: I believe AI can certainly enhance artistic capabilities, but I doubt it will supersede human artists as humans are required to choose the algorithm, what to train the algorithm on, the parameters of a neural net and so on.
Of course the outcomes of working with AI in art might be surprising, but this was often the case with early (digital) computer artworks by, for instance, Manfred Mohr who has stated that he never knew what a machine would output. But this is different to a machine superseding human artists. In some sense we are still asking similar questions about machines and art to those being asked by artists in the 60s and 70s. Perhaps this will always happen when there is a sudden leap with what is possible with a new technology.Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website. Tabitha GoldstaubI’m the co-founder of CognitionX, an AI Advice Platform which connects organisations with a global network of AI experts.

The news that Christie’s would sell an artwork made by artificial intelligence this October captured worldwide headlines and imaginations alike. Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018), an uncanny, algorithm-created rendering of an aristocratic gentleman, will hit the auction block in New York with an estimate of $7,000 to $10,000. But the piece’s inclusion in such a high-profile sale is creating controversy far ahead of the auction itself.
While images generated using AI technology have been circulating relatively widely since Google’s pattern-finding software DeepDream roared onto the scene in 2015, the field was still young, and the artworks produced via AI were neither aesthetically nor conceptually rich enough to hold the attention of the art world for long. But after the heavyweight auction house announced it was ready to sell this latest work, the mysterious portrait—and the even more mysterious algorithm behind it—were cast by many in the media as the new standard-bearers for the genre.
There is, however, a man behind the curtain—or rather, three men. The algorithm responsible for the portrait was developed by a French art collective called Obvious, which created its AI artist using a model called a GAN, short for “generative adversarial network.”
GANs entered the AI conversation in 2014 when researcher Ian Goodfellow published an article theorizing that they represented the next step in the evolution of neural networks: the interconnected layers of processing nodes, modeled loosely on the human brain, that have driven many recent developments in artificial intelligence. The concept of GANs captured people’s attention partly because, unlike the repetitious results produced by Google DeepDream—all of which were simply pre-existing images that appeared to be run through what our critic Ben Davis described as the same “psychedelic Instagram filter”—GANs could be trained to produce completely new, and dramatically different, images.

Courtesy of Christie’s Images Ltd.In order to get their algorithm to produce a legitimately classical-looking portrait, Obvious’s members say they fed it a training data set of more than 15,000 portraits created between the 14th and 20th centuries. Using these images, the algorithm was able to “generate” new images similar to the ones it had been fed. These new portraits were then presented to another algorithm (the “adversarial” part of the GAN acronym) that was trained to distinguish between images produced by humans versus those by machines—a Turing-like test for artworks—until the generated portraits could fool this discriminator into thinking they were “real,” too.
Since the announcement, many in the traditional art world have been losing their minds over this new movement, which Obvious has christened “GAN-ism.” But other artists making work via AI think the hype about what the technology can do on its own is premature. Mario Klingemann, a pioneer of AI art who has been working with GANs since their inception, says that while this model can create images that look new and seem to define the genre of AI-made art, they are actually just one tool in the neural art toolbox.
“Because they create instant gratification even if you have no deeper knowledge of how they work and how to control them, they currently attract charlatans and attention seekers who ride on that novelty wave,” Klingemann says.

Specifically, Klingemann doesn’t think that Obvious deserves its newfound legitimacy. “Pretty much everyone who is working seriously in this field is shaking their head in disbelief about the lack of judgment when it comes to featuring Obvious, and of course Christie’s decision to auction them out of all artists who work with neural networks,” he says.
“The work isn’t interesting, or original,” agrees Robbie Barrat, a young artist who works with AI. “They try to make it sound like they ‘invented’ or ‘wrote’ the algorithm that produced the works,” but says the collective actually uses a pre-existing implementation of the model to generate low-resolution outputs, which they then run through an online enhancer to get the final image. “People have been working with low resolution GANs like this since 2015,” says Barrat, adding that last year, when he was 17 years old, he did a project using the exact same type of neural network and an identical data set. “No one in the AI and art sphere really considers them to be artists—they’re more like marketers.”
Christie’s international head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, justified the choice to showcase Obvious by pointing to the limited human intervention in their creative process, evinced by the fact that the collective chose to credit the artwork to the algorithm rather than themselves. “This particular work was chosen in part because of the process,” Lloyd says. “Obvious tried to limit the human intervention as much as possible, so that the resulting work reflects the ‘purist’ form of creativity expressed by the machine.”

History Lessons
To get a better understanding of how excited (or alarmed) we should be about AI-influenced art, we have to look beyond what artists have been doing with GANs and to the history of artificial intelligence itself.
At present, much of the debate about any use of AI, including art, is colored by a grand misconception of the technology. Decades of science fiction have conditioned the general public to associate any invocation of AI with what technologists and researchers would call “artificial general intelligence,” or a machine with the abilities to think freely, learn without specific training, and perhaps even experience emotions. It’s the AI of Hollywood classics like C-3PO in Star Wars (the benevolent version) and HAL-9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey (the malevolent version).
Researchers are actively working toward artificial general intelligence, and recent breakthroughs at behemoth tech companies like Google make its eventual achievement seem plausible, though probably not imminent. But these are not the types of AI being used by Obvious, Klingemann, or any other artist making use of a neural network, for the simple reason that they do not exist yet.

A closer look at GANs reveals the long, winding road between their current capabilities and the sentient robots that the phrase “artificial intelligence” conjures for the uninitiated. Karthik Kalyanaraman, an economist and the curator of the first major gallery show devoted to art made via AI, explains that after Goodfellow’s essay about GANs was published in 2014, raw and untrained GANs were made open source by different companies, including Google (TensorFlow), Facebook (Torch), and the Dutch NPO radio broadcaster (pix2pix).
The artistic part actually comes in when these algorithms are trained to produce specific images, which is a process executed by human beings. “Artists come at these algorithms that are raw, like blank slates that are like children ready to be trained, and then train them in a particular visual style,” Kalyanaraman says. It can take up to two months to train GANs to produce images in line with the desired concept.
A lot separates GAN-ism from world-changing AI artists unassisted by humans. The issue isn’t just that GANs can only learn about the specific labeled data they’re fed (“These images are all portraits”), or that the boundaries of the tasks they can perform are very narrow (“Now that you’ve seen all those portraits, make me a portrait”). It’s also that only one of the most advanced neural networks ever developed by a tech colossus has ever learned to perform more than one cognitive task. Outside of this techno-financial edge case, educating a GAN to do something new requires a complete erasure of its progress on the original task—a process known in the AI field by the vivid phrase “catastrophic forgetting.”
In practice, catastrophic forgetting means the same GAN that Obvious used to create Portrait of Edmond de Belamy cannot also be used to create a landscape painting, let alone go rogue and liquefy life on Earth. (Oxford AI theorist Nick Bostrum famously proposed this possibility as a legitimate danger of a super-AI programmed only to manufacture paper clips.) For now, the potential of the technology vastly outpaces the reality. Artist Theo Triantafyllidis, whose work will appear in the Athens Biennial this October, grounds the discussion in relatable terms: “Even state-of-the-art AI today is somewhere between a really clumsy child and a really smart pet.”

Adversarial Approaches to GAN-ism
In that light, what Obvious has done in training the raw algorithm on a data set of existing portraits might seem less original than was previously understood, as others could replicate the training process and achieve similar results.
Unsurprisingly, then, the subjects in Obvious’s work share many similar, surreal distortions with the subjects of early work by Barrat, Klingemann, and other artists using GANs. Klingemann even came up with a name for the phenomenon: the “Francis Bacon effect.”
This repetitiveness shows that humans still have an important role to play in shaping how an AI develops creatively. Although the tech was made publicly available shortly after the Goodfellow paper was published, Kalyanaraman says it took until early 2017 for artists to really begin to recognize the potential for aesthetic diversity and conceptual richness that AI art can provide. “I think it’s just a sign of the fact that this field is in its infancy,” Kalyanaraman says, explaining that in the past year and a half there have been new developments on the technical side of things, as well as more traditional artists getting involved in the field.
“They’ve started to think about this stuff beyond the ‘selling point’ of it being art produced by AI, but have also started to think about how conceptually rich can they make it,” Kalyanaraman says. He adds that the more artists start working with AI, the more obvious it will be when the work being produced is unoriginal.
Indeed, AI has captured the attention of artists both more engaged in the conceptual depths of the technology and more deeply embedded in the structures of the traditional art market. Take Trevor Paglen and his recent series, “Adversarially Evolved Hallucinations.” Rather than train a GAN on portraits to produce an approximation of a human-rendered portrait, he trained GANs on images labeled only with symbolic or metaphorical terms, then directed them to produce images of these subjects that evade the (seemingly) simple literalism of training images labeled “portrait” or “cat.”
For instance, one work in the series arose from a GAN fed a training set (or “corpus”) labeled only with the open-ended classification “interpretations of dreams,” with specific images including Freudian classics like hypodermic needles, windows, and puffy faces. When asked to produce its own contribution from what it had reviewed, the GAN created a work that Paglen titled False Teeth (Corpus: Interpretations of Dreams) (2018), a creepy, pseudo-figurative image dominated by bloody reds, gummy pinks, and a fragmentary central form evoking dental implants.

In an interview this summer, Paglen compared working with AI to the way Sol LeWitt worked with installers for his Wall Drawings. In both cases, the job is to construct a set of rules descriptive enough to guide assistants to a general formal output that also reveals the open spaces and breakdowns within those rules.
The difference is that LeWitt’s assistants were other humans with interpretive capabilities, making judgment calls when necessary. Paglen’s are neural networks with deliberately complicated data sets, visualizing the human opinions embedded in their training. Instead of showing how independent and advanced GANs are, as Obvious’s “purist” work purports to do, Paglen’s work shows that GANs are dependent, limited, and hugely vulnerable to perpetuating the hidden biases held by the developers and researchers guiding them.
Artists’ horizons expand further in light of the fact that GANs are not even the only type of AI infrastructure available. Theo Triantafyllidis’s practice, for example, avoids neural networks in favor of the types of decision-tree-based AI that powers non-player characters in video games—technology that he has put to use in fixed-screen simulations and even virtual reality works. Other artists, such as Lynn Hershman Leeson, Martine Syms, and Martine Rothblatt, have created pieces involving chatbots, the communicative manifestations of natural language processing—the branch of AI that powers familiar digital “assistants” like Siri and Alexa.
Ultimately, the mini-controversy over Christie’s and Obvious offers a window onto an important lesson here in the early life of AI art: To identify truly path-breaking work, we would do better to stop asking where the boundary line lies between human artists’ agency and that of AI toolsets, and instead start asking whether human artists are using AI to plumb greater conceptual and aesthetic depths than researchers or coders. Anything less and we’re simply elevating a technology demo to the status of enlightened studio practice.

During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.Over the past decade, I’ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.This movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.’s center of gravity — away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country’s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.A.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of “copying.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.Analysts in the West often acknowledge the areas in which China has an advantage in A.I., but they tend to misunderstand the nature of China’s strength in each one. With regard to China’s abundant data, analysts often point to the sheer size of China’s population (which owns 1.1 billion mobile internet devices) and claim that lax privacy laws allow a free-for-all with user data. But China’s core data advantage lies not just in breadth (the number of users) and access (the amount of data that users contribute) but also in the depth of data on each user — the real-world activities of Chinese people that are captured in a digital format useful to an A.I. algorithm.For instance, Chinese consumers regularly use apps like WeChat to do an astonishing range of real-world things: buy groceries, book doctor’s appointments, manage their electricity and water utilities, take out microloans. Chinese people make up 68 percent of global demand for bike-sharing and ride-hailing apps. This widespread use of apps in part reflects a “leapfrog effect”: Chinese people never truly adopted credit cards, so they jumped directly to mobile payments; Chinese hospitals never had extensive traditional systems for booking patients, so they are jumping straight to smartphone apps; and so on.What emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.With regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China’s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the “think different” ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don’t explore or exploit all of their technology’s possibilities.In contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.You can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China’s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived — including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups — turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.Finally, there is the question of the Chinese government’s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.The Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn’t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it’s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.Am I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.Consider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it’s technical — major improvements in core algorithms — then the advantage goes to the United States. If it’s implementation — smart infrastructure or policy adaptation — then the advantage goes to China.At this point, we don’t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other’s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation’s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.If both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.Kai-Fu Lee (@kaifulee), the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, is the author of the forthcoming book “A.I. Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” from which this essay is adapted.A version of this article appears in print on Sept. 23, 2018, Section SR, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: What China Can Teach  The U.S. About A.I..

Is AI a threat to mankind? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.
Answer by Falon Fatemi, CEO & Founder, Node.io, on Quora:

The rise of AI has been met with mixed reviews. The late Stephen Hawking declared that AI could be the “worst event in the history of our civilization” and Elon Musk has stated that ""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""
However, AI is an integral part of our everyday lives and does not have to be so intimidating. As AI continues to integrate into our factories and offices, it will streamline and enrich processes to such an extent that companies using AI are better positioned for long-term growth than those who don’t.
PROMOTED
An important way to stay relevant in the face of AI is to double down in our efforts to develop a critical “superpower”— emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence involves the ability to recognize, understand and control our own emotions and influence others’ emotions. While AI affords companies unprecedented capabilities (such as speed-of-light calculations), it cannot exude emotional intelligence capabilities.

It’s time that we realize the pressure AI is putting on humans to be far more emotionally intelligent, as our future success in the workplace may depend on it.

Artificial intelligence to wipe out half of all jobs
Thamer Tayfour
bahrain
September 24, 2018












Environmentalists have been warning of water war, scientists of space war and the new entry to the list is ‘jobs war’. Technology experts are warning of a situation in the near future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) will wipe out nearly half of all existing jobs, leading to severe unemployment, especially among the youth.
Speaking to Tribune, technology expert and President of Bahrain Artificial Intelligence Society Dr. Jassim Haji said that policy-makers should be well aware of the situation to prevent a huge disaster from happening. “AI will take away 45 percent of all jobs occupied by humans in the region in the next few years. And it will certainly have an adverse impact on the lives of 20 million full-time employees,” he said. On the flip side, Dr. Haji said that it will contribute towards the economic growth in the region by adding around $320 billion, which is around 11pc of the region’s GDP.
“AI is capable of creating a radical change in the services provided by both the public and private sectors since AI will be able to perform more tasks currently operated by humans in the near future. “It’s expected that private commercial industries, such as the retail sector, would benefit more from AI. The public sector will also flourish with the utilization of AI in vital sectors including healthcare, education and other government services.
“In our region, there’s a remarkable interest in the development of AI and this is reflected in the future projects announced by the governments here, such as the smart cities and modern economies. Such initiatives require AI and modern operating systems, proving the growing interest in such technologies in the region.” Dr. Haji also said that AI and its role in the development of Middle Eastern societies will be highlighted during an upcoming event to be held in Bahrain. “The fourth edition of Bahrain Excellence Forum, which will be held on October 24, 25, will shed light on AI and its role in government excellence,” he said. It will be held under the patronage of Cabinet Affairs Minister Mohammed Al Mutawa.
The expert stated that the forum will include a demonstration of the different uses of AI applications in all fields and the means to benefit from modern technologies in their development. “AI has granted the ability to automate around 45pc of the existing jobs in the region. This would affect around 20 million full-time employees, but at the same time, it would save around USD366.6 billion in wages.
“This would be challenging to decision-makers in the region, but it is definitely inevitable. Raising awareness on AI and its capabilities is important and our societies should be well prepared for such a huge step towards the future.” On the other hand, experts worldwide fear that depending on AI and robotics in different industrial and service fields would have a negative impact on human resources and the opportunities of their employment. However, many other experts have an opposite and more optimistic opinion, predicting that newer work fields would be created.
On her part, the forum’s Assistant Secretary-General Noura Al Aliwi underlined the importance of AI as one of the major outputs of the industrial, informatics and technological revolutions.
