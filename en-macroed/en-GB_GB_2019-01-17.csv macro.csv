Quinyx, a Stockholm and London-based cloud provider of workforce management solutions, has raised $25 million in its latest round of funding, with support from existing investors Alfvén & Didrikson, Battery Ventures and Zobito.
Founded in 2005 by chief executive Erik Fjellborg after he spent a summer working for fast-food chain McDonald’s, the company provides software to help business of all sizes manage their staff scheduling, communication, task-management, as well as payroll integration.
After experiencing firsthand the difficult task managers have in organizing employee shifts, Fjellborg created the Quinyx software, with McDonald’s as the company’a first customer.
Service Tailored to the Service Industry
With a focus on shift-based or “flexible” workers in service industries, Quinyx now boasts about 500,000 employees on its platformOpens a new window  at companies including McDonald’s, Burger King, jewelery company Swarovski, London’s City Airport, airline Virgin Atlantic and pharmaceutical retailer Boots.
For now, the core customer base is in Europe but its software has been used globally in markets including China, Japan and South Korea. The company says the funding will be used to spur the roll-out of innovations and artificial intelligence technologies, helping to further automate and streamline the processes of workforce management.
Fjellborg said that the additional funds “will help us to accelerate our growth journey and develop and embed new technologies into our platforms to unlock the full potential of the flexible workforce. Our mission is simple – to create a better life for millions of people by improving their work lives.”
Maria Åhr, CEO of Alfvén & Didriksson, said “Quinyx is a game-changer in workforce management. Its consistent growth and calibre of its customers confirms its strong potential for future global growth. We look forward to playing an active role in the company’s next chapter.”
The investment marks the largest injection into Quinyx so far, which has raised a total of $53.3 million over four funding rounds.
“Having joined the board at Quinyx when we invested in the company last year, I’ve seen firsthand the ambition and drive Erik and his team have shown in going after this large market,” says Battery Ventures general partner Michael Brown. “Quinyx has made significant progress in the last year by continuing to focus on the strength of its technology. This new investment will help take Quinyx’s business to the next level.”
Shift Market Trend Encourages Development, M&A
With increasing numbers of people engaging in shift work, the global workforce management market is estimated to be worth $2.4 billion. Other players in the space include Infor, Kronos, Replicon and WorkJam.
A report by Gartner into the workforce management software sectorOpens a new window  says that by 2023, at least 95&percnt; of sales of new workforce management applications will be deployed on the cloud. It found a trend of cloud-first workforce management applications, with human capital management suite vendors expanding their capabilities in this area and more widely adopting workforce management solutions.
“The latest generation of WFM [workforce management] applications have the potential to transform, augment and disrupt the market by introducing new capabilities to WFM applications,” the report says. “Organizations have traditionally invested less frequently in WFM applications than in other HCM [human capital management] applications, such as functions of talent management. However, WFM is one of the few functions of HCM that can provide hard ROI.”
The benefits of using such a system, the report highlights, are to measure accurately the working time and absences of workers, making the information available to payroll and human resources; helping employers comply with legislation and agreements regarding working hours, pay and leave; providing efficient and fair work schedules; and providing tools to track worker productivity.
On Wednesday, enterprise software group Salesforce was reportedOpens a new window  to be in early-stage talks to buy Israeli workforce management software company Clicksoftware Technologies at a valuation of about $1.5 billion, although neither company confirmed the deal. Clicksoftware develops and sells enterprise software that offers task scheduling, resource management, as well as customer service tools.
Last week, US-based workforce management solution provider Kronos announced a partnership with German enterprise software group SAP to resell its Workforce Dimensions solution under the brand SAP Time Management by Kronos.
“SAP Time Management by Kronos offers unique and innovative capabilities that will help SAP customers with complex workforce needs to reimagine scheduling, timekeeping, leave management, and regulatory compliance” said Stephen Spears, chief revenue officer at SAP SuccessFactors. “The benefits are connected and localized human resources processes – and a smooth experience across the best workforce management, core HR, and payroll solutions in the market.”

By Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Director, Applied Machine Learning
Today, Facebook is announcing a new partnership with the Technical University of Munich (TUM) to support the creation of an independent AI ethics research center. The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, which is supported by an initial funding grant from Facebook of $7.5 million over five years, will help advance the growing field of ethical research on new technology and will explore fundamental issues affecting the use and impact of AI.
Artificial intelligence offers an immense opportunity to benefit people and communities around the world. But as AI technology increasingly impacts people and society, the academics, industry stakeholders and developers driving these advances need to do so responsibly and ensure AI treats people fairly, protects their safety, respects their privacy, and works for them.
At Facebook, ensuring the responsible and thoughtful use of AI is foundational to everything we do — from the data labels we use, to the individual algorithms we build, to the systems they are a part of. We’re developing new tools like Fairness Flow, which can help generate metrics for evaluating whether there are unintended biases in certain models. We also work with groups like the Partnership for AI, of which Facebook is a founding member, and the AI4People initiative. However, AI poses complex problems which industry alone cannot answer, and the independent academic contributions of the Institute will play a crucial role in furthering ethical research on these topics.
The Technical University of Munich is one of the top-ranked universities worldwide in the field of artificial intelligence, with work extending from fundamental research, to applications in fields like robotics and machine intelligence, to the study of the social implications of AI. The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will leverage the TUM’s outstanding academic expertise, resources and global network to pursue rigorous ethical research into the questions evolving technologies raise.
The Institute will also benefit from Germany’s position at the forefront of the conversation surrounding ethical frameworks for AI — including the creation of government-led ethical guidelines on autonomous driving — and its work with European institutions on these issues.
Institute Overview
Drawing on expertise across academia and industry, the Institute will conduct independent, evidence-based research to provide insight and guidance for society, industry, legislators and decision-makers across the private and public sectors. The Institute will address issues that affect the use and impact of artificial intelligence, such as safety, privacy, fairness and transparency.
Through its work, the Institute will seek to contribute to the broader conversation surrounding ethics and AI, pursuing research that can help provide tangible frameworks, methodologies and algorithmic approaches to advise AI developers and practitioners on ethical best practices to address real world challenges.
To help meet the need for thoughtful and groundbreaking academic research in these areas, Facebook looks forward to supporting the Institute and help offer an industry perspective on academic research proposals, rendering the latter more actionable and impactful.
Operational Model
The independent Institute will be led by TUM Professor Dr. Christoph Lütge, who holds degrees in business informatics and philosophy and has served as the Peter Löscher Endowed Chair of Business Ethics at TUM since 2010. Working with a diverse advisory board of representatives from academia, civil society and industry, the Institute will identify specific research questions and convene researchers focused on AI ethics and governance-related issues.
“At the TUM Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, we will explore the ethical issues of AI and develop ethical guidelines for the responsible use of the technology in society and the economy,” Dr. Lütge said. “Our evidence-based research will address issues that lie at the interface of technology and human values. Core questions arise around trust, privacy, fairness or inclusion, for example, when people leave data traces on the internet or receive certain information by way of algorithms. We will also deal with transparency and accountability, for example in medical treatment scenarios, or with rights and autonomy in human decision-making in situations of human-AI interaction.”
While Facebook has provided initial funding, the Institute will explore other funding opportunities from additional partners and agencies. Facebook may also share insights, tools, and industry expertise related to issues such addressing algorithmic bias, in order to help Institute researchers focus on real-world problems that manifest at scale.
The Institute will also pursue opportunities to publish research and work with other experts in the field; organize conferences, symposia, and workshops; and launch educational activities with other leading institutions in common areas of interest.
Realizing AI’s huge potential for good while balancing its risks is a global effort, and it will not be accomplished overnight. The Institute is an exciting step forward in our continued commitment to partnering with academic institutions, governments, NGOs, advocacy and industry groups, and others who are working to advance AI in a safe and responsible way.

The current wave of AI is very different. It requires both mathematical insight and hands-on experience. We need courses that strike the right balance between these two. Only then, will India be able to produce visible products and services in the AI age.”.The PadhAI course is a hands-on course on ‘Deep Learning’ which is the most successful sub-field of AI. To make it widely accessible, minimal prerequisites are expected and the fees are significantly lower than other offerings from universities and private organisations. The four-month course comprises 80 hours of lecture content and requires equivalent time in solving assignments.

It has become the first Indian Educational Institution to offer such a full-fledged BTech program in AI and likely the third institute globally - after Carnegie Mellon University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both of which are in the US.The Course will have an intake of around 20 students who can take the program through the JEE-Advanced.The mission of the Department of Artificial Intelligence, IIT Hyderabad, is to produce students with a sound understanding of the fundamentals of theory and practice of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It also aims to enable students to become leaders in the industry and academia nationally and internationally and meet the pressing demands of the nation in the areas of AI and Machine Learning. IIT Hyderabad is already offering an MTech program in Artificial Intelligence – Machine Learning.Speaking about the importance of this course, Prof UB Desai, Director, IIT Hyderabad, said, “The basic aim is to create a complete ecosystem for Artificial Intelligence Academics and Research at IIT Hyderabad. This involves BTech, MTech and different Minor Programs in AI. Moreover, the R&amp;D will be strongly entwined with academics.”It is envisaged that students graduating from these programs will apply their training to become leaders in the industry and academia and contribute to building a better future for India and the world.What makes the program at IIT Hyderabad unique is that it aims to provide a holistic view to students. It comprises algorithms from the Computer Science Department, Signal Processing from Electrical Engineering Department, Robotics from Mechanical Engineering Department and Mathematical Foundations. The course will also focus on application verticals such as healthcare, agriculture, smart mobility, among many others.Further, the ethical impact of AI and its technologies on areas such as privacy, bias and related issues will also be a key component of this B.Tech. program. It is important that the next generation of people trained in AI should be sensitized to these things and are cognizant of the impact of the technology they develop.Highlighting the salient features of this course, Dr. Sumohana Channappayya, Dean (Research and Development), IIT Hyderabad, said, “AI solutions are particularly promising for India (given the availability of a large corpus of data) where it can have a major positive impact on several critical domains such as healthcare, crop and soil management, weather prediction, surveillance and security, and defence. Long term and robust solutions to problems in these domains require a systematic and disciplined approach that is rooted in the fundamentals of AI. However, the demand for professionals trained in this area far exceeds the current supply. The BTech program in AI is a step in the direction of addressing this highly skewed demand-supply scenario.”Further, Dr. Sumohana Channappayya added that the potential for AI to improve the quality of human lives is tremendous. This program will train students in the fundamentals of computer science, AI and ML in addition to sensitising them to the ethical issues in deploying AI-based solutions.Students pursuing other degrees such as B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering can now do a minor in AI as well from the coming Academic Year. This will make IIT Hyderabad students, in all disciplines, well equipped to meet the challenges in AI that are lying ahead.Speaking about this course, Dr. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, said, “It will provide training on various aspects of AI, ranging from technical ones like machine learning algorithms to ethical issues as well. It will make our students very sought after by the Industry as their training will be comprehensive and well-rounded when working on smart AI-based technology solutions.”Further, IIT Hyderabad is already offering an M.Tech. in Data Science for working professionals that comprises Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and other related areas since 2015-16.The M.Tech. is a flexible program offered completely online in real-time with students having the freedom to complete the course between two to five years. This gives a lot of options for working professionals in AI area to upgrade their skillset without leaving their jobs or having to relocate.Dr. Vineeth added, “The past alumni have initiated R&amp;D projects after finishing the program and are also involved in collaborative Research projects with IIT Hyderabad. These courses, in addition to skill the Indian workforce, helps contribute to creating an ecosystem where industry and academia can closely discuss AI solutions and thereby bridge the gap between AI theory and practice.”IIT Hyderabad’s Department of Liberal Arts in collaboration with faculty from Computer Science and Electrical Engineering has also launched a unique Minor in ‘AI and Humanity.’ The influence of AI on everyday lives has grown exponentially: the way people interact with their bodies, their immediate environments, their societies, and the state are all increasingly mediated through AI. At this crucial point in its history, therefore, it is necessary to understand, question, and shape ways in which AI technologies are being incorporated into the fabric of everyday life.The AI and Humanity minor at IIT Hyderabad will expose students to exciting opportunities and challenges presented by AI. Students will benefit from thinking beyond the purely technical aspects of AI: humanities and social science scholars will team up with engineers and designers to offer wide-ranging interdisciplinary perspectives on AI and Humanity as part of this newly launched Minor.",,,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg', 'caption': 'Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad is launching a full-fledged BTech Program in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the coming Academic Year (2019-2020).', 'description': 'Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad is launching a full-fledged BTech Program in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the coming Academic Year (2019-2020).', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}","{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Hindustan Times', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com'}",,

'Her' : Artificial Intelligence Drives This Beautiful Love Story Home



                            Her may be basically a love-story, but a major focus has been laid upon the technological evolution that basically veins this drama. Human-OS love story is not a distant dream, and the maturity with which this film handles the delicate subject is worth a thousand applauds. Even more.

 ​
From the simple hi-tech phone to the keyboard-less computer to ever-evolving Operating System to the real-time interacting holographic video-game character, there's a lot more to this love story that shall have you amazed.

Put this in your 'must-watch' list, for this is a film that shall drive future tech-innovations in a whole new direction.
