Your Next Job Interview May Be With a Robot—Whether You Realize It Or Not
Major companies such as Hilton and Unilever have used AI interview software, and an estimated 83 percent of US companies use some form of AI in their HR processes.

Many companies have turned to artificial intelligence to lead hiring processes and cherry-pick job applicants… Welcome to the ‘Wild West of Hiring.’ Pixabay
When Emily applied for her dream job, she expected to ace her interview. She knew the company inside and out and had prepared to explain why she would be perfect for the role. When she received an invitation to a video platform that would record her responses to a series of questions, she was slightly thrown—she was applying for a people-facing role and had hoped to be able to build rapport with the hiring manager. Still, she hoped that she could still show her personality, even in pre-recorded clips.

What Emily didn’t realize until after the interview was that the third-party company that hosted the video software used facial analysis technology to screen candidates. Her interview would be assessed by an algorithm that used people’s facial expressions, intonation and word choice to evaluate whether Emily was right for the role.
The use of artificial intelligence has become increasingly widespread in recruitment over the last few years. Candidates are often asked to complete video interviews or online tests without any awareness that an algorithm will be the first assessor of their application. Major companies such as Hilton and Unilever have used AI interview software, and an estimated 83 percent of US companies use some form of AI in their HR processes.
“HR decision-making has always been based on the prior experience of recruiters and their intuition about a candidate,” says Prasanna Tambe, an Associate Professor of Operations, Information and Decisions at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “Technology has made it easier than ever to apply for jobs, so recruiters have increasingly large stacks of applicants to evaluate, which takes time. Tools that can help recruiters sort through even larger numbers of applicants and make well-informed decisions are very attractive.”
The use of AI in recruitment ranges from video software to chatbots that answer basic queries from candidates and algorithms that screen resumes for keywords. The technology integrates seamlessly with existing HR processes—research shows that 73 percent of candidates could not tell that they were interacting with a chatbot when they reached out to companies to ask questions, and in most cases, candidates have no way of knowing that AI was used to screen their application.

But algorithm-driven application processes are not without their problems. In 2018 Amazon abandoned a computer program that used machine learning to score candidates after developers realized that the tool discriminated against female candidates.
“Algorithms can be biased and unfairly discriminate against some groups in the recruitment process,” explains Tambe. “AI systems learn to make predictions based on data, and so predictions are generally more accurate for groups which have more data available. The industry does seem to be becoming increasingly sensitive to this issue, and some tools and methods are being designed to try and mitigate these problems.”
The issue of bias remains a pressing problem in AI recruitment, but some experts argue that human-centered hiring processes have similar issues. Kevin Parker is CEO of industry-leading video interview company HireVue. HireVue has paved the way when it comes to AI-driven candidate assessments, but its video interview facial analysis tool was abandoned in late 2020 after significant public pushback, including a complaint to the FCC in 2019, and an independent audit. The company still uses automation technology including online assessments and chatbots to vet candidates, and Parker believes that although AI systems are vulnerable to bias, they also mitigate issues of interviewer discrimination.
“Humans are notoriously inconsistent and are subject to huge amounts of both conscious and unconscious biases,” he explains. “By utilizing AI, and committing to regular audits and tests of these AI systems, hiring teams can be sure that they are consistently and fairly evaluating all of their candidates based on what actually matters—their work-based skill set.”
Parker thinks that the current economic climate will only speed up the shift to AI-powered recruitment as hiring teams are bombarded with dozens of applications for a single role. But he also stresses the importance of using machine learning to support human-led decisions rather than replace them. He believes that one of the most important uses of automation could be found in refining how talent is utilized within companies, matching current employees with relevant internal vacancies and minimizing the time that candidates spend applying for multiple roles by identifying which jobs they are best suited to.
“AI could be key in ensuring that employees are continuing to develop,” he says. “It can give an accurate understanding of an employee’s current skill set and encourage organizations to reward loyalty and good performance by hiring from within.”
AI recruitment is now so common that some colleges are offering lessons in how to complete AI-powered interviews or applications for the best results, and there is an inevitable risk that algorithms could transform the recruitment process into a box-ticking exercise. Oliver Quie is an HR expert and co-founder of innerworks, an application that uses AI-driven personality tests to predict company-employee fit. Quie believes that as machine-based recruitment becomes increasingly popular, there is a risk that candidates might try to “game” the system—but he argues that this isn’t beneficial for candidates or employees.

“Bringing your own unbiased and differentiated ‘data’ to an interview is still the best way to stand out,” he says. “‘Data’ includes factors such as experience, personality, and raw intelligence. These are factual and measurable, and are less easy to game than factors such as appearing to interview well in an AI environment.”
Yet in spite of sticky issues around candidate comfort with the process and the possibility for system manipulation, the use of machine learning in hiring decisions is already becoming the norm. So what should you look out for in future interviews and applications? Parker suggests that although algorithms might feel slightly alien, they usually evaluate similar measures to a traditional interview and application process.
“As you would with any other job interview, take the necessary time to research the company, job role and the team that you would be working with,” he says. “Answer questions using the STAR framework: respond to questions by outlining the situation, the task, the activity at hand and the results of your work. And don’t panic over technology—technical hiccups happen. If the last year has taught us anything, it’s that we’re all doing the best we can—a glitch in your audio or a cameo from a roommate isn’t going to ruin your shot at a place that you want to work.”

The first challenge that IT pros need to beat when job-hunting is to get past the front door. Those doors, now more than ever, are often virtual: online job boards, networking sites like LinkedIn, corporate application tracking systems (ATS), and so forth.
That’s no secret. What’s more opaque is the behind-the-scenes pre-screening that is applied – often in automated fashion – to a virtual pile of resumes. This typically leads to the culling of multiple potential candidates from consideration before a human hiring manager or recruiter even gives their resumes a passing look. (And when we say “passing look,” we mean it: An oft-cited 2018 eye-tracking study conducted by the careers site Ladders found that human recruiters spend an average of just 7.6 seconds reading a resume during an initial review before moving on to the next one.)

Why companies use AI resume screening tools
For job hunters, it's useful to think about the why behind this process.
For job hunters, it’s useful to think about the why behind this process. Recruiters and hiring managers spend a lot of their time reading resumes. As is the case with a lot of repetitive, time-consuming work, it can literally pay to find ways to become more efficient, and HR tasks are no exception. (This becomes increasingly true for companies that receive hundreds of applications for a single position, especially when some of the resumes they receive simply don’t possess the qualifications required for the job.)
Some folks will point out that there are multiple HR processes ripe for automation. The software vendor UiPath states that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can enable HR pros to reclaim as much as 40 percent of their time.
That’s the main idea behind automatically pre-screening resumes based on certain criteria. The automation piece is commonly referred to as Artificial Intelligence (AI), but whether or not it’s actually AI or a different (but related) technology such as RPA, the principle remains more or less the same: Depending on where and how you apply for your next IT job, your resume may have to pass through some kind of automated test before it gets a chance to be reviewed by human eyes.
[ Made it to the interview stage? Also read: IT careers: Top IT job interview questions for 2021 ]
To be clear, not every organization does this. We reached out to one in-house recruiting executive at a tech firm who said their firm isn’t currently leveraging AI in their hiring processes, for example. But if you’re directly applying for jobs through a corporate ATS or other online application channels, there’s a growing chance there are some kind of automated filters in place.
How to build a resume that gets past AI screening tools: 5 tips
We asked two experienced IT recruiters who review virtually countless resumes as part of their work with both individual job seekers and hiring companies to shed some light on “beating the AI” – whether the system is actually leveraging AI or another form of automation. These are the tips and tricks they shared for getting past the first step and boosting your odds of success during a job hunt.
1. Don't go overboard trying to ""beat the system""
It’s important for job seekers who are applying online to understand that this is indeed a thing. Not realizing that an ATS or similar channel might be automatically pre-screening resumes is not all that different than submitting a resume full of typos. It might indicate a lack of effort or care.
That said, don’t stress out about it or become obsessive about trying to game the system.
“It can be hard to ‘beat the AI’ without knowing the phrases it’s looking for,” says Matt Deneroff, branch manager for Robert Half Technology in Washington, D.C. “Every system is different and you don’t want to appear to be trying to simply beat the system when applying.”
It can actually be counterproductive if your resume reads like a game of keyword bingo. 
In other words, going overboard isn’t necessarily productive since there’s a black box element to this process. These are typically rules-based engines, especially if RPA is involved – and you probably don’t know the rules. And it can actually be counterproductive if your resume reads like a game of keyword bingo and, as Deneroff notes, gives a human hiring manager the sense that you’re trying to fake your way through the process or are otherwise overselling your qualifications.
2. Tailor your resume to specific job descriptions
This is smart resume advice overall: Customize (not to be confused with “exaggerate” or “fabricate”) your resume for specific positions.
In the case of an ATS that uses some form of automated prescreening, doing so will have the added benefit of increasing the likelihood that the text in your resume hits the mark in terms of screening criteria the company may be using.
“Our best advice is that tailoring your resume to a specific job description [is the best way to get past initial screening phases],” Deneroff says. “Not only will you be tailoring it – including specific buzzwords that were mentioned in the job description, [for example] – but you’ll also be showing the hiring manager that you have the experience [they’re specifically looking for], which is most important.”
The job description itself is providing you a working vocabulary as a foundation for tailoring your resume accordingly.
Keywords do matter, provided you’re not actually trying to game the application process or mislead someone. As Deneroff indicates, the job description itself is providing you a working vocabulary as a foundation for tailoring your resume accordingly. Read the description closely.
If the job description lists Kubernetes and service mesh experience as important, your resume should, too. (Otherwise, why are you applying for that particular position?) Make sure things are spelled out and spelled correctly, too. Rules-based technologies like RPA aren’t usually smart enough to realize you’ve made a mistake. For similar reasons, don’t rely on too much industry shorthand or jargon; the system might not be set up to recognize or understand it.

3. Make smart formatting choices
RPA bots and other rules-based automation aren’t really ""reading"" resumes so much as ""parsing"" them. 
RPA bots and other rules-based automation aren’t really “reading” resumes so much as “parsing” them. That’s why keywords – spelled properly, among other necessities – matter. As does cutting down or eliminating too much “IT-speak.” In this context, that means terms, phrasing, or abbreviations that few people outside of IT will recognize or use. (“K8s” instead of the full name, Kubernetes, is a useful example here – err on the side of the latter.)
This is also why formatting choices matter – sometimes a lot. Even your resume’s file type can be the difference between getting past an ATS screen or not.
“For a resume to pass screening tools like AI or RPA bots, make sure it is clean, plain, and in a Word document,” says Jenna Spathis, unit manager of the technology recruiting team at LaSalle Network. “I have noticed more mis-parsed information when resumes are submitted as PDFs rather than Word documents.”
“Plain” is a good guiding principle: As in plain, readable text – and little else. That could be counterintuitive to someone in a design-oriented role, such as a UI/UI position. But save the creative flair for a later phase of the process.
“Formatting issues are a big reason for resumes not being passed through an applicant tracking system,” Spathis says.
As an example, someone might have their skills, education, and experience information – all core information on a resume – in different text boxes in a column view.
“I have noticed those resumes also parse incorrectly when going through pre-screening systems,” Spathis says. “RPA bots are in place to pull and parse the most relevant information, including contact information, experience, and education.”
In other words: Even if your creatively designed resume does pass muster, the system might not capture all of the information it’s supposed to – which means that the recruiter or hiring manager might get an incomplete first impression.
“To ensure all relevant information is being pulled, a plain, simple Word document with clear headers is the best course of action,” Spathis says. “Clear headers include Summary, Education, Professional Experience, Certifications, and Skills or Technical Skills.”
Spathis recommends software engineers and other relevant roles include a link to your Github. (Human reviewers will likely want to take a look.) Also, if you do have a more creative or visually appealing version of your resume, you can always share that in a later phase.
4. The ""usual"" resume advice is still widely applicable
The fundamentals still matter in the era of online applications and ATS tools – especially as AI plays an increasing role in the early phases of recruiting. Two big pieces of conventional career wisdom stand out in this light.
Get feedback on your resume. That could be a peer in the industry, a friend, a recruiter, or a professional resume reviewer or career coach. 
First, get feedback on your resume. That could be a peer in the industry, a friend, a recruiter, or a professional resume reviewer or career coach. But there’s never really a bad time to hear input from others who can give you an informed and honest opinion. That’s especially important to remember if you’re applying to lots of places and hearing nothing in response. Ask (or pay) someone to review your resume – there may be something you missed that’s hurting your chances.
[ Learn the non-negotiable skills, technologies, and processes CIOs are leaning on to build resilience and agility in this HBR Analytic Services report: Pillars of resilient digital transformation: How CIOs are driving organizational agility. ]
Second, treat online applications via a corporate ATS or third-party job app as one tool – but not your only tool. Strategies such as tapping your network (and your network’s networks) are as important as ever because with online applications you risk not even getting past the first step. You need a multi-pronged search strategy.
5. Remember: A strong resume is just the first step
Yes, the first step is important, but it’s just that – a first step. Among other reasons (ethical considerations included) why it’s not a good idea to try to flat-out game an ATS or other app is that even if you succeed, you still have a long way to go. Yes, do the above in terms of things like keywords and formatting. But remember that your resume is just a calling card or introduction of sorts.

“Especially in the tech space, there are many people who are smart enough to beat the system,” Denerrof says. “But in the end, it will always come down to experience and how you handle the latter stages of the interview process. While you want to ‘beat AI’ and get past step one, it is important to be setting yourself up for the steps that come after as well.”

AbstractArtificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. However, technology uptake will be largely driven by clinicians, and there is a paucity of data regarding the attitude that clinicians have to this new technology. In June–August 2019 we conducted an online survey of fellows and trainees of three specialty colleges (ophthalmology, radiology/radiation oncology, dermatology) in Australia and New Zealand on artificial intelligence. There were 632 complete responses (n = 305, 230, and 97, respectively), equating to a response rate of 20.4%, 5.1%, and 13.2% for the above colleges, respectively. The majority (n = 449, 71.0%) believed artificial intelligence would improve their field of medicine, and that medical workforce needs would be impacted by the technology within the next decade (n = 542, 85.8%). Improved disease screening and streamlining of monotonous tasks were identified as key benefits of artificial intelligence. The divestment of healthcare to technology companies and medical liability implications were the greatest concerns. Education was identified as a priority to prepare clinicians for the implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This survey highlights parallels between the perceptions of different clinician groups in Australia and New Zealand about artificial intelligence in medicine. Artificial intelligence was recognized as valuable technology that will have wide-ranging impacts on healthcare.

IntroductionNomograms and clinical algorithms have long played a role in supporting clinical decision-making in medicine. More recently, major advances in research on artificial intelligence (AI) have been applied to medical image analysis with promising results1,2. This technology is now poised for clinical application. In order for AI to fully deliver its potential benefits for healthcare, medical practitioners need to understand and embrace the technology. Equally, patients need to entrust aspects of their healthcare to AI systems.Numerous AI image analysis algorithms have been shown to achieve high level performance, in some instances comparable to human experts, in the detection of a range of diseases in ophthalmology3,4,5, radiology6,7,8, dermatology9,10, and in other fields of medicine. A significant milestone in the clinical application of AI came in 2018 with the US Food and Drug Administration approval of the IDx-DR system for the autonomous detection of referable diabetic retinopathy—the first such approval in any field of medicine2. Although the application of this technology is nascent, it has the potential to transform aspects of healthcare11.As is true for any new medical technology, the extent to which AI algorithms for screening, diagnosis or prognosis are adopted in medicine will be dependent upon the attitudes of clinicians and patients. Consideration of these attitudes and knowledge gaps will therefore be essential for health systems, medical educators, professional bodies, AI developers and regulators. Few studies have examined clinician perceptions of new AI technologies on healthcare provision and the clinical workforce. Those that have been conducted have surveyed the potential impacts of AI in samples of medical students12,13,14, radiology trainees15, radiologists16,17,18, pathologists19, psychiatrists20, general practitioners (GP)21, as well as general physicians, surgeons, and trainees22,23, with contrasting results. Most surveys indicate that clinicians believe that AI will have a positive impact on their profession13,16,17,18,19,22. Psychiatrists and general practitioners indicated that AI would not affect their profession20,21. In contrast, surveys of medical students12 and radiology trainees15 have highlighted concerns about the implications of AI for training and employment prospects24,25,26,27.Areas of medicine that are most reliant on imaging will be amongst the first to be impacted by advances in AI technologies28. These include ophthalmology, radiology/radiation oncology and dermatology. In this study we conducted a survey of fellows and trainees of these specialty colleges in Australia and New Zealand in order to ascertain their current use, understanding and perceptions of AI.ResultsDemographicsA total of 632 trainees and fellows from three specialty colleges (305 ophthalmology, 230 radiology/radiation oncology, and 97 dermatology) completed the survey (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Completed surveys were received from 20.4% of members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) (1279 fellows, 212 trainees), 5.1% of members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) (4505 fellows and trainees) and 13.2% of members of the Australasian College of Dermatologists (ACD) (621 fellows, 113 trainees). RANZCR members included both radiologists (n = 199; 86.5% of RANZCR respondents) and radiation oncologists (n = 31; 13.5% of RANZCR respondents). ACD respondents were from Australia, whereas RANZCO and RANZCR respondents were from Australia and New Zealand. Incomplete surveys (n = 85/717, 11.9%) were excluded from analyses (Supplementary Table 3). Responses from completed surveys are summarised in Supplementary Table 4.Respondents predominantly practiced in metropolitan areas (n = 460, 72.8%), followed by a combination of metropolitan and rural practice (n = 102, 16.1%) and rural practice only (n = 70, 11.1%). Ophthalmologists were more likely to spend at least part of their time in a rural setting than radiologists/radiation oncologists or dermatologists (32.5%, 21.7% and, 23.7% respectively, p = 0.064). Respondents from each group had similar years of professional experience (p = 0.608) and almost half of all respondents had been in practice for 20 years or more (n = 303, 47.9%) (see Supplementary Table 2).Current knowledge and use of artificial intelligence in clinical practiceAlmost half of respondents (47.6%; n = 301) rated their knowledge of AI as average relative to their peers, with few rating their knowledge as excellent (n = 35, 5.5%) or very poor (n = 31, 4.9%) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4). Responses were similar across the three professional groups (p = 0.542). Most respondents indicated that they had never used AI applications in their work as a clinician (511, 80.9%). Ophthalmologists were more than twice as likely to use AI in their daily clinical practice than radiologists/radiation oncologists or dermatologists (15.7%, 6.1% and 5.2%, respectively, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2). Among the 67 ophthalmologists who specified how AI was utilized in their clinics, applications included those for glaucoma progression analysis, optical coherence tomography assessment, diabetic retinopathy image assessment and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation (Supplementary Table 5). Among the 40 radiologists/radiation oncologists who provided details as to how they use AI, applications included those for automated organ and lesion detection using computer aided detection of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (Supplementary Table 5). Among 8 dermatologists, the most common applications included those for skin lesion surveillance and voice transcription (Supplementary Table 5). Respondents who reported using AI had higher self-reported knowledge of AI than those that did not (p = 0.008).Figure 1Self-reported knowledge of artificial intelligence and its application in the respondent’s specialty, relative to peers in that field.Full size imageFigure 2Current frequency of artificial intelligence use in clinical practice.Full size imagePerceived impact of artificial intelligence on the professionMost respondents predicted that the introduction of AI would improve their field of practice (n = 449, 71.0% agreed or strongly agreed, Fig. 3). Almost two thirds (n = 379, 60.0%) of respondents believed that it would be ≤ 5 years before AI had a noticeable impact on their specialty (Fig. 4). No respondents reported that AI would never have a noticeable impact on their profession. Respondents who reported using AI predicted that the impact would be apparent sooner that respondents who did not (p < 0.001).Figure 3Levels of agreement with the statement “the field of [your specialty] will improve with the introduction of artificial intelligence”.Full size imageFigure 4Perceived length of time before artificial intelligence has a noticeable impact on [your specialty].Full size imageThe majority of respondents (n = 452, 71.1%) reported that AI will impact workforce needs ‘somewhat’ or ‘to a great extent’ in these specialty areas of medicine within the next decade. Most (n = 542, 85.8%) respondents believed that AI will impact workforce needs ‘somewhat’ or ‘to a great extent’ beyond the next decade. Radiologists/radiation oncologists were more likely to report workforce needs will be impacted ‘to a great extent’ within the next decade than ophthalmologists or dermatologists (54.4%, 41.6%, and 43.3%, respectively, p = 0.04) (Supplementary Table 4; Fig. 5).Figure 5Estimated impact of artificial intelligence on workforce needs within (< 10 years) and beyond (> 10 years) the next decade for each specialty group.Full size imageThe majority of radiologists/radiation oncologists (n = 202, 87.8%) and dermatologists (n = 53, 54.6%) considered that their medical specialist workforce would be impacted by AI to a greater extent than other health professionals in their field of practice (such as radiographers or general practitioners). In contrast, ophthalmologists considered that the impact of AI on the workforce would be greater for optometrists, than for general practitioners or ophthalmologists. Respondents who reported using AI were more likely to report that the introduction of AI would lead to the need for an increase in workforce numbers than did those who did not use AI (p = 0.006).Acceptable artificial intelligence performance standards and clinical workflowsMost survey respondents considered that AI systems would need to achieve performance that was superior to the average performing specialist when applied to screening for disease (n = 405, 64.1%, Fig. 6A) or for diagnostic decision support (n = 506, 80.1%, Fig. 6B).Figure 6100% stacked bars showing the acceptable level of error for an AI tool used for (A) disease screening and (B) clinical decision support.Full size imageRadiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists were twice as likely as ophthalmologists to consider that AI screening systems should have error levels superior to the best performing specialist (21.7%, 20.6%, and 10.5% respectively, p = 0.005, Fig. 6A).Expectations for system performance were even higher when used for diagnostic decision support by specialists. Accordingly, radiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists were each more likely than ophthalmologists to expect AI systems to be superior to the best performing specialist when used for decision support (30.9% and 23.9% and 19.0% respectively, p = 0.035, Fig. 6B).A hypothetical clinical workflow was proposed as follows: “patient clinical images undergo artificial intelligence analysis. A specialist subsequently reviews both the image and the artificial intelligence findings”. Most respondents would consider using this clinical workflow, however significantly more ophthalmologists and radiologists/radiation oncologists were willing to consider this than dermatologists (82.0%, 82.6%, and 67.0% respectively, p < 0.001).Perceived advantages of the use of artificial intelligenceThe top three ranked potential advantages of AI were (1) improved patient access to disease screening, (2) improved diagnostic confidence, and (3) reduced time spent by specialists on monotonous tasks. The top ranked advantage for ophthalmologists and dermatologists was ‘improved patient access to disease screening’ and the top ranked advantage for radiologists/radiation oncologists was ‘reduced time spent on monotonous tasks’ (Fig. 7).Figure 7Radar plot showing the highest scoring responses for the greatest perceived advantages of the use of artificial intelligence.

Plot axes represent the average ranks for all respondents, with higher scores indicating a higher ranking/stronger preference.Full size imagePreparedness for the introduction of artificial intelligence in clinical practiceA minority of respondents (n = 87; 13.8%) felt that the specialist training colleges were adequately prepared for the introduction of AI into clinical practice. Qualitative analysis of a total of 632 open-ended responses was performed, with similar responses grouped according to theme. Examples of verbatim responses are provided for each of the top five themes in Supplementary Table 6. Many respondents (n = 285) highlighted a need for improved training and education of college members about AI via scientific meetings, seminars, and the training curriculum. Some respondents highlighted the need for the colleges to be proactive in their approach in order to safeguard member interests (n = 99), with one participant requesting the college “make sure any changes are in the best interests of patients and [the] profession”. Others endorsed the development of frameworks and/or guidelines for AI implementation by the colleges (n = 30). The formation of sub-committees and working groups with expertise in AI to develop position statements (n = 46) was seen by some as a priority. Other response themes related to colleges taking leadership in relation to AI policy development and licensing (n = 74) and to be intimately involved in the trial and application of emerging AI systems (n = 69). Others called for the development of measures to ensure patient safety (n = 16) and the optimisation of clinical outcomes (n = 17).Ensuring that patient care remains in the realm of (the specialist) (n = 39) was recognized as a priority. In addition, the implementation of measures to assist clinicians in adapting to changes in care delivery (n = 17) was reported as a goal, with one respondent stating that this will “assist trainees to prepare for the AI era”. Some respondents highlighted a need for colleges to support more AI research (n = 69) and engage with industry, regulators and Government (n = 74). A need for clarity regarding the responsibilities of clinicians who will use the technology was also emphasised. Several respondents highlighted the need for a redefinition of the professional scope of specialists and related healthcare provider groups as AI is deployed more widely in clinical practice.Analysis according demographic subgroupsNo statistical differences were found for responses based on location of practice (metropolitan, rural or both, p > 0.149, Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, differences were noted based on years of clinical experience (Supplementary Table 8). Respondents currently in training were more than twice as likely than qualified specialists to consider that AI will impact workforce needs ‘to a great extent’ within the next decade (p < 0.001), despite no differences in self-reported knowledge of AI and its applications between these groups. Similarly, those still in training (n = 44, 66.7%) or with less than 5 years of experience as a specialist (n = 41, 66.1%) were more likely to believe that AI would impact practice ‘to a great extent’ beyond the next decade than were those with 20–30 years of experience or more than 30 years of experience (p < 0.001). Those with more than 30 years of experience were less likely to believe that workforce needs would decrease compared to those with fewer years of practice (p = 0.007).Comparison of responses between radiologists and radiation oncologistsDespite the distinct clinical roles of radiologists and radiation oncologists, no meaningful differences were detected in responses between the two professional groups (p ≥ 0.14), with the exception of knowledge of AI (radiation oncologists were more likely to rate their knowledge as below average compared to their peers, p = 0.02) and the number of years before AI has a noticeable effect on their field (radiation oncologists were more likely to believe that the effect will be noticeable within the next five years, p = 0.01). It is possible that responses from a larger sample of specialists in these fields may identify group differences.DiscussionThis survey was conducted to understand the perceptions of ophthalmologists, radiologists/radiation oncologists, and dermatologists about AI. These groups were selected as image analysis is a core work task for each profession and a variety of AI tools are being developed specifically for these specialties. To our knowledge, this survey is one of the first of its kind to investigate these specialist groups in parallel.Most survey respondents perceived the introduction of AI technology in their respective fields as a positive advance. A recent survey of fellows and trainees of the Canadian Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons had similar findings: 72.2% of 3,919 respondents indicated that AI would have a positive impact on workflow and/or clinical practice and patient experience. Only 17.2% of respondents in the Canadian survey indicated that AI would have either a negative impact on workflow or place their specialty at risk. These generally positive sentiments regarding AI have been echoed across a range of medical specialties in previous surveys13,14,15,16,19,22,23, however, surveys of general practitioners21 and of psychiatrists20 have indicated that the potential of AI may be limited for these groups. Similar to our findings, low rates of clinical AI use by radiologists/radiation oncologists have previously been reported, indicating that AI has not yet been widely adopted in this field15,16. However, it is possible that AI use is underreported in surveys such as this due to a lack of visibility of algorithms that are deployed within imaging platforms or variations in the interpretation of what constitutes AI.Most respondents considered that AI will have a noticeable impact on clinical practice within the next 5 years and on workforce needs within the next decade. In contrast, participants with more years of clinical experience were less likely to believe AI would have an impact on workforce needs within and beyond the coming decade, and current AI users were more likely to believe that workforce needs would increase. The current survey did not explore the basis for these diverging opinions. A survey of radiologists in the United States reported that AI would dramatically influence professional duties, however, the impact on workforce numbers was not ascertained15. Other surveys have indicated that workforce needs would remain stable or increase over the coming decade despite the introduction of AI16,18. Understanding the basis for these different perceptions on the impact of AI on the future medical workforce may be an interesting subject for further study.Improved access to disease screening was reported by ophthalmologists and dermatologists as the greatest perceived advantage to the use of AI. Recognition of the need for increased disease screening capacity may be explained by the combined effects of workforce maldistribution in regional and rural areas versus urban areas and projected increases in the burden of diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer, due to population ageing and growth29,30. The perceived advantage of reducing time on monotonous tasks by radiologists/radiation oncologists is not surprising given the large and growing volume of images viewed by these practitioners. Other studies have similarly identified reduced administrative burden and decreased image interpretation time as advantages of AI use for primary care physicians21 and pathologists16.The adoption of AI tools by clinicians is likely to be influenced by the extent to which they can be integrated into clinical workflows, enhance efficiency and achieve acceptable levels of performance31. The standards set by regulators of AI applications for health may not be directly aligned with the expectations of clinicians in practice. Interestingly, dermatologists were less accepting of a proposed clinical workflow which included AI-assisted diagnosis. This may be attributable to the distinct clinical practices of dermatologists31. Survey respondents had universally high expectations of AI system performance. There are many examples of AI outperforming humans1,2, however, until this study, little was known of the level of performance clinicians expect from AI systems.In keeping with high expectations for AI system performance, respondents were concerned about medical liability due to machine error. Legal processes for dealing with harms arising from new technologies have evolved in parallel with innovation, however the legal, moral and ethical considerations are increasingly challenging as technologies become more autonomous32,33. Lessons learned from autonomous vehicle technologies may provide some guidance, but this remains an area for further research and broad-based consultation33,34.An additional concern of respondents was a reduced reliance on medical specialists as a consequence of AI adoption. This concern is consistent with the impact of the technology on future workforce needs reported in this and other studies15,16,19. It is interesting that the primary concern of respondents was the divestment of healthcare to large technology companies. General mistrust in large technology companies has been documented recently35 and specifically in relation to healthcare36. Accordingly, numerous survey respondents called for leadership from specialist colleges and representative bodies to educate their members and to contribute to frameworks for the development, adoption and regulation of AI technologies in healthcare. The recent survey of fellows and residents conducted as part of the Canadian Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons Taskforce Report on Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Digital Technologies, similarly indicated that digital health literacy standards should be introduced and that governing bodies should take a proactive approach to AI23. Respondents called for improved training and education to improve awareness of AI and to increase proficiency in data science and statistics. Needs for training in ethics and legal aspects of AI ranked second to basic AI proficiency for fellows23.The limitations of this survey warrant consideration. Volunteer response bias means that the results may not be broadly representative of the views of clinicians in Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, the survey may not be generalizable beyond these countries. As response rates from radiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists were low, it is not possible to ascertain whether the views of respondents are representative of others in these specialty groups. Finally, the survey design imposes limitations on the scope of response options and thus the survey findings should not be regarded as a comprehensive account of the perceptions of respondents. This limitation was mitigated by the inclusion of open-ended questions.In conclusion, this survey highlights major similarities between the perceptions of ophthalmologists, radiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists in Australia and New Zealand about the application of AI in medicine. Overall, AI was regarded as a means to improve patient access to care, as well as to enhance clinical efficiency and performance. Concerns were raised about the influence of large technology and data companies, implications for medical liability and reduced reliance on medical specialists. As the successful implementation of AI in healthcare is dependent on detailed understanding of clinician and patient expectations of the technology, further research in these domains is needed.MethodsThis prospective anonymous online survey was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (HREC 18-1408HL) and was conducted in accordance with the doctrines of the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions. Electronic informed consent was obtained from each participant online prior to survey commencement.Survey designStudy data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Centre for Eye Research Australia. Survey questions were developed after a review of previous survey literature and in consultation with ophthalmologists, radiologists and dermatologists to ensure face validity. Example scenarios and related occupational fields differed between surveys designed for each specialty. Draft surveys were circulated to executives from the RANZCO, the RANZCR and the ACD for testing. The survey consisted of 18 multiple choice and open-ended questions (Supplementary Table 1). An additional question was included for radiologists and radiation oncologists to enable differentiation between these professional groups. Questions focused on frequency of AI use, knowledge, workforce impact, preparedness for future AI implementation, acceptable levels of error, individual concerns and barriers. Survey invitations were emailed by college staff to all fellows and trainees of the colleges residing in Australia and New Zealand. Dermatology respondents were from Australia alone. Participation in this anonymous survey was voluntary and no incentives were provided.Data analysisMultiple choice questions were analysed using Stata (v15.1, StataCorp, College Station, Texas). A complete-case analysis was conducted (i.e., incomplete surveys were excluded from the analyses, see Supplementary Table 3). Responses were compared according to profession, location of practice and years of experience using the Pearson’s χ2 test. Two-sided significance testing was conducted with an alpha of 5%. Thematic analysis of the response to “What do you think the college should do in preparation for the deployment of AI?” was undertaken using a ‘bottom up’ approach. Two authors (PR and XH) generated a list of initial codes after reviewing responses. Codes were built into broader categories and recurring themes were developed. Thematic discrepancies were resolved via discussion. Responses to questions regarding advantages and disadvantages of AI were analysed as follows: the first preference of each respondent received a score of 3, the second preference a score of 2 and the third preference a score of 1. Scores were tallied for each response and divided by the number of respondents to provide an overall score for each response. Higher scores indicate higher rankings. Scores were displayed as radar plots (Figs. 7, 8).

","{'headline': 'A survey of clinicians on the use of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology, dermatology, radiology and radiation oncology', 'description': 'Artificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. However, technology uptake will be largely driven by clinicians, and there is a paucity of data regarding the attitude that clinicians have to this new technology. In June–August 2019 we conducted an online survey of fellows and trainees of three specialty colleges (ophthalmology, radiology/radiation oncology, dermatology) in Australia and New Zealand on artificial intelligence. There were 632 complete responses (n\u2009=\u2009305, 230, and 97, respectively), equating to a response rate of 20.4%, 5.1%, and 13.2% for the above colleges, respectively. The majority (n\u2009=\u2009449, 71.0%) believed artificial intelligence would improve their field of medicine, and that medical workforce needs would be impacted by the technology within the next decade (n\u2009=\u2009542, 85.8%). Improved disease screening and streamlining of monotonous tasks were identified as key benefits of artificial intelligence. The divestment of healthcare to technology companies and medical liability implications were the greatest concerns. Education was identified as a priority to prepare clinicians for the implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This survey highlights parallels between the perceptions of different clinician groups in Australia and New Zealand about artificial intelligence in medicine. Artificial intelligence was recognized as valuable technology that will have wide-ranging impacts on healthcare.', 'datePublished': '2021-03-04T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2021-03-04T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '10', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84698-5', 'keywords': ['Health care', 'Health occupations', 'Health policy', 'Mathematics and computing', 'Medical research', 'Software', 'Science', 'Humanities and Social Sciences', 'multidisciplinary'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig3_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig4_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig5_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig6_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig7_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig8_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Scientific Reports', 'issn': ['2045-2322'], 'volumeNumber': '11', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Jane Scheetz', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Philip Rothschild', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'University of Melbourne', 'address': {'name': 'Ophthalmology, Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Myra McGuinness', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'University of Melbourne', 'address': {'name': 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Xavier Hadoux', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'H.

It was launched by Craig Raine’s poem “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home” (1979). The poem systematically deploys the technique of estrangement or defamiliarization—what the Russian formalist critics called ostranenie—as our bemused Martian wrestles into his comprehension a series of puzzling human habits and gadgets: “Model T is a room with the lock inside— / a key is turned to free the world / for movement.” Or, later in the poem: “In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps, / that snores when you pick it up.” For a few years, alongside the usual helpings of Hughes, Heaney, and Larkin, British schoolchildren learned to launder these witty counterfeits: “Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings / And some are treasured for their markings— / they cause the eyes to melt / or the body to shriek without pain. / I have never seen one fly, but / Sometimes they perch on the hand.” Teachers liked Raine’s poem, and perhaps the whole Berlitz-like apparatus of Martianism, because it made estrangement as straightforward as translation. What is the haunted apparatus? A telephone, miss. Well done. What are Caxtons? Books, sir. Splendid.Estrangement is powerful when it puts the known world in doubt, when it makes the real truly strange; but most powerful when it is someone’s estrangement, bringing into focus the partiality of a human being (a child, a lunatic, an immigrant, an émigré). Raine’s poem, turning estrangement into a system, has the effect of making the Martian’s incomprehension a familiar business, once we’ve got the hang of it. And since Martians don’t actually exist, their misprision is less interesting than the human variety. The Martian’s job, after all, is to misread the human world. Human partiality is more suggestive—intermittent, irrational, anxious. One can crave a more proximate estrangement: how about, rather than an alien sending a postcard home, a resident alien, or a butler, or even a cloned human being doing so?But it’s one thing to achieve that effect in a poem, which can happily float image upon image, and another to do so in a novel that commits itself to a tethered point of view. It would be hard not to personalize estrangement when writing fiction. The eminent Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky was interested in Tolstoy’s use of the technique, noting that it consists in the novelist’s refusal to let his characters name things or events “properly,” describing them as if for the first time. In “War and Peace,” for instance, Natasha goes to the opera, which she dislikes and can’t understand. Tolstoy’s description captures Natasha’s perspective, and the opera is seen in the “wrong” way—as large people singing for no reason and spreading out their arms absurdly in front of painted boards.The twentieth century’s most ecstatic defamiliarizer was Vladimir Nabokov, who had a weakness for visual gags of the Martian sort—a half-rolled and sopping black umbrella seen as “a duck in deep mourning,” an Adam’s apple “moving like the bulging shape of an arrased eavesdropper,” and so on. But in his most affecting novel, “Pnin” (1957), estrangement is the condition and the sentence of the novel’s hapless hero, the Russian émigré professor Timofey Pnin. In Tolstoyan fashion, Pnin is seeing America as if for the first time, and often gets it wrong: “A curious basketlike net, somewhat like a glorified billiard pocket—lacking, however, a bottom—was suspended for some reason above the garage door.” Later, we learn that Pnin must have mistaken a Shriners’ hall or a veterans’ hall for the Turkish consulate, because of the crowds of fez wearers he has seen entering the building.In the English literary scene, both Craig Raine and Martin Amis have been, in their devotion to Nabokov, flamboyant Martians. Such writing is thought to prove its quality in the delighted originality of its rich figures of speech; what Amis has called “vow-of-poverty prose” has no place at the high table of estrangement. Cliché and kitsch are abhorred as deadening enemies. (Nabokov regularly dismissed writers such as Camus and Mann for failing to reach what he considered this proper mark.) Kazuo Ishiguro, a consummate vow-of-poverty writer, would seem to be far from that table. Most of his recent novels are narrated in accents of punishing blandness; all of them make plentiful use of cliché, banality, evasion, pompous circumlocution. His new novel, “Klara and the Sun” (Knopf), contains this hilarious dullness: “Josie and I had been having many friendly arguments about how one part of the house connected to another. She wouldn’t accept, for instance, that the vacuum cleaner closet was directly beneath the large bathroom.” Aha, we say to ourselves, we’re back in Ishiguro’s tragicomic and absurdist world, where the question of a schoolkid’s new pencil case (“Never Let Me Go”), or how a butler devises exactly the right “staff plan” (“The Remains of the Day”), or just waiting for a non-arriving bus (“The Unconsoled”) can stun the prose for pages.But “Klara and the Sun” confirms one’s suspicion that the contemporary novel’s truest inheritor of Nabokovian estrangement—not to mention its best and deepest Martian—is Ishiguro, hiding in plain sight all these years, lightly covered by his literary veils of torpor and subterfuge. Ishiguro, like Nabokov, enjoys using unreliable narrators to filter—which is to say, estrange—the world unreliably. (In all his work, only his previous novel, “The Buried Giant,” had recourse to the comparative stability of third-person narration, and was probably the weaker for it.) Often, these narrators function like people who have emigrated from the known world, like the clone Kathy, in “Never Let Me Go,” or like immigrants to their own world. When Stevens the butler, in “The Remains of the Day,” journeys to Cornwall to meet his former colleague Miss Kenton, it becomes apparent that he has never ventured out of his small English county near Oxford.These speakers are often concealing or repressing something unpleasant—both Stevens and Masuji Ono, the narrator of “An Artist of the Floating World,” are evading their complicity with fascist politics. They misread the world because reading it “properly” is too painful. The blandness of Ishiguro’s narrators is the very rhetoric of their estrangement; blandness is the evasive truce that repression has made with the truth. And we, in turn, are first lulled, then provoked, and then estranged by this sedated equilibrium. “Never Let Me Go” begins, “My name is Kathy H. I’m thirty-one years old, and I’ve been a carer now for over eleven years.” That ordinary voice seems at first so familiar, but quickly comes to seem significantly odd, and then wildly different from our own.You can argue that, at least since Kafka, estrangement of various kinds has been the richest literary resource in fiction—in Kafkaesque fantasy or horror, in science fiction and dystopian writing, in unreliable narration, in the literature of flâneurial travel as practiced by a writer like W. G. Sebald, and in the literature of exile and immigration. Ishiguro has mastered all these genres, sometimes combining them in a single book, always on his own singular terms. Sebald, for instance, was rightly praised for the strange things he did with his antiquarian first-person prose, as his narrators wander through an eerily defamiliarized English and European landscape. But Ishiguro got there before him, and the prose of “The Remains of the Day” (1989) may well have influenced the Anglo-German author of “The Rings of Saturn” (1995). Here, Stevens describes the experience of driving away from familiar territory, as he sets out from Darlington Hall:But then eventually the surroundings grew unrecognizable and I knew I had gone beyond all previous boundaries. I have heard people describe the moment, when setting sail in a ship, when one finally loses sight of the land. I imagine the experience of unease mixed with exhilaration often described in connection with this moment is very similar to what I felt in the Ford as the surroundings grew strange around me. . . . The feeling swept over me that I had truly left Darlington Hall behind, and I must confess I did feel a slight sense of alarm—a sense aggravated by the feeling that I was perhaps not on the correct road at all, but speeding off in totally the wrong direction into a wilderness.This might well be one of Sebald’s troubled intellectuals, his mind full of literature and death, tramping around a suddenly uncanny Europe—a “wilderness.” Stevens is, in fact, just driving to the blameless cathedral town of Salisbury.Klara, the narrator of Ishiguro’s new novel, is a kind of robot version of Stevens, and a kind of cousin of Kathy H. She’s a carer, a servant, a helpmeet, a toy. “Klara and the Sun” opens like something out of “Toy Story” or the children’s classic “Corduroy” (in which a slightly ragged Teddy bear, waiting patiently in a department store, is first turned down by Mother, and finally plucked by her delighted young daughter). Klara is an Artificial Friend, or AF, and is waiting with anticipation to be chosen from a store that seems to be in an American city, sometime in the nearish future. As far as one can tell, the AFs, which are solar-powered and A.I.-endowed, are a combination of doll and robot. They can talk, walk, see, and learn. They have hair and wear clothes. They appear to be especially prized as companions for children and teen-agers. A girl named Josie, whom Klara estimates, in her pedantic A.I. way, to be “fourteen and a half,” sees our narrator in the shopwindow, and excitedly chooses Klara as her AF.Video From The New YorkerCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial SocialismTwo kinds of estrangement operate in Ishiguro’s novel. There’s the relatively straightforward defamiliarization of science fiction. Ishiguro only lightly shades in his dystopian world, probably because he isn’t especially committed to the systematic faux realism required by full-blown science fiction. Still, we must navigate around a fictional universe that seems much like our own, yet where people endlessly stare at, or press, their handheld “oblongs,” where adults are somehow stratified by their clothes (“The mother was an office worker, and from her shoes and suit we could tell she was high-ranking”), and where roadworkers are called “overhaul men.” In this colorless, ruthless place, children are fatalistically sorted into losers and winners; the latter, who are known as “lifted,” whose parents decided to “go ahead” with them, are destined for élite colleges and bright futures. Josie’s best friend, Rick, wasn’t lifted, and it will now be a struggle for him to get a place at Atlas Brookings (“their intake of unlifteds is less than two percent”). The parents of Josie’s privileged peers wonder why Rick’s parents decided not to go ahead with him. Did they just lose their nerve? It seems significant that the lifted Josie has an AF for companionship and solace, while the poorer, unlifted Rick does not.Subtler than this teasing nomenclature are the cloudier hermeneutics that have always interested Ishiguro. Klara is a fast learner, but she’s only as competent as her algorithms permit, and the world outside the shop can overwhelm her. Her misreadings are suggestive, and since she narrates the book, the reader is supposed to snag on them, too. She seems to lack the word for drones, and calls them “machine birds.” She makes a handy phrase out of the fact that Josie’s mother always drinks coffee swiftly in the morning—“the Mother’s quick coffee.” When Klara is taken for a drive, she marvels that cars would appear on the other side of the road “in the far distance and come speeding towards us, but the drivers never made errors and managed to miss us.” She interprets a block of city houses thus: “There were six of them in a row, and the front of each had been painted a slightly different color, to prevent a resident climbing the wrong steps and entering a neighbor’s house by mistake.” When Klara hears Josie crying, the cracked lament is novel to her, and she renders it with naked precision: “Not only was her voice loud, it was as if it had been folded over onto itself, so that two versions of her voice were being sounded together, pitched fractionally apart.”The pathos and the interest of her misapprehensions are deepened by her proximity to us: she’s like a child, or perhaps an autistic adult, looking for signals, trying to copy. As in “The Remains of the Day” and “Never Let Me Go,” Ishiguro has created a kind of human simulacrum (a butler, a clone) in order to cast an estranging eye on the pain and brevity of human existence. Pain enters the world of this novel as it does ordinary life, by way of illness and death: Josie suffers from an unnamed disease. Klara had noticed, at their first meeting at the store, that Josie was pale and thin, and that “her walk wasn’t like that of other passers-by.” We learn that Josie had a sister, who died young. When Klara first hears Josie sobbing in the night (that folded-over sound), the teen-ager is calling for her mother, and crying out, “Don’t want to die, Mom. I don’t want that.” As Josie begins to decline, we realize that Klara was selected to be the special kind of AF who may be required to comfort a young, dying human, and one who may uselessly outlive her human mistress.What sense can an artificial intelligence make of death? For that matter, what sense can human intelligence make of death? Isn’t there something artificial in the way that humans conspire to suppress the certainty of their own extinction? We invest great significance in the hope for, and meaning of, longevity, but, seen from a cosmic viewpoint—by God, or by an intelligent robot—a long life is still a short life, whether one dies at nineteen or ninety. “Never Let Me Go” wrung a profound parable out of such questions: the embodied suggestion of that novel is that a free, long, human life is, in the end, just an unfree, short, cloned life.“Klara and the Sun” continues this meditation, powerfully and affectingly. Ishiguro uses his inhuman, all too human narrators to gaze upon the theological heft of our lives, and to call its bluff. When Pascal wrote that “an image of men’s condition” was “a number of men in chains, all condemned to death, some of whom are slaughtered daily within view of the others, so that those who are left see their own condition in that of their fellows, and, regarding one another with sorrow and without hope, wait their turn,” the vision was saved from darkest tragedy by God’s certain presence and salvation. Ishiguro offers no such promise. We learn, late in the book, that Artificial Friends are all subject to what is called a “slow fade,” as their batteries expire. Of course, we, too, are subject to a slow fade; it might be the definition of a life.Klara wants to save Josie from early death, but she can do this only within her understanding and her means, which is where the novel’s title becomes movingly significant. Because the AFs are solar-powered, they lose energy and vitality without the sun’s rays; so, quite logically, the sun is a life-giving pagan god to them. Klara capitalizes the Sun, and speaks often of “a special kind of nourishment from the Sun,” “the Sun and his kindness to us,” and so on. When Klara joins Josie’s household, she assesses the kitchen as “an excellent room for the Sun to look into.” Before she left the store, a troubling incident had occurred. Roadwork had started outside the shop, and the workers had parked a smoke-belching machine on the street. Klara knows only that the machine’s three short funnels create enough smoke to blot out sunlight. It has a name, Cootings, on its side, so Klara takes to calling it the Cootings Machine. There are several days of smoke and fumes. When a customer mentions “pollution” (which Klara capitalizes), and points through the shopwindow at the machine, adding “how dangerous Pollution was for everyone,” Klara gets the idea that the Cootings Machine “might be a machine to fight Pollution.” But another AF tells her that “it was something specially designed to make more of it.” Klara begins to see the battle between the sinister Cootings Machine and the Sun as one between rival forces of darkness and light: “The Sun, I knew, was trying his utmost, and towards the end of the second bad afternoon, even though the smoke was worse than ever, his patterns appeared again, though only faintly. I became worried and asked Manager if we’d still get all our nourishment.”So Klara begins to construct a world view—a cosmogony, really—around her life-giving god. If the Sun nourishes AFs, it must nourish humans, too. If the Sun is a god, then perhaps one might pray to this god; one might, eventually, bargain and cajole, as Abraham did with the Lord. So Klara prays to the Sun: “Please make Josie better. . . . Josie’s still a child and she’s done nothing unkind.” And she has a specific bargain in mind. She tells the Sun that she knows how much he dislikes Pollution. “Supposing I were able somehow to find this machine and destroy it,” she says. “To put an end to its Pollution. Would you then consider, in return, giving your special help to Josie?” Klara sets about vandalizing the first Cootings Machine she comes across, apparently unaware that it’s not the only one in the world.Other writers might labor to make their science fiction more coherent. Ishiguro seems unconcerned that our AF somehow understands godly mercy and “sin” (“she’s done nothing unkind”) but can’t work out why houses are painted different colors. Another novelist might play up the dystopian ecological implications of a world in which the sun is beset by forces of life-quenching darkness. These implications are certainly present here. But Ishiguro keeps his eye on the human connection. Only Ishiguro, I think, would insist on grounding this speculative narrative so deeply in the ordinary; only he would add, to a description of a battle between sunlight and darkness, Klara’s prosaic and plaintive coda: “I became worried and asked Manager if we’d still get all our nourishment.”Ishiguro invites us to share the logic and the partiality of Klara’s world view by making plain that its logic flows from its partiality—sun equals life equals God—and by making plain how closely her world resembles ours. Her estrangement is ours, a reminder of the provisional nature of our own grasp on reality. No more than Klara can we understand—theologically speaking—why children die, which is why we, from the merely superstitious to the orthodoxly religious, construct our own systems of petition and bargain. If it is time for a child’s slow fade to become an unbearably faster fade, there is nothing, theologically speaking, we can do about it: the sun will continue to shine down—“having no alternative, on the nothing new,” as Beckett had it—on the just and unjust alike. Our prayers evaporate into the solar heat.At one moment in her pleading on behalf of Josie, Klara wheedlingly says to the Sun, “I know favoritism isn’t desirable.” The word has resonance, but weak leverage, in a world premised on systematic favoritism, in which whole classes of society are “lifted” and others are not. In Klara’s world, favoritism is considered not just desirable but apparently essential; she is a product of it. The relation between society’s increasingly invidious, focussed, and sinister patterns of selection (fascism, genetic engineering, “lifting”) and the cosmic arbitrariness of our ultimate destinies has been Ishiguro’s great theme: our nasty efforts at “favoritism” versus God’s or the universe’s inscrutable lack of it. For we die unequally but finally equally, in ways whose randomness seems to challenge all notions of pattern, design, selection. Theology is, in some guises, just the metaphysics of favoritism: a prayer is a postcard asking for a favor, sent upward. Whether our postcards are read by anyone has become the searching doubt of Ishiguro’s recent novels, in which this master, so utterly unlike his peers, goes about creating his ordinary, strange, godless allegories. ♦",,"Estrangement is powerful when it puts the known world in doubt, when it makes the real truly strange; but most powerful when it is someone’s estrangement, bringing into focus the partiality of a human being (a child, a lunatic, an immigrant, an émigré). Raine’s poem, turning estrangement into a system, has the effect of making the Martian’s incomprehension a familiar business, once we’ve got the hang of it. And since Martians don’t actually exist, their misprision is less interesting than the human variety. The Martian’s job, after all, is to misread the human world. Human partiality is more suggestive—intermittent, irrational, anxious. One can crave a more proximate estrangement: how about, rather than an alien sending a postcard home, a resident alien, or a butler, or even a cloned human being doing so?
But it’s one thing to achieve that effect in a poem, which can happily float image upon image, and another to do so in a novel that commits itself to a tethered point of view. It would be hard not to personalize estrangement when writing fiction. The eminent Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky was interested in Tolstoy’s use of the technique, noting that it consists in the novelist’s refusal to let his characters name things or events “properly,” describing them as if for the first time. In “War and Peace,” for instance, Natasha goes to the opera, which she dislikes and can’t understand. Tolstoy’s description captures Natasha’s perspective, and the opera is seen in the “wrong” way—as large people singing for no reason and spreading out their arms absurdly in front of painted boards.
The twentieth century’s most ecstatic defamiliarizer was Vladimir Nabokov, who had a weakness for visual gags of the Martian sort—a half-rolled and sopping black umbrella seen as “a duck in deep mourning,” an Adam’s apple “moving like the bulging shape of an arrased eavesdropper,” and so on. But in his most affecting novel, “Pnin” (1957), estrangement is the condition and the sentence of the novel’s hapless hero, the Russian émigré professor Timofey Pnin. In Tolstoyan fashion, Pnin is seeing America as if for the first time, and often gets it wrong: “A curious basketlike net, somewhat like a glorified billiard pocket—lacking, however, a bottom—was suspended for some reason above the garage door.” Later, we learn that Pnin must have mistaken a Shriners’ hall or a veterans’ hall for the Turkish consulate, because of the crowds of fez wearers he has seen entering the building.
In the English literary scene, both Craig Raine and Martin Amis have been, in their devotion to Nabokov, flamboyant Martians. Such writing is thought to prove its quality in the delighted originality of its rich figures of speech; what Amis has called “vow-of-poverty prose” has no place at the high table of estrangement. Cliché and kitsch are abhorred as deadening enemies. (Nabokov regularly dismissed writers such as Camus and Mann for failing to reach what he considered this proper mark.) Kazuo Ishiguro, a consummate vow-of-poverty writer, would seem to be far from that table. Most of his recent novels are narrated in accents of punishing blandness; all of them make plentiful use of cliché, banality, evasion, pompous circumlocution. His new novel, “Klara and the Sun” (Knopf), contains this hilarious dullness: “Josie and I had been having many friendly arguments about how one part of the house connected to another. She wouldn’t accept, for instance, that the vacuum cleaner closet was directly beneath the large bathroom.” Aha, we say to ourselves, we’re back in Ishiguro’s tragicomic and absurdist world, where the question of a schoolkid’s new pencil case (“Never Let Me Go”), or how a butler devises exactly the right “staff plan” (“The Remains of the Day”), or just waiting for a non-arriving bus (“The Unconsoled”) can stun the prose for pages.
But “Klara and the Sun” confirms one’s suspicion that the contemporary novel’s truest inheritor of Nabokovian estrangement—not to mention its best and deepest Martian—is Ishiguro, hiding in plain sight all these years, lightly covered by his literary veils of torpor and subterfuge. Ishiguro, like Nabokov, enjoys using unreliable narrators to filter—which is to say, estrange—the world unreliably. (In all his work, only his previous novel, “The Buried Giant,” had recourse to the comparative stability of third-person narration, and was probably the weaker for it.) Often, these narrators function like people who have emigrated from the known world, like the clone Kathy, in “Never Let Me Go,” or like immigrants to their own world. When Stevens the butler, in “The Remains of the Day,” journeys to Cornwall to meet his former colleague Miss Kenton, it becomes apparent that he has never ventured out of his small English county near Oxford.
These speakers are often concealing or repressing something unpleasant—both Stevens and Masuji Ono, the narrator of “An Artist of the Floating World,” are evading their complicity with fascist politics. They misread the world because reading it “properly” is too painful. The blandness of Ishiguro’s narrators is the very rhetoric of their estrangement; blandness is the evasive truce that repression has made with the truth. And we, in turn, are first lulled, then provoked, and then estranged by this sedated equilibrium. “Never Let Me Go” begins, “My name is Kathy H. I’m thirty-one years old, and I’ve been a carer now for over eleven years.” That ordinary voice seems at first so familiar, but quickly comes to seem significantly odd, and then wildly different from our own.

But then eventually the surroundings grew unrecognizable and I knew I had gone beyond all previous boundaries. I have heard people describe the moment, when setting sail in a ship, when one finally loses sight of the land. I imagine the experience of unease mixed with exhilaration often described in connection with this moment is very similar to what I felt in the Ford as the surroundings grew strange around me. . . . The feeling swept over me that I had truly left Darlington Hall behind, and I must confess I did feel a slight sense of alarm—a sense aggravated by the feeling that I was perhaps not on the correct road at all, but speeding off in totally the wrong direction into a wilderness.

This might well be one of Sebald’s troubled intellectuals, his mind full of literature and death, tramping around a suddenly uncanny Europe—a “wilderness.” Stevens is, in fact, just driving to the blameless cathedral town of Salisbury.
Klara, the narrator of Ishiguro’s new novel, is a kind of robot version of Stevens, and a kind of cousin of Kathy H. She’s a carer, a servant, a helpmeet, a toy. “Klara and the Sun” opens like something out of “Toy Story” or the children’s classic “Corduroy” (in which a slightly ragged Teddy bear, waiting patiently in a department store, is first turned down by Mother, and finally plucked by her delighted young daughter).

A girl named Josie, whom Klara estimates, in her pedantic A.I. way, to be “fourteen and a half,” sees our narrator in the shopwindow, and excitedly chooses Klara as her AF.

The janus face of Artificial Intelligence creating fairness or accelerating bias?

Automation and AI are both supporting businesses to make better decisions but at the same time are embedding age-old biases. As online and HR platforms increasingly turn to AI (artificial intelligence) and data-driven decisions to attract and retain talent we must include the wider society in doing more to achieve fairness. At Gapsquare, we work to ensure that equality takes centre-stage in such developments.
A few decades ago, as I was deciding which university degree to go for and what skills and qualifications I needed for my future career, tech, engineering and maths were not among my options. In fact, if anyone had told me that I would be using statistical regression models and leading a company that builds software to help create more fairness in employment in 2019 I would have seriously questioned them. But I have had to turn to technology, maths, and  artificial intelligence because they enabled by far the best opportunity to solve a global problem: that of unequal and unfair pay in many companies around the world.
What I have learned during years of working in equalities and technology is that software can help companies create fair pay on a scale and magnitude that no other solution can. What I did not expect is that I would find myself in a world where, while tech and artificial intelligence could offer a solution to equality and fairness at work, it also brings one of the biggest roadblocks to equality.
Tech offers up both the issues of ongoing bias, and the opportunity to resolve inequality for good.
As I pondered my options and weighed up my future at the beginning of my educational journey, the conceptualisation and design of AI that engendered biases was already on its way too. The biases in how humans were moved through the workforce and beyond were being engendered, steadily and often unknowingly, into the technologies defining our future. Nowadays, there are a range of examples of tech and AI demonstrating such bias. It is often easy to see that the data we feed our technology – and the teams that work to develop software – are mostly masculine, mostly white and often middle class.
To give an example, you might remember that last year Amazon hit the headlines because of its AI based hiring tool. The platform was developed by a team of data scientists in Edinburgh, Scotland, using CVs from a ten-year period to train models to identify top engineering talent. The models were programmed to recognise some 50,000 terms showing up in past CVs and select candidates based on the use of terms previously associated with ‘successful’ individuals. Perhaps inevitably, the algorithms began to prioritise applications that included more male-dominated language; words associated with success such as: ‘captured’, ‘created’, and ‘lead’. Candidates who used, for example, the word ‘woman’ in their CVs (i.e. women’s soccer club)  were automatically downgraded.
It wasn’t long before this intrinsic bias became apparent. The candidates being selected were unanimously representative of a group already dominant within the workforce. The technology had ruled out gender diversity in particular. When the company realised what was happening it worked on making the terms more gender neutral, taking backward steps to undo historical bias. The program has since been scrapped, there was just no guarantee that it would not continue to discriminate in other ways.
It’s time to take a magnifying glass to the assumptions our technologies are making and build fairer systems from the ground up.
Though this may not exactly give you hope about the potential of AI and automation, I believe stories like this should help us to see the potential of technology to do more. Technology that embeds bias reveals itself quickly and signals a need for change. It is inevitable that organisations offering ERP (enterprise resource planning) solutions are going to use more artificial intelligence and data-driven decision making to optimise processes, including HR. But there are a few things that can ensure that biases are accounted for. 
It’s time to take a magnifying glass to the assumptions our technologies are making and build fairer systems from the ground up.
At Gapsquare we want to see technology developed to demonstrate a higher level of objectivity and fairness than occurs naturally in human societies (at the moment). But we must all work to make sure that these technologies create fair systems and processes for all. It is time, we think, to question the data going into a system, question the algorithms developed and observe their resultant conclusions. It’s time to take a magnifying glass to the assumptions our technologies are making and build fairer systems from the ground up. In doing so, we ensure that we are embracing the potential and the pay off of building inclusive workplaces and inclusive companies. In doing so we guarantee that the world of tomorrow will look substantially better than the world as we know it today.

Spatial Computing is a blanket term that covers the combined capabilities of some incredibly disruptive innovations in tech that are making their way in the world. These include:Positioning (GPS)Artificial intelligence (AI)The internet of things (IoT)5GMachine learningMixed realityBlockchainRemote sensingGeographic Information Systems (GIS)Spatial Database and Management Systems (SDBMS)Spatial data scienceThe word ‘spatial’ is used, rather than location or geography, because it refers to time as well as physical space. And it is the convergence of our physical and digital worlds. For instance, wearable tech helps monitor our body health as well as tracking our surroundings.

These can then link into Strava or Runtastic to map a ride or run.Meanwhile, professional sports teams are using Catapult (ASX:CAT) wearable tech to monitor players speed, direction, temperature, general wellbeing etc. These measurements are gathered using a mixture of magnetometer, GPS, gyroscopes and accelerometers.An array of possibilitiesThere are now countless navigation apps, ride sharing apps for smart phones and precision agriculture, which each use spatial computing technologies. And these technologies are seeing their use and influence on our lives grow at a rapid pace.Many of these technologies will not be new to you and they’re ingrained within the depths of Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest ETFs, thereby generating further buzz and investment.The reason spatial computing is such a ground-breaking phenomenon is because it offers the potential to revolutionise our world. And in the process, it could very well displace many of the astoundingly successful businesses of today.Here are a few notable businesses currently operating in this space.Augmented Reality: Spatial computing is readily enhancing gaming capabilitiesAugmented reality is rapidly enhancing gaming and entertainment in the consumer space. It also has massive potential for business applications throughout the military, healthcare and manufacturing.Spatial computing is dependent on 3D imaging techniques, such as those experienced through AR/VR headsets, or glasses-free holographic displays. There are many branded products now in this space such as Oculus, Varjo, Pimax, HTC Vive, PSVR, GearVR, Magic Leap, and many more.

This is great fun for immersing children in a physical and virtual learning activity.This week German company TeamViewer (FFT:TMV) acquired US augmented reality software firm Upskill. TeamViewer is a secure remote connectivity solution provider, while Upskill is a pioneer in augmented reality (AR) software for frontline workers. This acquisition greatly enhances TeamViewers global position in providing industry-specific augmented reality solutions. And it follows on from its 2020 acquisition of European wearable software leader Ubimax.China’s ahead of the gameIn China, many companies are coming on leaps and bounds in this arena. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA, HKG: 9988), Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY, HKG:0700), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and JD (NASDAQ:JD) have trained, deployed, and monetized deep learning products at scale.Hong Kong based Artificial intelligence company SenseTime, is leading the way in virtual reality. SenseAR is its Augmented Reality Platform providing AR solutions for the internet entertainment industry, including short videos, live streams, image beautification, and social media apps.During China’s latest Singles Day shopping spree in November, Qiyu’s VR headsets ranked number one in sales on JD.com. Independent VR startup iQIYI Intelligent, created this headset. iQIYI Intelligent, a spinoff from NASDAQ-listed iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ), recently raised several million Chinese Yuan in a Series B funding round.Home electronics company Xiaomi (HKG: 1810) is heavily investing in IoT device start-up companies as well as 5G and other tech start-ups.Then there’s US camera application developer Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which uses augmented reality lenses in its arsenal. And the company believes it has a big revenue growth opportunity in boosting its US ad revenue by placing ads in non-messaging products such as its Snap Map and Spotlight video platform.

(NYSE MKT:ONVO), a 3D biology company. Organovo is delivering scientific and medical breakthroughs using its 3D bioprinting technology. It has 3D printed a human liver.The Company’s 3D bioprinting technology creates tissues that are both spatially patterned and three-dimensional.ARK Invest has also been topping up its holdings in Berkeley Lights (NASDAQ: BLI), now present in its ARKK and ARKG ETFs. ARK currently owns 4.68% of the company. Berkeley Lights uses digital cell biology to advance the field of spatial profiling, allowing researchers to visualise the 3D-spatial organization of genetic material in tissues.Irena Cronin serves as CEO of Infinite Retina which provides research and business strategy to help companies succeed in Spatial Computing. In an interview last year, she said:“Spatial computing is all the technology associated with bringing a 3D realm to it’s users… I’m currently working with a company called Mojo Vision, which is working on an augmented contact lens. So, this is another way you could integrate spatial computing into your world.”

Last year the company won NASA iTech 2020 Cycle 1 competition.“We still have plenty of work to do in the development of Mojo Lens, but our selection by NASA demonstrates a clear desire for innovation in augmented reality and heads-up computing, particularly for space exploration.”Autonomous vehiclesWhile ARK is invested in both Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), it appears to still view Tesla as the superior company with the most potential. Apple and Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) (KOREA SE:005380) were hoping to be teaming up to create an autonomous car but the plug’s been pulled on that deal. Now Apple still hopes to launch an autonomous vehicle in 2024, but ARK is concerned it’s too late to the party. Tesla appears ready to launch a fully autonomous driving service within the next two years, and Waymo launched its driverless robo-taxi to the public via a pilot scheme in Phoenix in October.

Tesla 3D – Photographer: Alexander Shatov | Source: UnsplashThe self-driving car business requires huge sums of money in research and development and is not an easy business to make progress in. Therefore, the big players such as Tesla and Apple are most likely to be the eventual winners.ARK holds Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) in both its ARKF and ARKQ ETFs. Apple has some involvement in spatial computing through its various product development processes. For instance, its new iPads are equipped with LiDAR sensors, which combine lasers and radar to provide spatial depths in the external world. LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging. It’s widely used in autonomous vehicle technology.Apple’s AirPods Pro feature spatial audio which may be crucial in making advanced AR glasses work.Tesla is a possibly the world’s biggest player in the ‘spatial computing’ space according to Robert Scoble, self-proclaimed ‘Spatial Computing evangelist’ and possible ‘Tesla evangelist’ too.As amazing as the battery was, it really just sets up what is next: data and mapping, which sets up killing Apple and Google maps, which sets up Robotaxis and freaking next level driver assistance capabilities, which sets up killing Uber and Lyft (none of these can react).— Scoble (@Scobleizer) September 24, 2020Data and mapping is the futureElon Musk is dropping hints on Tesla’s AI potential on Twitter:“Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.”FSD beta build V8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. Next version is a big step change beyond that. Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 3, 2021Elon Musk dropping Twitter hintsAutonomous DronesUS enterprise autonomous drone manufacturer Skydio has raised $170 million in a Series D funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Growth Fund. It’s now looking at a market value of around $1 billion.In 2019 AiRXOS, a unit of GE Aviation (LON: GEC, NYSE:GE), successfully delivered a human kidney via drone. It travelled from Baltimore’s St. Agnes Hospital to the university’s medical center 2.7 miles away. Drone delivery is an area of spatial computing getting set to transform how interconnected our world is. AiRXOS is working on shaping a new era of autonomous air transportation.Agricultural TechWhile autonomous vehicles seem new, autonomous tractors have been around for a while. And precision agriculture is another area that’s transforming the way food is produced.John Deere (NYSE: DE) recently entered into an allied distribution agreement with Smart Guided Systems to sell its Smart-Apply Intelligent Spray Control System for use with John Deere tractors in high value crop applications. This system uses LiDAR to help farmers reduce the amount of chemicals they use on their crops.Artificial IntelligenceAI covers computing that develops machines that think and work like humans. This can be in the form of speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.DocuSignARK invest has a 0.21% ownership of DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU) and it’s currently in ARKK, ARKW and ARKF ETFs. Contract law improvements and online notarization is growing, and DocuSign is immersing itself in the AI space. DocuSign Insight uses a proven combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies—including natural language processing, machine learning and rules-based logic to help enterprises manage their contracts. This can help reduce the time and cost of reviewing legal documents.MercadoLibreEcommerce company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is found in ARKW and ARKF ETFs. ARK has 0.16% ownership in the Argentinian company. Back in 2018, MercadoLibre acquired Córdoba-based start-up Machinalis, which specializes in the development of machine learning algorithms.MoneyLionFintech company MoneyLion is coming public via a SPAC in a $2.9 billion deal. It’s a modern finance application for individual use. The company uses a combination of artificial intelligence, superior analytics, and machine learning, to analyse customers’ personal finances and deliver uniquely personalized products and services including banking, lending and investing. The blank-check vehicle to bring this to IPO is Fusion Acquisition Corp (NYSE:FUSE).

H2GO Power, in collaboration with the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) and Imperial College London, are trialling the use of artificial intelligence (AI) software coupled with hydrogen technology. H2GO is looking to launch a crowdfunding campaign in the future.SnowflakeSnowflake is a cloud-based data-warehousing company that went public last year. Harnessing data it powers many vital businesses. Strava, the GPS tracking app and social network for athletes, uses Snowflake to power its business. Snowflake’s Geospatial data support in its Cloud Data Platform is introducing intelligent security solutions helping its customers increase profits while reducing fraud and risks.PalantirPalantir Technologies also publicly listed last year. It’s a US software company serving government agencies and private companies. Founded by Billionaire Peter Thiel, it specializes in big data analytics. In Palantir’s IPO S1 SEC registration it states Spatial Information Management as a software category its platform addresses. It also enhances raw video footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources in its Palantir Gotham video application.ModernaModerna is a US pharmaceutical and biotech company. Moderna’s technology platform inserts synthetic nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) into human cells. AI is a big deal in modern medicine and particularly in R&D. It has the ability to lift success rates to up to 50%, while reducing time-to-market, thereby cost saving and profit enhancing. This has been core at the company’s ability to bring its leading COVID-19 vaccine to achieve efficacy levels of 94.5% in a rapid time frame.Should we be worried about China?Again, China appears to be making strides in AI that are giving cause for concern to the US. According to a new report released by The US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence:“China possesses the might, talent, and ambition to surpass the United States as the world’s leader in AI in the next decade if current trends do not change,”And it’s not just AI technology that China is making strides in, the report also mentions quantum computing, robotics, 3D printing and 5G.A spectrum of possibilitiesSpatial Computing covers an enormous array of possible investments in a multitude of exciting technologies and industries. It offers huge scope for innovative improvements in our lives, but it also comes with ethical concerns around privacy and security.Many big names are already extensively deploying investment in R&D in many of these spatial computing areas. Along with those listed above, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAW:AAPL), Uber (NYSE:UBER), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are all involved in one way or another and public government agencies are getting in on the action too.Weather forecasting, anticipating outbreaks of infectious diseases, making homes safe for the elderly and disabled, reducing road-traffic accidents and friendly fire incidents in combat are all potential benefits to ongoing investment in spatial computing.

Not to kill you with lasers, or beat you in chess, or even to ferry you around town in a driverless Uber.These robots are here to merge purchase orders into columns J and K of next quarter’s revenue forecast, and transfer customer data from the invoicing software to the Oracle database. They are unassuming software programs with names like “Auxiliobits — DataTable To Json String,” and they are becoming the star employees at many American companies.Some of these tools are simple apps, downloaded from online stores and installed by corporate I.T. departments, that do the dull-but-critical tasks that someone named Phil in Accounting used to do: reconciling bank statements, approving expense reports, reviewing tax forms. Others are expensive, custom-built software packages, armed with more sophisticated types of artificial intelligence, that are capable of doing the kinds of cognitive work that once required teams of highly-paid humans.White-collar workers, armed with college degrees and specialized training, once felt relatively safe from automation. But recent advances in A.I. and machine learning have created algorithms capable of outperforming doctors, lawyers and bankers at certain parts of their jobs. And as bots learn to do higher-value tasks, they are climbing the corporate ladder.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe trend — quietly building for years, but accelerating to warp speed since the pandemic — goes by the sleepy moniker “robotic process automation.” And it is transforming workplaces at a pace that few outsiders appreciate. Nearly 8 in 10 corporate executives surveyed by Deloitte last year said they had implemented some form of R.P.A. Another 16 percent said they planned to do so within three years.Most of this automation is being done by companies you’ve probably never heard of. UiPath, the largest stand-alone automation firm, is valued at $35 billion — roughly the size of eBay — and is slated to go public later this year. Other companies like Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism, which have Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola and Walgreens Boots Alliance as clients, are also enjoying breakneck growth, and tech giants like Microsoft have recently introduced their own automation products to get in on the action.Executives generally spin these bots as being good for everyone, “streamlining operations” while “liberating workers” from mundane and repetitive tasks. But they are also liberating plenty of people from their jobs. Independent experts say that major corporate R.P.A. initiatives have been followed by rounds of layoffs, and that cutting costs, not improving workplace conditions, is usually the driving factor behind the decision to automate. Craig Le Clair, an analyst with Forrester Research who studies the corporate automation market, said that for executives, much of the appeal of R.P.A. bots is that they are cheap, easy to use and compatible with their existing back-end systems. He said that companies often rely on them to juice short-term profits, rather than embarking on more expensive tech upgrades that might take years to pay for themselves.“It’s not a moonshot project like a lot of A.I., so companies are doing it like crazy,” Mr. Le Clair said. “With R.P.A., you can build a bot that costs $10,000 a year and take out two to four humans.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCovid-19 has led some companies to turn to automation to deal with growing demand, closed offices, or budget constraints. But for other companies, the pandemic has provided cover for executives to implement ambitious automation plans they dreamed up long ago.“Automation is more politically acceptable now,” said Raul Vega, the chief executive of Auxis, a firm that helps companies automate their operations.Before the pandemic, Mr. Vega said, some executives turned down offers to automate their call centers, or shrink their finance departments, because they worried about scaring their remaining workers or provoking a backlash like the one that followed the outsourcing boom of the 1990s, when C.E.O.s became villains for sending jobs to Bangalore and Shenzhen.But those concerns matter less now, with millions of people already out of work and many businesses struggling to stay afloat.Now, Mr. Vega said, “they don’t really care, they’re just going to do what’s right for their business.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSales of automation software are expected to rise by 20 percent this year, after increasing by 12 percent last year, according to the research firm Gartner. And the consulting firm McKinsey, which predicted before the pandemic that 37 million U.S. workers would be displaced by automation by 2030, recently increased its projection to 45 million.A white-collar wake-up callImageHolly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto, oversees an automation project named “robotic process automation.”Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York TimesNot all bots are the job-destroying kind. Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto Insurance Companies, said that her firm has used automation to do 173,000 hours’ worth of work in areas like underwriting and human resources without laying anyone off.“People are concerned that there’s a possibility of losing their jobs, or not having anything to do,” she said. “But once we have a bot in the area, and people see how automation is applied, they’re truly thrilled that they don’t have to do that work anymore.”As bots become capable of complex decision-making, rather than doing single repetitive tasks, their disruptive potential is growing.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRecent studies by researchers at Stanford University and the Brookings Institution compared the text of job listings with the wording of A.I.-related patents, looking for phrases like “make prediction” and “generate recommendation” that appeared in both. They found that the groups with the highest exposure to A.I. were better-paid, better-educated workers in technical and supervisory roles, with men, white and Asian-American workers, and midcareer professionals being some of the most endangered. Workers with bachelor’s or graduate degrees were nearly four times as exposed to A.I. risk as those with just a high school degree, the researchers found, and residents of high-tech cities like Seattle and Salt Lake City were more vulnerable than workers in smaller, more rural communities.“A lot of professional work combines some element of routine information processing with an element of judgment and discretion,” said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who studies the labor effects of automation. “That’s where software has always fallen short. But with A.I., that type of work is much more in the kill path.”

Subscribe and listen.Many of those vulnerable workers don’t see this coming, in part because the effects of white-collar automation are often couched in jargon and euphemism. On their websites, R.P.A. firms promote glowing testimonials from their customers, often glossing over the parts that involve actual humans.“Sprint Automates 50 Business Processes In Just Six Months.” (Possible translation: Sprint replaced 300 people in the billing department.)“Dai-ichi Life Insurance Saves 132,000 Hours Annually” (Bye-bye, claims adjusters.)“600% Productivity Gain for Credit Reporting Giant with R.P.A.” (Don’t let the door hit you, data analysts.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTJason Kingdon, the chief executive of the R.P.A. firm Blue Prism, speaks in the softened vernacular of displacement too. He refers to his company’s bots as “digital workers,” and he explained that the economic shock of the pandemic had “massively raised awareness” among executives about the variety of work that no longer requires human involvement.“We think any business process can be automated,” he said.Mr. Kingdon tells business leaders that between half and two-thirds of all the tasks currently being done at their companies can be done by machines. Ultimately, he sees a future in which humans will collaborate side-by-side with teams of digital employees, with plenty of work for everyone, although he conceded that the robots have certain natural advantages.“A digital worker,” he said, “can be scaled in a vastly more flexible way.”The danger of so-so automationImageSelf-checkout machines don’t help customers, they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift.Credit...Andrew Spear for The New York TimesHumans have feared losing our jobs to machines for millennia. (In 350 BCE, Aristotle worried that self-playing harps would make musicians obsolete.) And yet, automation has never created mass unemployment, in part because technology has always generated new jobs to replace the ones it destroyed.During the 19th and 20th centuries, some lamplighters and blacksmiths became obsolete, but more people were able to make a living as electricians and car dealers. And today’s A.I. optimists argue that while new technology may displace some workers, it will spur economic growth and create better, more fulfilling jobs, just as it has in the past.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut that is no guarantee, and there is growing evidence that this time may be different.In a series of recent studies, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, two well-respected economists who have researched the history of automation, found that for most of the 20th century, the optimistic take on automation prevailed — on average, in industries that implemented automation, new tasks were created faster than old ones were destroyed.Since the late 1980s, they found, the equation had flipped — tasks have been disappearing to automation faster than new ones are appearing.This shift may be related to the popularity of what they call “so-so automation” — technology that is just barely good enough to replace human workers, but not good enough to create new jobs or make companies significantly more productive.A common example of so-so automation is the grocery store self-checkout machine. These machines don’t cause customers to buy more groceries, or help them shop significantly faster — they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift. This simple, substitutive kind of automation, Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Restrepo wrote, threatens not just individual workers, but the economy as a whole.“The real danger for labor,” they wrote, “may come not from highly productive but from ‘so-so’ automation technologies that are just productive enough to be adopted and cause displacement.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOnly the most devoted Luddites would argue against automating any job, no matter how menial or dangerous. But not all automation is created equal, and much of the automation being done in white-collar workplaces today is the kind that may not help workers over the long run.During past eras of technological change, governments and labor unions have stepped in to fight for automation-prone workers, or support them while they trained for new jobs. But this time, there is less in the way of help. Congress has rejected calls to fund federal worker retraining programs for years, and while some of the money in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill Democrats hope to pass this week will go to laid-off and furloughed workers, none of it is specifically earmarked for job training programs that could help displaced workers get back on their feet.Another key difference is that in the past, automation arrived gradually, factory machine by factory machine. But today’s white-collar automation is so sudden — and often, so deliberately obscured by management — that few workers have time to prepare.“The rate of progression of this technology is faster than any previous automation,” said Mr. Le Clair, the Forrester analyst, who thinks we are closer to the beginning than the end of the corporate A.I. boom.“We haven’t hit the exponential point of this stuff yet,” he added. “And when we do, it’s going to be dramatic.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFinding a robot-proof futureThe corporate world’s automation fever isn’t purely about getting rid of workers. Executives have shareholders and boards to satisfy, and competitors to keep up with. And some automation does, in fact, lift all boats, making workers’ jobs better and more interesting while allowing companies to do more with less.But as A.I. enters the corporate world, it is forcing workers at all levels to adapt, and focus on developing the kinds of distinctly human skills that machines can’t easily replicate.Ellen Wengert, a former data processor at an Australian insurance firm, learned this lesson four years ago, when she arrived at work one day to find a bot-builder sitting in her seat.The man, coincidentally an old classmate of hers, worked for a consulting firm that specialized in R.P.A. He explained that he’d been hired to automate her job, which mostly involved moving customer data from one database to another. He then asked her to, essentially, train her own replacement — teaching him how to do the steps involved in her job so that he, in turn, could program a bot to do the same thing.Ms. Wengert wasn’t exactly surprised. She’d known that her job was straightforward and repetitive, making it low-hanging fruit for automation. But she was annoyed that her managers seemed so eager to hand it over to a machine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“They were desperate to create this sense of excitement around automation,” she said. “Most of my colleagues got on board with that pretty readily, but I found it really jarring, to be feigning excitement about us all potentially losing our jobs.”For Ms. Wengert, 27, the experience was a wake-up call. She had a college degree and was early in her career. But some of her colleagues had been happily doing the same job for years, and she worried that they would fall through the cracks.“Even though these aren’t glamorous jobs, there are a lot of people doing them,” she said.She left the insurance company after her contract ended. And she now works as a second-grade teacher — a job she says she sought out, in part, because it seemed harder to automate.Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, is the author of the new book “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation,” from which this essay is adapted.A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2021, Section BU, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Robots Are Coming For Phil in Accounting.

Released by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a federal body created to review and recommend ways to use artificial intelligence for national security purposes, the report recommends the use of AI to update America’s defense plans, predict future threats, deter adversaries and win wars.Because AI will be “incorporated into virtually all future technology,” it is easy to recognize that national security threats and opportunities posed by AI should be a catalyst for necessary changes to defense requirements and resourcing processes. In an AI-enabled world, the Defense Department will be unable to modernize the way it recruits talent, trains the force, develops and integrates technology, and funds all of these elements without internal culture shifts and help from Congress.“Unless the requirements, budgeting and acquisition processes are aligned to permit faster and more targeted execution, the U.S. will fail to stay ahead of potential adversaries.” This blunt recommendation to the Defense Department under the heading “Accelerate Adoption of Existing Digital Technologies” makes clear the urgency for cultural and structural updates to the way the department currently does business.RELATED‘Wakeup call’: Report calls for massive AI investments to counter ChinaThe findings, ordered by Congress, include hundreds of recommendations from experts to get the DoD “AI-ready” by 2025.By Andrew EversdenCommission members, who came principally from the academic and business communities, further noted in the report that:“The sources of battlefield advantage will shift from traditional factors like force size and levels of armaments, to factors like superior data collection and assimilation, connectivity, computing power, algorithms, and system security.”“Perhaps the most urgent and compelling reason to accelerate the use of AI for national security is the possibility that more advanced machine analysis could find and connect the dots before the next attack, when human analysis alone may not see the full picture as clearly.” Simply put, AI will revolutionize the practice of intelligence.The life cycle project management phases used in appropriations categories that govern the defense budget run counter to the trial and error process of AI and other software-based technologies. Thus commissioners recommended that the Defense Department should “Modernize the Budget and Oversight Process for Digital Technologies.”The Defense Department should commit to building budgets that invest at least 3.4 percent of the annual defense budget in science and technology and allocate at least $8 billion for research and development of “core AI.”To be able to afford the implementation of this last recommendation, the department would have to change its acquisition and resourcing approaches to get more and faster bang for its buck. The commission recognized this by proposing a pilot program to “test mission-focused budgeting and appropriations.” Ideally this would lead to the establishment of “a single appropriation and budget structure for software and digital technologies by FY 2023.”In comparison to China’s ability to move quickly with resourcing decisions, another new report released last week about competing in time notes that the inflexibility of the Defense Department budget process, which dates back to 1961, makes it more difficult to rapidly move money to innovations that appear promising. In a good, small step in the right direction, Congress supported the software pilot requested by Defense in its 2021 budget to begin addressing this problem.Now is the time to harness federal buying power and leverage the potential momentum of this wide-ranging report to break the mold, and (as described in the report) come to the aid of “visionary technologists and warfighters [who] largely remain stymied by antiquated technology, cumbersome processes, and incentive structures that are designed for outdated or competing aims.”The Defense Department can do many things for itself through the use of existing laws and rules governing how it buys things. It can also encourage and train its workforce to take risks, try new things and abandon them if they don’t work rather than wasting money to follow through on programs that will be out of date before being deployed. The department should foster a culture of a creative “what if we…” approach to problem-solving and iteratively identify how things connect and can be used differently. Integration and sustainment should not be acquisition afterthoughts.Congress can help by alleviating some of the risks with recommended pilot programs to signal support for a more agile approach to both acquisition and oversight.

In recent months, concerns about the economic impact of the pandemic have been closely tied with a spate of panicked automation headlines like, ""Will Robots Take Our Jobs In A Socially Distanced Era??"".But there's a different reality that showcases the importance of having a robust digital transformation strategy.Already we have seen that incorporating new technologies has led to a dramatic shift in the way industries operate worldwide. We are also witnessing a significant rise in interest for robotic process automation (RPA), intelligent automation and artificial intelligence among business leaders who realize that intelligent automation demonstrates strong transformative potential across all industries.



Business leaders are accelerating the adoption of technologies they view as crucial to digital transformation efforts – like intelligent and robotic process automation – to help them thrive in this tumultuous business environment and beyond.Intelligent automation as a competitive differentiatorBusinesses are constantly met with new restrictions and 63% of business decision makers feel they are struggling to meet customer demands. 93% of those decision makers believe intelligent automation will help solve this problem.


Intelligent automation offers a number of key benefits, from time and money savings to improved efficiency. By implementing all capabilities found in RPA and connecting previously silo'ed departments and improving communication, intelligent automation can help businesses focus on more strategic work. For example: One Michigan-based power company serving 2.2 million customers is using a digital workforce to halve the number of bills that need to be reviewed by human workers. By automating this process, and 35 others, the company is saving 250,000 man hours annually.Related: How Artificial Intelligence Is Reshaping the Insurance IndustryImplementation is on the upswingBusiness leaders are looking to intelligent automation to help reap the benefits of a lighter workload and reduced financial burden. In fact, at the start of 2020, 92% of business leaders already had plans to roll out intelligent automation across their organizations – this number will only go up as we continue to experience the lasting impact of the pandemic. 


Many companies have been building an automation-ready business culture and knowledge workers are ready to embrace their digital coworkers. Only 33% of employees still harbor fears about losing their jobs to automation and 81% have a strong understanding of the benefits intelligent automation can bring to their organizations. Overall, the past year has prepared leaders, and employees alike, to welcome technology that will make for a more agile and efficient hybrid workforce.Related: Fintech Start-Ups Are Growing: What's New To Look For In 2020An adapting workforceThe past year has proved that our workforce is resilient, flexible and capable of adjusting to many challenges. As businesses around the globe embrace new work environments and technologies, we've seen a growing level of trust in automation as employees adapt to digital colleagues. They are excited about the opportunities intelligent automation creates, embracing benefits that allow them to focus more on creative, meaningful work. Businesses that provide employees with training and reassurance as these digital workers are introduced enable the smoothest transition. As the financial strain of the pandemic continues, investment management firms are applying intelligent automation to end-to-end processes for loan applications, getting funds to those in need as quickly as possible. Healthcare organizations are automating the patient diagnostic process, reducing clinical risk by ensuring the process is fast and accurate. 


As organizations in industries like healthcare and financial services introduce intelligent automation, they help their workforce adapt and upskill by retraining employees. In fact, 78% of organizations provide training opportunities when they introduce new technologies. Further 80% of knowledge workers feel comfortable reskilling, indicating a willingness to adapt alongside digital colleagues.The coming robot apocalypse has been greatly exaggeratedWhat could the future hold with digital workers operating alongside human workers? Today's intelligent automation is more sophisticated than ever and does not require the level of manual governance it once did. Businesses can train digital workers to do almost anything (payment processing, monitoring data integrity, management, etc.) freeing human workers to engage in more exciting roles.Blue Prism intelligent digital workers are designed to be more accessible and intuitive to non-tech business users. By offering a no-code automation tool, business teams are empowered with agile operational automation capabilities. This vastly expands access and utilization of both in-house and third party technologies, allowing for business processes to become more easily repeatable, secure, auditable and scalable -- ultimately resulting in higher customer satisfaction rates.

 (Tracy Staton)
Virtual drug design tech firm Iktos has set up a new pact with Big Pharma Pfizer to tap its artificial intelligence for its discovery work. Pfizer will use the Paris-based company’s tech for de novo design to “selected Pfizer small-molecule discovery programs,” although the pair did not share specifics of the targets nor of any financials for the pact. “Pfizer has had an active interest in AI for de novo design and we are excited to work with Iktos to use their AI technology on a number of our programs,” said Charlotte Allerton, head of medicine design at Pfizer.The use of AI is fairly broad, but these sorts of deals are designed to help seek out, model and better predict small-molecule activities to help Pfizer know which targets are most likely to get to the finishing line and return millions, if not billions, of dollars. Iktos, founded back in 2016, has similar deals with Janssen, Almirall, Servier, Galapagos and Pierre Fabre. RELATED: Almirall taps Iktos for AI drug discovery work“We are proud to work with Pfizer and to have their scientists use our software in their early discovery programs,” said Yann Gaston-Mathé, co-founder and CEO of Iktos. “It is our ultimate goal to put our technology in the hands of drug discovery scientists, who have deep knowledge and understanding of their discovery programs. By combining their drug discovery expertise with our algorithmic and data science know-how and experience derived from the many collaborations we have established to date, we believe that the promise of AI to dramatically improve drug discovery will have a better chance to be realized and impact therapeutic development.”

French start-up Iktos has announced a collaboration with Pfizer on the use of its artificial intelligence technology for drug design. This partnership comes in response to the considerable progress in the development of AI algorithms and computing power that has enabled the development of innovative approaches to small molecule drug design.

Founded in 2016, Iktos develops generative AI technology in numerous collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotech companies. A fundamental aspect of the technology lies in the exploration of chemical space performed by generating compounds in silico under the constraints of the program’s final objectives, rather than by screening compound libraries. As part of the collaboration, Pfizer has deployed Iktos’ generative AI technology and is applying it to several small molecule research programs.
“Pfizer has an active interest in AI for de novo design and we are pleased to work with Iktos to use their AI technology in a number of our programs,” said Charlotte Allerton, Head of Drug Design at Pfizer.

Earlier this year, Iktos launched Makya™, its de novo AI-based design software for multi-parameter optimization (MPO), available either as a SaaS platform or installed in the customer’s IT environment or virtual private cloud (VPC). Makya’s interface allows it to be used by medicinal or computational chemists. Makya can also be run as a Python package via a Jupyter notebook interface.
“We are proud to work with Pfizer and delighted that their scientists are using our software in their research programs,” said Yann Gaston-Mathé, co-founder and CEO of Iktos.
“Our ultimate goal is to put our technology in the hands of drug discovery researchers who have a deep knowledge and understanding of their research programs. By combining their drug discovery expertise with our know-how in algorithmic and data science, as well as our experience from numerous collaborations established to date, we believe that AI’s promise to significantly improve drug discovery will have a better chance of being realized and having an impact on therapeutic development”.

The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence today released its report today with dozens of recommendations for President Joe Biden, Congress, and business and government leaders. China, the group said, represents the first challenge to U.S. technological dominance that threatens economic and military power for the first time since the end of World War II.
The 15-member commission calls a $40 billion investment to expand and democratize AI research and development a “modest down payment for future breakthroughs,” and encourages an attitude toward investment in innovation from policymakers akin that which led to building the interstate highway system in the 1950s. Ultimately, the group envisions hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on AI by the federal government in the coming years.

Amplifying ROI: The Impact of Women Leaders in Generative AI Development



The report recommends several changes that could shape business, tech, and national security. For example, amid a global shortage of semiconductors, the report calls for the United States to stay “two generations ahead” of China in semiconductor manufacturing and suggests a hefty tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers. President Biden pledged support for $32 billion to address a global chip shortage and last week signed an executive order to investigate supply chain issues.
“I really hope that Congress deeply considers the report and its recommendations,” AWS CEO Andy Jassy said today as part of a meeting held to approve the report. “I think there’s meaningful urgency to get moving on these needs, and it’s important to realize that you can’t just flip a switch and have these capabilities in place. It takes steady, committed hard work over a long period of time to bring these capabilities to fruition.”
Commissioners who helped compile the report include Oracle CEO Safra Catz, Microsoft chief scientist Eric Horvitz, Google Cloud AI chief Andrew Moore, and Jassy, who takes over as CEO of Amazon later this year. Publication of the final report is the last act of the temporary commission Congress formed in 2018 to advise federal policy.
The 756-page report calling for the United States to be AI-ready by 2025 was approved by commissioners in a vote today. Moore and Horvitz abstained from chapters 2 and 11 of the report due to perceived conflicts of interest.
“I think it bears repeating that to win in AI, we need more money, more talent, stronger leadership, and collectively we as a commission believe this is a national security priority, and that the steps outlined in the report represent not just our consensus, but a distillation of hundreds and hundreds of experts in technology and policy and ethics, and so I encourage the public and everyone to follow our recommendations,” commission chair and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said.
Now, Schmidt and other commissioners said, begins the work of selling these ideas to key decision makers in power.
Recommendations in the report include:

The intelligence community should seek to fully automate many tasks by 2030.
In line with earlier recommendations, the final report calls for the creation of a Digital Corps for hiring temporary or short-term tech talent, and a Digital Service Academy to create an accredited university to produce government tech talent. The report calls failure to recognize the need to develop a government technical workforce shortsighted and a national security risk.
Increase access to open source software for federal government employees in agencies like the Pentagon. The report refers to TensorFlow and PyTorch as “must-have tools in any AI developer’s arsenal.”
Private industry should form an organization with $1 billion in funding in the next five years that launches efforts to address inequality.
Identify service members with computational thinking.
Establish responsible AI leads in each national security agency and branch of the armed forces.
The report also calls for the U.S. State Department to increase its presence in U.S. and technology hubs around the world.
Triple the number of national AI research institutes. The first institutes were introduced in August 2020.
Set policy for agencies critical to national security to allow people to report irresponsible AI deployments.
Double AI research and development spending until 2026, when levels will hit $32 billion.
The report also calls immigration a “national security imperative” and that immigration policy could slow progress for China. Commissioners recommend doubling the number of employment-based green cards, creating visas for entrepreneurs and the makers of emerging and disruptive technology, and giving green cards to every AI PhD graduate from an accredited U.S. university. Leadership in 5G telecommunications and robotics are also referred to as national security imperatives in the report.

Government beyond defenseadvertisement
Within government, the report also goes beyond recommendations for the Pentagon, extending recommendations to Congress for border security and federal agencies like the FBI or Department of Homeland Security. For example, the report criticizes a lack of transparency of AI systems used by federal agencies as potentially affecting civil liberties and calls for Congress to amend impact assessment and disclosure reporting requirements to include civil rights and civil liberty reports for new AI systems or major updates to existing systems.
“For the United States, as for other democratic countries, official use of AI must comport with principles of limited government and individual liberty. These principles do not uphold themselves. In a democratic society, any empowerment of the state must be accompanied by wise restraints to make that power legitimate in the eyes of its citizens,” the report reads.
A statement from ACLU senior staff attorney Patrick Toomey, whose work focuses on national security, said the report acknowledges some dangers of AI in its recommendations, but “it should have gone further and insisted that the government establish critical civil rights protections now, before these systems are widely deployed by intelligence agencies and the military. Congress and the executive branch must prioritize these safeguards, and not wait until after dangerous systems have already become entrenched.”advertisement
The report argues that the consolidation of the AI industry threatens U.S. technological competitiveness in a number of important ways, exacerbating trends like brain drain and stifled competition.
China and U.S. foreign policy
Increases in funding and investment by China to be an AI leader by 2025 means more time is dedicated to China in the report than any other foreign nation. The report concludes that the United States could lose military technical superiority to China within the next decade.
“We have every reason to think that the competition with China will increase,” Schmidt said during the NSCAI meeting today.
To ward off rising models of techno-authoritarian governance like the kind practiced in China, the report calls for the United States to establish an Emerging Technology Coalition with allies. The report calls for high-level, ongoing diplomatic dialogue with China to discuss challenges emerging technology like AI presents in order to find areas for cooperation toward global challenges like climate change. That body could also act as a forum for sharing concerns or grievances about practices inconsistent with American values. Bilateral talks between the United States and China were previously recommended by AI policy expert and former White House economist R. David Edelman.
In defense, commissioners do not support a treaty for the global prohibition of AI-enabled autonomous weaponry since it is “not currently in the interest of U.S. or international security,” and because the report concludes that China and Russia would ignore any such commitment. Instead, the report calls for developing standards for autonomous weaponry.
In other matters related to foreign policy and international affairs, the commissions calls for an international agreement to never automate use of nuclear weapons, and to seek similar commitments from Russia and China.
The need for leadership is stressed throughout the report. For President Biden, the report recommends an executive order aimed at protecting intellectual property, and create a Technology Competitiveness Council in part to deal with intellectual property issues and establish national plans.
Oracle CEO Safra Catz called collaboration within and among Department of Defense, U.S. government, and allies critical, and said that leadership in government is needed. “There’s so many important steps that have to be taken now.”
“It is our great hope that like-minded democratic nations work together to make sure that technologies around AI do not leak into adversarial hands that will give them an advantage over our systems and that we will unite together in the safe and responsible deployment of this kind of technology in military systems,” commissioner and In-Q-Tel founder Gilman Louie said today.
The United States has been working with international groups like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), while last year defense and diplomatic officials from United States allies met to discuss ethical use of AI in warfare.

Ethical AI
New technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), are reshaping our world. They bring powerful opportunities and threats, especially to our human rights. The Final Report sets out a roadmap for Australia to seize the opportunities and address the threats.
Australia should innovate consistently with our liberal democratic values. This means being consultative, inclusive and accountable. New tech should come with robust human rights safeguards.
Technology and human rights
The recommendations in the Final Report are informed by the Commission’s expertise, our research and extensive public consultation with the community, government, industry and academia.
The Final Report aims to foster a deeper understanding of the human rights implications for Australia of new and emerging technologies to ensure ethical AI is designed and deployed.
Final Report
The Final Report is divided into four parts:

Part A: a national strategy on new and emerging technologies
Part B: the use of artificial intelligence in decision making by government and the private sector
Part C: supporting effective regulation through the creation of an AI Safety Commissioner
Part D: accessible technology for people with disability.

The Final Report covers several areas in detail such as facial recognition technology, algorithmic bias and the creation of an AI Safety Commissioner amongst others.

Artificial intelligence algorithm tests, trusted AI, black box effect: interview with Guillaume Avrin from LNE

In the context of our dossier Trusted Artificial Intelligence: From Critical Systems to the Common Good published in issue 3 of the magazine ActuIA currently on newsstands and available in our online shop, we spoke with Guillaume Avrin, Head of the “Artificial Intelligence Evaluation” department at the Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d’Essais (LNE). In February 2021, LNE, which has established itself for several years as a trusted third-party assessor of artificial intelligence, announced that it had obtained government funding for the creation of the world’s first generic platform dedicated to the evaluation of artificial intelligence, called LEIA.
In this interview, Guillaume Avrin explains LNE’s missions in the field of artificial intelligence, what artificial intelligence algorithm testing and the “black box” effect are, but also the challenges of certification.
ActuIA: Could you give us a brief presentation of the LNE?

Guillaume Avrin: The Laboratoire national de métrologie et d’essais (LNE) is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature (EPIC) attached to the Ministry of Industry. It is the national reference body for testing, evaluation and metrology. In support of public policies, its action aims to assess and structure the supply of new products, seeking both to protect and meet the needs of consumers and to develop and promote the competitiveness of national industry (cf. Article L823-1 of the Consumer Code). It also assists manufacturers in their efforts to innovate and become more competitive in many fields of expertise and sectors of activity. LNE carries out work on the characterisation, qualification and certification of systems and technologies to support all breakthrough innovations (artificial intelligence, nanotechnologies, additive manufacturing, radioactivity measurement, hydrogen storage, etc.) for the benefit of the scientific, regulatory and industrial community.
In the emerging field of artificial intelligence, LNE has metrological and methodological expertise in evaluation, which has no equivalent at European level. It has carried out more than 950 evaluations of AI systems since 2008, notably in language processing (translation, transcription, speaker recognition, etc.), image processing (person recognition, object recognition, etc.) and robotics (autonomous vehicles, service robots, agricultural robots, collaborative robots, intelligent medical devices, etc.). It is involved in all the major cross-cutting challenges of AI and, in parallel, ensures the implementation of a solution qualification system based on an efficient and partly internalized national network, particularly in the upstream stages of this deployment and for the development of the metrological, methodological and instrumental models to be implemented.
Are the tests of artificial intelligence algorithms similar to the tests you are used to doing in other specialties, or have they required the development of new skills and protocols? How are they different? How many artificial intelligence experts work for LNE? Do they all work at LNE or do you use independent experts?

The tests that we conduct in AI contribute to estimating fairly and in the absolute (for purposes of development, performance characterization, benchmarking, certification, etc.) the use value, performance, hazards, environmental impact, positive or negative, i.e. also its impact, even indirect, on societies and individual lifestyles: socio-economic consequences, ethical, legal, sociological questioning, etc.
This is a significantly new issue linked to the strong professional and social substitution power of AI, but which also has a metrological specificity: the ability of intelligent systems is to be measured mainly on the functional level and lies above all in their adaptability (a conventional system is on the contrary judged quantitatively on its performance in compliance with a job framework that is perfectly defined from the design stage). It is therefore not only a question of objectively quantifying functions and performance, but also of validating and characterising operating environments (perimeters of use) which are by nature variable, often highly variable, particularly in the case of so-called “open” environments. It is this variability of the situation to be treated, specific to the terrain of the human mind, which confers the quality of intelligence to the system and even measures its degree.
This extensive field of use and experimentation and the at least partially autonomous and often non-convex, non-linear, non-deterministic behaviour of AI systems require the development of sui generis protocols and measurement instruments:

The measurement of intelligent systems is based on a so-called “soft” metrology that is more functional than quantitative, more attentive to robustness than to performance, and using composite and multidimensional metrics capable of accurately and precisely reflecting the magnitude and sensitivities of the environmental field of operation of the component under test.
It is essentially a question of covering a field of use with a necessarily limited but minimal sampling fineness to guarantee the absence of aberrant reactions. The test scenarios to be presented to the system under evaluation are therefore potentially very numerous, some of which may lead to accident or near-accident situations and can only be generated using simulation means. As simulation implies a necessarily reductive modelling of reality, compromises must be found between the needs for completeness and realism.

This compromise imperative directly justifies and structures the “LEIA” (Laboratory for the Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence) initiative coordinated by LNE, which will eventually bring together all national players (research laboratories, test centres, equipment manufacturers and test bench architects, data owners, standardisation bodies, administrations, investors, etc.) to build an initial integrated platform for evaluating artificial intelligence on an international scale. This system will be based on a network that takes into account the existing situation (HR, resources, know-how, statutory missions), operating in a distributed but structured way (at least by AI application sector) to jointly meet the need for system evaluation. This network is built over time by relying on various collaborative projects at national (ANR, Grand défi), European (H2020, CHIST-ERA, COVR, etc.) and international levels.) and international (in particular through its strategic partnership with NIST, which is specific to AI), as well as through LNE’s participation in various standardization committees dealing with AI and robotics (Afnor’s Strategic Orientation Committee for Information and Digital Communication, Afnor’s AI committee, CEN-CENELEC’s Focus Group AI and Section 81 of the Union de Normalisation de la Mécanique on industrial robotics).
To meet this practical and programmatic need, LNE now has some fifteen in-house engineers and PhDs specializing in AI, who are regularly accompanied by post-docs, PhD students and trainees, as well as its own experts in cybersecurity, biology, mathematics and statistics, medical devices, etc. Even if this number of staff is eventually to be doubled, LNE will continue to work to the maximum extent possible in co-contracting with its academic, scientific, industrial and administrative partners, if only to promote technical appropriation and technology transfer.
How many years have you been involved in the measurement of artificial intelligence algorithms and how is this demand evolving? Can we have figures? What types of actors are you working with?
The activity was launched in 2008 as a result of guidance given by the public authorities, in the context of specific sovereignty issues, but it is only three years since artificial intelligence was made one of the top national and international priorities for technological and industrial development, and thus for the LNE.
Since all professional and domestic sectors (medical devices and diagnostics, autonomous mobility, industrial and agricultural robotics, legaltech, fintech, assurtech, etc.) are now included in the scope of the project, the project is now being implemented in the following areas: medical devices and diagnostics, autonomous mobility, industrial and agricultural robotics, legaltech, fintech, assurtech, etc.) which is gradually becoming automated, the spectrum of LNE’s partners and customers has in parallel broadened to include a wide range of institutional (Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of the Armed Forces, Ministry of Research, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Ministry of Ecological Transition, High Authority for Health, DG CONNECT of the European Commission, INC, CEA, etc.) and industrial (Thales, Dassault, Airbus, Facebook, Numalis, etc.) players, and continues to grow.
The difficulty will be precisely to manage this transition from a developing AI to a commercial AI, which could be massive and for which it is therefore necessary to actively prepare, well in advance of commercial maturities and qualification needs. In programmatic terms, this difficulty has been recognized by the EC in a recent White Paper and in its “TEF” test centre project of the order of 3 billion euros, which could be launched at the beginning of 2021, as well as in France in its decision to retain trusted AI as one of its rare “major challenges” financed by the Innovation and Industry Fund.
Data is very important in artificial intelligence: how to ensure that training data is not biased? Their constitution, especially in Deep Learning, requires very large games that can be extremely expensive to collect, is it realistic to expect you to compile such data sets for testing on your own, and if you rely on your clients’ data, aren’t the test results likely to be very far from reality?

The qualification of the data is aimed at verifying their representativeness, i.e. their completeness with regard to the targeted application and their realism, in order to limit the potential associated biases (selection bias, classification bias, etc.).
The completeness of the data is quantified in particular through coverage rate calculations, while compliance with realism requirements is assessed thanks to qualification procedures that are currently being standardised, in particular within the framework of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Artificial Intelligence standardisation committee to which we contribute (cf. ISO/IEC WD 5259 – in preparation – “Data quality for analytics and ML”).
Evaluating completeness requires, in particular, formalizing the use cases, identifying the conditions of use and contraindications, formalizing the influencing factors (weather conditions, luminosity, temperature, etc.) impacting the performance of the system. A corpus analysis can then be carried out in order to verify the proper coverage of application needs.
Several methods exist to generate or artificially augment data to improve the coverage rate of learning and test scenarios, including the addition of perturbations (rain, snow, etc.), noise and sensor defects from models, the application of metamorphic transformations (inversion, rotation, etc.), the automatic production of corner cases by auto-encoders or GANs, etc.
The realism assessment includes checks for meta-information potentially associated with the raw data, called annotations. When these are carried out by humans, they can thus be subject to specific analyses in order to verify the existence of a field truth associated with the data (complete manual examination or random sampling, selection by majority vote, calculation of inter- and intra-anotator agreement rates, etc.). It also includes the identification and analysis of “outliers” (“outliers” or “atypical” values) in order to decide whether they should be maintained/deleted/adapted, or the consistency between the means (sensors, pre-processing chains, etc.) used for the acquisition of learning and test data, and those implemented in real conditions, once the system has been deployed.
Concerning the tools available for corpus exploration, since 2015 LNE has been developing the Matics software platform, free and open source (CeCILL-B licence), dedicated to data visualization and the evaluation of automatic information processing systems. In constant evolution, the software can be used, for example, to automate the evaluation of automatic language processing tasks (translation, transcription, speaker verification, named entity recognition, tokenization, lemmatization, etc.) and image recognition tasks (computer vision).
Both AI system developers and their assessors are concerned by these requirements for realism and completeness in the test databases to be used. Both the physical and logical separation and the precellence of the assessor’s test data must be guaranteed. Depending on the application area, several approaches are currently being considered:

If the application concerns very rare data (for example medical data of orphan pathologies), the AI developer is generally the only one or one of the only ones in the world to have data on the subject. The trusted third-party evaluator will therefore need to be able to access corpuses of the developer that have not been used during learning, which he can “augment” (noise, disturbances, transformations, etc.) in order to limit bias, especially overlearning, for use in evaluations.
If the application concerns common, transapplicable and/or inexpensive to produce data (recognition of everyday objects such as humans, animals, road signs, office equipment, etc.), then it is relevant to set up reference databases (standards for AI) independently of the developer.

These processes are obviously long and costly, and therefore pre-emptive. Their strategic nature cannot therefore be over-emphasised, and some even believe that they could go so far as to call into question the principle of European solidarity as an exception to sovereignty.
In any case, and even though such data may often be of a sensitive nature (personal, professional, military), the LEIA initiative leaves open at this stage the question of the best form of collection and aggregation to adopt, centralised or distributed, public or private. However, since the need is unavoidable and must be met first, it should above all be covered as soon as possible and without waiting for it to start happening across the Atlantic or elsewhere. Because, if behind the race to AI, there is a race to the data, nothing will serve to run, it will especially be necessary to be started at the right time.
We often talk about the “black box” effect of Deep Learning. Does it seem to you to be a real obstacle, or do you believe that a Deep Learning algorithm can still be qualified as “trusted”, i.e. that it meets performance, robustness, explicability and ethical issues, at the end of the tests carried out?

The term “black box” refers to the inaccessibility (physical, logical or simply human understanding) of the internal workings of a system. For AIs of this type, the decisions made are generally not explicable, the decision rules applied are not interpretable and the functionality is not formally demonstrable.
Only the experimental way remains, which incidentally obliges us to better identify the conditions of use by having to carry them out concretely. It is the whole system that is then tested and we can even argue that intelligence is a holistic property of such a black box, i.e. there would be no sense in sharing it between its possible components.
Input-output tests (also called “black box” tests) are then set up to characterize the AI system by soliciting it according to a scenario combining various stimuli and evaluating the quality of its behavior (for example via comparisons to references, to a field truth). The confidence to be placed in these AIs thus depends directly on the results of evaluations conducted on representative test data.
To be reassured, we can note that human beings often function in “black box” mode, the recognition of their environment, for example, appeals more to their intuition than to their reasoning (we immediately recognize a person by their particular features without detailing them formally).
Some tests, usually involving real-time decision-making capabilities, are also used to assess these skills. This is the case of the driver’s licence test. It can also be noted that if a human being passes his driving test in thirty minutes, the autonomous vehicle is required to cover several thousand kilometres before being approved. It is therefore not so much the “black box” nature of the autonomous vehicle that raises the question as the identification of the right size of the test environment (which influencing factors to vary, which sampling step, etc.) to put in place to report on its performance.
Do you have any other examples of areas where you are being asked for help and where this “black box” effect also exists?

Because of its missions, LNE conducts its assessments mainly through tests. The hardness of a material, for example, is assessed experimentally, in addition or when it cannot be calculated from its chemical composition.
It is the very notion of measurement that refers to this usual practice of a posteriori evaluation.
What are the main weaknesses of the artificial intelligence algorithms that you notice during the tests?

The main weaknesses we find are directly related to the existence of measurement instruments to identify, quantify and correct them. As previously mentioned, there is a whole metrology of AI to be set up, making it possible to characterize the operating environments of AI systems beyond the error rate calculations currently carried out. We thus note the lack of robustness (to meteorological variations, rare events, etc.) and resilience (adverse attacks, sensor perturbations, etc.) of the systems we are evaluating.
In the same way, the explicable or ethical nature of decisions made by AI is difficult to assess objectively today, due to the lack of a reference system and tools to quantify them. And we know the weaknesses of current AIs concerning these two aspects.
Deep Learning’s algorithms have proven to be very sensitive to adverse attacks, allowing to deceive a machine vision AI by adding a few almost imperceptible pixels to an image. Have you seen any progress in this area, and if not, isn’t this likely to undermine the reliability of AI systems in an uncontrolled environment, such as an autonomous vehicle?

New approaches appear to have been developed to mitigate the “fragility” of Deep Learning algorithms, including the concepts of robust learning and robust data. To date, we have not seen any real improvement with respect to adversary attacks as a whole.
Nevertheless, it seems to us relevant to differentiate between the adversary examples corresponding to realistic corner squares (the scenario that the data represents could indeed occur in real and nominal operating conditions) and the adversary examples that would result from a malicious attack. While the robustness of Deep Learning algorithms improves when they are trained on databases containing disrupted/enhanced/transformed data, their resilience to attacks seems to be primarily a matter of other types of protection, including cyber security.
Are you in favour of making the certification of artificial intelligence algorithms mandatory, including in systems that are not considered “critical” but whose consequences may be significant for society (for example in the case of recruitment algorithms)? Is there not a risk that the cost of these tests could be a brake on innovation and the emergence of new startups?

In a context of plethoric development, it seems indispensable to give guarantees and objective criteria of choice to the users of AI systems. Certification, which is based on a reference system shared by all and on evaluation results carried out by independent third-party bodies, is an effective tool for building this confidence. LNE, which combines expertise in the field of AI assessment with the expertise of a certification body, has therefore chosen to build a voluntary certification reference system on the subject. This is a first step that will enable developers to acquire and demonstrate the implementation of good practices, attesting to the reliability of the AI systems developed.
Rather than a hindrance, this certification will be a competitive advantage. The working group in charge of building the reference system, made up of representative players in the field (Arcure, Axionable, IRT Railenium, Kickmaker, Michelin, Orange, Proxinnov, Scortex, Thales, etc.), has moreover chosen to build the requirements in terms of results to be achieved and not the means to be implemented, thus avoiding slowing down innovation. The cost of a certification should be quite reasonable in view of the stakes of the conformity assessment carried out.
It is in fact wealth creation that our economy needs, for the domestic market and for our international trade. Wealth is directly linked to demand, it is only a measure of its satisfaction. In order to extend to commercial success an AI market that has so far been driven mainly by supply, it is imperative to anticipate market reactions and to activate as soon as possible the conditions for bringing supply and demand closer together, which is the main purpose of certification.
Thank you to Guillaume Avrin for agreeing to answer our questions.

PK Donepudi - American Journal of Trade and Policy, 2014”, he discusses about a) the advantages and benefits that 4IR brings for the shipping industry in automation, artificial intelligence, and smart interactions, b) common challenges such as Regulatory Compliance, Physical Risks and Hazards, Global Business Trends, Cost of Technology Upgrade, and Operational Complexity due to the use of specialized equipment, and c) key opportunities areas. He explains how cloud computing can assist ports focus on their core business as they use the infrastructure of the cloud and in return, they get processing speed, cost-efficiency, security, high availability, and robustness. In addition, IoT solutions enable the devices to become smart, connect with other devices, and collect and report data about their working conditions and status. This reduces human effort and results in fewer accidents, lesser losses, more productivity, and more profits.His article “Crossing point of Artificial Intelligence in cybersecurity, PK Donepudi - American journal of trade and policy, 2015” discusses about how innovations and application in the field of Artificial Intelligence can enhance and strengthen cybersecurity. This article aims at recognizing the capacity of AI to a) safeguard organizations from various threats on the net, b) classify and detect malware, c) devise handy and robust security norms, and d) improve predictive and recuperative systems. The article suggests various Artificial Intelligence techniques For Cybersecurity such as Expert Systems (a computer framework that duplicates the decision-making capacity of a human), Neural Nets (also called deep learning, it is inspired by the capacities and working of the human mind), and Intelligent Agents (an independent entity that perceives development through sensors and follows up on an environment utilizing actuators (for example it is an agent) and coordinates its movement towards achieving goals) and discusses their application in cybersecurity.Praveen has also co-authored several scholarly articles as a subject matter expert of his field of expertise. “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Treasury Management: A Systematic Literature Review.

The articles describes Autoregressive model, Radial basis function model, Regression model, Random forest model, Seasonal interaction model and Gradient boosted model.Artificial intelligence applications, according to Praveen, will help various organisations succeed. Artificial intelligence applications do not have to be limited to a single domain. These can be found in fields like banks and hospitals. These applications aid in the completion of complex tasks that are difficult for humans to complete. Artificial intelligence applications not only complete these functions, but they do so in the most efficient manner possible.Connect with Donepudi on LinkedInThe opinions expressed here are solely the author's and do not reflect the opinions or beliefs of the LA Progressive.Tagsterms:Tech and Social MediaArtifical IntelligenceLatest NewsRwanda in DRC, Israel in PalestineBy Ann Garrison12 minutes agoNATO/US Complicity in Israel's Relentless Genocide of Gaza  By Ann Wright29 minutes agoProject 2025 Consolidates Executive PowerBy Stephanie Williams29 minutes agoHere's How Boeing Executives Profited from Saving on SafetyBy Jan Weir8 hours agoYou’re a Hypocrite, So Am I By Eleanor Goldfield9 hours agoCori Bush, Activist-Politician, Still Inspires Working People Like Me By India Walton9 hours agoHomophobia's Role in Political ManipulationBy Chris Houston22 hours agoHave We Learnt Anything from Sexual Harassment in the Media?

It will allow job seekers to schedule virtual meetings with career coaches that match their skillsets, connect with prospective employers, participate in training opportunities, and receive help with building effective resumes.Rhode Islanders can access the portal at BackToWorkRI.com.AdvertisementThe initiative, which was launched in July 2020 by Governor Gina M. Raimondo, was meant to be a public-private partnership designed to train, support, and hire Rhode Islanders who have been displaced by the pandemic.Since last March, thousands of Rhode Islanders have lost their jobs, leaving them no other choice but to file for unemployment. Sarah Blusiewicz, assistant director of workforce development for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, said she hopes that after filing for unemployment, Rhode Islanders will be using this career center as a tool to get back to work.“COVID-19 has left thousands of Rhode Islanders unemployed and searching for new, sustainable careers,” said Blusiewicz. “Our collaboration with Google Cloud has married accessible technology with government innovation to train and connect workers with the resources they need to access in-demand jobs.”The career center uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to connect the state’s workforce with new career opportunities while using familiar productivity tools within Google Workspace. Some of the features include the AI-powered CareerCompass Rhode Island bot, named “Skipper,” which uses data and machine learning to connect residents with potential new career paths and proven reskilling opportunities.The center also integrates video calling via Google Meet, so job seekers can meet with career coaches and use screen-sharing to review and edit resumes and cover letters in real time. Coaches and job seekers are paired based on the coach’s areas of expertise and language fluency. The center is available in English and Spanish now, but can support multiple languages.Advertisement“Rhode Island is the first state in the country to use AI/ML and Google Workspace to deploy a job search platform at this scale,” said Mike Daniels, vice president of Global Public Sector at Google Cloud. “We hope that the integrated experience provided by our technology will help job seekers hit the ground running.”Here are answers to common questions about the platform:How does applying for a job on this platform help eliminate the implicit bias issues that resume readers have?According to Blusiewicz, the platform will help push forward resumes for skills-based hiring, unlike other platforms that use technology that eliminates job seekers who don’t use the “correct” keywords. In addition, she said since job seekers can book video conferences with employers and recruiters, the portal encourages hiring managers to go above the “resume reader noise.”In conversations with local employers, Blusiewicz said, “For years, the theme has been, ‘We have great job seekers that need jobs.’” Great jobs are out there, she said, but traditional job boards with resume readers that searched only for certain terms, coupled with information overload, eliminated good candidates.How does the platform ensure that Rhode Islanders are using the center, and not people from other states?Users are not required to plug in their address, Blusiewicz said, but the idea is to have this portal connected to Rhode Island’s unemployment insurance system.“As Rhode Islanders are filling out those unemployment claims, we can then direct them to this site as the next step,” she said.AdvertisementThe job I had before the pandemic is probably not going to come back. How will this portal help me?The machine learning aspect of the center will help someone transition into another field. It will scan your profile and the work history that you upload, and pull administrative data on people who have skills similar to yours. Based on your existing skills, it will help match you to other sectors and positions that are available.Will similar platforms be available in other states?Daniels said Google Cloud is in conversations with “a number of states” about developing a similar career center, but he said he believes that this site will pave the way for neighboring states.“I think we’ve really thought deeply in terms of how we could incorporate the human element and how to make this a different feeling for someone, by curating it for them, instead of them simply going out and pounding the job boards,” said Daniels. “This is coming at exactly the right time.”Get Rhode MapA weekday briefing from veteran Rhode Island reporters, focused on the things that matter most in the Ocean State.Enter EmailSign UpAlexa Gagosz can be reached at alexa.gagosz@globe.com.

AI algorithms are used in almost every sector – criminal justice, recruitment, news media, manufacturing, banking, military, law enforcement, etc. With AI being used in diverse areas, there is a growing worry among researchers that bias in AI can threaten human rights and society, coming in the way of free speech, right to resources and information, to name a few. With such risks, the need for ethical, responsible, and transparent AI is obvious..But what more will it take to make AI ethics a priority for businesses? .In 2019, the AI Ethicist role was established as top 5 hires for companies that want to succeed in the digital domain. The need was brought to light as ethical and social implications of AI will only become a matter of greater importance. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) advised that &quot;companies need to create roles for senior-level marketers, ethicists, or lawyers who can pragmatically implement ethically aligned design, both in the technology and the social processes to support value-based system innovation&quot; in IEEE's Ethically Aligned Design Guidelines for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems v2..In the past couple of years, many organizations came forward and expressed their need to hire for this role under different titles like Chief AI Ethics Officer, Chief Trust Officer, and AI Ethics and Governance. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Accenture took a step forward and actually hired for this responsibility. &quot;The call for artificial intelligence ethics specialists is growing louder as technology leaders publicly acknowledge that their products may be flawed and harmful to employment, privacy, and human rights&quot;, highlighted Wall Street Journal..The Need For A Dedicated AI Ethicist .What does an AI ethicist do? This role will be responsible for offering sound advice on ethical AI practice and guards the organization against bias, accidental consequences, and ensures accountability. Sadly, some companies have not realized its implications and consider this role as an add-on..An AI Ethicist works across many disciples of the organization towards having ethical and unbiased AI goals throughout the product life cycle. The AI Ethicist will directly inform corporate leadership and the board of directors about unintended non-technical aspects of AI and the risks it might possess on the organization..IBM has set the right example in taking the lead. IBM Policy Lab proposes a regulatory framework that consists of five policy imperatives for the organization, the first of which is to designate a lead AI ethics official. It goes on to say, &quot;Providers and owners should designate a person responsible for trustworthy AI, such as a lead AI ethics official. This person would be accountable for internal guidance and compliance mechanisms such as an AI ethics board, that oversees risk assessments and harm mitigation strategies. A market environment that prioritizes the adoption of lead AI ethics officials, or other designated individuals, to oversee and manage the increasing complexity could help to mitigate risks and improve public acceptance and trust of these systems, while also driving firms' commitment to the responsible development, deployment, and overall stewardship of this important technology.&quot;.Who Can Be An AI Ethicist? .Now that we know why it is imperative for companies to get on board with hiring an individual to oversee AI ethics, let's understand what is required in an AI Ethicist's background..Diverse Perspective: AI ethics is not just about meeting legislation and compliance requirements or coding a technical solution in a system. As AI is adopted throughout the product life cycle, it is critical for the potential candidate to have experience in every domain where AI can be implemented. Only then the person can have an ethical, social, and political perspective of AI technology..Interdisciplinary Work Experience: Having technical knowledge and skill in areas like privacy legislation and machine learning is a bonus but not everything. An ethicist should be able to see the bigger picture and understand the system to be able to question and assess the consequences of the business processes. For this, interdisciplinary work experience is necessary..Understanding Processes &amp; Policies: A must-have skill for this role is the ability to question a design flow and develop a framework with necessary controls and loops. To reflect this in the work, a potential candidate should have previous experience in developing and structuring processes and policies..Public Speaking Skills: Confidently public speaking and facilitating training workshops is an important part of this role. One has to prepare content for the target audience, host debates and discussions, and meet with customers to advocate for ethical and responsible AI..With an AI Ethicist in charge, who holds these necessary skills, an organization will evade many unnecessary issues that can hinder its growth. Brian Kropp, Chief of Research, HR, envisions that a CAIEO (chief artificial intelligence ethics officer) as a person will create the ethical bill of rights that will be used to govern how an organization uses AI, where it will use it, how the organization will ensure it uses AI is the most appropriate way..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
