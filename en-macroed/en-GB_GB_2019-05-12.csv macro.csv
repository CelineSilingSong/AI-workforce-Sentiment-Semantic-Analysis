“Ensuring that human rights are strengthened and not undermined by artificial intelligence is one of the key factors that will define the world we live in”, says Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatović, in a Recommendation published today.
This Recommendation – entitled “Unboxing artificial intelligence: 10 steps to protect human rights” – provides a number of steps which national authorities can take to maximise the potential of artificial intelligence systems and prevent or mitigate the negative impact they may have on people’s lives and rights. It focuses on 10 key areas of action:

human rights impact assessment;
public consultations;
human rights standards in the private sector;
information and transparency;
independent oversight;
non-discrimination and equality;
data protection and privacy;
freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and the right to work;
access to remedies; and
the promotion of artificial intelligence literacy.

The Recommendation also contains an annexed checklist to help implement the measures recommended in each key area.
“Artificial intelligence driven technology is entering more aspects of every individual’s life, from smart home appliances to social media applications, and it is increasingly being utilised by public authorities to evaluate people’s personality or skills, allocate resources, and otherwise make decisions that can have real and serious consequences for the human rights of individuals. Finding the right balance between technological development and human rights protection is therefore an urgent matter”, says Commissioner Mijatović.
The Recommendation builds on work done in this area by the Council of Europe, as well as other international organisations. It is rooted in the existing universal, binding and actionable framework provided by the international human rights system.

Don’t ignore AI – whatever you do
The most important thing for executives is to just start engaging with AI today – tomorrow is not good enough,” warns Shamus Rae, partner and head of digital disruption at KPMG UK. “Business leaders need to understand the capabilities of these new technologies and put in place an AI strategy that includes some clear self-challenge. This ensures that they don’t get stuck in ‘play’ mode and fail to make any tangible change to their operations or business model.” Mr Rae predicts that, due to the common misconception of AI, “we will see some major missteps by household names failing to adapt fast enough”.
Work out what specific challenge you’re trying to solve
“Think hard about what problem in your business you want to solve, not with artificial intelligence but with data,” advises Kim Nilsson, founder and chief executive of data science hub Pivigo. “The solution always needs to come from that intersection of where your business challenges overlap with available data sets. Only there will significant value lie in data science and AI.” Antony Bourne, industries president of global enterprise software company IFS, agrees. “Before you initiate any project, you must figure out your ‘why’,” he says. “What exactly do you want to improve and enhance? The more targeted your objectives, the more competitive and transformative your results.”
Target low-hanging fruit 
Clare Barclay, chief operating officer of Microsoft UK, advises business leaders to aim at small targets, or minor improvements – the so-called “low-hanging fruit” – when it comes to AI. “If you start thinking of the really big things, you do nothing,” she says. “Ask yourself: ‘What is the problem I am trying to fix?’” Dr Will Venters, assistant professor of information systems and innovation at the London School of Economics’ Department of Management, adds: “Starting with process improvement – perhaps through robotic process automation or simpler and proven AI algorithms – is more likely to be more profitable and successful than trying to push the envelope.”
Understanding data is critical to business success
David Gonzalez, head of big data for Vodafone Business, believes employees at every level should analyse data to maximise the potential of AI technologies. “A chief data officer and trained data scientists are very important to organisations looking to implement AI solutions,” he starts. “The integral role that data plays in powering businesses to succeed in today’s economy means that understanding data even at a basic level really has to be everyone’s job. The entire C-suite has to provide support, ensuring that their area is primed to harvest robust data and that stakeholders understand the value of using it in conjunction with analytics and AI.”
Decide whether to build or buy AI solutions
John Abel, Oracle’s vice principle of cloud and innovation in the UK and Ireland, says: “The next logical question is: ‘How do I implement?’” He continues: “This essentially boils down to either buying a pre-built AI application, or building your own. If you choose the former, your implementation time will likely be shorter, costs lower and maintenance easier. You won’t have to employ data scientists or pay for development platforms and architectural components to learn, buy, maintain and integrate. Buying a ready-to-go AI application provides the lowest barrier to entry, near-immediate benefits and they are often bundled with third-party data sources.”
Don’t forget about ethics
“A major issue with AI is trust,” posits Mr Abel. “The machine provides an output, but how can the user trust it made the right decision, or is recommending the correct action? To establish trust, a machine-learning algorithm needs to show its working and what data was important for the machine to make a particular output.” Ms Barclay of Microsoft UK urges executives to “establish a clear set of ethics, commitments and values around the use of AI. Not only will this ensure ethically grounded innovation, but it can support your bottom line, too. Microsoft research shows companies that consider what AI ‘should’ do have been shown to outperform those that don’t by 9 per cent.”

Take advantage of AI democratisation 
In a bid to help overcome the barrier to AI adoption because of a huge skill shortage, the introduction of pre-built algorithms and open-source machine-learning libraries is helping non-experts grapple with organisations’ data, and deliver insights through AI. Mark Skilton, professor of practice in information systems and management at Warwick Business School, heralds a newfound accessibility for AI solutions – the so-called democratisation of AI. He lauds the “astonishing” amount of, often free, online machine-learning and AI training on offer from Coursera, Udemy, as well as Stanford and Harvard universities, and many others.

Preach to the converted to accelerate workplace AI adoption
According to Maximising the AI Opportunity, Microsoft’s study published in October, some 67 per cent of the 1,000 executives and 59 per cent of employees surveyed are open to experimenting with AI – however, almost all of them will require training and development. For AI to stand the best chance of success in your organisation it is critical to seek out those workers who are most excited by its potential and nurture that interest. “By involving employees, you’re culturally engaging with them around the things that are going to change, and you’re equipping them with new skills,” suggests Ms Barclay.

The adoption of AI and machine learning is expanding rapidly across the manufacturing segment in countries like the U.S., owing to several key applications and benefits the technology delivers to enterprises that aim to enhance their business processes and product value.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing has come a long way from the initial pilot project phase to becoming an imperative component of modern facilities around the world. The ease at which AI-powered machines and robots seem to be developed today have invigorated a sense of industrial revolution, fueled by accelerating investments in technologies like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. AI can be considered to possess the potential to transform manufacturing processes at a global level, analogous to what Ford had achieved with the introduction of its moving assembly line nearly a century ago.
Worldwide, AI has already brought dramatical changes across industries such as enterprise software, cybersecurity, healthcare, finance and retail. It has influenced not only the way companies approach product development and service delivery but has also helped them keep pace with the evolving consumer demands and behaviors. Essentially, with abilities like machine learning at its core, AI can provide manufacturers with enhanced engineering, sensing, data analytics and quality control features that can boost their productivity and save considerable expenses.
The tremendous interest and acceptance of AI can be construed from the fact that in 2018, a record $9.33 billion was raised by AI start-ups in the U.S. from venture capital investments. Home to a vast number of manufacturing industries like automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, food & beverage and electronics, the U.S. is certainly poised to witness a rapid expansion in the global landscape of AI in manufacturing marketOpens a new window .In addition, the achievements of tech giants like IBM, Intel, Google, Qualcomm and Microsoft in the deployment of AI software and hardware solutions for manufacturers have paved a critical path for emerging players to follow. From reducing unplanned process downtime to advancing product quality, workflow efficiency and employee safety, AI is leading the digital transformation of manufacturing companies and supporting the growth of process automation. 
Enumerating the benefits of deploying AI in manufacturing:
Worker injuries and losses due to inadequate demand forecast, equipment failure and poor planning have plagued the manufacturing industry for long and innovators have attempted to address these concerns with the help of technology. Replacing humans in hazardous tasks with AI-powered robots has undoubtedly averted countless injuries to factory staff globally, while optimizing energy utilization and improving production yield. AI in manufacturing effectively delivers multiple direct and indirect benefits to businesses and the overall community they cater to. The advantages delivered by the deployment of this technology are certain to help manufacturers gain access to a wide range of lucrative growth opportunities.
Cost Savings
Manufacturers have to bear huge expenses on material procurement, power supply and maintaining a reliable supply chain. AI has the potential to help companies estimate demand and keep track of raw material usage for ensuring there is no wastage of resources or shortage of inputs that can lead to a break in productivity. This is a crucial function since over or underestimating production targets cause revenue losses. An AI-based solution could also be deployed for connecting supply chain components like inventory management, order management, transport and procurement on a single platform to ease up and automate the processes. 
A prominent effect of adopting the technology at manufacturing facilities is that it saves immense amount of staff expenses, as lesser number of workers are needed to complete production activities. It must be noted that in a developed country like the U.S., labor costs are considered to be high, which is why major businesses establish plants in Asia. The remarkable cost savings achieved with the help of AI solutions will thus boost the manufacturing industry in the U.S. and tackle the increasing problem of labor shortfall. 
Inspection
Quality checks constitute one of the most important part of a manufacturing process, as any issues with a product, after reaching the end consumer, invariably damage the company’s reputation besides having to incur unnecessary losses. Inspecting products with the help of AI and machine learning could minimize the possibility of a defective product leaving the factory. Apparently, computer vision makes use of high-resolution cameras backed by AI to spot the tiniest of details and defects which even the most trained human eye can miss. 
ML enables these systems to improve through a small amount of sample images, saving considerable time and money. The rise of enterprise level connectivity solutions based on the cloud will supplement the growth of computer vision technologies in sectors like auto parts manufacturing and chip making, where mass production is carried out and instant response to identified defects is critical. 
Predictive maintenance
Traditionally, manufacturers have been undertaking preventive maintenance of machinery and equipment, often leading to long term contracts with third party services and expenses that run in thousands of dollars. Although this helps in avoiding production delays, valuable resources are diverted towards these activities and it also surges labor costs. 
However, using ML, businesses can make use of sensors and cutting-edge analytics integrated into the manufacturing equipment, which evaluate their condition in real time and provide alerts when any machine problem is to be resolved. The International Society of Automation estimates that every year, nearly $647 billion is lost due to machine downtime worldwide. As such, ML can be used to analyze current and historical data to predict future events, to optimize the use of resources and improve the reliability of plant equipment. 
Engineering and Design
Business have to face various challenges in meeting consumer demand and high product standards, including the development of new products or upgrading designs of the existing portfolio. By the adoption of a novel method called generative design, AI-based software are able to provide numerous solutions to a design or engineering problem. Supposedly, after users input the material, dimension, cost and process constraints in the system, ML tests and learns from every possible combination to see which solutions work as required.
Generative design allows for faster solving of design issues and is slated to offer enormous benefits in terms of resource efficiency and product quality. Representing one of the most innovative uses of the technology, General Motors had begun to use generative design to achieve vehicle weight reduction by exploring numerous permutations of auto part designs and coming up with hundreds of high-performance design options. 
Predictably, development of light and zero emission vehicles would offer significant opportunities for AI in manufacturing, especially with the likes of Ford, General Motors and many auto part companies in the U.S. working towards a more energy efficient future. Combined with the unprecedented growth in the consumption of IoT devices and the emergence of AI-based start-ups in the North America, the manufacturing segment can be expected to integrate AI along every step of the production lifecycle.

LinkedInFacebookWhatsAppXTelegramShare




Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing technology, which has become an integral part of several organisations. Many companies have started deploying this recent technology to get a better reach among consumers and clients. In fact, the trends in AI have huge implications on several industries including software, healthcare, automobile, manufacturing and more.






The rapid progress of Artificial Intelligence has led to trends such as deep learning, facial recognition, privacy, AI-enabled chips and cloud computing. When implemented the right way, these trends have the potential to transform the entire industry and garner a lot of traction among users.

The Barbican dives deep into artificial intelligence with More Than Human exhibition

Chatbots, facial recognition tech, deep-fake videos and newly commissioned installations by Es Devlin and Lawrence Lek are on display at The Barbican's sprawling AI: More Than Human exhibition.



The exhibition takes a wide-ranging approach to the topic of artificial intelligence, with immersive and interactive displays spread throughout the brutalist cultural centre.
Alter by Hiroshi Ishiguro is on display the Barbican's AI: More than Human exhibitionAs well as showcasing recent research projects out of innovation hubs like MIT, it incorporates historical artefacts such as a world war two-era Enigma Machine.
These sit alongside snippets from influential cultural products like Bladerunner and Frankenstein, and contemporary artworks with something to say about the intersection of nature and technology.
Devlin and Lek join Yuri Suzuki, TeamLab, Universal Everything, Neri Oxman, Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, Yoichi Ochiai, DeepMind, Jigsaw, IBM and Google Arts and Culture in having contributed work to the exhibition.



Co(AI)xistence by Justine Emard is an interface between data and human motionCurators Barbican International Enterprises (BIE) produce one major show every two years, often looking at a topic of public interest through a mixed historical, scientific, social and creative lens.
""Artificial intelligence is a key marker of the zeitgeist and we are thrilled to be exploring the subject, both as a motive for scientific progress and a stimulus for creativity,"" said BIE head Neil McConnon.
Joy Buolamwini's work AI Ain't I A Woman explores how AI can discriminate against minority ethnic facesThe main exhibition is installed in The Curve gallery. It opens with a look at the golem figure from Judaism and the concept of animism — the attribution of a living soul to everything around us, even inanimate objects — from the Shinto faith.
This is part of a section called The Dream of AI, which also looks at early experiments in alchemy, and asks the audience to consider how human history might have primed the ground for our current relationship with technology.
2065 by Lawrence Lek allows visitors to explore an imagined future where humans exclusively play video gamesThe next section is called Mind Machines and focuses on early innovations in AI stretching back to the 1800s. It looks at Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and Ada Lovelace, often considered the first computer programmer.
Alan Turing and the codebreakers of Bletchley Park, IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue, robots like MIT's swimming SoFi and chatbots such as Mitsuku also feature in this part of the exhibition.
Es Devlin's PoemPortraits sits outside the main exhibition spaceData Worlds follows, which explores how artificial intelligence can help us improve aspects of our lives such as road safety, medical diagnostics and city planning through the likes of the Kreyon City project by Sony Computer Science Laboratories.
This allows visitors to build a city out of Lego — with one eye on their citizens' projected quality of life.
TeamLab's WALABW can be found in the Pit theatre of the cultural centreThis section also includes more dystopian aspects, such as the University of Washington's Synthesizing Obama ""deep fake"" video, which shows the former US president saying things he hasn't said.
Another theme here is the replication of human biases through limited data-sets, with Joy Buolamwini's work showing how often facial-recognition fails to recognise black faces.
The final section of the main exhibition is the most experimental. Called Endless Evolution, it presents Massive's Attack's Mezzanine album encoded into artificial DNA contained in spray cans, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine's bioengineered tissues and organs, and Neri Oxman's Synthetic Apiary to help bee populations.
Myriad (Tulips) by Anna Ridler demonstrates the way in which algorithms ""learn"" from dataMost of the large-scale, commissioned installations sit outside of the main exhibition, occupying other spaces in The Barbican.

In The Pit theatre is TeamLab's interactive digital installation What a Loving and Beautiful World, a calming environment populated by butterflies and Chinese letterforms.
In the foyer is Es Devlin's PoemPortraits, created with Google Arts and Culture, where visitors can contribute a word and have AI weave it into a cumulative, collaborative poem.
Totem by Chris Salter is a digital art work that stands floor to ceiling in the Barbican's foyerNearby is Lawrence Lek's playable 2065, created for a speculative future where we spend all day playing video games, and Yuri Suzuki's Electronium, where visitors can compose with AI.
There's also Universal Everything's interactive Future You, which will evolve throughout the exhibition by learning from visitors' movements, Chris Salter's ceiling-high digital Totem and Certain Measures' A Machine View of London video work mapping one million buildings in London.
What-a-Loving-and-Beautiful-World is an immersive digital art work by TeamLabMuseums around the world are exploring themes of technology, robotics and the future — including, recently, fellow London institution the V&A with The Future Starts Here — but The Barbican's may be the biggest and most ambitious attempt to date.
BIE worked with guest curators Suzanne Livingston and Maholo Uchida on the exhibition, which will tour after it finishes its run at The Barbican. BIE's previous exhibition, 2017's Into the Unknown: A Journey Through Science Fiction, is still touring.
AI: More Than Human opens at The Barbican today and runs until 26 August 2019.

Beneath the surface web, the public form of the internet you use daily to check email or read news articles, exists a concealed ""dark web."" Host to anonymous, password-protected sites, the dark web is where criminal marketplaces thrive in the advertising and selling of weapons, drugs, and trafficked persons. Law enforcement agencies work continuously to stop these activities, but the challenges they face in investigating and prosecuting the real-world people behind the users who post on these sites are tremendous.
""The pop-up nature of dark-web marketplaces makes tracking their participants and their activities extremely difficult,"" says Charlie Dagli, a researcher in MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Artificial Intelligence Technology and Systems Group. Dagli is referring to the fast rate at which dark-web markets close down (because they are hacked, raided, abandoned, or set up as an ""exit scam"" in which the site shuts down intentionally after customers pay for unfulfilled orders) and new ones appear. These markets' short lifetimes, from a few months to a couple years, impede efforts to identify their users.
To overcome this challenge, Lincoln Laboratory is developing new software tools to analyze surface- and dark-web data.
These tools are leveraging the one benefit this whack-a-mole-like problem presents — the connections sellers and buyers maintain across multiple layers of the web, from surface to dark, and across dark-web forums. ""This constant switching between sites is now an established part of how dark-web marketplaces operate,"" Dagli says.
Users are making new profiles constantly. Although they may not be employing the same usernames from site to site, they are keeping their connections alive by signaling to each other through their content. These signals can be used to link personas belonging to the same user across dark-web forums and, more revealingly, to link personas on the dark web to the surface web to uncover a user's true identity.
Linking users on the dark web is what law enforcement already tries to do. The problem is that the amount of data that they need to manually shuffle through — 500,000 phone numbers and 2 million sex ads posted a month — is too large and unstructured for them to find connections quickly. Thus, only a low percentage of cases can be pursued.
To automate the persona-linking process, Lincoln Laboratory is training machine learning algorithms to compute the similarity between users on different forums. The computations are based on three aspects of users' communications online: ""How they identify to others, what they write about, and with whom they write to,"" Dagli explains.
The algorithm is first fed data from users on a given Forum A and creates an authorship model for each user. Then, data from users on Forum B are run against all user models from Forum A. To find matches for profile information, the algorithm looks for straightforward clues, such as changes in username spelling like ""sergeygork"" on Forum A to ""sergey gorkin"" on Forum B, or more subtle similarities like ""joe knight"" to ""joe nightmare.""
The next feature the system looks at is content similarity. The system picks up on unique phrases — for example, ""fun in the sun"" — that are used in multiple ads. ""There's a lot of copy-and-paste going on, so similar phrasings will pop up that are likely from the same user,"" Dagli says. The system then looks for similarities in a user's network, which is the circle of people that the user interacts with, and the topics that the user's network discusses.
The profile, content, and network features are then fused to provide a single output: a probability score that two personas from two forums represent the same real-life person.
The researchers have been testing these persona-linking algorithms both with open-source Twitter and Instagram data and hand-labeled ground truth data from dark-web forums. All of the data used in this work are obtained through authorized means. The results are promising. ""Every time we report a match, we are correct 95 percent of the time. The system is one of the best linking systems that we can find in the literature,"" Dagli says. 
This work is the most recent development in ongoing research. From 2014 to 2017, Lincoln Laboratory contributed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Memex program. Memex resulted in a suite of surface- and dark-web data analysis software developed collaboratively with dozens of universities, national laboratories, and companies. Ten laboratory technologies spanning text, speech, and visual analytics that were created for Memex were released as open-source software via the DARPA Open Catalog.
Today, more than 30 agencies worldwide are using Memex software to conduct investigations. One of the biggest users, and a stakeholder in Memex's development, is the Human Trafficking Response Unit (HTRU) in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. stated in a written testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives that his office used Memex tools to screen more than 6,000 arrests for signs of human trafficking in 2017 alone. ""We also used Memex in 271 human trafficking investigations and in six new sex trafficking indictments that were brought in 2017,"" he stated. With the introduction of Memex, prostitution arrests screened by HTRU for human trafficking indicators increased from 5 to 62 percent, and investigations of New York Police Department prostitution-related arrests increased from 15 to 300 per year.
Jennifer Dolle, the deputy chief of HTRU, visited the laboratory to present how the unit has benefited from these technologies. ""We use these tools every single day. They really have changed how we do business in our office,"" Dolle says, explaining that prior to Memex, a human trafficking investigation could take a considerably longer time.
Now, Memex tools are enabling HTRU to quickly enhance emerging cases and build sex trafficking investigations from leads that have little information. For example, these tools — including one called TellFinder (built by Memex contributor Uncharted Software) for indexing, summarizing, and searching sex ad data — have been used to identify additional, underage victims from data in a single online prostitution advertisement. ""These additional investigative leads allow HTRU to prosecute traffickers on violent felony charges and hold these defendants responsible for the true nature of the crimes they commit against vulnerable victims,"" says Dolle.
Researchers are continuing to learn how emerging technologies can be tailored to what agencies need and for how the dark web operates. ""Data-driven machine learning has become a demonstrably important tool for law enforcement to combat illicit online marketplaces on the dark web,"" says Lin Li, a principal investigator of this continuous work in the laboratory’s Human Dynamic Dark Networks program, which is funded through the laboratory’s Technology Office. ""But, some of the ongoing challenges and areas of research include expanding our understanding of the demand economy, disrupting the supply economy, and gaining a better overall situational awareness.""
A better understanding of how the supply-and-demand chains of the dark-web economy work will help the team develop technologies to disrupt these chains. Part of the goal is to raise the risks of participating in this illicit economy; linking personas on the dark web to those on the surface web is one potentially powerful tactic.
""This fast-growing illicit economy was shown by DARPA to fund terrorist activities and shown by HTRU as a driver of modern-day slavery. Defeating terrorism and eliminating slavery are national and humanitarian needs,"" says Joseph Campbell, leader of the Artifical Intelligence Technology and Systems Group. ""Our group has extrodinary expertise in AI, machine learning, and the analysis of human networks based on information extracted from multilanguage speech, text, and video combined with network communications and activities. The state-of-the-art technologies that we create, develop, and advance are transferred to our sponsors, who use them daily with tremendous impact for these national and humanitarian needs.""

Since before the dawn of the computer age, scientists have been captivated by the idea of creating machines that could behave like humans. But only in the last decade has technology enabled some forms of artificial intelligence (AI) to become a reality.
Interest in putting AI to work has skyrocketed, with burgeoning array of AI use cases. Many surveys have found upwards of 90 percent of enterprises are either already using AI in their operations today or plan to in the near future.
Eager to capitalize on this trend, software vendors – both established AI companies and AI startups – have rushed to bring AI capabilities to market. Among vendors selling big data analytics and data science tools, two types of artificial intelligence have become particularly popular: machine learning and deep learning.
While many solutions carry the “AI,” “machine learning,” and/or “deep learning” labels, confusion about what these terms really mean persists in the market place. The diagram below provides a visual representation of the relationships among these different technologies:
As the graphic makes clear, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. In other words, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.
Similarly, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. And again, all deep learning is machine learning, but not all machine learning is deep learning.

AI, machine learning and deep learning are each interrelated, with deep learning nested within ML, which in turn is part of the larger discipline of AI.
Artificial Intelligence ‘Contains’ Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Computers excel at mathematics and logical reasoning, but they struggle to master other tasks that humans can perform quite naturally.
For example, human babies learn to recognize and name objects when they are only a few months old, but until recently, machines have found it very difficult to identify items in pictures. While any toddler can easily tell a cat from a dog from a goat, computers find that task much more difficult. In fact, captcha services sometimes use exactly that type of question to make sure that a particular user is a human and not a bot.
In the 1950s, scientists began discussing ways to give machines the ability to “think” like humans. The phrase “artificial intelligence” entered the lexicon in 1956, when John McCarthy organized a conference on the topic. Those who attended called for more study of “the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”
Some of these early researchers believed it would be only a few years before they solved these problems. In reality, however, it took several decades for computer hardware and software to advance to the point where AI applications like image recognition, natural language processing and machine learning became possible.
Critics rightly point out that there is a big difference between an AI system that can tell the difference between cats and dogs and a computer that is truly intelligent in the same way as a human being. Most researchers believe that we are years or even decades away from creating an artificial general intelligence (also called strong AI) that seems to be conscious in the same way that humans beings are — if it will ever be possible to create such a system at all.
If artificial general intelligence does one day become a reality, it seems certain that machine learning will play a major role in the system’s capabilities.
Machine Learning: A Key Driver of AI
Machine learning is the particular branch of AI concerned with teaching computers to “improve themselves,” as the attendees at that first artificial intelligence conference put it. Another 1950s computer scientist named Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as “the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”
In traditional computer programming, a developer tells a computer exactly what to do. Given a set of inputs, the system will return a set of outputs — just as its human programmers told it to.
Machine learning is different because no one tells the machine exactly what to do. Instead, they feed the machine data and allow it to learn on its own.
In general, machine learning takes three different forms: 
Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is one of the oldest types of machine learning, and it is very useful in teaching a computer how to play a game.
For example, Arthur Samuel created one of the first programs that used reinforcement learning. It played checkers against human opponents and learned from its successes and mistakes. Over time, the software became much better at playing checkers.
Reinforcement learning is also useful for applications like autonomous vehicles, where the system can receive feedback about whether it has performed well or poorly and use that data to improve over time.
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is particularly useful in classification applications such as teaching a system to tell the difference between pictures of dogs and pictures of cats.
In this case, you would feed the application a whole lot of images that had been previously tagged as either dogs or cats. From that training data, the computer would draw its own conclusions about what distinguishes the two types of animals, and it would be able to apply what it learned to new pictures.
As the system absorbed more data over time, it would become better and better at the task. This technique is said to be “supervised” because it requires humans to tag the images in advance and oversee the learning process.
Unsupervised Learning
By contrast, unsupervised learning does not rely on human beings to label training data for the system. Instead, the computer uses clustering algorithms or other mathematical techniques to find similarities among groups of data.
Unsupervised machine learning is particularly useful for the type of big data analytics that interests many enterprise leaders. For example, you could use unsupervised learning to spot similarities among groups of customers and better target your marketing or tailor your pricing.
Some recommendation engines rely on unsupervised learning to tell people who like one movie or book what other movies or books they might enjoy. Unsupervised learning can also help identify characteristics that might indicate a person’s credit worthiness or likelihood of filing an insurance claim.
Various AI applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, facial recognition, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, knowledge engines, emotion recognition, and other types of systems, often make use of machine learning capabilities. Some combine two or more of the main types of machine learning, and in some cases, are said to be “semi-supervised” because they incorporate some of the techniques of supervised learning and some of the techniques of unsupervised learning. And some machine learning techniques — such as deep learning — can be supervised, unsupervised, or both.
Deep Learning: The Powerhouse Driving ML and AI
The phrase “deep learning” first came into use in the 1980s, making it a much newer idea than either machine learning or artificial intelligence.
Deep learning describes a particular type of architecture that both supervised and unsupervised machine learning systems sometimes use. Specifically, it is a layered architecture where one layer takes an input and generates an output. It then passes that output on to the next layer in the architecture, which uses it to create another output. That output can then become the input for the next layer in the system, and so on. The architecture is said to be “deep” because it has many layers.
To create these layered systems, many researchers have designed computing systems modeled after the human brain. In broad terms, they call these deep learning systems artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs come in several different varieties, including deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and others. These neural networks use nodes that are similar to the neurons in a human brain.
Neural networks and deep learning have become much more popular over the last decade in part because hardware advances, particularly improvements in graphics processing units (GPUs), have made them much more feasible. Traditionally, system designers used GPUs to perform the advanced calculations necessary for displaying high-quality video and 3D gaming.
However, those GPUs also excel at the type of calculations necessary for deep learning. As GPU performance has improved and costs have decreased, people have been able to create high-performance systems that can complete deep learning tasks in much less time and for much less cost than would have been the case in the past.
Today, anyone can easily access deep learning capabilities through cloud services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud.

Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Sleep Medicine

How will AI and machine learning change how sleep medicine providers treat their patients?

By Lisa Spear
Right now it’s typical for sleep technologists to mull over pages of polysomnography (PSG) data related to eye movements, respiration, brain activity, and more, to look for indicators of sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy. Machine learning could revolutionize sleep medicine by taking over the diagnostic process, identifying gaps in care, and helping predict CPAP adherence even before therapy begins.
“I think [sleep medicine] is a field that is ripe for disruption in really being able to apply big data and big data tools to our field and perhaps even be a leading force in terms of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can really impact patients in the way that we deliver care,” says sleep specialist Dennis Hwang, MD, director of Kaiser Permanente’s San Bernardino County Sleep Center.

This is why sleep technology companies across the globe are taking the initiative to develop new programs that will one day make artificial intelligence (AI) a mainstay in sleep clinics. One Iceland-based sleep technology company, Nox Medical, created a branch in 2015 called Nox Research, which focuses on developing AI tools to automate sleep study scoring and extract new insights from sleep study data. Since the program began, Nox has released an AI-powered automatic sleep detector as part of the company’s sleep analysis software Noxturnal.
“We see this as an opportunity to empower the sleep techs and doctors to improve diagnosis or serve larger patient populations without adding to their workload,” says Jon S. Agustsson, co-director of Nox Research.
The Nox researchers are also working on AI tools to detect arousals during sleep. “The identification of arousals is important for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, but manual scoring is time consuming and requires expertise,” says Halla Helgadottir, co-director of Nox Research.
Agustsson adds, “A very difficult project to apply AI to is detecting rare events, which either are not well defined, where humans do not agree well on the scoring, or the scored labels do not overlap exactly over the periods where the event occurs. An example of this is AI to detect arousals in EEG. Arousals are only a small part of EEG signals.
“To further complicate things, when arousals are typically scored there is usually not concern with [their] exact timing….The timing of the manually scored event may vary by multiple seconds from the actual timing of the event. In this case it is difficult for the AI tool to learn what is an arousal (since it learns from the data it sees), and it is difficult to measure the performance of the AI tool since it will not always agree with the human-scored labels. To make things even worse is that arousals can occur at any time and can last for various amounts of time. This is much more difficult to deal with than classifying each 30-second epoch.”
Nox researchers are making progress on automated scoring of arousals, and their results from the latest version of the arousal scorer will be presented as an abstract at SLEEP 2019.1
Another healthcare tech company, Somnoware, has deployed a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to help physicians estimate the likelihood of 90-day CPAP therapy compliance. The software works by mining patient data from electronic medical records, patient questionnaires, and lab visits. This data includes demographic information and comorbidities, which all help to build a machine learning model to predict short- and long-term CPAP compliance even before the patient is put on therapy, according to a release.
As more data comes into the program, the model automatically updates its predictions. This way, clinicians can track trends in compliance and determine the likely impact of certain interventions on patient outcomes.

“Our goal is to bring valuable information to physicians early, so it can be used for proactive patient care management,” says Raj Misra, PhD, chief data scientist and vice president of marketing at Somnoware.
AI could also change the diagnostic process. For instance, researchers from the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine developed an AI system to analyze sleep stages to diagnose narcolepsy, finding that AI could use datasets to pinpoint unusual sleep staging more accurately than a human sleep tech. Results were published in a 2018 paper in Nature Communications.2
“Right now [sleep test scoring] is done by technicians, and clearly, there is no reason why it couldn’t be done by a computer,” says sleep specialist Emmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD, an author of the study and the director of the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine.
The Stanford researchers first told six techs to analyze and score sleep data, looking for changes in sleep staging that could indicate narcolepsy. After the researchers averaged those scores, they then trained an AI program to “learn” specific data trends. They did this by providing it with 3,000 sleep study recordings. The results demonstrated that the AI system could actually score sleep tests more accurately than its human counterparts.
“Sleep studies are quite complicated, a bit subjective, so artificial intelligence is really ideal,” says Mignot.
AI-powered sleep test autoscoring software is a tool that could one day be a common way to save time and resources in sleep clinics. Madison, Wis-based tech company EnsoData has moved in this direction, creating the software EnsoSleep, which combines American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring recommendations with algorithms that analyze sleep data; the company says this can help diagnose sleep disorders like sleep apnea, according to a Wisconsin State Journal article written by EnsoData co-founder and CEO Chris Fernandez.3

“Our mission at EnsoData is to create more time for direct patient care and the cultivation of meaningful patient relationships, the aspect of medicine that the majority of clinicians report as the most satisfying part of the practice, by automating these heavily manual data tasks with powerful artificial intelligence software,” Fernandez wrote.
EnsoSleep received FDA 510(k) clearance in 2017 to automate PSG and home sleep tests. According to the article, since the FDA clearance, EnsoSleep has been used by dozens of clinics across the country to improve patient access to care and preserve sleep clinic resources.
“As growth of the patient population increasingly outpaces the size of our clinical workforce, artificial intelligence will play a critical role in empowering clinicians with tools that scale and amplify their ability to provide care for a far greater number of patients,” Fernandez says in the article.
Other technologies are also on the horizon. Morpheo, an open-source initiative to help develop machine learning models for automatic and predictive diagnosis of sleep disorders, is a project based in Paris, France. “The idea was to develop algorithms that would help and assist doctors with clinical sleep work,” explains Marco Brigham, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at École Polytechnique.
“Basically we are working on the AI aspect of the project to assist physicians in sleep medicine,” says Brigham. Since the funding for this project is wrapping up in June, it is unclear if clinicians will ever get to use it, but Brigham says there is still plenty of potential for AI to impact patient care.
At Kaiser Permanente in California, sleep researchers have been having discussions to brainstorm the concept of an “AI bot.” It’s not going to be the cyborg one might envision but would likely be a downloadable smartphone app, according to Hwang.
The AI bot would be a companion to help troubleshoot problems with sleep apnea care. If a patient is struggling to adjust to the air pressure of their CPAP, they might first chat with the AI bot before consulting a physician. The AI bot would then be able to check in on the patient to ask them how they are and inquire about their sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. “It would utilize true intelligence to provide an interactive process,” says Hwang.
“Part of our vision is developing an AI bot that would be able to interact with a patient frequently in an intelligent way. It would ask the patient how they are doing, how they are feeling, and be able to provide some mechanism to improve some cognitive behavioral aspects of care,” says Hwang. “There may be some issues that can be dealt with by the AI bot that may not involve a sleep provider.”

Introduction
What if going to school means learning from robots and making stuff which gets paid by the government? What if you get a chance to jump grades and do cooler stuff simply because you are already at that stage of professional knowledge and competency? What if graduating from University or Polytechnic is not good enough? What if you need to be an expert by the time you graduate from school simply because autonomous machines and automation have taken over work that is predictable and regular? What if you don’t have the time and opportunity to formulate and develop your expertise? What should you do?
I was in AI 30 years ago and by that, I mean Armoured Infantry, during my national service days. I understood what it meant to fight tanks with tanks. It was really no use using rifles to shoot at tanks. Similarly, we need to use AI to compete with AI because any other way is likely to be futile. To be clear, it is still early days yet for AI but the potential of AI represents a huge leap in the processing capability of machines, moving into areas such as visual recognition, and analysis of big data.
“Fight tanks with tanks, AI with AI”
We need to use AI to learn faster, better and more effectively. Human learning has to increase at an exponential rate because machine learning outscores and outlasts human learning on almost all counts.
 
 
How to Better Equip Ourselves in the Face of Artificial Intelligence and Automation
In the story of two men foraging for food in a forest and a bear appearing out of nowhere, we were told that to survive, one does not need to run faster than the bear but to outrun the other person.
In this analogy, if we take artificial intelligence (AI) and automation as the bear, and ourselves as the men who need to outrun each other or if possible, the bear itself, the challenges and our corresponding plans may become clearer to us. Hence, one solution that we may consider is simply to outcompete the other person and not necessarily the bear.
“But how does this analogy work?”
Technology has moulded and shaped the workforce over the years. From improving efficiency to workplace safety, it has forever changed how we approach and do work. In fact, every industrial revolution of the past were sparked by a new breakthrough in technology: the first was brought forth by the invention of steam engines, liberating us from overdependence on animal labour, the second was made possible by using electricity to drive mass production, which helped feed the rising demand of the global population and more recently, the third, where digital technology has helped to connect billions online.
It does not stop there, though. A fourth industrial revolution is on the horizon and it mainly revolves around Artificial intelligence (AI). With improvements in technology, machine learning algorithms are becoming ever versatile and AI can be eventually programmed to perform activities that follow a predictable pattern. These include cooking, cleaning, driving, reviewing MRI scans and many other behaviours. The implication is that many processes performed by human specialists can and will be automated. In fact, in their (2017) report, McKinsey & Co. predicts 60% of all jobs have at least 30% of activities which are able to be automated and this will result in a loss of 400 to 800 million jobs by the year 2030. For companies, this presents higher efficiency and profit margins as AI and automation eliminate human error and limitations. However, for the employee, the outlook turns negative. The encroaching AI and automation (the ‘Bear’) results in stiffer competition as both human and machine race for that job role.
The Global Status Report on Road Safety (2018), published by WHO in December 2018, highlights that the number of annual road traffic deaths has reached 1.35 million fatalities. Road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of people aged 5-29 years globally and the majority of those killed are the pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.
Research by Ohio University (2017) indicates that with driverless vehicles, also known as Grade 5 Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), we can benefit from AI in at least three ways:

Reduced rate of accidents due to human misjudgement and lapses in decision-making


Reduced travelling time due to more efficient pathing and avoiding of congestion


Reduced carbon emission due to more efficient braking and acceleration

 
Where do humans figure in this equation? 
It seems that human intervention is still required whether remotely or physically when the AV is in operation. Currently, most AVs’ autopilot is not extremely reliable and humans still has to take over the wheel when needed. Refer to the diagram on the 6 stages of automation in vehicles.
 

The 6 stages of automation in road vehicles
 
In the long run, if full automation were to take place, human drivers will monitor and control the AVs remotely from a control centre, overriding the automation when necessary (e.g. Calderone (n.d.) on Robotics Tomorrow). Imagine a whole army of driving controllers in every state and city, overseeing millions of AVs globally.
Hence, while AI encroaches into the driving industry, displacing millions of jobs, there are new jobs which will appear. Some of these jobs will have better compensation packages than current jobs. The critical question is which of the displaced drivers will be able to take on these new jobs.
 
Job mobility is important as it can provide you with more career pathways
If you are currently a professional driver, will you be able to outcompete other drivers to take on these new roles? Interestingly, the concept of feeder role is not new (e.g. Career Framework by Mercer). What this means is that employers will require staff with new capabilities. Often, these new capabilities require the layering on of new competencies and mindsets over current professional beliefs and values. 
 
As 2-time winners of the national InnovPlus Competition (2017 and 2018 editions) in Singapore, our team developed chatbots to drive a new experience for online learning. With chatbots for learning, curriculum designers no longer work on lesson plans or storyboards but on conversational trees. It utilises a branching methodology to drive learning scenarios and decision-making. The new designer capability is demanding. It layers new engagement pedagogy over foundational adult education beliefs and principles. Conversational tree designers are required to have strong foundational skills in designing online courses before they can be considered to take on this new role. What makes a potential conversational tree designer? The feeder capabilities include a sensitivity to learner needs, scripting fluency and instructional design.
In the 2019 survey by the Ministry of Manpower (MoM), the highest number of job vacancies was for trainers and assessors, over and above jobs such as accounting and computing.
Going forward, the Continuing Education and Training sector will require even more professionals especially those with technology-enabled learning skillsets.
Based on research published by Carl Benedikt and Michael A. Osborne from Oxford University (2013), jobs requiring:
Creativity and Innovation (R&D), Complexity and Management (Entrepreneurship) or Empathy and Compassion (social-workers, care-givers)
 
Teachers and trainers are high in demand but low in supply are less at risk of automation. It will be difficult for AI to replicate these roles due to the intrinsic nature of such work.
Automation will not be able to replace the entire workforce, so it is important to understand how AI and us will work together in the future. Homing in the evolving skillsets that are valuable to your job description can help you remain competitive as well as offer you opportunities to progress either horizontally (Across industries) or vertically (Within your industry).
Knowing how to make space for AI and automation will be critical for human workforce development so that human workers perform the roles that involve decision-making and pre-empting errors. Remember technology has the capability to multiply impact enormously so any mistake can be horrifyingly catastrophic.
So when the bear appears, we can either…
 Run faster than the other person by developing our capability to fit into the feeder jobs
Or
Move into spaces which AI may not necessarily encroach into at this point in time
 
As an Adult Educator trainer and mentor, I have coached more than 10,000, teachers, trainers and instructional designers over the past 20 years – some at novice levels but also many at intermediate and expert levels.
More recently, one of my learners working in a semiconductor industry was told to codify his skills so that the organisation can automate his role. John (not his real name) understood his role so well that besides codifying his skillsets, he also highlighted areas which would need a lot more work and could not be automated.  John’s boss was so impressed with John’s meticulous work that he kept John to oversee the automation process while his counterpart performing the same role in Switzerland was retrenched. In short, John outdid the competition by getting into the feeder role, which was to manage the on-going and future automation process.
What John provided was a blueprint on how a worker could get into the feeder role during the automation process; he carried out the following tasks: 

Codified key skillsets
Value added by signalling where machines cannot yet do the job
Specialised in plugging the skills gaps 
Facilitated the business process transformation
Operated at expertise level by reviewing the automation process by putting on strategic, innovative and metacognitive lenses
Maintained a resilient mindset even though he was given advance notice of a possible retrenchment or job redesign

As with John’s organisation, all enterprises seeking to automate will eventually need experts to manage the automation at the operational, supervisory and management levels. These experts work with intelligent machines to automate some of the current manual processes and in the long run, pre-empt errors as well as override the machines in the event of faults and accidents. The Air Ethiopia and Lion Air crashes involving the Boeing Max planes in 2019 taught us a few valuable lessons. One of which must be the re-examination of how humans think in relation to intelligent machines and automation.
 
Have pilots forgotten how to fly without autopilot? 
Due to the high level of trust built up over the years of usage, pilots stop questioning the validity and accuracy of data put forth by machines and the corresponding behaviour of these machines. To actually rise above the curtain of trust and question the machine data and behaviour requires a different manner of training approach.
“With so much automation in the flight deck nowadays … pilots may feel safer psychologically to keep relying on some autopilot functions ...”

Prof. Terence Fatt (Singapore Management University)

Effectively, pilots are trained to rely on machines and data to make decisions and this can be disastrous as the two air crashes demonstrate. Deciding when to cart over from relying on machines and automation to human decision-making is not a choice to be made lightly, especially under time pressure. Hence, this decision-making to question machines must be part of the training.
One approach that we have adopted over the years was to design errors intentionally into training, to develop metacognition and expertise. Through errors, practitioners are facilitated to question underpinning beliefs and assumptions during training, thus building elements of metacognition and deep expertise. However, most training in Singapore and globally does not deal with expertise training, only competency-level training.
With AI taking over competency-level tasks, we will short-change our learners if we do not shift learning designs to developing expertise. The race has changed. As AI is trained through massive data and feedback, any behaviour that can be tracked with the outcomes measured and feedback given, AI can and will improve at breakneck speed. Hence, competency-based tasks are perfect for AI to tap on, primarily because all competency-based training (CBT) are underpinned by measurable outcomes. If humans continue to depend on CBT, we will likely be outrun and out-thought over time.
 
Conclusion
In short, we can no longer win a 100-metre race; we have to stretch it to 110 metres. The intelligent machines can complete 100m in less than 1s (as an example). Humans take on average, about 10s. However, most intelligent machines cannot yet reach 110m. They do not quite have the metacognition, innovative mindsets, ability to pre-empt errors and question assumptions. Humans can complete the additional 10m run only if they are appropriately trained.
However, the majority of the workforce are trained to be only competent. Moving them into the expertise zone (i.e. the additional 10 m) will take a concerted effort to coach and mentor them, so that they can outcompete the intelligent machines and human resources in other countries.
The bears are coming!
We cannot assume things will remain the same. However, if you ask any man on the street how he is preparing for AI, the response is usually a puzzled look or to take each day as it comes. Some expect the government to resolve the challenges brought about by AI. Not many are thinking about the future, nor can they do anything about it. The learned helplessness can be incapacitating and disempowering.
We need a more ingenious and simple approach to get people into feeder roles, by training them to reach expertise levels. The competition will be stiff, the learning will be unprecedented but the opportunities and rewards can be immense and satisfying, only if we can ride the oncoming AI wave – to run and keep on running.

Artificial Intelligence at AT&T: Our Guiding Principles
By Tom Moore





share
































It started with a mouse in 1950 – a mechanical mouse that learned how to navigate a maze from experience. It was developed at AT&T’s Bell Labs, and it’s often considered the world’s first example of machine learning.
The mouse has grown into the field of Artificial Intelligence – a game-changing technology we use across our business. AI helps build and optimize the 5G network. It helps to fight fraud and enhance cybersecurity. We even use AI to guide our truck dispatch, helping technicians reach customers on time.
Artificial Intelligence is defined as a non-human system that mimics human intelligence. But another term is equally important: Ethics. It’s a system of moral standards and human values. It still belongs to people, and people still have responsibility for the outcomes generated by AI.
Here are the guiding principles that AT&T has adopted for working with Artificial Intelligence:
1.       By People, For People
We incorporate human oversight into AI. With people at the core, AI can enhance the workforce, expand capability and benefit society as a whole.
2.       Accessible and Shared
We support open-source communities whenever appropriate to further access, collaboration, standardization and participation in industry discussion.
3.       Secure and Ethical
We are grounded in ethics, safety, and values at every stage of AI, including our privacy principles and security safeguards.

­   Design: We use varied, validated datasets and diverse human input to achieve objectives.
­   Development: We use a transparent approach to algorithms that includes safeguards.
­   Deployment: We monitor outcomes to ensure accuracy and help minimize biases.

These may seem simple and common sense. But as AI leaders, we believe their importance can’t be overstated. These principles will guide our decisions from design to deployment.
Here’s a hypothetical example. AI can make our network more efficient. It reduces power needs and physical duplication by offering fast and smart routing decisions. But what if a new algorithm to skirt outages kept favoring urban customers at the expense of rural ones? Not on purpose – but as an unintended consequence.
No organization will be perfect, but that’s what humans must try to anticipate, catch and repair. The people who run AI decide on the data used, the goals set, the algorithms deployed, and the outcomes monitored.
What’s Next?
AI continues to evolve at a rapid pace. In addition to our principles, we’re developing an internal set of  operating guidelines, compliance tools and governance. We’re refining and expanding our AI training programs.
We’re committed to doing it right. When outcomes are owned by people, no one should be able to claim, “The machine did it.”
Tom Moore is AT&T’s chief privacy officer and senior vice president-compliance.

The big question is will AI affect the next generation of the labour force or it will change the job market completely in the era of automation?.The World Economic Forum has dubbed the age of AI, Automation is the new dawn of Industrialization, or Industry 4.0, which will change and re-define the way we communicate and transact..The new age disruptive technologies led by AI will change the job market bringing in more of automation, intelligence and creation of new opportunities. Almost no occupation will be unaffected by the technological change in the AI era. The most affected will be the ones which are rule-based and monotonous, like bookkeeping, record maintenance and manual excel based reconciliation..Technology leaders are drumming up the thought that the emergence of new technologies is going to be the new drivers of employment..Unplanned Automation May Cause Havoc.Experts say that if automation is not planned well and addressed holistically, it can lead to disaster without a doubt, affecting 60% to 70% of the current jobs. They will either get marginalized or eliminated once and for all. According to a World Bank research, automation is threatening 69% of the job market in India, while it's 77% in China..Automation has economy-wide implications at the macro level and workplace-level implications at the micro level for the worker..Automation will bring three main changes in the changing job market at the macro level, these include, gender disparity in the redeployment of the workforce, firm re-organisation and changes in skill demand. Skill will be more based on how does an employee and organisation adapts itself to the changing workspace credited to automation..The New age Human Cloud Platform.Automation has given rise to the new age digital workforce that is increasingly mobile. Dubbed as the Human Cloud Platform, this new breed of workers will redefine the changing Job Market where they can be hired from any location to perform tasks..Going at the micro level, automation will change how job profiles are looked at, jobs will be described as a set of independent tasks. Expect more of independent workers to perform a portfolio of tasks for pre-determined wage rates. More work will be decentralised and distributed to remote workers who may decide to work on their own terms..This will bring a new change in HR policies with respect to obligations on social benefit, collective bargaining and minimum wage rates set..The Age of Flexible Jobs, Transient Wages, and Distributed Risks.With the advent of Automation, there are three major areas in labour policy that will need a change, these include rethinking social policy and re-skilling workers in the short-term, in addition to re-examining employment potential of new sectors like the digital technologies in the long-term..In this case, Universities and the higher centres of learning will continue to play a leading role reskilling and re-modelling the resumes with certifications of new technologies studied. On-demand courses which give the flexibility to learn at one's own pace is no doubt a big hit now. The present workforce has to adapt, and un-learn and re-learn with the new codes of the digital era..Mitigating the Damage.As evidenced by ongoing discussions in the business community, companies have fully committed to a new wave of automation. Doing so makes business since—it will help bolster firm productivity and improve companies' bottom lines. However, these decisions will also have significant impacts on the lives of millions of workers. Therefore, policymakers at all levels must step in with new investments to mitigate the worst impacts of automation and to ensure a just and equitable transition to a 21st-century economy. Without urgent and consequential action, we should expect the coming decades to look much like the last: considerable economic benefits for some, but significant strain and disruption for many others..In a crux, it is predefined that AI will make some labour obsolete, but we cannot hide from the bigger picture of the potential benefits that AI will bring along, easing its way into the economy retraining humans for jobs overlooking a new set of activities. AI and Its allied technologies will no doubt create a difference in the workforce and in a crux will bring about changes that will be exciting and ground-breaking in terms of the policy, job roles and working without the cubicles.. A change which we all can't watch to watch unfold!.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
