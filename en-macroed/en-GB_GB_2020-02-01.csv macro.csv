ChowFebruary 5, 2020 2:02 PM ESTIn November, the musician Grimes made a bold prediction. “I feel like we’re in the end of art, human art,” she said on Sean Carroll’s Mindscape podcast. “Once there’s actually AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), they’re gonna be so much better at making art than us.” Her comments sparked a meltdown on social media. The musician Zola Jesus called Grimes the “voice of silicon fascist privilege.” Majical Cloudz frontman Devon Welsh accused her of taking “the bird’s-eye view of billionaires.” Artificial intelligence has already upended many blue collar jobs across various industries; the possibility that music, a deeply personal and subjective form, could also be optimized was enough to cause widespread alarm. But there are many musicians who feel that the onset of AI won’t end human art, but spur a new golden era of creativity. Over the past several years, several prominent artists, like Arca, Holly Herndon and Toro y Moi have worked with AI in order to push their music in new and unexpected directions. Meanwhile, a host of musicians and researchers across the world are developing tools to make AI more accessible to artists everywhere. While obstacles like copyright complications and other hurdles have yet to be worked out, musicians working with AI hope that the technology will become a democratizing force and an essential part of everyday musical creation. “It’s provided me a sense of relief and excitement that not everything has been done — that there’s a wide-open horizon of possibility,” Arca, a producer who’s worked with Kanye West and Björk on groundbreaking albums, told TIME in a phone interview. Artificial intelligence and music have long been intertwined. Alan Turing, the godfather of computer science, built a machine in 1951 that generated three simple melodies. In the 90s, David Bowie started playing around with a digital lyric randomizer for inspiration. At the same time, a music theory professor trained a computer program to write new compositions in the style of Bach; when an audience listened to its work next to a genuine Bach piece, they couldn’t tell them apart.Progress in AI music field has rapidly accelerated in the past few years, thanks in part to devoted research teams at universities, investments from major tech companies and machine learning conferences like NeurIPS. In 2018, Francois Pachet, a longtime AI music pioneer, spearheaded the first pop album composed with artificial intelligence, Hello, World. Last year, the experimental singer-songwriter Holly Herndon received acclaim for Proto, an album in which she harmonized with an AI version of herself:But while the technology has come a long way, many say that we’re still far from an AI creating hit songs on its own. “AI music is simply not good enough to create a song that you will listen to and be like, ‘I would rather listen to this than Drake,’” says Oleg Stavitsky, the CEO and co-founder of Endel, an app which generates sound environments. Case in point: “Daddy’s Car,” a 2016 AI-penned song meant to mimic the Beatles, is a frustrating jumble of psychedelic rock tropes that fails to come together in a meaningful way. Perhaps in part due to these limitations, few straight-ahead pop songs are being created by AI. Instead, much more intriguing progress is being made in two seemingly diametrically opposed streams of music: the functional and the experimental. Meeting DemandsOn one side of the spectrum, AI music has become an answer to a simple demand: more music is needed than ever, thanks to a ballooning number of content creators on streaming and social media platforms. In the early 2010s, the composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes, and Michael Hobe were working on music for Hollywood films like The Dark Knight when they found themselves deluged with requests for simple background music for film, TV or video games. “There would be so many of our colleagues who wanted music that they couldn’t afford or didn’t have time for — and they didn’t want to use stock music,” says Silverstein.So the trio created Amper, which allows non-musicians to create music by indicating parameters like genre, mood and tempo. Amper’s music is now used in podcasts, commercials, and videos for companies like Reuters. “Previously, a video editor would search stock music and settle for something sufficient,” Silverstein says. “Now, with Amper, they can say, ‘I know what I want, and in a matter of minutes, I can make it.'” And when the company ran a recent Turing-like test, they found that, just like with the AI-generated Bach composition, consumers couldn’t tell the difference between music composed by humans and that composed by Amper’s AI. Endel was likewise created to fill a modern need: personalized soundscapes. Stavitsky realized that while people are increasingly plugging into headphones to get them through the day, “there’s no playlist or song that can adapt to the context of whatever’s happening around you,” he says. His app takes several real-time factors into account — including the weather, the listener’s heart rate, physical activity rate, and circadian rhythms — in generating gentle music that’s designed to help people sleep, study or relax. Stavitsky says users have successfully used Endel to combat ADHD, insomnia and tinnitus; a company representative said the app reached one million downloads at the end of January. Both Amper and Endel turn non-musicians into sonic curators, allowing them to become involved in a process they might have been shut out of due to lack of training or background. This year, Silverstein says, Amper will launch a consumer-friendly interface so that anyone, not just companies, can use it to create songs. “Billions of billions of individuals who might not have been part of the creative class now can be,” he says. Pushing Music ForwardOf course, creating simple ditties or glorified white noise is far different from creating great music. This is one of the main concerns that many have about AI in music: that it could flatten music into functional and generic sounds until every song sounds more or less the same. What if major labels use AI and algorithms to cram simplistic earworms down our aural cavities from now until the end of time? But musician Claire Evans of the Los Angeles-based electropop band YACHT says that sort of craven optimization already sits at the heart of the music industry: “That algorithm exists and it’s called Dr. Luke,” she says, referring to the once omnipresent producer who creates pop hits through specific formulas. It’s the job of forward-thinking musicians, then, to wield the technology for the exact opposite purpose: to push against standardization and explore uncharted territory they could not have conjured on their own. For their most recent album Chain Tripping, YACHT trained a machine learning system on their entire catalog of music. After the machine spit out hours of melodies and lyrics based on what it had learned, the band culled through its output and spliced together the most intriguing bits into coherent songs. The result was a jumpy and meandering interpretation of dance pop that was strange to listen to and even stranger to play. “I think often musicians underestimate how much the way we play is based on our physical experiences and habits,” Evans says. She says it took the band many excruciating hours to learn the new music, because many riffs or chord changes would deviate just slightly from the ones they had relied on for decades. “AI forced us to come up against patterns that have no relationship to comfort. It gave us the skills to break out of our own habits,” she says. The project resulted in the first Grammy nomination of YACHT’s two-decade career, for best immersive audio album. For the British-Iranian musician Ash Koosha, working with AI ironically led to an emotional breakthrough. He developed an AI pop star, named Yona, that writes songs through generative software. And while many of her lyrics are vague and nonsensical, some of them were shockingly vulnerable. Koosha was especially astounded by the line “The one who loves you sings lonely songs with sad notes.” “Being so blunt and so open — so emotionally naked — is not something most humans can do,” Koosha told TIME. “I wouldn’t be able to be that honest unless something triggers me.” In Berlin, the hacker duo Dadabots is hard at work creating musical chaos and disorientation with AI’s help. Berlin has become one of the global centers of AI experimentation (Endel is also based there) and Dadabots is currently in the midst of a residency in which they’re workshopping new tools with avant-garde songwriters and running AI-generated death metal livestreams. Co-founder CJ Carr says that AI acts both as a trainer for musicians — “like how a chess AI can help you improve your game,” he says — and a formidable radical creator. Dadabots’ neural networks have spit out ominous whispers, guttural howls, and furiously choppy drum patterns. For Carr, the weirder, the better. “When music is messed up, that’s better for music,” he says. “I want to see expressions and emotions and sounds that have never existed before.” For other creators, AI is not just a path forward, but also a link to a forgotten past of pre-recorded music. Last summer, a new version of the 2012 cult classic “Jasmine” by Jai Paul appeared online. While the first few bars sound the same as the original, the track gradually begins to mutate, with slippery guitar licks and syncopated hand claps drifting and out. The song continues for as long as you are listening — a taut band seemingly locked into an infinite, infectious jam session. But the track is AI-generated, a project from London-based company Bronze. Its creators, musicians Lexx and Gwilym Gold and scientist Mick Grierson, hoped to create a piece of technology that would dislodge music from the static and fossilized nature of recordings. “We wanted a system for people to listen to music in the same state it existed in our hands — as a constant, evolving form,” Gold told TIME. Jai Paul shares a label, XL, with Arca, one of pop music’s foremost transgressors (she worked on Kanye West’s Yeezus, Björk’s Vulnicura and FKA Twigs LP1). When the Venezuelan-born Arca learned about Bronze’s work, she was intrigued about how it could connect live and recorded music in an unprecedented way. “When you publish an album, that’s the way people will hear it forever more. When you play a song live, it’s unpredictable and ephemeral,” she says. “Working with tech like Bronze allows for this third thing. Lexx and I got really excited talking about what it means for the way people can listen to music, and the course of the industry.” Arca and the Bronze team soon began collaborating on an installation by the French artist Philippe Parreno that currently resides in the newly reopened lobby of New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The music creaks and burbles out of swiveling speakers that seem to move along with you. The output changes with the temperature and crowd density, meaning no two days in the space will be the same.Arca says that listening to the music that she ostensibly composed is a strange and gripping experience. “There’s something freeing about not having to make every single microdecision, but rather, creating an ecosystem where things tend to happen, but never in the order you were imagining them,” she says. “It opens up a world of possibilities.” She says that she has a few new music projects coming this year using Bronze’s technology. “Still in the Very Beginning” While creators like Arca use AI to push creativity forward, many worry that the technology will displace musicians from their jobs. But Koosha says that this type of fear has accompanied every technological development of the last century. “It reminds me of the fear people had in the 70s — when guitar players started a movement to break any synthesizer they found,” he says. While some guitarists or drummers might have been displaced, a whole generation of home producers arose thanks to the lower barrier to entry, and hip-hop, house music and entire new vocabularies and sonic aesthetics rose to the fore. And Francois Pachet, the director of Spotify’s Creator Technology Research Lab, says that we’re still very much in the early days of experimentation with AI music. “The amount of music produced by AI is very little compared to the activity on the research side,” he says. “We are still in the very beginning.”When more AI creations are released, there will be inevitable legal battles. Existing copyright laws weren’t written with AI in mind, and are extremely vague about whether the rights to an AI song would be owned by the programmer who created the AI system, the original musician whose works provided the training data, or maybe even the AI itself. Some are worried that a musician would have no legal recourse against a company that trained an AI program to create soundalikes of them, without their permission. But until those issues arise, musicians around the world are working as hard as they can to get their tools into the hands of as many curious music-makers as possible. “I want to see 14 year old bedroom producers,” Carr says, “inventing music that I can’t even imagine.” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A Guardian investigation in October found the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had increased spending to about £8m a year on a specialist “intelligent automation garage” where computer scientists were developing more than 100 welfare robots, deep learning and intelligent automation for use in the welfare system.The Dutch government’s risk indication system (SyRI) is a risk calculation model developed over the past decade by the social affairs and employment ministry to predict the likelihood of an individual committing benefit or tax fraud or violating labour laws.Deployed primarily in low-income neighbourhoods, it gathers government data previously held in separate silos, such as employment, personal debt and benefit records, and education and housing histories, then analyses it using a secret algorithm to identify which individuals might be at higher risk of committing benefit fraud.A broad coalition of privacy and welfare rights groups, backed by the largest Dutch trade union, argued that poor neighbourhoods and their inhabitants were being spied on digitally without any concrete suspicion of individual wrongdoing. SyRI was disproportionately targeting poorer citizens, they said, violating human rights norms.The court ruled that the SyRI legislation contained insufficient safeguards against privacy intrusions and criticised a “serious lack of transparency” about how it worked. It concluded in its ruling that, in the absence of more information, the system may, in targeting poor neighbourhoods, amount to discrimination on the basis of socioeconomic or migrant status.Sentencing: minister rejects European human rights convention warningRead moreThe system did not pass the test required by the European convention on human rights of a “fair balance” between its objectives, namely to prevent and combat fraud in the interest of economic wellbeing, and the violation of privacy that its use entailed, the court added, declaring the legislation was therefore unlawful. The Dutch government can appeal against the decision.Christiaan van Veen, director of the digital welfare state and human rights project at New York University School of Law, said it was “important to underline that SyRI is not a unique system; many other governments are experimenting with automated decision-making in the welfare state”.Van Veen cited Australia and the UK as countries where such concerns were particularly acute. “This strong ruling will set a strong precedent globally that will encourage activists in other countries to challenge their governments,” he said.Alston predicted the judgment would be “a wake-up call for politicians and others, not just in the Netherlands”. The special rapporteur presented a report to the UN general assembly in October on the emergence of the “digital welfare state” in countries around the globe, warning of the need “to alter course significantly and rapidly to avoid stumbling, zombie-like, into a digital welfare dystopia”.In the UK, as well as contracts with the outsourcing multinationals IBM, Tata Consultancy and Capgemini, the DWP is also working with UiPath, a New York-based company co-founded by Daniel Dines, the world’s first “bot billionaire”, who last month said: “I want a robot for every person.”His software is being deployed in an effort to introduce machine learning to check benefit claims, which suggests welfare computers will autonomously learn and alter the way they make decisions with minimum human intervention.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NetherlandsBenefitsInequalityComputingEuropePrivacynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNever doubt the instincts of Donald Trump, who just appointed ‘never Trump guy’ as his running mateMarina Hyde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s here to stay. That means the industry will need a skilled workforce to build more artificial brains.,The Future of Work,N/A,"Artificial intelligence is all the rage, and there’s good money to be made in an industry that’s still largely emerging from its infancy. But, the problems that AI solves are not easy, and to work in the AI industry you will need a strong and focused set of skills. Here’s the good news: We live in a society where a shocking number of people would rather have a robot boss than a human one. We would rather be led by machines. This means that most of us are accepting of the idea of artificial intelligence, or AI.  In many sectors, machines have already taken over monotonous jobs. Automotive manufacturing is a prime example. Auto and aerospace manufacturers use machines heavily in their assembly lines. In fact, machines completely transformed the way that our cars are built. Artificial intelligence isn’t just a fad. It’s here to stay. And it’s here to stay in most industries, from consumer technology to staffing to aerospace defense.And, that means the industry will need a skilled workforce to build, test and deploy more and more artificial brains around the world. Get in early and you’ll stand to make a lot of money. Not to mention help change the world. If you are interested in a career in artificial intelligence, then you’re in the right place. What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial intelligence attempts to mimic (and surpass) the power of the human brain using nothing but machines. “Machine learning” is another common term in AI. The primary goals of artificial intelligence are:
Speed up repetitive procedures by using robots or machines instead of humans 
Out-smart human brains through “learning” and memory
Recognize patterns and make decisions instantly and efficiently
Artificial intelligence attempts to build machines that think and reason rather than operate in a relatively confined space with pre-built routines, procedures and outcomes. Smart AI systems recognize patterns and remember past events and learn from them, making each subsequent decision smarter, logical and more organic. AI is a giant paradigm shift in modern computing and requires a deeply scientific and logical approach to design computer systems that think and learn. In other words, build robots that aren’t just “robots”. And believe it or not, AI capabilities are all over the place. A few examples of artificial intelligence systems include speech recognition (available on many cell phones and smart home devices), email spam blockers, plagiarism checkers, language translation services (like Google Translate) and the auto-pilot system on airplanes. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amgen, Amazon, Facebook, ExxonMobil, Boeing, Raytheon, Humana and so many others are hiring for artificial intelligence roles. AI salaries are typically higher than average because good AI talent can be hard to find. Examples of roles in artificial intelligence include data engineers and data scientists.Artificial intelligence is everywhere in society, and the industry is growing rapidly in 2020. Here is exactly what you need to know to pursue a career in AI, and the salary of data engineers.The Skills You Need to Work in Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence is highly scientific. After all, mimicking the human brain using machines is a very tough problem to solve, much less master. The skills that you will need to pursue AI as a career are varied, but all of them require a great deal of education, training and focus. That said, there is a wide variety of career types available in AI and machine learning, and they range from higher-level research to low-level programming and implementation. For example, researchers use their breadth of knowledge in theory and study to reveal new types of systems and capabilities. Researchers hypothesize new or different ways for machines to think and test their research for real-world feasibility. Algorithm developers take AI research and transform that research into repeatable processes through mathematical formulas that can be implemented using hardware and software.Software developers and computer scientists use those algorithms to write sophisticated pieces of software that analyze, interpret and make decisions.   Hardware technicians build pieces of equipment (like robots) to interact with the world. Robots use its internal software to move and operate. Most careers in artificial intelligence require coursework and experience in a variety of math and science-related topics like:
Math: statistics, probability, predictions, calculus, algebra, Bayesian algorithms and logic
Science: physics, mechanics, cognitive learning theory, language processing
Computer science: data structures, programming, logic and efficiency
Want a career in AI? No matter what your desired job title is, you should read. A lot. Read papers and case studies. Experiment with technologies like Map-Reduce, PHP, MySQL, Postgres and “Big Data”, especially if you are targeting a computer science-related career in AI. Expose yourself to as many technologies as you can. Pro tip: Browse through AI job opportunities. Read the job descriptions and especially the requirements to get a feel for specific qualifications that you need for that job. For example, some might need experience in low-level programming languages like Python or MatLab. Others, especially in the healthcare industry, need expertise in data services like Spark and Blockchain. Regardless of the type of job that you’re after in artificial intelligence, there is no better way to figure out the exact skills you need than to read job requisitions and stay as up-to-date in the industry as possible. Use the Job Search tool here on The Ladders to find AI and machine learning jobs. The Best Non-Tech Skills for Artificial IntelligenceThough the types of careers in the AI industry are varied, most professionals in AI possess five key skills and capabilities, regardless of their individual roles. Most AI professionals: Are highly critical thinkers. They take nothing at face value and are naturally curious. They believe in trial and error and must test and experiment before making a concrete decision. Like to push the envelope. AI is all about pushing the boundaries. Pegging the capabilities of hardware and software to their max, always looking for more. More ways to improve existing systems. More ideas for inventing new ways to live. Live naturally-curious lives. Always wanting to know more, artificial intelligence pros want to know how things work. They don’t just look. They observe. They don’t hear. They listen. Don’t get easily overwhelmed. They understand that artificial intelligence is highly technical, but also realize that venturing into uncharted waters is difficult and mysterious. They enjoy the process rather than getting frustrated by it. Love math and science. AI is highly technical and it’s a natural good fit for those who are gifted and interested in hard sciences and mathematics. Artificial intelligence is not just about replacing the human component of the industry. It’s also about making it easier to make decisions based on observable patterns, use logic and reasoning to form conclusions and build pathways to boost efficiency and production. It is not an easy discipline, but that’s also why salaries in the AI industry are much higher than average. It takes the right type of person with the right skill set to excel. Are you the type of person who’s right for a career in AI? If you have many of these skill sets, then you just might be. Top U.S. cities for Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence an advantage to modern workforces

4th February 2020 



 






guest column:Emmanuel Zvada
HR in the age of disruptions needs to play the role of agile leaders with a digital and business mindset, helping their organisations stay ahead of the technological curve. Smart technologies are not just changing our homes; they are edging their way disrupting the workplaces. 
I thank IPMZ (Institute of People Management of Zimbabwe) for pioneering Digital HR Transformation last week, it was really long overdue in the Zimbabwean HR fraternity as it has the potential to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy across organisations both private and public.
What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to technology used to do a task that requires some level of intelligence to accomplish. In other words, they are tools trained to do what a human can do. AI is different from ordinary software’s because it has high-speed computation, a huge amount of quality data and advanced algorithms. AI technologies offer significant opportunities to improve HR functions, such as self-service transactions, recruiting and talent acquisition, payroll, reporting, access policies and procedures. Human resources executives have faith that merging AI into HR administration functions will benefit and improve the overall employee experience.

Artificial intelligence and HRM
AI is reinventing human resources in a way not seen before by automating the repetitive task of hiring, onboarding, learning, and development, allowing HR teams to focus more on creative and strategic work. AI is being used in HR to automate repetitive, low-value tasks thus increasing the focus on more strategic work. Many fear that the rise of AI will lead to machines and robots replacing human workers and view this progression in technology as a threat rather than a tool to better ourselves. Let me clear all the fears and resistance of AI by enlightening all HR practitioners that you are not been replaced but HR processes, system and practices are just being reinvented.
Why artificial intelligenceAdopting a workplace artificial intelligence leads to more automatic processing for tasks that a company works through each day. It is crucial to note that the beauty of AI in the workplace is that the same amount of work that can be done in a day or two days by employees with the aid of AI it can be done in hours. This means productivity and efficiency is enhanced. Using AI in the workplace is also easier than many thinks. Artificial intelligence in the workplace allows a company and its employees to reach maximum efficiency levels, leaving more time for projects and networking.
Eliminate repetitive, manual processes with automationAI automates processes eliminating repetitive, manual processes replacing them with automation. Think about how much time is wasted on repetitive processes that could be performed via automation. By automating many of the physical and redundant processes performed by your workforce, you can allocate more time, resources, and brainpower to larger endeavour’s like sales strategy and customer satisfaction.
Save time especially use of chatbotsA chatbot is a service, powered by pre-programmed rules and sometimes, that you interact through a chat interface. Chatbots have actually been around for years, but they have had a recent renaissance with the rise of artificial intelligence. These easy-to-use tools are incredibly useful in the workplace since they allow for instant communication, ergo faster decision-making.
AI chatbots become smarter over time and learn better answers to frequently asked questions, freeing up time for management to focus on more strategic tasks. These virtual robots are effective and bridge the communication gap between employees and management and make internal information easily accessible.
Artificial intelligence improves employee’s productivity.
The main objective of the organisation is to earn maximum profit by utilising minimum manpower. Through the technical improvements and automation software, multiple tasks in the office are achieved effortlessly and the work of the employees become much simpler. The advancement of technology works as an important tool but at the same time, increases complexity at the workplace. Not only does AI increase productivity, it also improves overall quality. With any job, human-error is always a factor, whereas AI software is less likely to malfunction. It also enables deeper personalisation by understanding what customers want over time, resulting in better quality products and services.
Reducing human bias in decision makingHumans are normally biased in whatever choices or decision they making. Even when striving for inclusiveness, HR professionals may subconsciously lean toward a particular candidate, for example in recruitment. Now, with artificial intelligence, algorithms can be designed to help employers identify and remove these biases. That potentially translates to better hiring communication and attracting a more diverse group of candidates. Those same algorithms can also find candidates who may have been screened out due to human bias.
Artificial intelligent makes HR more humanEmbracing of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in human capital management is the only way that HR practitioners can become more human at workplaces. The automation of tasks through AI technology allows for the freeing of HR professionals to focus on uniquely human abilities such as critical thinking, creativity, and empathy. While they are involved with the more human tasks, technology, at the moment, can handle the more ordinary tasks.
Besides being adaptable, flexible and agile to the ongoing changes, HR has to prepare for the innovations that are yet to occur and the development that might define the future of work. This is where a strong knowledge of current trends and the potential they come with will come in handy.
The HR department is probably the most promising field to put AI to use as they are the first line in dealing with the “human” component of their business. AI could serve as a great ally to them at each stage, right from sourcing talent, shortlisting applicants and performance assessment, making it a key tool in HR management. The journey for HR to pace up with the age of disruption starts from knowing the employees, the business, the environment the business operates in, applying analytics and data science, and then framing relevant strategies which will be then executed using new age technologies as per the requirement of business. Thus, in the age of disruptions, the first thing HR needs to disrupt is themselves.
If organisations wish to remain competitive in today’s global economy, they need to look at ways to incorporate conversational AI for HR transactions in their decision-making processes.
Organisations should rely on AI to perform administrative duties so that HR departments may become more efficient, by so doing HR professionals will be able to focus more on strategic planning at an organisational level.

Isaac Asimov, roboticist and science fiction writer, predicted in his novel I, Robot in 1950 that robots and artificial intelligence were going to be banned from Earth in the year 2030. Instead, we are seeing huge advances in AI and this is likely to continue within the next decade.
The UK’s investment in AI recently reached a record high for 2019, rising from  $1.02 billion for the whole of 2018 to $1.06 billion in the first six months of 2019. What’s more, the European Commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen recently made calls for a GDPR-style regulation for the use of AI to be put in place, signaling the predicted mass uptake of the technology amongst businesses across different industries.
There are multiple facets of AI, all with varied uses and capabilities, and one area in particular that is attracting a lot of attention is Intelligent Automation. Intelligent Automation (IA) marries artificial intelligence including natural language processing, digital workforce management and machine learning with automation.
This branch of the technology is currently boasting an expected market growth of up to $14.4 billion by the year 2024 up from $8 billion in 2019. IA leveraging the potential of fractal science will be a key branch of AI that can help companies solve the unstructured data challenge. It will essentially enable companies to not only process structured data, but also unstructured data and given that this type of data will make up 80 percent of all business data by the year 2025, more companies will be looking to utilize IA with fractal science for their business processes. AI technology such as deep automation tools including Integrated Automation Platforms (IAP) will soon become the go-to business processing tools.
AntWorks predicts that in the next decade, it will be hard to find an industry not utilizing AI to intelligently automate business processes. With countless use cases for AI across all industries, here are our predictions for 2020 and beyond.
Automated workforces and services
Companies across all industries are in most parts experiencing a never-ending demand for convenience from customers. This has certainly been characterized by the increase in the adoption of chatbots in some sectors. It is clear that consumers are unopposed to the idea, with 40 percent of them not being concerned about whether a robot or a human assists them as long as the experience is positive and their problems are solved.  However, automating customer service roles can put jobs at risk or may require a change in skillset for the human workforce. Companies need to integrate upskilling/reskilling programs into their digital transformation strategies to truly realize the value that comes when human and digital workforces come together.
 AI to advance surveillance
The safety and security of the public is very high on the agenda for most governments in the world. this is why we will likely be seeing a rise in the adoption of computer vision technology as a form of surveillance within the upcoming decade. A key challenge on the horizon for governing bodies, however, will be the ethical implementation of this technology. In 2019, the CIA’s deputy director of technology development Dawn Meyerricks confirmed the organization had 137 ongoing AI projects, including a computer vision solution that is capable of identifying and tagging objects or individuals in real-time video recordings. These findings would then be flagged to the surveillance team for further analysis.
According to Meyerricks, the CIA is also working on an AI solution that can forecast any significant future events through trends and shifts in data analysis, enabling them to then prepare accordingly. Whilst the latter use cases for AI technology are positively in line with the safekeeping of the public, it is not out of the realm of possibility that it could be used for more sinister activities. This concern naturally reinforces the need for organizations to tackle issues around the safety and responsible use of an otherwise effective and promising new AI capability in security.
AI and ethics: the debate continues
The ethics regarding the use of AI across different industries will be a hot topic throughout the 2020s. AI has the potential to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges as well as enhance the quality of our personal and professional lives. Yet there is a real risk of AI falling into the wrong hands. From being used for political fixing to corporate espionage, there are countless dangerous ways in which perpetrators could use the technology for ulterior motives. Calls for the regulation and standardization of AI have already been made and will continue to surface. This means that the increased investment and desire to expand AI regulations across all industries will likely ensure that there are greater consequences for those out of compliance.
The success of using AI for good depends upon trust, and that trust can only be built over time with the utmost adherence to ethical principles and practices. As we plow ahead into the next decade, the only way we can really see AI and automation take the world of business by storm is if it is smartly regulated. This begins with incentivizing further advancements and innovation to the tech, which means regulating applications rather than the tech itself.
Governments need to provide a framework to ensure the protection against malicious use of AI. This means that we will hopefully see a greater onus and accountability put on major organizations in delivering any form of cutting-edge AI technology, in a way that is both responsible and ethical.
 AI in healthcare to grow exponentially

The discovery and trials of drugs is an expensive endeavor. In fact, each new drug development program can cost approximately $2.6 billion to run. Given the increasing resistance of diseases and the rise of superbugs, it is starting to become a race against time for many big pharma companies in bringing new drugs to the market. AI can speed up drug trial processes.
The complexity of the molecular makeup of drugs means that finding data on new combinations for a particular medicine can be difficult as the combinations are numerous. Therefore, a lot work goes into studying research data on genes, molecular structures, and other biological information. Processing this large amount of data can be very difficult and time consuming for a human, which is why intelligent automation platforms are needed to process and analyze this catalog of data at a much faster rate using multi-tenancy bots and deep learning algorithms. Not only will this speed up the drugs time to market, but it will also save pharma companies billions in revenue
Another use case for intelligent automation in the healthcare industry is on the frontline. Currently, half of physicians’ time is spent on electronic health records (EHR) and paperwork. The use of AI to process patient data will not only enable physicians to see more patients per day, but the data insights AI can give will provide faster and more effective patient diagnosis.
AI technology has exceptional potential and is expected to create promising opportunities across all industries in the next decade. Its projected growth means that organizations will need to continue tinkering with their digital transformation strategies in order to accommodate the effective use of AI. More than anything, AI and machine learning will soon determine the fate of many companies as the markets become increasingly more saturated.

Landmark Relic of Silent Film Hauntingly Upscaled to 4K by Artificial Intelligence

Tech05 February 2020By David Nield 

 
(Denis Shiryaev/YouTube/Lumière brothers) 



Released in 1896, L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat is one of the earliest examples of movie-making we have – the 50-second silent short, which shows a mail train pulling into La Ciotat station, seems humdrum by today's standards, but would have wowed 19th century crowds seeing moving pictures for the first time.



Now this famously old, scratchy film relic has been upscaled into glorious 60 frames-per-second 4K footage thanks to the power of artificial intelligence – using neural networks to fill in missing pixels and missing frames that weren't there to begin with.



It's the work of developer and YouTuber Denis Shiryaev, and if you watch his new take it comes across as a modern-day movie filmed in black and white. Details on clothing and the train itself can be easily picked out; everything runs smoothly and in sync; and you can see far into the distance. width=""700″ height=""414″ allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"">As well as adding a new audio track, Shiryaev has used two algorithms here: the first is the Gigapixel AI from Topaz Labs, which fills in detail as pictures are made larger.



It does this by analysing huge numbers of images as they are scaled down, learning what information gets lost along the way. With this training to draw on, the AI is able to work backwards to add information as images are scaled up.



The second bit of AI magic is added by DAIN (or Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation), developed by a team of researchers and Google engineers.



DAIN also fills in detail, like Gigapixel AI, but this time it's it's inserting whole pictures rather than individual pixels, building the frame rate up to a smooth 60 frames per second.



Again, it's using an archive of existing videos as training materials, trying to work out what should be in the gaps by assessing both the before and after frames, and the different levels of depth that are in a shot.



Bear in mind that the extra details you're seeing in this restoration may not actually be what was really in the footage, down to the last pixel – instead they're the best guesses of computer algorithms trained on vast libraries of similar photos and videos.



The original L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat was filmed by the Lumière brothers, using 35mm film inside a Cinématographe camera (which also doubled as a projector).



We should also point out that compared to some very poor-looking, low-resolution copies of the film online, the source video Shiryaev used is also of a very good quality, likely thanks to previous restoration techniques.



Unfortunately, the source video doesn't come with any details about how it was made, but it looks to have been digitally enhanced in some way.



Whatever the story behind the source used, the new version adds extra resolution and smoothness to the footage, giving us another example of how AI engines can construct their own digital reality.



While there are valid concerns about deepfake photos and videos – recreating scenes that never existed – this upscaling of a classic silent film shows the positive ways that neural networks can be deployed.Check out some of the older versions of L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat floating around YouTube, and you can see what a difference digital processing and artificial enhancements can make. The film is even available in colour now too.

Much has been said about the impact of Industry 4.0 and rapid technological changes and how robots and Artificial intelligence (AI) would affect work.What is clear is the way we work in the future will be drastically different. How can workers better prepare themselves? And what can the Government and employers do to help workers?Advertisement 











Economic downturns are usually swift and unexpected, and those who have yet to re-equip themselves with new skills could face the possibility of long-term unemployment.Alexander Monge-Naranjo and Faisal Sohail from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found in 2015 that the share of older workers in the United States above 50 facing long term unemployment spells of 26 weeks or longer had doubled from 21 per cent in 2005 to 41 per cent in 2015.The rising long-term unemployment of this group of individuals reflects the mismatch between the skills they have and the skills employers demand.

      Unemployment inched up in 2019 but job growth better than expected
  







In the era of Industry 4.0, where the economic landscape is rapidly changing, we can expect the threat of long-term unemployment to also increasingly affect younger workers, not only those in their 50s. For those with dependants and a mortgage to service, a persistent unemployment spell would be catastrophic.HOW SHOULD SINGAPORE RESPOND?Advertisement 











Our best response to this uncertainty is to accept the increasing possibility of redundancies, have an open mind about re-skilling, and open, honest discussions about supporting unemployed workers using a mix of active labour market and income support policies such as limited unemployment insurance, wage insurance and maybe even some minimal form of basic income.This will prevent an economic underclass from forming and increasing inequality in our society.An example is the Danish model of ""flexicurity"", which encourages employers to restructure during downturns but supports workers with unemployment benefits.The consensus among the firms, workers and the Danish government is that firms that need to restructure will not hesitate to fire workers, but the workers themselves are not severely affected as they get to undergo retraining and receive unemployment benefits from the state for up to two years, at a maximum rate of around S$770 a week in 2018.

      Singapore’s economic growth and job creation have benefited citizens more than foreigners
  







In contrast, firms in Singapore that need to restructure tend to carry out retrenchment exercises, with employees getting a one-off payment that is costly to their employers.  Advertisement 











This is not to say that the Danish model is superior to Singapore’s or that the Republic should blindly adopt a Scandinavian model of social welfare.At the same time, active reskilling supported by the Government and tertiary institutions will help displaced workers retrain and address problems with falling cohort sizes.A mindset shift towards being more accepting of industry switchers may help improve risk-taking among the next generation of mid-career professionals in sunset industries who may not enjoy as much retrenchment benefits as older cohorts.Government support in the form of a transitionary income support paid directly to trainees, who may not have found an employer sponsor in the new industry, may help reduce hesitancy and bandwidth taxes associated with the loss of income while switching jobs.  This can complement the Adapt and Grow scheme where wage subsidies are given to employers only after they hire prospective employees, and while they wait for training to be completed.Advertisement

Such income support would also go further than the one-off Job Credit Scheme the Government implemented in 2009 to give businesses cash grants to encourage them to preserve jobs in a downturn.Indeed, an economic package for the future should incorporate some thinking about supporting industries through transformation in the longer term.In Budget 2016, the Government had launched Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to help major industries restructure to meet increasingly challenging economic conditions, global competition and disruptive technologies.While the Government has developed a set of structures for transformation, businesses should cooperate and see this initiative as an opportunity to automate, invest in other technologies or shift to different industries altogether.On the part of the Government, it can look at supporting such forms of riskier business decisions in future iterations of the ITMs to allow business owners to also switch from sunset industries to other businesses.This process, nonetheless, takes time as it requires an eventual recognition of where the future economic opportunities are, which could be very different from the present ones.

For example, healthcare, and its intersection with fintech and data analytics, would be increasingly important given Singapore’s ageing population and its ambition as a smart nation.However, in the five new banking licences that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is ready to issue, it is interesting to note that none of the consortiums applying for the digital banking licences here is focusing on the elderly.This is a departure from banks in Japan like the Kyoto Shinkin Bank, which organises music therapy sessions, lowered bank counters so services could be provided while older customers are seated and has managers and clerks who are trained to spot dementia. One current applicant in Singapore is instead focusing on the youth in an ageing population.LESSONS FROM HISTORYLearning from history, one has to readily adapt to its needs to survive and perhaps even thrive in an industrial revolution. In The Enlightened Economy, Joel Mokyr from Northwestern University argued that the First Industrial Revolution was aided by the “high quality of workmanship available to support innovation”.Innovation at that time was primarily mechanisation, which, as economic historian Karine van der Beek discovered, had led to increased demand in 18th Century England for wrights, workmen who “[erect and install] in place of use, machinery and other mechanical equipment"". British shipwrights made advances that improved sailing speeds by almost one-third in the late 1700s, compared to the Dutch who only improved by about 10 per cent. Singapore, as we know, could have been very different had the Dutch arrived first.The lesson we may learn from the First Industrial Revolution is this: Those with the skills to “support innovation” of our times, like the wright of the 18th Century, will thrive and maybe even change history, while those who don’t may find themselves left behind.This dictum may seem conceptually obvious, but are we ready to accept and proactively adapt to the major disruptions that could be coming our way? ABOUT THE AUTHORS:Nicholas Sim is senior lecturer at the School of Business, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Damien Huang is a research associate at the Institute of Policy Studies and Sabrina Heng is Adjunct Senior Research Fellow, University of Adelaide and Associate Lecturer, PSB Academy.
