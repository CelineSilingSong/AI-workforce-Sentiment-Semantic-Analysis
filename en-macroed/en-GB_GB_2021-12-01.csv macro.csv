In this tight, hot labor market, artificial intelligence is gaining attention as a compelling and effective way to improve the hiring process. Phenom, an Ambler, Pennsylvania-based company, effectively uses artificial intelligence to automate tasks and personalize job searches. 


Usually disruptive tech companies are found in Silicon Valley or major tech hubs. Phenom, based in a small town outside of Philadelphia, the startup has quietly become a billion-dollar unicorn.  

Phenom CEO Mahe Bayireddi said that his company relies upon AI to match people with the right jobs. This is achieved by helping companies find on-target talent at their companies and promoting them internally. Bayireddi says that his AI enables recruiters to find the right fits faster and job seekers searching for a new opportunity to find appropriate roles without wasting a lot of time. His goal is to find jobs for over one billion people.

PROMOTED
Instead of having one platform, its software is embedded into an array of job sites with some of the best and largest companies in the world. The career-tech company has 300 million users and one million jobs posted in 130 countries. With millions of pieces of data, Phenom is able to predict and guide job seekers to the roles that fit their background. 

Bayireddi spoke about the current job market, stating that the Great Resignation is a movement that shows the shifting demands and expectations of workers. Employees  are in pursuit of greater job flexibility and the desire to feel valued and appreciated.

These factors are as important—or even more important—than compensation. The employee experience should be top of mind for employers, if organizations want to keep and retain top talent. If they lag behind, they’ll see a lot of attrition and have trouble attracting new talent.

Here are some of the highlights
Hot Markets for Candidates Since June 2021 


Interest in retail jobs have increased 44.8%, and open retail jobs have also increased 67.2%.
Interest in IT jobs has increased 13.02%, and open IT jobs have also increased 11. 2%.
Interest in manufacturing jobs has increased 8.8%, while open manufacturing jobs have increased 12.35%.


Markets of Declining Candidate Interest Since June 2021 


Interest in HR jobs has decreased 27.5%, but open HR jobs have increased 60.9%.
Interest in hospitality jobs has decreased 10.3%, while open hospitality jobs have increased 15.4%.
Interest in healthcare jobs has decreased 2.2%, but open healthcare jobs have increased 19.2%.


Almost all sectors hired aggressively since June 2021, but the number of open healthcare (60.9%) and retail (67.2%) have soared. The plethora of job listings is due to a combination of being difficult jobs, with an inordinate amount of stress and pressure, and needing to endure difficult patients and customers respectively. 
Healthcare professionals had to risk their lives on a daily basis. For many, the pay wasn’t worth the health risks. We don’t talk about this enough—healthcare workers have been under unrelenting mental fatigue for having to tend to sick and dying patients at a rate we haven’t seen in modern history. It makes sense that there are many job openings with few takers.
Employees at retail stores, shops, department stores and in other customer facing businesses bore the brunt of an angry public. With fewer staff members, they were forced to work longer hours for low pay. In the Great Resignation movement, many retail workers decided to quit and pursue other opportunities that offer better pay and a chance for advancement.
On the positive side, these folks can use Phenom’s AI-driven job sites to see how their experiences, backgrounds and talent could be utilized in a different industry, job or career.

10 examples of AI in customer service


AI and AI-enhanced tools drive efficiency and cost reduction throughout the customer service team.

As the demand for an improved and personalized customer experience grows, organizations are turning to AI to help bridge the gap.
Advancements in AI continue to pave the way for increased efficiency across the organization -- particularly in customer service. Chatbots continue to be at the forefront of this change, but other technologies such as machine learning and interactive voice response systems create a new paradigm for what customers -- and customer service agents -- can expect. Not every piece of technology is right for every organization, but AI will be central to the future of customer service.







Here are 10 examples of the future of AI in customer service.

1. Chatbots
One of the most common uses of AI in customer service is chatbots. Businesses already use chatbots of varying complexity to handle routine questions such as delivery dates, balance owed, order status or anything else derived from internal systems. By transitioning these frequently asked questions to a chatbot, the customer service team can help more people and create a better experience overall -- while cutting operational costs for the company.


2. Agent assist
In many modern omnichannel contact centers, agent assist technology uses AI to automatically interpret what the customer is asking, search knowledge articles and display them on the customer service agent's screen while they're on the call. The process can save time for the agent and the customer, and it can decrease average handle time, which also reduces cost.


3. Self-service
Customer self-service refers to customers being able to identify and find the support they need without relying on a customer service agent. Most customers, when given the option, would prefer to solve issues on their own if given the proper tools and information. As AI becomes more advanced, self-service functions will become increasingly pervasive and allow customers the opportunity to solve concerns on their schedules.

4. Robotic process automation
Robotic process automation (RPA) can automate many simple tasks that an agent used to perform. Automating bots to focus on updating records, managing incidents or providing proactive outreach to customers, for example, can drastically reduce costs and improve efficiency and processing time. One of the best ways to determine where RPA can assist in customer service is by asking the customer service agents. They can likely identify the processes that take the longest or have the most clicks between systems. Or they may suggest simple, repetitive transactions that don't require a human. When prioritized and deployed correctly, this type of business process improvement can save customer service companies millions of dollars each year.


5. Machine learning
At its core, machine learning is key to processing and analyzing large data streams and determining what actionable insights there are. In customer service, machine learning can support agents with predictive analytics to identify common questions and responses. The technology can even catch things an agent may have missed in the communication. Additionally, machine learning can be used to help chatbots and other AI tools adapt to a given situation based on prior results and ultimately help customers solve problems through self-service.



AI can use natural language processing to analyze customer feedback and provide insights for an organization.







6. Natural language processing
Many customer service teams use natural language processing today in their customer experience or voice of the customer programs. By having the system transcribe interactions across phone, email, chat and SMS channels and then analyze the data for certain trends and themes, an agent can meet the customer's needs more quickly. Previously, analyzing customer interactions was a lengthy process that often involved multiple teams and resources. Now, natural language processing eliminates these redundancies to create deeper and more efficient customer satisfaction.


7. IVR automation
While Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems have been automating simple routing and transactions for decades, new, conversational IVR systems use AI to handle tasks. Everything from verifying users with voice biometrics to directly telling the IVR system what needs to happen with the help of natural language processing is simplifying the customer experience. Some companies turn to visual IVR systems via mobile applications to streamline organized menus and routine transactions. Blending many of these AI types together creates a harmony of intelligent automation.



In customer service, machine learning can support agents with predictive analytics to identify common questions and responses and even catch things an agent may have missed in the communication.






8. Sentiment and advanced analytics
Using sentiment analysis to analyze and identify how a customer feels is becoming commonplace in today's customer service teams. Some tools can even recognize when a customer is upset and notify a team leader or representative to interject and de-escalate the situation. In conjunction with a voice of the customer tool, sentiment analysis can create a more honest and full picture of customer satisfaction. Vendors such as Brandwatch, Hootsuite, Lexalytics, NetBase, Sprout Social, Sysomos and Zoho offer sentiment analysis platforms that proactively review customer feedback.


9. AI training
As the COVID-19 pandemic forced employees into remote positions, many training teams began using AI to construct simulations to test employee aptitude for handling various situations. Previously, the training involved a blend of classroom training, self-paced learning and a final assessment -- a routine that's much harder to implement in remote or hybrid offices. With AI taking the role of the customer, new agents can test out dozens of possible scenarios and practice their responses with natural counterparts to ensure that they're ready to support any issue a user or customer may have.


10. Smart speakers
The practical applications for organizations and customer service teams are still a work in progress, but smart assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri are an exciting avenue for personalized service. Customers appreciate and prefer when an organization communicates via their preferred platform, and for some people, that may be via their smart home device. Imagine a future where a user can bypass a phone call or email and troubleshoot any product or service concern via a simple question to their smart speaker. Simplified communications like this could be the difference between a satisfied or frustrated customer.
With several use cases for AI in customer service and many more to come, customer service teams must think more critically, handle higher-tiered issues and take advantage of all available tools to create an unforgettable customer experience.

Vincent C. Müller, currently professor of philosophy and ethics of technology at the Technical University of Eindhoven, was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship to support his work on the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

The award includes a grant of €3.5 million (approximately $3.96 million), plus matching funds of €1.5 million from the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) university, where he will be taking up a permanent chair in “Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence.”

The award is from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and is one of the largest of its kind in the world. In its announcement, the foundation says:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually entering all areas of our everyday lives. The more AI we use, the more we realise that certain standards and frameworks are needed to ensure that AI is developed and employed in a value-based, responsible and human-centred fashion. Otherwise, exclusion and discrimination could result.
The exploration and application of responsible AI is still a very young discipline and Vincent C. Müller can rightfully be described as one of its pioneers. Even before the topic had triggered broad public debate, he was working on the philosophy and ethics of AI, whereby he also enjoys a very high reputation amongst computer scientists: He is one of the few people outside of informatics to be appointed a fellow of the Alan Turing Institute in London. He also channels his expertise into political consultancy, for example as an expert in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, a global initiative involving Germany that was launched in 2020 to promote the responsible development and use of AI.
As a Humboldt Professor at FAU, Vincent C. Müller is called upon to build bridges both between technological and humanities expertise as well as beyond the confines of the university to industry and public administration. He is invited to build up a new, international, interdisciplinary Centre for Philosophy and AI Research (PAIR) which will become a hub for AI philosophy at FAU. Cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits is also foreseen in order to support the development of trustworthy AI systems.
Ten Humboldt professorships were awarded this year, across a range of disciplines. You can learn more about the other recipients here.

Congratulations to Professor Muller for the award, and it is important to study responsible AI. I challenge all ethicists of AI to figure out what we are going to do about these – alleged ‘self replicating robots’ that were discovered today and reported by NPR. I am not claiming to be an expert in AI ethics, but I think we can all agree that robots that can self-replicate are a problem to say the least. Stopping them from self-replicating seems to me (a layperson on this topic) to be a topic of both theoretical and practical urgency. https://www.npr.org/2021/12/01/1060027395/robots-xenobots-living-self-replicating-copy?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&fbclid=IwAR0rK-0QOx_-VqQXdpIepIBTYsQ2mGcyt1mVpJ_WqZusdGpEec-7jheWJq8

Dear Sebastian, you are right that the self-replicating robots recently reported are (obviously!) very problematic. However, I don’t think they pose a very obvious theoretical challenge. There are at least two strategies that would OBVIOUSLY contain them. First, anyone who creates a self-replicating robot should be punished in some way, and punished *to a degree* proportionate to the extent of the replication. So, for example, if a scientist creates a self replicating robot that replicates 100 times, then that deserves a stronger punishment than we’d give to a scientist to creates a robot that replicates five times. I think that’s just common sense. Secondly, suppose the self-replication has gotten ‘out of control’ in a lab. There is a way to contain it, using the technique that was used to great effect following Chernobyl — that is to pour concrete on top of the building where this is occurring, effectively ‘sealing in’ the replication process (much like by way of analogy the concrete ‘sealed in’ the toxins from Chernobyl). Both of these strategies would be very effective, and I think they are more or less common sense. Thus, I reject the thought that heavy duty theoretical work is needed to solve this rather straightforward situation.

“Xenobots” are not robots. They do not think. They do not work. They do not replicate themselves. They are biological dustpans, designed as such by scientists, who apparently want to make these extreme claims for themselves, of having created life AND living robots. 
Examples of what neither man nor AI created:
–Tissue cells want to be tissues, so when they pile up in the solution, they stick together to form tissue. Scientists got them to stick together in their dustpan, C-shape.
–Living cells move somewhat, so a lump of stuck-together cells in a solution will move around. When they do, some single cells in the solution get inside the C-shape and start to pile up and stick together. This, they call “replicating themselves”. But if the free cells in the solution were bird cells, the lumps which collected would be lumps of the cells of birds, not frog cells. They even claim that it’s even cooler that the cells of their so-called self replication don’t even come from them! 
That is why they have not replicated themselves. They have not even gathered the cells. The cells randomly piled up in the C-shape, then stuck together, because the tissue cells want to heal and be part of a tissue again. The most they did was use the raw materials of the frog cells to form a c shape which was more efficient at allowing cells to stay inside, collecting them. But that was human ingenuity, not AI.

Regrettably what academic philosophers might come up with in terms of parameters for AI in terms of humanistic ethics will be inevitably trumped by the technomilitary establishment and the inherent greed of the financial institutions that run the decadent Western world, including its already dehumanized research university culture.

Not only regrettable but unavoidable in state of affairs after Darwin Marks and the academical establishment of the West after Holmsky. Anarchy and Holmsky are two products of the same kind selfreplicating without any control. It is too late and useless to sponsor a Messiah from the same kind of products.

It is good to first clarify the problem of consciousness from the philosophical side. But only if the approach is good. On my page you can find keywords for such an approach as well as a model that could be implemented in AI.

But the software seems prone to racial, cultural and gender biasBy John McQuaid Juan Mabromara AFP and Getty ImagesDecember 2021 IssueSociologyIn Liverpool, England, at a February 2020 conference on the rather unglamorous topic of government purchasing, attendees circulated through exhibitor and vendor displays, lingering at some, bypassing others. They were being closely watched. Around the floor, 24 discreetly positioned cameras tracked each person’s movements and cataloged subtle contractions in individuals’ facial muscles at five to 10 frames per second as they reacted to different displays. The images were fed to a computer network, where artificial-intelligence algorithms assessed each person’s gender and age group and analyzed their expressions for signs of “happiness” and “engagement.”About a year after the Liverpool event, Panos Moutafis, CEO of Austin, Tex.–based Zenus, the company behind the technology, was still excited about the results. “I haven’t seen lots of commercial systems getting this level of accuracy,” he said to me during a video call, showing me a photograph of the crowd, the faces outlined with boxes. Zenus engineers had trained the system to recognize emotions by having it examine a huge data set of facial expressions with labels describing relevant feelings. The company validated the program’s performance in various ways, including live tests when people reported how they felt when an image was taken. The system, Moutafis said, “works indoors, it works with masks, with no lighting, it works outdoors when people wear hats and sunglasses.”The Zenus setup is one example of a new technology—called emotion AI or affective computing—that combines cameras and other devices with artificial-intelligence programs to capture facial expressions, body language, vocal intonation, and other cues. The goal is to go beyond facial recognition and identification to reveal something previously invisible to technology: the inner feelings, motivations and attitudes of the people in the images. “Cameras have been dumb,” says A.C.L.U. senior policy analyst Jay Stanley, author of the 2019 report The Dawn of Robot Surveillance. “Now they’re getting smart. They are waking up. They are gaining the ability not just to dumbly record what we do but to make judgments about it.”Emotion AI has become a popular market research tool—at another trade show, Zenus told Hilton Hotels that a puppies-and-ice-cream event the company staged was more engaging than the event’s open bar—but its reach extends into areas where the stakes are much higher. Systems that read cues of feeling, character and intent are being used or tested to detect threats at border checkpoints, evaluate job candidates, monitor classrooms for boredom or disruption, and recognize signs of aggressive driving. Major automakers are putting the technology into coming generations of vehicles, and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other tech companies offer cloud-based emotion-AI services, often bundled with facial recognition. Dozens of start-ups are rolling out applications to help companies make hiring decisions. The practice has become so common in South Korea, for instance, that job coaches often make their clients practice going through AI interviews.AI systems use various kinds of data to generate insights into emotion and behavior. In addition to facial expressions, vocal intonation, body language and gait, they can analyze the content of spoken or written speech for affect and attitude. Some applications use the data they collect to probe not for emotions but for related insights, such as what kind of personality a person has and whether he or she is paying attention or poses a potential threat.But critics warn that emotion AI’s reach exceeds its grasp in potentially hazardous ways. AI algorithms can be trained on data sets with embedded racial, ethnic and gender biases, which in turn can prejudice their evaluations—against, for example, nonwhite job applicants. “There’s this idea that we can off-load some of our cognitive processes on these systems,” says Lauren Rhue, an information systems scientist at the University of Maryland, who has studied racial bias in emotion AI. “That we can say, ‘Oh, this person has a demeanor that’s threatening’ based on them. That’s where we’re getting into a dangerous area.”Recommended StoriesChatGPT Isn’t ‘Hallucinating’—It’s Bullshitting!Joe Slater, James Humphries & Michael Townsen HicksWe’re Not Asking the Right Question to Solve the Overdose CrisisZachary SiegelHere’s Why Protest News Doesn’t Tell You MuchDouglas M. McLeodTrump’s Personality Cult Plays a Part in His Political AppealBen Goldsmith & Lars J. K. MoenThe underlying science is also in dispute. Many emotion-AI apps trace their origins to research conducted half a century ago by psychologists Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen, who theorized that a handful of facial expressions correspond to basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise; Ekman later added contempt to the list) and that these expressions form a universally understood emotional language. But these ideas are now hotly debated. Scientists have found evidence of significant cultural and individual variations in facial expressions. Many researchers say algorithms cannot—yet, anyway—consistently read the subtleties of human expressions in different individuals, which may not match up with stereotypical internal feelings. Ekman himself, who worked to develop early forms of emotion-recognition technology, now argues it poses a serious threat to privacy and should be heavily regulated.Emotion AI is not intrinsically bad. If machines can be trained to reliably interpret emotions and behavior, the potential for robotics, health care, automobiles, and other fields is enormous, experts say. But right now the field is practically a free-for-all, and a largely unproven technology could become ubiquitous before societies have time to consider the potential costs.In 2018 Mark Gray, then vice president for people and business operations at Airtame, which makes a device for screen-sharing presentations and displays, was looking for ways to improve the company’s hiring process. Efficiency was part of it. Airtame is small, with about 100 employees spread among offices in Copenhagen, New York City, Los Angeles and Budapest, but the company can receive hundreds of applications for its jobs in marketing or design. Another factor was the capricious nature of hiring decisions. “A lot of times I feel it’s coming from a fake voice in the back of someone’s head that ‘oh, I like this person personally,’ not ‘this person would be more competent,’” says Gray, who is now at Proper, a Danish property management tech company. “In the world of recruitment and HR, which is filled with the intangible, I kind of wanted to figure out how can I add a tangible aspect to hiring.”

Airtame contracted with Retorio, a Munich-based company that uses AI in video interviews. The process is quick: job candidates record 60-second answers to just two or three questions. An algorithm then analyzes the facial expressions and voice of the interviewees and the text of their responses. It then generates a profile based on five basic personality traits, a common model in psychology shorthanded as OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Recruiters receive a ranked list of candidates based on how well each profile fits the job.Such software is starting to change how business decisions are made and how organizations interact with people. It has reshaped the hiring process at Airtame, instantly elevating some candidates over others. Gray says that is because the profiling works. He shared a chart showing that the job performance of several recent hires in sales tracked their personality scores, with employees who had scored higher in conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness doing the best.Machines that can understand emotions have long been the subject of science fiction. But in computer science and engineering, human affect remained an alien concept for a long time. As recently as the 1990s, “it was a taboo topic, something undesirable,” says Rosalind Picard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who coined the term “affective computing” in a 1995 technical report. “People thought I was crazy, nuts, stupid, embarrassing. One respected signal- and speech-processing person came up to me, looked at my feet the whole time, and said, ‘You’re wasting your time—emotion is just noise.’”Picard and other researchers began developing tools that could automatically read and respond to biometric information, from facial expressions to blood flow, that indicated emotional states. But the current proliferation of applications dates to the widening deployment starting in the early 2010s of deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning that employs neural networks, which are roughly modeled on biological brains. Deep learning improved the power and accuracy of AI algorithms to automate a few tasks that previously only people could do reliably: driving, facial recognition, and analyzing certain medical scans.Yet such systems are still far from perfect, and emotion AI tackles a particularly formidable task. Algorithms are supposed to reflect a “ground truth” about the world: they should identify an apple as an apple, not as a peach. The “learning” in machine learning consists of repeatedly comparing raw data—often from images but also from video, audio, and other sources—to training data labeled with the desired feature. This is how the system learns to extract the underlying commonalities, such as the “appleness” from images of apples. Once the training is finished, an algorithm can identify apples in any image.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newsletters

But when the task is identifying hard-to-define qualities such as personality or emotion, ground truth becomes more elusive. What does “happiness” or “neuroticism” look like? Emotion-AI algorithms cannot directly intuit emotions, personality or intentions. Instead they are trained, through a kind of computational crowdsourcing, to mimic the judgments humans make about other humans. Critics say that process introduces too many subjective variables. “There is a profound slippage between what these things show us and what might be going on in somebody’s mind or emotional space,” says Kate Crawford of the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, who studies the social consequences of artificial intelligence. “That is the profound and dangerous leap that some of these technologies are making.”The process that generates those judgments is complicated, and each stage has potential pitfalls. Deep learning, for example, is notoriously data-hungry. For emotion AI, it requires huge data sets that combine thousands or sometimes billions of human judgments—images of people labeled as “happy” or “smiling” by data workers, for instance. But algorithms can inadvertently “learn” the collective, systematic biases of the people who assembled the data. That bias may come from skewed demographics in training sets, unconscious attitudes of the labelers, or other sources.Even identifying a smile is far from a straightforward task. A 2020 study by Carsten Schwemmer of the GESIS–Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Cologne, Germany, and his colleagues ran pictures of members of Congress through cloud-based emotion-recognition apps by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The scientists’ own review found 86 percent of men and 91 percent of women were smiling—but the apps were much more likely to find women smiling. Google Cloud Vision, for instance, applied the “smile” label to more than 90 percent of the women but to less than 25 percent of the men. The authors suggested gender bias might be present in the training data. They also wrote that in their own review of the images, ambiguity—ignored by the machines—was common: “Many facial expressions seemed borderline. Was that really a smile? Do smirks count? What if teeth are showing, but they do not seem happy?”Facial-recognition systems, most also based on deep learning, have been widely criticized for bias. Researchers at the M.I.T. Media Lab, for instance, found these systems were less accurate when matching the identities of nonwhite, nonmale faces. Typically these errors arise from using training data sets that skew white and male. Identifying emotional expressions adds additional layers of complexity: these expressions are dynamic, and faces in posed photos can have subtle differences from those in spontaneous snapshots.Rhue, the University of Maryland researcher, used a public data set of pictures of professional basketball players to test two emotion-recognition services, one from Microsoft and one from Face++, a facial-recognition company based in China. Both consistently ascribed more negative emotions to Black players than to white players, although each did it differently: Face++ saw Black players as angry twice as often as white players; Microsoft viewed Black players as showing contempt three times as often as white players when the expression was ambiguous. The problem can likely be traced back to bias in the labeled images in training data sets, she says. Microsoft and Face++ did not respond to requests for comment.Many companies now emphasize that they are aware of and addressing such issues. Retorio’s algorithm was trained on a data set, compiled over a period of years using paid volunteers, of short interview videos labeled with personality traits, co-founder Christoph Hohenberger says. The company has taken steps to filter out various demographic and cultural biases that would tend to favor one group over another in the personality assessments, he says. But because there is currently no regulation or oversight of the industry, in most cases we have to take a company’s word for it—the robustness and equity of proprietary data sets are hard to verify. HireVue, a company that does video interviews with algorithmic analysis of the text and vocal tone, brought on an outside auditor to check for bias, but that is rare.“This idea that there exists one standard for humans to be and that everyone can meet it equally” is fundamentally flawed, says Ifeoma Ajunwa, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who studies AI decision-making. The assumption, she says, means that “everyone who doesn’t meet that standard is disadvantaged.”In addition to concerns about bias, the idea that outside appearances match a decipherable inner emotion for everyone has also started to generate strong scientific opposition. That is a change from when the concept got its start more than 50 years ago. At that time Ekman and Friesen were conducting fieldwork with the Fore, an Indigenous group in the highlands of southeast Papua New Guinea, to see if they recognized and understood facial expressions the same way as people from radically different backgrounds did—a stevedore from Brooklyn, say, or a nurse in Senegal. Volunteers were shown sets of photos of people making expressions for what the scientists called the six basic emotions. To provide context, a translator provided brief descriptors (“He/she is looking at something which smells bad” for disgust, for instance). The Fore responses were virtually identical to those of people surveyed in countries such as Japan or Brazil or the U.S., so the researchers contended that facial expressions are a universally intelligible emotional language.The notion of a shared group of expressions that represented basic emotional states quickly became popular in psychology and other fields. Ekman and Friesen developed an atlas of thousands of facial movements to interpret these expressions, called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Both the atlas and the theory became cornerstones of emotion AI. The work has been incorporated into many AI applications, such those developed by the company Affectiva, which include in-car systems and market research.But scientists have argued that there are holes in Ekman’s theories. A 2012 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, for instance, presented data showing that facial expressions varied considerably by culture. And in 2019 Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University, along with several colleagues, published a study that examined more than 1,000 scientific papers on facial expressions. The notion that faces revealed outward signs of common emotions had spread to fields ranging from technology to law, they found—but there was little hard evidence that it was true.The basic emotions are broad stereotypical categories, Barrett says. Moment to moment, facial expressions reflect complicated internal states—a smile might cover up pain, or it might convey sympathy. And today, she contends, it is almost impossible for an AI system to consistently, reliably categorize those internal states if it has been trained on data sets that are essentially collections of labeled stereotypes. “It’s measuring something and then inferring what it means psychologically,” Barrett says. “But those are two separate things. I can’t say this about every company obviously, because I don’t know everything that everybody is doing. But the emotion-recognition technology that’s been advertised is routinely confounding these two things.”




Gender bias: In a study using politicians' faces, researchers found that an emotion-AI program determined that only a few men were smiling. The scientists' own review, however, indicated the vast majority of men had a smile. In contrast to men, the program, Google Cloud Vision, applied the “smile” label to many women. Percentages on labels of attributes in two images (below) indicate the confidence the AI had in the label accuracy. The woman got a smile label at 64 percent confidence—along with labels focused on her hair—whereas the man did not get that label at all.

One reason for this problem, Crawford says, is that the world of tech start-ups is not aware of scientific debates in other fields, and those start-ups are attracted to the elegant simplicity of systems such as FACS. “Why has the machine-learning field been drawn to Ekman?” Crawford asks. “It fits nicely with a machine-learning capacity. If you say there is a limited set of expressions and strictly limited numbers of potential emotions, then people will adopt that view primarily because the theory fits what the tools can do.” In addition to Ekman’s work and the personality-trait model of OCEAN, emotion-AI companies have adopted other systems. One is a “wheel of emotions” devised by the late psychologist Robert Plutchik, which is used by Adoreboard, a U.K.-based company that analyzes emotion in text. All these approaches offer to translate the complexity of human affect into straightforward formulas. They may suffer from similar flaws, too. One study found that OCEAN produces inconsistent results across different cultures.Nevertheless, researchers say emotion apps can work—if their limitations are understood. Roboticist Ayanna Howard, dean of the College of Engineering at the Ohio State University, uses a modified version of Microsoft’s facial-expression-recognition software in robots to teach social behavior to children with autism. If a robot detects an “angry” expression from its interlocutor, for example, its movements will adapt in ways that calm the situation. The stereotypical facial expressions may not always mean exactly the same thing, Howard says, but they are useful. “Yeah, we’re unique—but we’re not that different from the person next door,” she says. “And so when you’re talking about emotion in general, you can get it right maybe not all the time but more than random right.”In general, algorithms that scan and aggregate the reactions of many people—such as those Zenus uses to read crowds—will be more accurate, Barrett says, because “better than random” becomes statistically meaningful with a large group. But assessing individuals is more treacherous because anything short of 100 percent accuracy ends up discriminating against certain people.Many computer vision specialists are now embracing a more agnostic view of facial expressions. (And more companies have begun stating they do not directly map emotions or internal states.) “As the field has developed, there’s increasing understanding that many expressions have nothing to do with emotion,” says Jonathan Gratch, a computer science professor at the University of Southern California, who specializes in affective computing. “They’re kind of tools we use to influence each other, or they’re almost like words in a conversation, and so there’s meaning in those words. But it is not direct access to what I’m feeling in the moment.”Yet as attempts to map and monetize emotional expressions, personality traits and behaviors grow, they are expanding the parts of our lives that can fall under surveillance. After 20 years of tech companies mining personal data from online behavior, a new, more intimate domain—faces and bodies and the signals they send—is poised for similar treatment. “If you’re a Coca-Cola, and you’re driving a campaign, and your principal methodology for messaging is the Internet, you know everything about what audience you reached,” says Jay Hutton, CEO of Vancouver-based company VSBLTY, which markets smart cameras and software that scan crowds, analyzing demographics and reactions to products for retailers. “But what if we could take computer vision and turn bricks and mortar into that same level of analytics?”In December 2020 VSBLTY announced a partnership with Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo to create in-store networks of cameras to capture data in the beverage company’s 50,000 Modelorama convenience stores and neighborhood bodegas in Mexico and other Latin American countries by 2027. Demand will exist wherever there are screens and advertising, Hutton says. The technology “will be used in transit hubs, or in an airport, or a stadium,” he says. “Advertisers are paying millions of dollars to be a sponsor, and their ads appear on screens throughout the stadium, [and] they are looking for validation of that spin.”This trend raises a basic legal and social question: Do the data from your face and body belong to you? In most places around the world, the answer is no—as long as your personal identity is kept separate from that data. “If you would like to know, and somebody’s in public, there seems to be no limit in scanning them for their emotions,” says Jennifer Bard, a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, who has studied the issue.Most emotion-AI companies that capture data in public say the information is anonymized, and thus its collection should not provoke concern. VSBLTY does not store facial images or other data that can be linked to identities, Hutton says. Zenus’s Moutafis notes that his company’s app does not upload the actual facial images that its cameras capture—only the relevant metadata on mood and position—and that it puts up signs and notices on meeting screens that the monitoring is occurring. “Explicit consent is not needed,” he says. “We always tell people deploying it that is a very good practice; when you have a surveillance sensitivity, you have to put up a sign that these areas are being monitored.” Typically, Moutafis says, people do not mind and forget about the cameras. But the diversity of applications means there are no common standards. It is also far from clear whether people and politicians will embrace such routine surveillance once it becomes a political and policy issue.Ekman, who earlier worked with the company Emotient and with Apple on emotion AI, now warns it poses a threat to privacy and says companies should be legally obligated to obtain consent from each person they scan. “Unfortunately, it is a technology that can be used without people’s knowledge, and it’s being used on them, and it’s not being used on them to make them happier,” he says. “It’s being used on them to get them to buy products they might not otherwise buy. And that’s probably the most benign of the nonbenign uses of it.”Emotion AI has entered personal spaces, too, where the potential hoard of behavioral data is even richer. Amazon’s Alexa analyzes users’ vocal intonation for signs of frustration to improve its algorithms, according to a spokesperson. By 2023 some automakers will be debuting AI-enabled in-cabin systems that will generate huge amounts of data on driver and passenger behavior. Automakers will want those data, also likely anonymized, for purposes such as refining system responses and in-car design and for measuring aggregated behavior such as driver performance. (Tesla already collects data from multiple sources in its vehicles.) Customers would likely have the option of activating various levels of these systems, according to Modar Alaoui, CEO of emotion-AI company Eyeris, so if occupants do not use certain functions, data would not be collected on those. The in-cabin systems designed by Affectiva (recently acquired by Swedish firm Smart Eye) do not record video but would make metadata available, says chief marketing officer Gabi Zijderveld.Aleix Martinez, a computer vision scientist at Ohio State and Amazon and a co-author with Barrett of the 2019 paper criticizing the face-emotion connection, has a photo he is fond of showing people. It is of a man’s face that appears to be twisted in a mixture of anger and fear. Then he shows the full image: it is a soccer player exultant after scoring a goal. Facial expressions, gestures, and other signals are not only a product of the body and brain, he notes, but of context, of what is happening around a person. So far that has proved the biggest challenge for emotion AI: interpreting ambiguous context. “Unless I know what soccer is, I’m never going to be able to understand what happened there,” Martinez says. “So that knowledge is fundamental, and we don’t have any AI system right now that can do a good job at that at all.”The technology becomes more effective, Martinez says, if the task is narrow, the surroundings are simple, and the biometric information collected is diverse—voice, gestures, pulse, blood flow under the skin, and so on. Coming generations of emotion AI may combine exactly this kind of information. But that, in turn, will only create more powerful and intrusive technologies that societies may not be prepared for.Rights & PermissionsFrom our Archives

Depending on the people you talk to, architects approach artificial intelligence (AI) with a range of anticipation, skepticism, or dread. Some say algorithms will handle drudge work and free designers to focus on the more creative aspects of their jobs. Others assert that AI won’t live up to its hype—at least not in the near future—and will make only marginal improvements in the profession. And a third group worries that software that learns on its own will put a lot of architects out of work.

Science fiction writers have been imagining robots that think like human beings for more than 100 years. But the field of artificial intelligence really began in the middle of the last century with British mathematician Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” In 1956, at a conference hosted by Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, mathematician John McCarthy coined the term “artificial intelligence” and, with a group of participants, explored how to “make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves,” according to the event’s proposal.Imbuing computers with true intelligence, though, has proved to be more difficult than originally imagined. Sixty-five years after the Dartmouth conference, computers can process huge amounts of information, analyze it to find correlations and patterns, and then make predictions based on those patterns. What makes AI different from previous forms of computation is Machine Learning (ML), which employs algorithms that get better at performing certain tasks the more they do them; they learn without having to be programmed to do each step. The bigger the data set used to “train” an algorithm, the better it will perform. By 1997, IBM had developed a chess-playing program called Deep Blue that was able to beat Gary Kasparov, the world chess champion at the time. Today, Google Translate does a pretty good job of recognizing text in one language and communicating it in another. A program known as GPT-3 will take a few word prompts and write a paragraph of text that seems at first glance to have been written by a person. Algorithms allow autonomous vehicles to navigate city streets, radiologists to identify cancerous tumors, and online shopping services to recommend products to their customers.But computers still don’t think like people. They have no awareness of anything beyond their own predetermined capabilities and don’t have anything close to common sense. They know only what they have been shown and lack the ability to generalize from one task to another. A 2016 Obama Administration report on the future of AI identified the technology’s potential to “open up new markets and new opportunities for progress in critical areas such as health, education, and the environment,” but admitted that “it is very unlikely that machines will exhibit broadly applicable intelligence comparable to or exceeding that of humans in the next 20 years.”In the past decade or so, software for architects has evolved from CAD to scripted geometry engines like Rhino and parametric BIM platforms like Revit—moving from the representation of buildings (in plan, section, elevation) to more responsive systems that show the impact of one change on the rest of the project. Thanks to faster and cheaper computers and the enormous computing power and storage capacity of the cloud, AI systems are now able to encode information and relationships in increasingly complex layers. Because they’re able to process vast amounts of data accessible from internet-based sources, they can create statistical correlations that approximate learning, says Phillip Bernstein, author of a forthcoming book on AI and an associate dean at the Yale School of Architecture.Of course, most architects are nowhere close to doing any of that in their practices, instead using platforms like BIM to create drawings, rather than connecting them to data to create insight, notes Bernstein. Architects will be pushed to adopt AI tools, he says, mostly by clients who are already using large data sets, machine learning, and predictive simulation to manage their operations and facilities. Steve McConnell, managing partner at NBBJ, which has designed buildings for major tech companies like Amazon and Tencent, echoes this sentiment. By using data to drive their designs, architects can show the value of what they do to clients who run their own businesses with data-driven processes, points out McConnell.McConnell says AI will also enable architects to “move upstream” in the building-development process by giving them the analytical tools to serve as “strategic partners” to clients—helping them identify business opportunities, for example, even before project planning has begun. Architects, though, “need to reimagine their skills and what they bring to the table.”The promise of AI is not only that it will provide a business advantage, points out Bernstein. The technology has the potential to help architects address “profound problems,” such as reducing waste and embodied carbon in projects, making public spaces more equitable, and enhancing building performance, he says.A few design firms are developing their own proprietary AI tools to help them work on big projects. Gensler, for example, rolled out its Nform “ecosystem” of data-driven software—much of which employs algorithms and AI—in the summer of 2020. Developed by the firm’s design technology studio, the in-house package of software addresses design issues at different scales—from floor plan to master plan to sustainability strategy. By harnessing algorithms to large data sets, the new software gives designers rapid feedback on the impact of changes to interior-space plans or building configurations, so design decisions can be made much faster and earlier in the process. “We want to augment the power of our designers and make them more agile,” says Marc Syp, Gensler’s director of computation.Some firms have introduced their AI tools commercially. One such software application is cove.tool which optimizes designs based on multiple parameters, including daylighting, energy use, code compliance, and cost. Launched in 2017 by Atlanta-based architects Patrick Chopson and Sandeep Ahuja as an outgrowth of their sustainable-design consulting firm, Pattern R+D, cove.tool is now their primary focus. The cloud-based app uses machine learning to process data collected from many different sources—such as construction-cost-data company RSMeans, building-product manufacturers, public databases, and the app’s users themselves—to model energy use versus cost at every stage of design. It is intended as a holistic tool, obviating the need to employ an array of stand-alone software programs to analyze designs for daylighting, shadows, HVAC, and such, says Ahuja. The company plans to add electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis to the tool soon. “The idea is to give architects all of the data they need at every step along the design process,” says Ahuja.Although not a design firm, Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has developed a tool called Delve that integrates financial parameters, energy models, and site constraints to help architects and planners design complex urban projects. It depends on generative design and AI to analyze factors such as density, daylight, and walkability to propose a range of options and show the trade-offs inherent in each one. The software is mostly used during the planning, feasibility, and entitlement stages of a project to demonstrate how various schemes will meet city requirements and the client’s bottom line, says Violet Whitney, director of product management for Delve.Artificial intelligence offers the potential for creating environments that are more responsive to their users’ needs at all scales, including the urban scale. Cities have been collecting vast amounts of data, and companies like Google have been providing functions like Street View and Earth for years now. AI can harness all this information, analyze it, and use it to help make places work better. Such data are the raw material that urbanists like Kevin Lynch and William H. Whyte had to generate periodically and painstakingly to develop their ideas; now these data are continually updated and available in real time, says Carlo Ratti, who directs MIT’s Senseable City Lab and practices architecture. His firm, Carlo Ratti Associati, is using such data to map Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, to better understand the city’s public spaces for Manifesta 14, the European cultural biennale that will take place there in 2022. Ratti’s team is using algorithms to reveal hidden spatial and social patterns and identify key squares, streets, parks, and green areas that are either underused or misused. This past summer, Ratti applied this information to initiate a series of temporary urban interventions that offer new ways of using and reclaiming these spaces. The third phase of the project will track residents as they “vote with their feet” and show how the reconfigured spaces actually function. This feedback will then help identify which interventions—such as converting the area around an old brick factory into an “urban living room” and turning space for cars into places for people—are retained for the future development of the city. “AI can help us understand visual clues that might not be apparent using older tools,” says Ratti.

Ratti cautions that the recent explosion in data collection comes with very real concerns. “Ninety percent of all the data on the planet have been created in the last two years,” he says. Cities need to be transparent about how they collect, store, and use data. They also need to wrestle with privacy issues and prevent—or at least identify—biases that might be embedded in the information they use.Ratti sees AI’s being used to “turn buildings into living things,” pointing to facades in particular. With sensors that collect information on humidity, temperature, and air quality, envelopes can respond in real time to enhance comfort, reduce energy use, and maximize efficiency. “Building facades today are corsets,” he says, “but we can make them living skins.”One firm that has been exploring AI as a tool for devising adaptive facades is Foster + Partners. Working with Autodesk, Foster’s applied research-and-development group has been investigating self-deforming materials that can change their shape without any mechanical forces. Instead of employing motorized louvers or other such devices, these materials respond to environmental conditions in the same way an eye’s iris does to light. They do this by combining thermo-active materials with passive laminates (multilayered materials, usually plastic) and exploiting the difference in expansion and contraction rates to change the shape of the facade.Because there’s a nonlinear relationship between the laminates’ internal forces and their behavior, designing the material to work in a desired way is remarkably complex. So Foster used machine learning to build what is known as a “surrogate model” to study all of the interactions and how the various layers would react to changing conditions. Instead of repeatedly adjusting the arrangement of laminates to get the desired deformed state, the designers started with the preferred end state and let AI figure out how to get there.

To devise adaptive facades with self-deforming materials, Foster + Partners reversed the typical workflow, starting with the desired outcome and then allowing AI to figure out how to achieve it. Image courtesy Foster + Partners/Autodesk
In addition to such surrogate-modeling work, Foster is also exploring a more advanced form of machine learning that it calls “design-assistance” modeling, says Martha Tsigkari, a partner at Foster. The goal of this kind of modeling is to facilitate architectural processes that do not have definitive answers —those that require subjective approaches—and “work alongside the intuition of designers in the creative process.” The firm is trying to understand the potential of AI at different stages—from design to construction to building operation, says Tsigkari. Ideally, AI would create a continuous information loop, so feedback from the operation of a completed building would help architects with the design and construction of their next one.

AI, though, is not just for big firms and big projects. Suchi Reddy, whose 16-person New York–based practice, Reddymade, combines art and architecture, worked with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for two years to develop AI technologies for a kinetic light installation in the 90-foot-high central rotunda of the Smithsonian’s Arts and Industries Building in Washington, D.C. Called me + you, the installation was commissioned for Futures, an exhibition that opened in November in the Smithsonian’s original home, which had been closed since 2004 due to structural concerns. Visitors can speak into nine circular “listening stations” at the base of the piece and tell their “future visions.” An AI-driven system then translates the meaning and tone of the spoken words into a kinetic “mandala” of color and light in the piece’s central totem. Each person’s sentiment changes the pattern and color of the totem, creating a constantly changing collective vision of the future. A web app allows people from around the world to add their voices to the sculpture, providing readings of the global “temperature” of sentiments on the future at any given moment.Reddy says her work uses “emotional AI” that blends physics, neuroscience, and data technology. “I want to integrate feelings with technology to help us engage on a human level,” she says.Another architect using AI to explore the relationship between the built environment and psychology is Mona Ghandi, who runs Morphogenesis Lab, a cross-disciplinary program at Washington State University (WSU) that includes students in architecture, neuroscience, computer science, and materials science. With an interest in “compassionate spaces,” Ghandi and her Morphogenesis team created an AI-driven installation called Wisteria that responds to the emotions of people interacting with it. Exhibited at WSU’s Pullman campus from February to August 2020, Wisteria comprised a “forest” of cylindrical fabric “shrouds” suspended from the ceiling that changed shape and color depending on biometric data collected from the people moving underneath it. By weaving into the shrouds a shape-memory alloy programmed to respond to readings of visitors’ body temperature and pulse, the Morphogenesis team enabled the fabric cylinders to move and activate LEDs that change color. The work is “contingent on user involvement and engagement,” says Ghandi, and “illustrates the collective emotion” of the visitors at any particular moment.Ghandi sees Wisteria as a first step in developing spaces that can respond to the needs of people with neurological and emotional issues, such as autism and post-traumatic stress disorder, or to improve the cognitive performance of children in school.While AI is still in its infancy, architects are taking it in a wide range of directions—some of which may prove to be dead ends and others more successful. What’s clear, though, is that architects must get out in front of the technology or get run over by it.

The technical landscape is being transformed by artificial intelligence and robotics. Things that were once only a pipe dream are now a reality. From automated systems in the manufacturing sector to self-serving robots at a restaurant, technology has advanced, bringing humans closer together. In today’s world, AI and robots are utilized as problem solvers, companions, and first responders.
Our civilization is undergoing several technological advancements. In a few decades, it will be significantly different from what it is today. The rapid growth of the artificial intelligence and robotics industry is one important factor that affects and changes several aspects of daily life.
Artificial intelligence and robots are used in a wide range of industries
We’re not talking about a certain industry when we talk about AI and robotics. Their adaptability has made them popular in almost every business and sector imaginable. There is something for everyone in the gaming, military, healthcare, automotive, fitness, education, retail, manufacturing, and other areas.
As a result, the great bulk of our transactions will very certainly be handled by machines and computers. This is only the beginning. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics are all projected to make significant progress in the next years before becoming commonplace.

The impact can be found anywhere
Modern AI which performs objective functions using data-trained models and is commonly classified as deep learning or machine learning — has already had a significant influence on virtually every major industry.
Apart from this, the impact of robots and artificial intelligence can be seen in our lives from a variety of angles.
1. At Workspace
Robots are capable of working at any hour of the day or night. They don’t need vacations, breaks, or health insurance. They don’t have conflicts with their bosses or coworkers, and they don’t take time off to deal with their problems.
Employers would welcome a workforce consisting entirely of intelligent robots, while employees are concerned about how a robotics-based workforce might affect employment.
2. On Industries
It’s tough to imagine a manufacturing company today without automated lines, robotic arms, and advanced technology. In the industrial world, robots have become the new normal, and they are making significant progress in improving a variety of manufacturing processes.
3. In Healthcare
The use of robotics in artificial intelligence (AI) is an example of modern technology that is helping to promote digital health and improve medical care.
Robotic equipment has rendered surgeons’ assistants obsolete. They allow for less invasive surgery and more accuracy, which reduces patient recovery time.

4. In Private lives
Our helpers are evolving into robots and sophisticated software.
This trend impacts not just businesses, but also everyday personal obligations.
People are now embracing a range of domestic appliances, such as robot vacuum cleaners and intelligent coffee makers, to assist them with their tasks. Siri and Alexa are personal assistants that let you discover information, place orders, and operate smart home devices. The creation of such assistance will definitely continue as client demand develops.
Conclusion
Robotics and artificial intelligence is having an impact on the future of practically every industry and individual in the world. Artificial intelligence has spurred the growth of technologies such as big data, robots, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
Some sectors are only getting started using AI, while others have been utilizing it for a long time. Both have a significant amount of work ahead of them. Regardless, artificial intelligence’s impact on our daily lives is tough to ignore.

Thursday, she launched a new research institute to ask questions about responsible use of artificial intelligence that Gebru says Google and other tech companies won’t.“Instead of fighting from the inside, I want to show a model for an independent institution with a different set of incentive structures,” says Gebru, who is founder and executive director of Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research (DAIR). The first part of the name is a reference to her aim to be more inclusive than most AI labs—which skew white, Western, and male—and to recruit people from parts of the world rarely represented in the tech industry.Gebru was ejected from Google after clashing with bosses over a research paper urging caution with new text-processing technology enthusiastically adopted by Google and other tech companies. Google has said she resigned and was not fired, but acknowledged that it later fired Margaret Mitchell, another researcher who with Gebru co-led a team researching ethical AI. The company placed new checks on the topics its researchers can explore. Google spokesperson Jason Freidenfelds declined to comment but directed WIRED to a recent report on the company's work on AI governance, which said Google has published more than 500 papers on ""responsible innovation"" since 2018.Trending NowRE:WIRED 2021: Speaking Truth to Biased AlgorithmsThe fallout at Google highlighted the inherent conflicts in tech companies sponsoring or employing researchers to study the implications of technology they seek to profit from. Earlier this year, organizers of a leading conference on technology and society canceled Google’s sponsorship of the event. Gebru says DAIR will be freer to question the potential downsides of AI and will be unencumbered by the academic politics and pressure to publish that she says can complicate university research.“Instead of fighting from the inside, I want to show a model for an independent institution with a different set of incentive structures.”Timnit GebruDAIR will also work on demonstrating uses for AI unlikely to be developed elsewhere, Gebru says, aiming to inspire others to take the technology in new directions. One such project is creating a public data set of aerial imagery of South Africa to examine how the legacy of apartheid is still etched into land use. A preliminary analysis of the images found that in a densely populated region once restricted to non-white people where many poor people still live, most vacant land developed between 2011 and 2017 was converted into wealthy residential neighborhoods.A paper on that project will mark DAIR’s formal debut in academic AI research later this month at NeurIPS, the world’s most prominent AI conference. DAIR’s first research fellow, Raesetje Sefala, who is based in South Africa, is lead author of the paper, which includes outside researchers.Safiya Noble, a professor at UCLA who researches how tech platforms shape society, serves on DAIR’s advisory board. She says Gebru’s project is an example of the kind of new and more inclusive institutions needed to make progress on understanding and responding to technology’s effects on society.“Black women have been major contributors to helping us understand the harms of big tech and different kinds of technologies that are harmful to society, but we know the limits in corporate America and academia that Black women face,” says Noble. “Timnit recognized harms at Google and tried to intervene but was massively unsupported—at a company that desperately needs that kind of insight.”Keep ReadingSearch our artificial intelligence database and discover stories by sector, tech, company, and more.Noble recently launched a nonprofit of her own, Equity Engine, to support the ambitions of Black women. She is joined on DAIR’s advisory board by Ciira wa Maina, a lecturer at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya.DAIR is currently a project of nonprofit Code for Science and Society but will later incorporate as a nonprofit in its own right, Gebru says. Her project has received grants totaling more than $3 million from the Ford, MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Open Society foundations, as well as the Kapor Center. Over time, she hopes to diversify DAIR’s financial support by taking on consulting work related to its research.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDDAIR joins a recent flourishing of work and organizations taking a broader and critical view of AI technology. New nonprofits and university centers have sprung up to study and critique AI’s effects in and on the world, such as NYU’s AI Now Institute, the Algorithmic Justice League, and Data for Black Lives. Some researchers in AI labs also study the impacts and proper use of algorithms, and scholars from other fields such as law and sociology have turned their own critical eyes on AI.The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy this year hired two prominent academics who work on algorithmic fairness research and is working on a “bill of rights” to guard against AI harms. The Federal Trade Commission last month hired three people from AI Now to serve as advisers on AI technology.Despite those shifts, Baobao Zhang, an assistant professor at Syracuse University, says the US public still seems to broadly trust tech companies to guide development of AI.Zhang recently surveyed AI researchers and the US public on who they trusted to shape development of the technology in the public interest. The results were starkly different: The public were most trusting of university researchers and the US military. Tech companies as a group came slightly behind, ranking similarly to international or nonprofit research institutions such as CERN, but ahead of the US government. AI researchers reported less trust than the general public in the US military and some tech companies, notably Facebook and Amazon, but more in the UN and non-governmental scientific organizations.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Google spokesperson Jason Freidenfelds declined to comment but directed WIRED to a recent report on the company's work on AI governance, which said Google has published more than 500 papers on ""responsible innovation"" since 2018.
The fallout at Google highlighted the inherent conflicts in tech companies sponsoring or employing researchers to study the implications of technology they seek to profit from. Earlier this year, organizers of a leading conference on technology and society canceled Google’s sponsorship of the event. Gebru says DAIR will be freer to question the potential downsides of AI and will be unencumbered by the academic politics and pressure to publish that she says can complicate university research.
DAIR will also work on demonstrating uses for AI unlikely to be developed elsewhere, Gebru says, aiming to inspire others to take the technology in new directions. One such project is creating a public data set of aerial imagery of South Africa to examine how the legacy of apartheid is still etched into land use. A preliminary analysis of the images found that in a densely populated region once restricted to non-white people where many poor people still live, most vacant land developed between 2011 and 2017 was converted into wealthy residential neighborhoods.
A paper on that project will mark DAIR’s formal debut in academic AI research later this month at NeurIPS, the world’s most prominent AI conference. DAIR’s first research fellow, Raesetje Sefala, who is based in South Africa, is lead author of the paper, which includes outside researchers.
Safiya Noble, a professor at UCLA who researches how tech platforms shape society, serves on DAIR’s advisory board. She says Gebru’s project is an example of the kind of new and more inclusive institutions needed to make progress on understanding and responding to technology’s effects on society.
“Black women have been major contributors to helping us understand the harms of big tech and different kinds of technologies that are harmful to society, but we know the limits in corporate America and academia that Black women face,” says Noble. “Timnit recognized harms at Google and tried to intervene but was massively unsupported—at a company that desperately needs that kind of insight.”
Noble recently launched a nonprofit of her own, Equity Engine, to support the ambitions of Black women. She is joined on DAIR’s advisory board by Ciira wa Maina, a lecturer at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya.
DAIR is currently a project of nonprofit Code for Science and Society but will later incorporate as a nonprofit in its own right, Gebru says. Her project has received grants totaling more than $3 million from the Ford, MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Open Society foundations, as well as the Kapor Center. Over time, she hopes to diversify DAIR’s financial support by taking on consulting work related to its research.
DAIR joins a recent flourishing of work and organizations taking a broader and critical view of AI technology. New nonprofits and university centers have sprung up to study and critique AI’s effects in and on the world, such as NYU’s AI Now Institute, the Algorithmic Justice League, and Data for Black Lives. Some researchers in AI labs also study the impacts and proper use of algorithms, and scholars from other fields such as law and sociology have turned their own critical eyes on AI.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy this year hired two prominent academics who work on algorithmic fairness research and is working on a “bill of rights” to guard against AI harms. The Federal Trade Commission last month hired three people from AI Now to serve as advisers on AI technology.
Despite those shifts, Baobao Zhang, an assistant professor at Syracuse University, says the US public still seems to broadly trust tech companies to guide development of AI.
Zhang recently surveyed AI researchers and the US public on who they trusted to shape development of the technology in the public interest. The results were starkly different: The public were most trusting of university researchers and the US military. Tech companies as a group came slightly behind, ranking similarly to international or nonprofit research institutions such as CERN, but ahead of the US government. AI researchers reported less trust than the general public in the US military and some tech companies, notably Facebook and Amazon, but more in the UN and non-governmental scientific organizations.

Page ContentThe EU's regions and cities have underlined their essential role in boosting investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and fostering trust in AI solutions. The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) has adopted an opinion calling for more transparency and stricter information requirements, especially what comes to high-risk AI systems. It also points out the major human rights risks and implications associated with the use of social classification, which should only be allowed only for specific purposes and always with human oversight to avoid any violations to the right to dignity and non-discrimination and to the values of equality and justice.The Committee strongly believes that the EU Regulation in the field of Artificial Intelligence should allow regions and cities to participate in the monitoring of AI systems and report on their implementation. The opinion drafted by Guido Rink (NL/PES), Member of the Executive Council of Emmen, regrets the absence of reference to local and regional authorities in the draft regulation, despite their key role in creating a favourable environment to AI investment and in exploiting the potential of AI systems to provide better services to the citizens. Mr Rink's opinion was adopted at the CoR plenary session on 2 December.""The vertiginous developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence have a direct impact on all citizens and levels of government. The Artificial Intelligence Act is therefore in principle a useful tool to avoid fragmentation in AI implementation rules across the EU. However, while Member States should not obstruct the application of the Regulation, proper consultation of the local and regional authorities concerned when it comes to the use of high-risk AI systems is imperative. What is more, we need much stronger safeguards in relation to AI-driven social scoring by public authorities, which risks leading to discrimination and social exclusion, while retaining the possibility to use AI with human oversight for better service provision"", rapporteur Guido Rink said.The CoR opinion calls on the Commission to consider in greater depth the high-risk classification of AI systems intended for use by public authorities, including AI systems used in democratic processes such as elections. Same transparency and information requirements should apply to all users, including private persons. Besides, Member States should retain the right to regulate high-risk AI systems if duly justified public and national security interests are at stake. Relevant local and regional authorities should always be consulted when AI systems are used for the real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces.The Committee also underlines the importance of clear rules in building an ecosystem of trust and lifting legal uncertainty surrounding the development and use of Artificial Intelligence. In that regard, early detection and elimination of potential overlaps and conflicts with existing rules is of key importance. It expresses concerns about the regulation's potential administrative burden, which can hinder small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities in promoting innovation and deploying AI systems. Regions and cities are also asking the European Commission to provide funding for public campaigns to familiarise the general public with the uses and potential risks of AI systems and to inform consumers on Artificial Intelligence/machine-driven decision-making.Contact:Lauri OuvinenTel. +32 473536887lauri.ouvinen@cor.europa.eu

AI Is Discovering Patterns in Pure Mathematics That Have Never Been Seen Before

Tech04 December 2021By David Nield

We can add suggesting and proving mathematical theorems to the long list of what artificial intelligence is capable of: Mathematicians and AI experts have teamed up to demonstrate how machine learning can open up new avenues to explore in the field.



While mathematicians have been using computers to discover patterns for decades, the increasing power of machine learning means that these networks can work through huge swathes of data and identify patterns that haven't been spotted before.



In a newly published study, a research team used artificial intelligence systems developed by DeepMind, the same company that has been deploying AI to solve tricky biology problems and improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, to unknot some long-standing math problems.



""Problems in mathematics are widely regarded as some of the most intellectually challenging problems out there,"" says mathematician Geordie Williamson from the University of Sydney in Australia.



""While mathematicians have used machine learning to assist in the analysis of complex data sets, this is the first time we have used computers to help us formulate conjectures or suggest possible lines of attack for unproven ideas in mathematics.""



The team shows AI advancing a proof for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, a math problem involving the symmetry of higher-dimensional algebra that has remained unsolved for 40 years.



The research also demonstrated how a machine learning technique called a supervised learning model was able to spot a previously undiscovered relationship between two different types of mathematical knots, leading to an entirely new theorem.



Knot theory in math plays into various other challenging fields of science as well, including genetics, fluid dynamics, and even the behavior of the Sun's corona. The discoveries that AI makes can therefore lead to advances in other areas of research.



""We have demonstrated that, when guided by mathematical intuition, machine learning provides a powerful framework that can uncover interesting and provable conjectures in areas where a large amount of data is available, or where the objects are too large to study with classical methods,"" says mathematician András Juhász from the University of Oxford in the UK.



One of the benefits of machine learning systems is the way that they can look for patterns and scenarios that programmers didn't specifically code them to look out for – they take their training data and apply the same principles to new situations.



The research shows that this sort of high-speed, ultra-reliable, large-scale data processing can act as an extra tool working with mathematicians' natural intuition. When you're dealing with complex, lengthy equations, that can make a significant difference.



The researchers hope that their work leads to many further partnerships between academics in the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence, opening up the opportunity for findings that would otherwise be undiscovered.



""AI is an extraordinary tool,"" says Williamson. ""This work is one of the first times it has demonstrated its usefulness for pure mathematicians, like me.""



""Intuition can take us a long way, but AI can help us find connections the human mind might not always easily spot.""The research has been published in Nature.

December 01, 2021 - Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize clinical research and care delivery. AI can be used to sift through massive databases and may have applications in mental healthcare and cancer detection.
“AI in healthcare is increasingly being used with respect to medical devices and other types of technologies and therapeutics,” Linda Malek, partner at Moses & Singer and chair of the firm’s Healthcare and Privacy & Cybersecurity practice groups, said in an interview with HealthITSecurity.
“It's used in all kinds of applications in terms of monitoring things like diabetes, in radiology for identifying different kinds of pathologies and chest x-rays, and in the mental health context in terms of identifying depression.”
Recent research also showed that AI may be able to close gaps and mitigate risks in the healthcare cybersecurity space. AI in cybersecurity is projected to increase at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 23.66 percent from 2020 to 2027, according to a report from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Despite all its benefits, AI technologies are arguably developing at a faster rate than regulatory agencies can keep up with. AI vendors in the healthcare space must figure out how to navigate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance, and in the case of business associates, HIPAA compliance.
In the meantime, security and patient privacy concerns remain top-of-mind in the healthcare sector when it comes to AI.
AI Security and Privacy Concerns
“There are multitudes of ways in which AI is particularly useful in the healthcare context. But there are a whole host of concerns in terms of how we regulate AI, particularly because AI is so dependent on gathering large blocks of data in order to learn,” Malek explained.
“When you consider that, you see that there are data privacy and cybersecurity issues, ethical issues, and safety issues.”
The volume of data that AI models can maintain is staggering. Without the proper safeguards and regulatory assurances, AI could pose risks to patient data security and privacy.
When it comes to protected health information (PHI), covered entities have a duty under HIPAA to protect patient data. Engaging with any third-party vendor comes with risks that should be carefully assessed. 
Before entrusting an AI vendor with sensitive data, healthcare organizations should establish business associate agreements (BAAs) to hold vendors to the same rigorous data protection standards.
As AI technology continues to evolve and healthcare organizations continue to integrate AI into daily processes, gaps in the regulatory space continue to put this technology in a gray area.
“Beyond the possibility for general abuses of power, AI poses a novel challenge because the algorithms often require access to large quantities of patient data, and may use the data in different ways over time,” a 2021 study published in BMC Medical Ethics suggested.
“The location and ownership of servers and computers that store and access patient health information for healthcare AI to use are important in these scenarios. Regulation should require that patient data remain in the jurisdiction from which it is obtained, with few exceptions.”
While other emerging technologies may be just as exposed to privacy and security issues in healthcare, AI is vulnerable in a different way, Malek said.
AI technology is not necessarily any more vulnerable to manipulation by bad actors than any other technology. That being said, any network-connected technologies used in conjunction with patient care or data analysis should be carefully guarded.
The sheer volume of data, the ability to re-identify previously de-identified data, and the challenge of navigating through the regulatory landscape make AI a unique risk in healthcare security and privacy.
Regulatory Gaps, Challenges of AI in Healthcare
“There is still a gap in terms of how security and privacy should be regulated in this area,” Malek observed. “There is a patchwork of laws that we apply, but they were not designed for AI. Neither is HIPAA.”
Life sciences and biotech companies are constantly creating innovative technologies that can be applied to clinical operations.
“The problem is that HIPAA does not directly regulate entities that are in this space unless they're acting as a business associate for a covered entity,” Malek stated.
Signing a BAA is a great way to ensure data privacy and security to some degree, but HIPAA does not factor in certain new technologies that could pose significant risks. In addition, vendors can get by without a BAA if the data is de-identified, meaning that it no longer can be traced back to an individual and is subsequently no longer subject to HIPAA.
“But the problem with the HIPAA definition of de-identification is that technology now can re-identify that data pretty easily. And so, the parameters that HIPAA uses for de-identified purposes may not be sufficient to really take into account what we're seeing now in AI and in other technologies that are used in concert with AI,” Malek pointed out.
“De-identification, as it's currently defined, may not be enough to really protect the anonymity of the data. That's an example where HIPAA doesn't really take this kind of technology into account.”
Where HIPAA falls short, other regulations may be able to help. The FTC has recently taken an interest in AI technologies in order to protect consumers from potential privacy risks. In a historic 2019 ruling, the FTC imposed a $5 billion penalty on Facebook for misleading consumers by telling them that they could opt-in to facial recognition technology, even though the setting was on by default.  
“I think the FTC will probably step in to do more in terms of regulation around AI in the privacy context. There needs to be transparency so that the patient understands how their data might be used to promote the development of an AI-driven product,” Malek emphasized.
The FDA is also working toward building out a set of regulations and guidance surrounding AI in relation to the privacy and security of medical devices. In September 2021, the FDA recently released its “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Software as a Medical Device Action Plan,” which provided introductory ideas about how the FDA plans to tackle AI technology regulations.
“The FDA’s traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies,” the document stated.
“In this potential approach, the FDA would expect a commitment from manufacturers on transparency and real-world performance monitoring for artificial intelligence and machine learning-based software as a medical device, as well as periodic updates to the FDA on what changes were implemented as part of the approved pre-specifications and the algorithm change protocol.”
Working together, various regulatory agencies may be able to fill in the gaps and help to implement safeguards that ensure that AI technologies take security and privacy into account, especially when it is used in healthcare.
“Right now, the discussions about AI have been ethical discussions as opposed to regulatory discussions,” Malek stated. “But if a regulatory body like the FDA looks at those questions from a more regulatory standpoint, we'll potentially make more progress.”
Malek presented two best practices that are critically important with respect to AI and healthcare: consent and accountability. These two concepts are key focus areas for the regulatory bodies that are working to create guidelines for AI vendors and should also be top-of-mind for healthcare organizations and AI developers.
Sometimes, data is collected for research purposes and later repurposed for secondary use that the patient may not have consented to. Malek cited a 2016 case in which Google-owned DeepMind, an AI vendor, obtained over a million patient health records without patient consent in the UK.
DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust signed a deal in 2015 that provided DeepMind with access to pseudonymized patient data, New Scientist first reported. The agreement was later found to be outside the realm of the UK’s data protection laws.
“Consent is important, but sometimes it is difficult because the contemplated future uses are often not known,” Malek reasoned.
Along with consent, it is equally crucial that accountability is at the forefront of data privacy and security in AI.
“Regulations need to provide guidelines that are clearer for entities that are developing AI so that they know what they need to do to protect the data from a breach and how they will be held accountable if there is a breach,” Malek stressed.
If these regulatory gaps are filled to address the ever-changing technological landscape, privacy and security risks relating to AI could lessen.
Factoring AI Security and Privacy Risks into Your Cybersecurity Program
AI’s benefits in healthcare may largely outweigh security and privacy risks, but it is important for healthcare organizations to still take these risks into account when developing cybersecurity programs and ensuring HIPAA privacy compliance.
“I think that the cybersecurity protection from a technology standpoint has to be commensurate with the advanced technology that's used in AI. In other words, you can't use antiquated cybersecurity measures to deal with very advanced technology like AI and machine learning,” Malek suggested.
“So, I think being as advanced in your cybersecurity protection efforts as you are in your AI development efforts is going to be critically important.”
At the end of the day, healthcare organizations should always prioritize patient safety, security, and privacy. Anything that may pose a threat to those components must be thoroughly evaluated.
Until regulations surrounding AI technology become clearer, healthcare organizations should focus on ensuring transparency, asking patients for consent, and assessing third-party vendors before implementing new technologies in to their infrastructure.

INDIANAPOLIS - Employers competing for talent can turn to a new online job-matching and career-planning tool to quickly fill openings exacerbated by a tight labor market.
The Hoosier Talent Network from the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) is powered by artificial intelligence to better help employers find the best prospects in the right locations based on an individual’s unique potential, at no cost.
“The Hoosier Talent Network opens up new doors for employers and connects them with the jobseekers who are the best match for their current workforce needs,” said Chad Carter, DWD’s Hoosier Talent Network project leader. “This platform has the capability to be a gamechanger in getting the state’s employers back on track for future success.”
More than 16,000 jobseekers have created accounts on the page. DWD’s commitment to bringing employers and jobseekers together is clearly reflected in this new revolutionary resource available to all Hoosiers.
Companies ranging from small businesses to large corporations can use the available advanced technology to get matched with potential workers with all types of skills by visiting www.HoosierTalentNetwork.com.
Jobseekers also can visit the same site to discover the benefits available to them. Whether searching for job now or considering a different career in the future, the Hoosier Talent Network is sharply different from what may have been experienced in the past.
One of the most important features is the technology that looks at each person’s potential and capabilities. Instead of simply matching jobseekers to a similar job they’ve once held, the Hoosier Talent Network demonstrates to them how their talents can be deployed differently in a growing company or industry.
For both employer and jobseeker, the goal is to find that career-defining, long-term fit that benefits both parties.

    Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Bangladesh's IT sector  Fahmida Khatun and Nadia Nawrin        Fahmida Khatun and Nadia Nawrin Published : Dec 01, 2021 15:55 Updated : Dec 07, 2021 16:30 Share this news                   
              For all latest news, follow The Financial Express Google News channel.
             The global Information Technology (IT) sector has been growing ever since the beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Various advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, cloud computing, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), big data, and Machine Learning (ML) are being used by IT-based organisations to increase productivity and improve customer experience. This phenomenon has led to the massive growth potential of the IT sector which is expected to be worth around USD 5 trillion by 2021 and is speculated to be growing at a faster rate in future as evidence suggests.
Bangladesh, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, is also experiencing considerable growth in its IT sector. Automation technologies are largely being used by the telecom, banking, pharmaceutical, and ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh. As the world is getting more digitised, Bangladesh also needs to expand its IT infrastructure to keep up with the 4IR. The country needs to tap into the huge potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions such as machine learning, decision support systems, automated data analysers and others that heavily influences digital growth.
Although still very small in size compared to the other sectors contributing to the GDP, the IT sector in Bangladesh is observing an increase in exports. According to the BASIS, there are currently more than 4500 Software and IT organisations enlisted in Bangladesh. These organisations utilise more than 300,000 nearby IT experts. Many of these companies are also in partnership with overseas companies. This is creating both employment and export opportunities. Employment forecasts for the IT sector are expected to see steady growth. Making use of the huge population, this sector can expand even further and create more jobs for the aspiring youth of the country.
OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES: A 2020 study by a2i suggests that development in the IT sector was set to create a minimum of 10,000 jobs each year. Another study by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 2020 has found that Bangladesh's labour force participation rate is more than half of its population and around two-thirds of the country is aged between 14 to 64. In addition to that, the English speaking population of the country is about 7 million. Given the proper government intervention and facilitation, these people can learn IT skills and knowledge through enrolling in IT-focused universities, colleges, and training centres, as well as on-the-job training. Many IT-based jobs such as call centres and e-commerce require minimum skills in computers with moderate proficiency in English. Moreover, with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many enterprises have invested in the digitalisation of numerous services in response to work-from-home arrangements. All of this signals the potential of a major breakthrough in the IT sector which may increase employment opportunities and prepare Bangladesh's economy for the maximum utilization of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).
Due to technological progress, many human jobs are being replaced by AI and thus rendering them redundant or obsolete. However, efforts towards re-skilling these employees is nearly absent, a study finds. Besides, the academic curriculum is most often disconnected from the IT market demand which results in unskilled IT graduates finding themselves unsuitable for jobs in the relevant sector. In addition, investment in the high-tech sector is also comparatively lower. When compared to its neighbouring country India, Bangladesh lags behind in terms of access to internet and telecommunications devices, internet speed and technology skills. Despite the female population constituting half of Bangladesh's population, the IT Industry is still lagging far behind in terms of attaining gender equity. There is still no gender-sensitive policy in our country that focuses on creating skilled female IT experts. As a result, evidence suggests that the female participation rate in both Computer Science Engineering (CSE) programmes and IT-based job sectors is significantly lower than the male population. Therefore, Bangladesh has to cover a considerable gap to adapt to 4IR completely.
Government Policies and Impact on IT Sector: Acknowledging the importance of the IT sector, the government of Bangladesh has set the vision of Digital Bangladesh as, ""Bring socioeconomic changes through ICT and digital revolution across the country"". The National IT policy 2018 has been introduced to integrate strategic objectives, including digital government, digital security, social equity and universal access to education, research and innovation, skill development and job creation, and strengthening domestic capacity to cope with emerging technology changes. The National Telecommunications Policy 2018 aims to ensure affordable and universally accessible internet, telecommunications, improve safety and security from cybercrime, effective service delivery, promote entrepreneurship, facilitate local hardware and software production.
In terms of improving Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure, Bangladesh has set a developmental approach towards research and development, skilling and reskilling of AI workforce, data and digital infrastructure, ethics, data privacy, security and regulations, funding and accelerating AI start-ups, and industrialisation for AI technologies. Bangladesh has a national blockchain strategy that recognises the need to explore blockchain technology in order to advance its technical capacity, develop resilient infrastructure, increase efficiencies in e-governance and foster innovations. With the advent of AI, a well-organised cybersecurity strategy is crucial. Bangladesh's National Cybersecurity Strategy aims to work collaboratively home and abroad, to manage all major cyber risks that affect us directly irrespective of their origin and type, thereby creating a safe, secure and resilient critical national information infrastructure for our economy and society.
The government of Bangladesh has introduced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a discipline in various institutions including universities, colleges, polytechnic and other vocational institutions. A study from 2018 suggests more than 10,000 IT graduates each year from more than 95 universities and 200 polytechnic or technical colleges. Furthermore, most of the experts involved in the IT sector are computer science or software engineering majors with proficiency in developing programming languages. These facilities and graduates are contributing to the development of human resources for Bangladesh's IT services businesses. All of these indicate that the sector is growing in terms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Consistency of such developments is necessary for the country's economy to keep pace with the digital revolution of 4IR and the realisation of the Digital Bangladesh vision.
The IT sector in Bangladesh, while developing, still has room for improvement. Today's AI Intensive IT sector requires a skilled workforce to function. Of late, the government and other organisations have realised the need for a skilled IT workforce and started working towards developing human resources capable of handling emerging technologies. This is not sufficient. The country needs to establish innovative research and development centres to analyse and comprehend recent developments in global technology trends, forecast the industry's growing technology demands accurately and assist professionals in upskilling the existing workforce. More focus is required for developing and aligning the coursework and curriculum of engineering and polytechnic institutions with industry requirements. In order to attract more youths in the IT sector, sponsoring important IT skill training courses and scholarship programmes will help promote IT entrepreneurship. Thus, a vibrant AI intensive IT industry managed by a skilled workforce will be created. This will help overcome the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and uplift Bangladesh's financial growth.

Low code/no-code approaches allow developers to quickly build applications and alleviate the need to write codes line by line. This helps small business owners, office administrators, business analysts and others who are not well versed with software development to develop test applications. These people have little or no knowledge of programming, development work or machine code..How do they work?.Programmers write lines of code to generate the capabilities and features requested in a computer programme or application in traditional software development. This method necessitates that the programmer is well-versed in computer languages, as well as development environments, deployment processes, and testing standards..Platforms with low and no code contain all of the work done behind the scenes. Users visually pick and connect reusable components that represent certain phases or capabilities (and include the real code), and then link them together to construct the desired automated process. Instead of writing line-by-line scripts for each required function and capability, users may construct applications as if they were creating a flowchart. These platforms also often include capabilities that enable experimentation, prototyping, testing, and deployment..This form of app development work is also known as point-and-click or just click development..Will low-code applications become more popular? The verdict on how far this will all go is yet out. According to some experts, low and no coding may even assist business users to construct AI-driven apps..&quot;Low and no-code platforms enable firms to use artificial intelligence without hiring an army of expensive engineers and data scientists,&quot; argues Jonathan Reilly in Harvard Business Review. Reducing adoption barriers will aid in unleashing the power of AI across all industries and allowing non-specialists to forecast the future. No-code AI platforms will become as commonplace as word-processing and spreadsheet tools are now..Make it easy to utilise AI services by using solutions like Amazon AWS. They provide pay-as-you-go options, so you can start utilising them right now without worrying about long-term obligations. The pricing structure of AWS is consistent across industries; so, firms in various industries will benefit from comparable costs when utilising Amazon Web Services (AWS). &quot;The user should not have to be familiar with regression or k-nearest neighbour methods.&quot; At the moment, low-code and no-code platforms are not commonly regarded as a road to high-end software development..&quot;I don't believe the ordinary business user can design and deploy sophisticated apps,&quot; says Kevin Harbauer of Ephesoft. &quot;To be successful, most of these low-code/no-code solutions need a reasonably technical power user.&quot; Although the principles of developing a successful application of any complexity have essentially stayed unaltered, developers in today's environment must pay greater attention to user experience design, prioritise critical features, and understand procedures and algorithms. Creating an amazing application in today's industry is no longer easy enough for just anyone. &quot;It's simply the implementation that has shifted to drag-and-drop interfaces that do not necessitate writing code.&quot;.Low-level automation is a common application use case, according to Harbauer, and &quot;appears to be where the majority of these sorts of apps are employed outside of IT.&quot; &quot;These technologies enable power users to automate routine processes, connect data between systems, and construct simple..But it's about more than just saving time. &quot;The goal of low-code or no-code software is not to have citizen developers construct complex or mission-critical software systems,&quot; says Harel Tayeb, CEO of Kryon Systems. It is instead intended to allow citizen developers to &quot;rapidly construct an app that will assist them to address an issue and then go on with their day.&quot; More complicated systems would still need the maintenance of IT or engineers.&quot; According to Tayeb, &quot;robot process automation is still too sophisticated for the common user.&quot;.According to Jonathon Reilly, writing in Harvard Business Review, low and no-code platforms enable &quot;the deployment of artificial intelligence without recruiting an army of pricey engineers and data scientists.&quot; &quot;Reducing adoption barriers will aid in unleashing the power of AI across all industries and allowing non-specialists to forecast the future. No-code AI platforms will become as commonplace as word-processing and spreadsheet tools are now.&quot;.&quot;There is still a lot of work to be done for vendors.&quot; To genuinely take off, citizen developer-based RPA must be truly user-friendly, which means no coding skills or technical background is required. The tools must be simple to use and provide the user with the capabilities required to create and deploy a software bot.&quot; In contrast, the resident developer &quot;knows how to fully automate the process since they've been doing it manually.&quot; That is where the citizen developer provides value: they know how to accomplish a task from start to finish since they have done it personally.&quot;.According to Forrester, the top categories for low-code utilisation are now business process or workflow applications, online and mobile front ends, and customer-facing apps. However, as proven by responding to COVID-19 pandemic-related circumstances such as employee contract tracing applications, low-code has swiftly become a regular norm for speedy application development. Low-code, according to experts, will ultimately transcend into larger domains such as reengineering technology stacks and ecosystems..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

CLEVELAND — Case Western Reserve University is taking significant strides to enhance research across its campus. 

More than 250 researchers from nearly two dozen research groups will benefit from a new effort at the school that involves a new faster and larger computing power of ""Artificial Intelligence SuperComputer"" (AISC). In the summer of 2022, the $1 million computer system is expected to be installed. 







According to Vpin Chaudhary, the Kevin J. Kranzusch Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer and Data Sciences at Case, this will be the university's largest and ""far more powerful than anything university researchers had access to before."" 

The institution's data center will be home to at least five refrigerator-sized computers that will accelerate machine learning and artificial intelligence by at least 10 times the speed, according to Chaudhary. As a result of the products, more researchers will be able to manipulate larger amounts of data simultaneously and quickly. 

The effort comes after Chaudhary secured external funding for the AISC from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Ohio Department of Higher Education Action Fund. Case Western Reserve also funded an undisclosed amount of money for the project. 

Some of the features of the new system include: 

The latest and fastest graphic processing unitsHigher bandwidth memoryHigh-speed connectionsA key component known as ""Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe)-based storage."" 

A CWRU alum and current vice president of the company that invented the GPU, Kranzusch contributed $5 million to the commitment in 2019, spurring the department’s creation. He released the following statement: 

Congratulations to the entire university community, especially the students, for gaining access to such a powerful tool to explore the uses of AI and High Performance Computing in their fields. I am certain that the collaboration and rigor that CWRU is known for will only be enhanced with the addition of this important asset."" 

While in the research stage, Chaudhary surveyed dozens of Case faculty members, post-doctoral researchers, Ph.D. students and graduate and undergraduate students to understand what would help them deepen their studies.

As a result, the researchers said that they were in need of more computing power for a wide variety of topics. 

""To solve large problems and to create solutions that will have an impact, you have to have the infrastructure to do the work,"" Chaudhary said. ""I believe this will boost a lot of ongoing research and enable a lot of new work."" 

The original 250 people he surveyed and included in the NSF grant proposal will have access to the new computers first. Any university faculty member also will be able to request access by filling out a form that asks for a description of the proposed research and expected use requirements. 

This new acquisition will give ""researchers the power to explore further and faster than ever before, and will prove catalytic in advancing breakthroughs in disciplines across the university,"" said Venkataramanan ""Ragu"" Balakrishnan, the Charles H. Phipps Dean of the Case School of Engineering. ""From advancing cancer detection to analyzing the deterioration of nuclear materials, artificial intelligence and supercomputing are at the core of our most innovative initiatives."" 

The project also looks to focus on advanced computing power. In the fall of 2021, Kranzusch doubled his commitment to the department with a second $5 million gift. 

When Chaudhary came to Case Western, one of his main goals was to bring advanced computing power to the School of Engineering. Aside from his work at Case Western Reserve, he is helping lead a new $20 million Artificial Intelligence institute at the Ohio State University. 

Case Western Reserve is now partnering alongside OSU, Indiana University and a dozen other schools to work towards bringing more AI to the next generation of people.
