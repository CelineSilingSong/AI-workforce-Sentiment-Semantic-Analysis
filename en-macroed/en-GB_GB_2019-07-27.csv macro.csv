'Crowdworking' provides the humans who train artificial intelligence

                                        by Melissa Hellmann

Eager to make extra money on the side, Washington, D.C., resident Paula Alves Silva turned to a gig emblematic of the digital age: She recorded sentences read aloud in the comfort of her home to help train artificial intelligence (AI) software.





Silva completed the tasks in her native Portuguese tongue for Seattle-based startup DefinedCrowd, which develops machine learning algorithms that power products for businesses including heavyweights MasterCard and BMW. Such recordings could be used in voice recognition products introduced in new countries, or to train existing systems to recognize non-native speakers or regional accents, the company says.
Silva earned $20—from 8 to 33 cents per sentence—and considered that satisfactory given the short amount of time it took to complete the tasks. The knowledge that her task would contribute to a new artificial intelligence system was a bonus, she said.
When voice-activated software such as Amazon's Alexa responds to the simple command of calling Mom, thousands of global workers have helped train the software to ensure that, say, Tom from work isn't dialed instead. The workers transcribe and annotate recordings that are fed back into the software to improve Alexa's human speech recognition (sometimes using recordings from unaware consumers, according to Bloomberg).
The rise of AI in the age of the gig economy has ushered in an invisible workforce in which ordinary people, like Silva, train technology to be smarter.
Created in 2015 by CEO and founder Daniela Braga, DefinedCrowd is one of many companies that use so-called crowdworking to teach tech devices how to follow commands. Others including Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Figure Eight, formerly known as CrowdFlower, were established over a decade ago.






In the past two years, DefinedCrowd has grown from 20 employees in 2017 to 110 globally. That's not counting the 130,000 people across 60 countries that DefinedCrowd says have worked on its tasks. It calls them the Neevo community and says they can work in 50 different languages.
Not all their tasks involve speech: For instance, if the makers of an autonomous vacuum want their machines to clean a living room without running into objects, crowdworkers would annotate the different objects in images of living rooms. Those annotated images would then be used as training data to teach the machines precision, said DefinedCrowd spokeswoman Catarina Salteiro.
""You can think of us as the gasoline of a car,"" said Salteiro. ""You'll put good gas in there to make sure that it's working properly.""
To complete tasks for DefinedCrowd, workers register with their email or social media account on the company's web platform or the recently launched app. After passing a test based on a skill set such as native French fluency, the worker is sent email notifications of available tasks and paid through Paypal at the end of a gig.
Another DefinedCrowd crowdworker, Rakesh Kumar of Delhi, India, said in an email that the recordings he makes in English and Hindi provide a necessary extra income of nearly $10 per month for about six hours of work altogether. It's helpful, although he noted the payment ""is quite less than other freelance work I do.""
A user gets paid only if their work is high quality and matches the requirements. Several members of the Neevo community tweeted at DefinedCrowd that they hadn't gotten paid yet, nor received notifications of new tasks in a while. ""You guys have not paid many completed tasks and the site seems to be down,"" wrote one user in December.
The availability of jobs and the skills required for tasks are dependent upon the projects that clients develop, said Salteiro. Certain languages are in a higher demand for tasks than others. ""As we grow our client base, the offer of work on our Neevo platform will increase and more tasks will become available for different languages and at a higher frequency,"" she said.
A 2018 International Labour Organization report found that crowdworkers who complete tasks for sites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk are paid low wages. Based on two surveys of 3,500 crowdworkers in 75 countries, the report found a third of them relied on the tasks as their main source of income. The report concluded that across five online global platforms—Amazon Mechanical Turk, Microworkers, CrowdFlower, Prolific and Clickworker—the average pay per hour amounted to U.S. $4.43 for work considered payable. When accounting for work that was rejected, pay that wasn't received, or the amount of time it took to search for tasks, respondents averaged $3.31 per hour. Similar to Kumar, nearly 90% of the surveys' respondents said they wanted more work than was available, with workers averaging about 25 hours of crowdwork per week.






Labor law professor Charlotte Garden of Seattle University's School of Law considers crowdworking a form of outsourcing work that was once done by company employees. Such arrangements ""can make workers more vulnerable"" by preventing them from advancing into higher roles or enjoying the labor protections that regular employees have, said Garden.
Given the absence of clear guidelines on the treatment of crowdworkers, last week the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) issued a set of ethical recommendations to AI companies on proper pay, privacy and transparency for crowdworkers. In a blog post, it said U.S. crowdworker companies should pay at least the U.S. average minimum wage of $8.50 per hour. Minimum hourly wage in developing countries should be around $4, given the lower prevailing incomes, AI2 recommended. Companies that employ crowdworkers also should be transparent about how long a task will likely take and conditions that may lead to the rejection of work, AI2 urged.
DefinedCrowd is already following the guideline of calculating payment based on the minimum hourly rate of the country where the job is aimed and the estimated time it will take to complete a task, said Salteiro. She wouldn't be more specific about the pay ranges.
The lack of governance mechanisms in crowdworking has St. Louis University employment law professor Miriam Cherry wondering about the end goal in relying on temporary workers to train AI data systems. ""Is it just efficiency for the sake of efficiency ... or is it something that really could help people?""
One answer to Cherry's question could be found in DefinedCrowd's work with Portugal's biggest electricity company, EDP, according to company spokesperson Jorge Simões. Last year, DefinedCrowd's crowdworkers helped the company determine which electricity poles need to be repaired, a once expensive and time-consuming process that required specialists to survey the poles from a helicopter. DefinedCrowd instead devised a machine-learning algorithm to detect defects in poles from images captured by drones and from helicopters.
To create it, crowdworkers identified the type of damage in 900 images of electric poles that were then used to train and test a damage-detection AI system that monitors the state of poles.
EDP was so satisfied with the work that it became an investor in DefinedCrowd last year. The company is now working with DefinedCrowd to create a voice transcription algorithm that works in industrial environments with loud background noise and the use of technical language by service technicians.
To Simões, the work demonstrated that the most difficult tasks could be ""successfully automated, optimizing the final result of the inspection by minimizing human error and visual limitations,"" even if it took human intelligence to get there.

While it's not unimportant, a lot of the groundwork when developing a new fragrance is done by evaluating data, and that's something artificial intelligence is highly qualified to do.

Meet Philyra

Philyra became the artificial intelligence (AI) apprentice IBM created that perfumer David Apel worked alongside to create two new fragrances for Brazilian cosmetics company O Boticário in time for the country's Valentine's Day holiday this year. They were specifically looking for a fragrance to sell to Generation Z and millennials who they knew would be intrigued by a fragrance created by AI. This collaboration officially launched AI into the fragrance industry.

How does Philyra work?

There are 1,300 scent building blocks (synthetic fragrances and extracts from flowers, mosses, spices, and fruits) that are available to a perfumer. Symrise has a database of 1.7 million formulas made from various combinations of these substances, and this database was shared with Philyra. Philyra was also given information about what fragrances sold well among different genders, age groups, and countries. After analyzing the data with a deep-learning algorithm, the AI system (that’s unencumbered with cultural bias, personal preference, knowledge, experience or comfort with a substance) found possibilities that hadn’t been explored previously. From the data, Philyra output perfume formulas that should perform well for a target group. The perfumer stepped in to refine the AI-generated formulas. It’s important to understand that Philyra’s deep-learning algorithm allows it to learn how various ingredients can be combined and is not just acting based on what a human programmed it to do.
PROMOTED
The beauty of the AI analyzing the data and suggesting formulas is it results in formulas that humans had never considered before for whatever reason. Turns out the sense of smell isn't the most critical aspect of creating a new fragrance; it's understanding the perfume's composition. 
AI algorithms can learn and suggest:
·    Novelty of a fragrance by comparing it to commercially available fragrances
·    Raw material substitutes and complements to be used in formulas
·    Dosing of raw material

·    Predict the human response
Philyra, with the help of perfumer David Apel, created three different versions for O Boticário’s Valentine's Day launch—one created entirely by AI, a second where the perfumer made some adjustments and a third where the AI output was used merely as a suggestion, but the final product was the perfumer's own formula. All three were tested, and the “overwhelming majority opted for the 100% AI-generated perfume.”
Egeo ON Me and Egeo ON You, AI fragrances
Philyra’s and Apel’s creations for O Boticário, Egeo ON Me and Egeo ON You, were released this year in time for Brazil’s Valentine’s Day on June 12.
Egeo ON Me is the feminine fragrance, and ON You is the fragrance more typically masculine, however, the company wants each individual, no matter what gender, to select whatever fragrance resonates with them the most. The fragrances combine notes of fruits, flowers, woods, caramel, and even condensed milk.
Machines augmenting the process
As was the case when artificial intelligence was first used in other industries, there are questions in the fragrance industry about the future of human perfumers. Abel, for one, sees artificial intelligence as a collaboration between humans and machines rather than a threat. Free from bias, machines can help humans overcome barriers to creativity and provide novel ideas. In addition, it typically takes six months to four years to develop a new fragrance; using AI, the timeline is dramatically shortened.
The innovation of IBM Research and Symrise may have been the first fragrance house to use AI to develop new combinations, but it certainly won’t be the last. This year, flavor and fragrance company Givaudan unveiled CARTO, a system designed to use the Odors Value Map to maximize olfactory performance in final formulas of flavors and fragrances.
Turns out creating fragrances is an art and a science. Master perfumers still have the emotional advantage over AI, so until that changes, AI will augment human expertise in fragrance development.

The idea of robots taking our jobs is not radically new. 
But artificial intelligence (AI) is now completely reorganising the global economy. Some estimates of productivity-driven economic growth conclude that AI will contribute approximately $US16 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

Unfortunately – compared to the European Union, Japan, United States and United Kingdom – Australia has been relatively late in turning to address the challenges of AI, and creating the right policies to deal with its many implications (good and bad).  
For our economy to thrive, what we need now is the right mix of governance, regulation, civil society participation, industry support and business compliance – as well as the development and deepening of digital literacy throughout Australian communities. 
So how can we make that happen? A report launched today is designed to help. 
Euphoria versus cataclysm
New developments in AI are very different from previous forms of automation. Technologies today are mobile, situationally aware, adaptive and in real-time communication with other intelligent machines.  
Machine learning has been especially important in speeding up the spread and efficacy of AI. Machine learning encompasses smart algorithms that improve their performance unsupervised, often through sorting and classifying big data sets. Applications include weather prediction, medical diagnostics and personalised marketing (such as ads through Facebook). 
Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, said the AI revolution is “unlike anything humankind has experienced before”. 
The consequences of our increasingly automated global world involve a shattering of political orthodoxies. We have to be much more agile and prepared to change fast. Our policies and approaches should allow us to cope with the unexpected, unanticipated shifts coming from the digital revolution.

I have been pondering these massive global changes over the last nine months while working as a member of the Australian Council of Learned Academies Expert Working Group on Artificial Intelligence in Australia. The ACOLA Report, launched today in Canberra, considers the full spectrum of issues arising from AI. 
One big challenge we faced was to distinguish between euphoric and cataclysmic visions of AI. Another big task was to chart the public policy “sea change” arising from AI. Neither challenge was easy to confront.
Leveraging AI for Australia
The ACOLA Report lays out how we can improve Australia’s economic, societal and environmental well-being while taking into account the ethical, legal and social issues linked with AI. 
It highlights the importance of finding a balance between innovation and risk, and how we can weigh up the promise of unprecedented technological transformation of manufacturing, infrastructure and the economy on the one side, and the growing risks of technological unemployment and autonomous weapons (“killer robots”) on the other.

      Why it's so hard to reach an international agreement on killer robots




The plan outlined in the report focuses on education, business operations, governance and regulation, social implications, research and skills.
In terms of education, for example, increased automation of routine tasks means people will be freed up in the workplace. This means there’s likely to be an increased demand for employees with strong interpersonal skills and critical thinking. 
The social sciences, humanities and creative arts have a big role to play in promoting ethical AI. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics are vital in advancing the next generation of AI researchers. 
AI will demand new skills and capabilities, and adaptability, in our workforce. Micro-credentialing (a form of education in which “mini-degrees” are achieved in specific subject areas) is likely to become useful for certifying basic education and digital literacy in AI.  
Schools, the vocational education and training (VET) sector and universities should encourage broad-based training and lifelong learning in AI development. 
The ACOLA report also addresses the need for new policy relating to data harvesting and invasions of privacy (for example, involving tech giants Facebook and Google) and geopolitical concerns, especially where the spread of fake news has been powerfully weaponised by Russia and other countries.

Everything to play for
Getting the balance right between opportunity and risk arising from the AI revolution will be essential to the future fabric of Australia. However the ACOLA report is only the start of the process of public engagement – much more needs to be done.  
What is now urgently needed, I think, is a national summit on AI – involving politicians, policymakers, business leaders and industry representatives and people from the broader community. This can help us consider how Australia might best fashion a common framework for the ethical development of AI, both in our country and internationally.
Australia has come to this global policy debate somewhat later than some, but in terms of the AI revolution there’s everything still to play for.

The arguments developed in this article are the author’s own views, and not representative of ACOLA or the panel that contributed to the horizon scanning report on AI.

Research suggests kids growing up on Alexa and Google Home think that these devices are smarter than them. But a new kind of summer camp wants kids to know that artificial intelligence (AI) is far from perfect. Welcome to AI Ethics camp. In a classroom on the second floor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, two dozen middle school-aged kids wearing neon green t-shirts sat in clusters around tables. Standing at the front of the room was MIT researcher Blakeley H. Payne, who’s devoted her graduate studies in the Media Lab to the ethics of artificial intelligence. “How many of you use YouTube?” Payne asked.The answer: just about everyone in this class. Some 81% of all parents with children age 11 or younger let their child watch videos on YouTube, with 34% indicating that they allow their child to do this regularly, according to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center. The more you watch, the more YouTube is able to target all kinds of content, including advertising. “Do you ever think about the algorithm behind the ‘Who’s trending’ page?” Payne asked. Most of the kids shook their heads no.This was the first time local STEM organization Empow Studios hosted AI Ethics camp, after partnering with Payne. Empow Studios and Payne want to offer the camp at an affordable cost, so they set it at $150 a week. Payne thinks all kids should not only understand how AI works, but approach its design through an ethical lens. And what better way to introduce that idea than with a favorite sandwich?""At the very beginning, we talk about how algorithms can have different goals and purposes,"" Payne said. ""They make an algorithm to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and then we talk about what is the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich algorithm? And they all have different ideas. Is it the algorithm that makes the tastiest sandwich? Is it the prettiest sandwich, the quickest and easiest to make, the easiest to clean up? And we moved from there into the technical curriculum, so as they're building their machine learning models, they can think, 'Oh wait, what is the goal of my machine learning system?'""The point is that artificial intelligence is a human creation, prone to flaws and biases. A 2018 study by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the Media Lab, found that the facial recognition software of tech giants IBM, Microsoft and Google struggled in detecting the faces of black women. The study suggested that when biased data sets are fed into machine-learning algorithms, they perpetuate inequalities in various pipelines where artificial intelligence is being used, from job recruitment to prison sentences.Read more: Addressing Gender And Racial Bias In Facial Recognition Technology Three days into the camp, 10-year-old Abhinav had already learned that artificial intelligence is not an independent entity.“I thought AI would be, like, a robot that thinks freely on its own. That's what I thought before I came here,"" he said. ""Now I know it's not just something that thinks really on its own, but it's actually something that can recognize things that can help people.” The capstone project for the week is redesigning YouTube. It may sound like a heady undertaking, but Payne says these digital natives are already sharp media consumers.“They have such an ability from a young age to empathize with different stakeholders, to put themselves in other people's shoes,"" she said. ""If you ask them about YouTube, they can exactly explain to you who the recommender algorithm benefits, who it harms and why.”Just ask Saisha, a rising seventh-grader who has already given this issue some thought. She suggests that YouTube implement more rigorous filters to protect kids from inappropriate content.“What I would change is that there would be a heavier filter on content,"" Saisha said. ""They would look not just for what the title says, but the program would run through and if it has any certain negative vocabulary maybe programmed into it, then it could just filter it out.” Payne thinks the way to influence the next generation of programmers and consumers is to teach AI ethics more broadly, in schools across the country.“Because what I don't want to happen is, I don't want the ethics piece to go to an elite few. And then you're just perpetuating these systems of inequality over and over again,” she said. “I love to think about a future where the students in this workshop make up the majority of the people who work in Silicon Valley or the majority of the people who work on Wall Street.”Correction: An earlier version of this story spelled Blakeley H. Payne's first name incorrectly.

 You could be forgiven for thinking that AI will soon replace human physicians based on headlines such as “The AI Doctor Will See You Now,” “Your Future Doctor May Not Be Human,” and “This AI Just Beat Human Doctors on a Clinical Exam.” But experts say the reality is more of a collaboration than an ousting: Patients could soon find their lives partly in the hands of AI services working alongside human clinicians.

  There is no shortage of optimism about AI in the medical community. But many also caution the hype surrounding AI has yet to be realized in real clinical settings. There are also different visions for how AI services could make the biggest impact. And it’s still unclear whether AI will improve the lives of patients or just the bottom line for Silicon Valley companies, health care organizations, and insurers.


  “I think that all our patients should actually want AI technologies to be brought to bear on weaknesses in the health care system, but we need to do it in a non-Silicon Valley hype way,” says Isaac Kohane, a biomedical informatics researcher at Harvard Medical School.


  If AI works as promised, it could democratize health care by boosting access for underserved communities and lowering costs — a boon in the United States, which ranks poorly on many health measures despite an average annual health care cost of $10,739 per person. AI systems could free overworked doctors and reduce the risk of medical errors that may kill tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of U.S. patients each year. And in many countries with national physician shortages, such as China where overcrowded urban hospitals’ outpatient departments may see up to 10,000 people per day, such technologies don’t need perfect accuracy to prove helpful.


  But critics point out that all that promise could vanish if the rush to implement AI tramples patient privacy rights, overlooks biases and limitations, or fails to deploy services in a way that improves health outcomes for most people.


  “In the same way that technologies can close disparities, they can exacerbate disparities,” says Jayanth Komarneni, founder and chair of the Human Diagnosis Project (Human Dx), a public benefit corporation focused on crowdsourcing medical expertise. “And nothing has that ability to exacerbate disparities like AI.”



Today, the most popular AI techniques are machine learning and its younger cousin, deep learning. Unlike computer programs that rigidly follow rules written by humans, both machine learning and deep learning algorithms can look at a dataset, learn from it, and make new predictions. Deep learning in particular can make impressive predictions by discovering data patterns that people might miss.

  But to make the most of these predictions in health care, AI can’t go at it alone. Rather, humans still must help make decisions that can have major health and financial consequences. Because AI systems lack the general intelligence of humans, they can make baffling predictions that could prove harmful if physicians and hospitals unquestioningly follow them.


  The classic example comes from Rich Caruana, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, as he explained in Engineering and Technology magazine last year. In the 1990s, Caruana worked on a project that tried using an earlier form of machine learning to predict whether a patient with pneumonia was a low-risk or a high-risk case. But trouble arose when the machine learning model tried to predict the case for asthma sufferers, who are high risk because their preexisting breathing difficulties make them vulnerable to pneumonia. The model pegged these patients as low-risk, requiring minor intervention rather than hospitalization — something a human expert never would have done.
If you follow the model blindly, says Kenneth Jung, a research scientist at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, “then you’re hosed. Because the model is saying: ‘Oh, this kid with asthma came in and they got pneumonia but we don’t need to worry about them and we’re sending them home with some antibiotics.’”


  Deep-learning predictions can also fail if they encounter unusual data points, such as unique medical cases, for the first time, or when they learn peculiar patterns in specific datasets that do not generalize well to new medical cases.


  The AI predictions do best when applied to massive datasets, such as in China, which has an advantage in training AI systems thanks to access to large populations and patient data. In February, the journal Nature Medicine published a study from researchers based in San Diego and Guangzhou, China that showed promise in diagnosing many common childhood diseases based on the electronic health records of more than 567,000 children.


  But even large datasets can pose problems, particularly when researchers try to apply their algorithm to a new population. In the Nature Medicine study, all the half million patients came from one medical center in Guangzhou, which means there is no guarantee the diagnostic lessons learned from training on that dataset would apply to pediatric cases elsewhere. Each medical center may attract its own unique set of patients — a hospital known for its cardiovascular center, for instance, may attract more critical heart conditions. And findings from a Guangzhou hospital that mostly attracts ethnic Chinese patients may not translate to one in Shanghai with a higher number of foreign-born, non-Chinese patients.



 


										In this 2017 TEDx Talk, Shinjini Kundu of Johns Hopkins Hospital explains how AI tools have the potential to glean more from medical images than doctors alone can — including predicting diseases before patients show symptoms.									


  This extrapolation will prove difficult in other situations as well. For example, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, a computer scientist and biomedical engineer at the University of Toronto, say you have 40,000 ICU patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center — that’s just one hospital in one city. “And so I have all these papers that have done predictions with this data. Does that work with another hospital in Boston? Maybe. Does it work for a hospital in another state? Would it work in another country? We don’t know.”



While AI models may not work in every case, Ghassemi thinks the technology is still worth exploring. “I am very much in favor of taking these models from the bench to the bedside,” she says, “but with really aggressive precautionary steps.”

  Those steps need to exist throughout AI development and deployment, says I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard University and a leader for the Project on Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, and the Law. This may involve verifying the accuracy and transparency of AI predictions. And during data collection, researchers will also need to protect patient privacy and ask for consent to use patient data for training AI.


  The consent issue comes up again when the AI model is ready for experimental clinical testing with real patients. “Do patients need to be told you’re using the algorithm on them, and does it matter whether the AI is completely guiding care or partly guiding care?” Cohen asks. “There is really very little thinking on these questions.”


  Ghassemi also advocates for frequently auditing AI algorithms to ensure fairness and accuracy across different groups of people based on ethnicity, gender, age, and health insurance. That’s important given how AI applications in other fields have already shown that they can easily pick up biases.


  After all those steps, the people and companies providing AI services will need to sort out legal liability in the case of inevitable mistakes. And unlike most medical devices, which usually need just one regulatory approval, AI services may require additional review whenever they learn from new data.


  Some regulatory agencies are rethinking how to assess health care AI. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a discussion paper to get public feedback about how to update the relevant regulatory review. “What we are continuously trying to do here is get back to our goal of giving people access to technologies, but we’re also realizing that our current methods don’t quite work well,” says Bakul Patel, director for digital health at the FDA. “That’s why we need to look at a holistic approach of the whole product life cycle.”
In addition to issues surrounding access, privacy, and regulations, it also isn’t clear just who stands to benefit the most from AI health care services. There are already health care disparities: According to the World Bank and the World Health Organization, half of the globe’s population lacks access to essential health care services and nearly 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty by health care expenses. Depending on how it is deployed, AI could either improve these inequalities, or make them worse.

“A lot of the AI discussion has been about how to democratize health care, and I want to see that happening,” says Effy Vayena, a bioethicist at the Federal Institute of Technology in Switzerland.


  “If you just end up with a fancier service provision to those who could afford good health care anyway,” she adds, “I’m not sure if that’s the transformation we’re looking for.”


  How this all plays out depends on the different visions for implementing AI. Early development has focused on very narrow diagnostic applications, such as scrutinizing images for hints of skin cancer or nail fungus, or reading chest X-rays. But more recent efforts have tried to diagnose multiple health conditions at once. 
In August 2018, Moorfields Eye Hospital in the United Kingdom and DeepMind. the London-based AI lab owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, showed that they had successfully trained an AI system to identify more than 50 eye diseases in scans, which matched the performance of leading experts. Similarly broad ambitions drove the San Diego and Guangzhou study that trained AI to diagnosis common ailments among children. The latter wasn’t as good at diagnosing pediatric diseases compared to senior physicians, but it did perform better than some junior physicians.


  Such AI systems may not need to outperform the best human experts to help democratize health care, but simply expand access to current medical standards. Still, so far, many proposed AI applications are focused on improving the current standard of care rather than spreading affordable health care around, Cohen says: “Democratizing what we already have would be a much bigger bang for your buck than improving what we have in many areas.”


  Accenture, a consulting firm, predicts that top AI applications could save the U.S. economy $150 billion per year by 2026. But it’s unclear if patients and health care systems supplemented by taxpayer dollars would benefit, or if more money would simply flow to the tech companies, health care providers, and insurers.


  “The question of who is going to drive this and who is going to pay for this is an important question,” says Kohane. “Something a bit hallucinatory about all those business plans is that they think they know how it will work out.”


  Even if AI services make cost-saving recommendations, human physicians and health care organizations may hesitate to take AI advice if they make less money as a result, Kohane cautions. That speaks to the bigger systemic issue of the U.S. health insurers using a fee-for-service model that often rewards physicians and hospitals for adding tests and medical procedures, even when they aren’t needed.



There is another AI opportunity that could improve the quality of care while still leaving most medical diagnoses in the hands of doctors. In his 2019 book “Deep Medicine,” Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, talks about creating essentially a supercharged medical Siri — an AI assistant to take notes about the interactions between doctors and their patients, enter those notes in electronic health records, and remind physicians to ask about relevant parts of the patient’s history.

  “My aspiration is that we decompress the work of doctors and get rid of their data clerk role, help patients take on more responsibility, and key up the data so it doesn’t take so long to review things,” Topol says.


  That “never-forgetful medical assistant or scribe,” says Kohane, would require AI that can automatically track and transcribe multiple voices between physicians and patients. He supports Topol’s idea, but adds that most AI applications in development don’t seem to be focused on such assistants. Still, some companies such as Saykara and DeepScribe have developed services along these lines, and even Google teamed up with Stanford University to test a similar “digital scribe” technology.


  An AI assistant may sound less exciting than an AI doctor, but it could free up physicians to spend more time with their patients and improve overall quality of care. Family physicians in particular often spend more than half of their working days entering data into electronic health records — a main factor behind physical and emotional burnout, which has dire consequences, including patient deaths.


  Ironically, electronic health records were supposed to improve medical care and cut costs by making patient information more accessible. Now Topol and many other experts pointed to electronic health records as a cautionary tale for the current hype surrounding AI in medicine and health care.
The implementation of electronic health records has already created a patchwork system spread among hundreds of private vendors that mainly succeeds in isolating patient data and makes it inaccessible to both physicians and patients. If history is any guide, many tech companies and health care organizations will feel the pull to follow similar paths by hoarding medical data for their own AI systems.


  One way around this may be to use a collective intelligence system that aggregates and ranks medical expertise from different sources, says Komarneni, who is trying this approach with Human Dx. Backed by major medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, Human Dx has built an online platform for crowdsourcing advice from thousands of physicians on specific medical cases. Komarneni hopes that such a platform could, in theory, also someday include diagnostic advice from many different AI services.


  “In the same way that multiple human professionals might look at your case in the future, there is no reason why multiple AI couldn’t do it,” Komarneni says.


  As doctors wait for their AI helpers, crowdsourcing projects like Human Dx “could definitely lead to improved diagnostics or even improved recommendations for therapy,” says Topol, who coauthored a 2018 study on a similar platform called Medscape Consult. The paper concluded collective human intelligence could be a “competitive or complementary strategy” to AI in medicine.


  But if AI services pass all the tests and real-world checks, they could become significant partners for humans in reshaping modern health care.


  “There are things that machines will never do well, and then others where they’ll be exceeding what any human can do,” Topol says. “So when you put the two together it’s a very powerful package.”

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  McKesson is a large pharmaceutical distributor that delivers health information technology, medical tools and supplies, and care management tools and software to healthcare providers in the United States. The company has been working to incorporate artificial intelligence solutions internally since 2012, but in more recent years they have adopted a few important automation tools.  These tools help them free up white-collar workers to take care of more specific work that only humans can do. Additionally, they help the company make a smooth transition into value-based care, which could result in higher annual savings. In this article, we take a closer look at how McKesson facilitates healthcare AI through investments and building a new digital infrastructure internally. We also explore the tools McKesson is currently using to automate business areas that human employees may not be suitable for.  We discuss the following initiatives: Facilitating AI Inside and Outside the Enterprise:  How McKesson helps AI firms develop healthcare applications they are interested in, such as Komodo Health. How the company makes it easier for all their employees to access and make better use of the AI tools they currently use. Internal AI Initiatives for White-Collar Automation and Finance Management: McKesson’s partnership with Genpact that allows them to automate numerous white-collar processes Their acquiring of Change Healthcare and how their predictive analytics software helps discern reimbursement rates for value-based care. We begin our exploration of McKesson’s current AI initiatives with their investment in Komodo Health and adoption of the Google Cloud platform as flexible digital architecture. Facilitating AI Inside and Outside the Enterprise McKesson has made changes to allow their business to more easily adapt to new AI technologies. Their move to the Google Cloud platform is perhaps their most important change in recent years, because it enables faster implementation of new AI tools across all business areas.   Additionally, they look to smaller companies in the healthcare AI market to invest in so that they may have even more useful applications in the future. This is emphasized by their investment in newer companies with which they can build a relationship with early and possibly influence their approach to making their AI products. Investing in Komodo Health McKesson Ventures, the company’s own venture capital fund, invested in AI healthcare firm Komodo Health. Komodo claims their predictive analytics platform helps doctors diagnose and keep track of disease progression in patients. It purportedly can help doctors deliver individualized care by supplying insights about each patient or patient population. Komodo claims that all of this results in a shorter time between the patient’s check-in and their treatment. Komodo most likely achieves this by training their machine learning model on a large amount of anonymized patient data. This way, patient names and other personal information will not be circulated and thus remain compliant with healthcare regulations. The data might involve various details about a patient’s health, such as: Medical history, including past injuries and ailments Past disease and ailment treatments that have worked for the patient Medications they are currently taking Any medication allergies The patient’s current symptoms Each of these categories would then be labeled, and Komodo likely labels each piece of data under one of these categories. After Komodo’s data scientists expose the machine learning model to all of this data, it would then be able to discern correlations between symptoms, how they get worse, and which diseases or ailments they are most commonly associated with.Once trained, their predictive analytics model could be used to help physicians understand their patients’ illnesses. This software most likely uses the context it has on the medical history of past patients to predict what a doctor’s diagnosis will be on a current patient.  This could be especially helpful to McKesson because of its purported capacity to predict the progression of a patient’s disease, which would allow healthcare providers to more easily communicate to McKesson which products they need and when they need to arrive.  McKesson’s world cancer day update suggests that Komodo Health’s AI platform can also be used to accurately predict cancer relatively early compared to current diagnostics. They emphasize this with a quote from Dr. Arif Nathoo, CEO of Komodo Health.  With regards to the data used to create these predictions, Nathoo said, “Just as Amazon can tell you when you need more cereal or new running shoes based on behaviors, we’re learning from the journeys of patients across 50 billion clinical encounters how to train our algorithms to detect cancer well before symptoms manifest.” While 50 billion clinical encounters may seem like an untenable amount of patient data to use, McKesson claims Komodo uses the medical history of over 300 million patients to train its software. If this medical history includes each and every doctor’s appointment and emergency room visit on each patient’s record, then it is possible their database reaches 50 billion individual encounters. McKesson Moves to Google Cloud McKesson recently moved away from other cloud-based technology platforms in favor of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), allowing them to distribute new applications and tools across the company more easily.  They claim that it will also advance the development of their new AI technology, which includes improving their data analytics capacity. This primarily supports McKesson’s strategy for optimizing how they deliver healthcare and products more efficiently. The company claims the move to GCP will ensure that their digital infrastructure will be flexible. This likely means each department will not need to invest hard drive space to constantly installing new AI tools and updates to make sure they are operating with the newest technology.  Instead, employees use Google Cloud to remotely access the applications they need to use for their jobs, and updates are run through the cloud so that nobody can miss an update. McKesson also claims this flexible infrastructure will allow them to accomplish the following advancements to their technological resources: Create a scalable and agile database that is more useful for the company itself and the other healthcare businesses it works with. This likely means that medical data is stored in a directory where it is labeled normally, but not organized according to those labels. This allows for different ways to organize patient data and clinical data so that it can be used by anyone interfacing with McKesson’s Google Cloud applications. Modernize their solutions to common business problems such as product manufacturing, specialty product distribution, and pharmacy retail operations. This is purportedly accomplished through developing and testing new applications and software tools through GCP. Capture new medical data in real-time using cloud-based data analytics tools, which likely helps them develop and improve machine learning models. This could allow for more up to date insights on specific patient populations or how patients commonly react to certain diseases. Have a bigger capacity for integrating machine learning and AI into the enterprise. Because the AI software does not need to be installed to each computer, or even to a central computer onsite, integrating AI applications may take much less time. When combined with the real-time cloud analytics mentioned above, AI applications could likely continue updating automatically without a human monitor.  Expedite their ability to deliver new software and services along with the scalability to handle big-picture issues as well as granular business problems. This may seem redundant, but McKesson likely included this statement because Google Cloud Platform allows them to accomplish this faster than they ever have before. Reduce the need for managers and administrators to always be checking on and updating the digital architecture. This allows data scientists to focus on new projects within an infrastructure they can already rely on to be flexible enough to integrate their projects. Below is an introductory seminar about using machine learning and AI on the Google Cloud platform. In this video, a Google cloud expert describes how businesses can use the platform to facilitate the use of AI across their entire enterprise. Because the video is quite long, we have included a list of the most useful moments below.  6:12 – Machine Learning as an API. GCP has 5 machine learning APIs that can enable AI tools that use natural language processing, translation, speech recognition, machine vision, and “video intelligence,” or insights from data gathered with machine vision. 21:56 – GCP tools for training machine learning models on a business’ proprietary data. These tools are called TensorFlow and ML Engine. TensorFlow is an open-source Google-created machine learning training tool, while ML Engine is a tool specifically for GCP. 24:18 – How custom machine learning models work on GCP using TensorFlow and ML Engine.  Internal AI Initiatives for White-Collar Automation and Finance Management McKesson has made some important partnerships and mergers in the past few years that have improved its business processes using machine learning and AI. They have partnered with the AI firm Genpact in order to automate white-collar pharmaceutical work and free up employees to focus on delivering care.  Additionally, McKesson acquired Change Healthcare and are utilizing their predictive analytics software to provide value-based care and automate claims management.  White-Collar Automation at McKesson and Their Partnership With Genpact McKesson has been working on data analytics systems and finding better and better ways to manage their data since 2016. This has allowed them to try out different approaches to artificial intelligence in various business areas, but most recently they have leveraged the technology for numerous white-collar use cases. They take advantage of these use cases through their use of AI applications provided by Genpact, a partnered company. The white-collar business areas that McKesson has been able to automate include: Order to cash: The process of aggregating sales orders for pharmaceuticals and medical services, and taking in payments for those sales. Could come from individual patients, insurance providers, or hospitals in the case of medical tool sales. Record to report: The collection and distribution of important information, ideally in a timely manner. This includes communicating pathology and radiology information about patients to the correct doctors and pharmacists. Alternatively, this can be useful in a medical testing lab where results may need to be distributed to many departments at once.  Contract management: The process by which written and signed contracts are distributed, then sent back to the relevant departments. These departments will need to know the contract has been signed in order to fulfill a task or ship a product. Additionally, data analytics systems may take any currently active contracts into account when recommending the best course of action for a business leader. Master Data management: An automated process that manages a company’s store of big data and where that data is stored within the enterprise. This is most likely in reference to patient data and electronic health records (EHR) stored somewhere in McKesson’s database. Source to pay: Managing the company’s financial resources in order to reduce company spending in frivolous areas. This helps business leaders decide the areas that require the most funds and prioritize based on large amounts of enterprise data. This is most likely accomplished using predictive analytics to create a budget while taking patient data into consideration when calculating possible resource utilization in the future.  McKesson’s “source to pay” and “record to report” processes are the most likely to be automated through predictive analytics. This is because managing and recommending good business spending habits requires using historical spending data and the ROI yield from past expenditures. The image below is an example of one of Genpact’s AI software solutions, APFlow. The company claims APFlow is their recommended solution for the source to pay process.  The user is able to visualize all invoices within a system and group them by document type and payment status. The dashboard allows the user to bring up recently viewed graphs and refresh the visualizations based on any changes to the data: A preview of Genpact’s dashboard Additionally, predictive analytics software can predict where a certain type of document or memo needs to be sent based on information on past data transfers within the enterprise.  In the case of new personnel or a change in which departments are prioritized to receive information, however, this may be bypassed by directing the software to send the information to certain people.  This is different from a non-AI analytics engine that simply shows the most current trends in a company’s data. We spoke to German Sanches-Trilles about the differences between analytics and predictive analytics in our interview about data science terms that people commonly get wrong.  When asked about what makes predictive analytics different from more common analytics engines, Sanches-Trilles said: If we compare it with normal analytics, when I listen to the term analytics, the first thing that comes to my mind is Google Analytics. [In Google Analytics,] you look at the traffic of your website, perhaps the purchases of your eCommerce, looking at the data and trying to understand it.  When you are doing predictive analytics, there is this predictive part in which you think of the data you have, you build something with that data, an algorithm or a model or whatever, and try to infer something that is going to happen in the future based on the past. Predictions from AI software are reviewed by a human employee before a final decision is made. Because of this, predictive analytics software can help business leaders manage finances using all of their enterprise data with the freedom to accept or reject what the results may imply.  Acquisition of Change Healthcare: Claims Management and Predictive Analytics Recently, McKesson acquired Change Healthcare, an AI firm that has allowed them to access their predictive analytics technology for value-based care and medical reimbursement. Value-based care is a business model that charges the patient based on the value of care they received.  This functions differently from individually priced medicines and services as products based on a typical supply and demand market strategy.  Change Healthcare has AI analytics software that can possibly allow McKesson to ensure the accuracy of payments and revenue by reducing finance errors like missed payments and chargebacks. One of McKesson’s chosen solutions from Change Healthcare is their recent software called Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence. This is part of Change Healthcare’s “Intelligent Healthcare Network,” or its AI platform specifically for solving business problems in healthcare.  The company claims the Claims Lifecycle solution can help optimize claims processing for both healthcare providers and payers such as patients or their health insurance provider.  The “claims lifecycle” referred to in the name of the solution refers to the chain of events that starts when a claim is initially filed and ends when it is paid off or rejected by the company.  The software purportedly detects claims that will be denied while the claim is submitted. The machine learning model behind the software likely compares new claims with past ones that have been accepted. This allows it to discern if the claim is accurate or not. The graphic below from McKesson illustrates how Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence observes details about input claims and then accepts or rejects them: Infographic on how Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence comes to its conclusions, courtesy of Change Healthcare Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence can reject claims based on the signature on the form or the dollar amount the claim is for, however, these are just some of the possible parameters. A denied claim could get sent back to the claimant so that they may complete any parts of the claim they may have missed.  Additionally, this allows the claimant to correct any information that the system rejected. According to Change Healthcare, this system has resulted in $6.2 billion in savings within all companies that use this solution. It is very possible that this software uses predictive analytics to determine if the information within each claim is accurate or complete. This inference comes from the fact that Change Healthcare is a company focused on data analytics and predictive analytics, and this was true even before they were acquired by McKesson.  Unfortunately, there is currently no information on this solution that confirms it as predictive analytics. Predictive Analytics Software Change Healthcare’s analytics platform is called HealthQx, and it purportedly can help healthcare providers make the transition to value-based care and reimbursement. These are required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the solution uses predictive analytics to determine the value of the care each patient received.  Additionally, automating this process facilitates reimbursement in the elimination of any possibility for human error. When a human employee cannot retain all of the financial information at once and makes a mistake, it could lead to less reimbursement for their company, which affects the total revenue for that company.  HealthQx uses a technique called “episodic claim grouping” to detect when business costs rise and fall. The software can then take the time period between when costs initially spike and when they fall back down as an “episode” so that it can focus in on a specific time where costs surged to find exactly how much a provider needs to be reimbursed.  HealthQx can use the data from each of these episodes to gather more insight to use in future analytics queries and projects. Change Healthcare refers to this data utilization as “episodic analysis.” However, episodic claim grouping is just one technique a predictive analytics software could use to find this type of insight that a client company could not find prior to adoption. We spoke to Steve Gullans, Managing Director at Excel Venture Management, about investing in AI healthcare applications.  While our interview mostly deals with why doctors don’t want to be fully replaced by AI, Gullans made an important observation regarding white-collar and financial automation in healthcare: …Looking for diamonds in the rough or opportunities that are undervalued, by looking through the patent histories and seeing what’s out there that people don’t appreciate, on a global basis…you could actually find things that were invisible before. It would seem that even investors at large venture funds are interested in how patient history can help determine the value of their care. Because of this, business leaders should keep an eye out for AI firms that purport to solve value-based care problems if that is a business area they are considering for integration. It is likely that the machine learning model behind HealthQx was trained on thousands of records from client healthcare providers such as EHRs, healthcare claims, and financial data. It would need to be relevant to the client company’s resources and financial plans, patient health levels and satisfaction, and the list of services that can be reimbursed.  Additionally, it is possible that the software has a natural language processing (NLP) section. This is because EHRs contain unstructured written information that NLP can process whereas predictive analytics cannot. Both Change Healthcare and McKesson claim that HealthQx is being leveraged by health plan providers that cover 33% of commercially insured citizens in the United States. However, they do not mention any of these providers by name.  It would appear that McKesson is seeing some success with the software as a value-based care solution, but they do not state any savings figures in regards to their transition into AI-powered value-based care.   Header image credit: Medium Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Barclays - Current InitiativesBarclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks.… Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Venture Investments in Artificial Intelligence - Trends in 2016 and BeyondInvestments in artificial intelligence continued on an upward swing in 2016, following through on the… Artificial Intelligence at Morgan Stanley - Current InitiativesMorgan Stanley is a US financial institution known mostly for its financial advisory services.

Chiropractic in the coming years will see a number of breakthroughs for the application of artificial intelligence in medical science
Artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science dedicated to enabling computers to mimic human thinking, is making waves in health care. Inevitably, AI would start having an impact on chiropractic clinics in the process. Many of the everyday tasks chiropractors and their teams perform will likely be affected by AI and the application of artificial intelligence in medical science.
This creates a wide variety of new possibilities for chiropractors. You can save staff hours for more high-level tasks and automate much of your back office work, or create chatbots to interact online with prospective patients and mine patient data for valuable insights. In the process, these applications may save your practice time and money, providing key productivity you can apply to other tasks and responsibilities.
By learning more about how AI works and what it can do for your practice, you can start putting computer intelligence to work.
How AI works
For many of us, AI in the workplace conjures up images of robot workers carrying out human office tasks in a made-for-TV science fiction film — maybe even robots cleaning our homes (which they already do) or driving our cars (pioneered by Tesla). While it’s true that constant improvements in technology are allowing for better and more innovative robots, in practice the best applications of robotic technologies are related to data management.
Health care is rich with data, and AI can help analyze data more efficiently and discover new trends that weren’t visible before. This has a variety of different applications in the industry. For example:

Health research
Marketing and community outreach
Individualized care

Not all of these applications for AI have been fully realized just yet. They do offer a lot of promise, though, along with potentially very helpful insights for chiropractic care.
Patient data
One of the most relevant uses for AI in a clinical setting is for data analytics. Patient data contains a lot of valuable information for your practice such as:

Disease, illness and condition trends
Demographics
Patient health outcomes

While no human being could ever analyze thousands of journal articles to give a patient individualized health advice, AI could easily help doctors do this. This could allow you to personalize your care based on the best of what the research says and on an individual patient’s circumstances, past health history or other characteristics. You can eventually tailor treatments with the help of an AI assistant and reduce the likelihood something will be missed in the process of your own literature review or research.
This also means it could be easier to participate in important health research or even tailor your own in-house research using available health databases. If the data is there, the potential is enormous for the application of artificial intelligence in medical science.
Marketing and communications
Automated communications with patients and prospective new patients can improve your clinic’s ability to serve and provide information. AI allows you to set up chatbots on your website, for instance, to engage with online visitors and share important info about your practice. When you automate your marketing, it can help you focus on other things like caring for patients. At the same time, you’re still marketing at a high data-driven level.
In time, it’s likely other marketing and communications applications will become available. Right now, AI-powered email and chat marketing are two popular ways to streamline and improve marketing outreach. This creates great options for chiropractors.
Putting AI to work for your practice
Now may be the best time to start putting AI to work for you. If you like, start small. Find some voice-capture software to speed-up and auto-archive your patient notes. One great place to start is with your marketing — consider a basic chatbot app for your website to collect information and questions from potential new patients.

Their inevitable point is to interface those wires to a thought transmitter which tucks behind your ear like a portable hearing assistant..These threads identify and record the electrical signals in the cerebrum, and transmit this data outside the body. This can possibly make a scalable high-bandwidth mind-machine interface (BMI) framework, implying that it connects the cerebrum to an external device to shape a brain-machine interface..The objective is to utilize Neuralink to comprehend and treat various types of the cerebrum or spine-related disorders. For example, paralyzed people could utilize the implanted device to control telephones or computers..Anyway, Musk additionally imagines the implant as a method for improving your own brain, giving people the choice to accomplish a beneficial interaction with artificial intelligence (AI). This could, in the end, lead to an eventual fate of &quot;superhuman intelligence&quot;, as indicated by Musk..Musk and friends flaunted a smaller than usual, dedicated computer chip whose job it is to divert the electrical noise from neurons into crisp digital signals. The chip does just a single thing, like those utilized by Bitcoin diggers and does it utilizing as meager energy as possible, which is essential if it will sit under your skull. According to Andrew Hires, an assistant professor of biological sciences at the University of Southern California, one doesn't have to change batteries out in every two hours. Neuralink has taken a lot of cutting-edge stuff and set up it together in manners that academic groups have attempted to do. As yet missing from Neuralink's demo is a wireless transmitter, which different organizations have illustrated..Neuralink talked up slim, flexible, polymer wires that it needs to jab into people's brains through holes in their skulls. The flexible electrodes are like advancements being developed somewhere else (including by Chong Xie at the University of Texas, Austin)..Neuralink claims that it recorded from 1,000 or so neurons in a rodent. In any case, don't be excessively dazzled by the huge number. It isn't record-breaking, and may not be important to catch brain signals required for the applications Neuralink is taking a look at. Recording only 30 neurons in the motor cortex of a volunteer's cerebrum as they envision moving their arm is sufficient to enable them to control a computer cursor on a screen..The gadget being referred to, which is anonymous up until now, will see the tiny thread fitted with 3,000 electrodes which can screen the activity of 1,000 neurons..This implies the embedded gadget would probably target particular territories of the cerebrum, and said the device could dissect the neurons and using artificial intelligence (AI) would work out how to invigorate the patient. Details on how mind movement will be interpreted or how the brain would be simulated have not been discussed..Mr Musk stated: &quot;dislike all of a sudden we will have this fantastic neural lace and will take over individuals' brains. It will require some time.&quot;.Musk's Neuralink startup has likewise constructed a neurosurgical robot that is capable of embeddings six strings into the human brain every minute. Each thread is smaller than one-tenth of the size of a human hair and contains 192 electrodes..Every electrode group is encased inside a small implantable gadget that contains custom wireless chips, estimating four by four millimeters. The strings would be separately embedded into the cerebrum &quot;with micron accuracy&quot; by a tiny needle toward the end of the robot, which measures around 24 microns in diameter. This would almost certainly target explicit pieces of the brain and abstain from harming any veins..As of now, the operation would require drilling holes into the patient's skull to embed the threads. Later on, however, they want to utilize a laser shaft to puncture the skull with a progression of tiny holes, which wouldn't be felt by the patient..After some time, I figure we will presumably observe a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence,&quot; said Musk. &quot;It's for the most part about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your mind and the digital variant of yourself, especially yield..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
