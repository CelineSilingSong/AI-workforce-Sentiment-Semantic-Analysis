<em>An edited transcript of the interview appears below.</em>

<strong>AI for Business</strong><strong>: </strong>A lot is being written about artificial intelligence. What inspired you to write <em>Leadership by Algorithm</em>? What gap among existing books about AI were you trying to fill?

<strong>David</strong> <strong>De Cremer: </strong>AI has been around for quite some time. The term was coined in 1956 and inspired a “first wave” of research until the mid-1970s. But since the beginning of the 21st century more direct applications became clear and changed our attitude towards the “real” potential of AI. This shift was especially fueled by events where AI started to engage with world champions in chess and the Chinese game Go. Most of the attention went, and still goes to, the technology itself: that the technology acts in ways that seem to be intelligent, which is also a simple definition of artificial intelligence.

It seems intelligent in ways that humans are intelligent. I am not a computer scientist; my background is in behavioral economics. But I did notice that the integration between social sciences, humanity, and artificial intelligence was not getting as much attention as it should. Artificial intelligence is meant to create value for society that is populated by humans; the end users always must be humans. That means AI must act, think, read, and produce outcomes in a social context.

AI is particularly good at repetitive, routine tasks and thinking systematically and consistently. This already implies that the tasks and the jobs that are most likely to be taken over by AI are the hard skills, and not so much the soft skills. In a way, this observation corresponds with what is called Moravec’s paradox: What is easy for humans is difficult for AI, and what is difficult for humans seems rather easy for AI.

An important conclusion is then also that in the future developments of humans, training our soft skills will become even more important -- and not less as many may assume. I wanted to explain that because there are many signs today -- especially so since COVID-19 -- that we need and are required to adapt more to the new technologies. As such, that puts the use and influence of AI in our society in a dominant position. As we are becoming more aware, we are moving into a society where people are being told by algorithms what their taste is, and, without questioning it too much, most people comply easily. Given these circumstances, it does not seem to be a wild fantasy anymore that AI may be able to take a leadership position, which is why I wanted to write the book.
<blockquote>“We are moving into a society where people are being told by algorithms what their taste is, and, without questioning it too much, most people comply easily.”</blockquote>
<strong>AIB: </strong>Is it possible to develop AI in a way that makes technology more efficient without undermining humanity? Why does this risk exist? Can it be mitigated?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>I believe it is possible. This relates to the topic of the book as well. [It is important] that we have the right kind of leadership. The book is not only about whether AI will replace leaders; I also point out that humans have certain unique qualities that technology will never have. It is difficult to put a soul into a machine. If we could do that, we would also understand the secrets of life. I am not too optimistic that it will [become reality] in the next few decades, but we have an enormous responsibility. We are developing AI or a machine that can do things we would never have imagined years ago.

At the same time, because of our unique qualities of having and taking perspective, proactive thinking, and being able to take things into abstraction, it is up to us how we are going to use it. If you look at the leadership today, I do not see much consensus in the world. We are not paying enough attention to training our leaders – our business leaders, our political leaders, and our societal leaders. We need good leadership education. Training starts with our children. [It is about] how we train them to appreciate creativity, the ability to work together with others, take perspectives from each other, and learn a certain kind of responsibility that makes our society. So yes, we can use machines for good if we are clear about what our human identity is and the value we want to create for a humane society.

<strong>AIB: </strong>Algorithms are becoming an important part of how work is managed. What are the implications?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>An algorithm is a model that makes data intelligent, meaning it helps us to recognize the trends that are happening in the world around us, and that are captured by means of our data collections. When analyzed well, data can tell us how to deal with our environment in a better and more efficient manner. This is what I’m trying to do in the business school, by seeing how we can make our business leaders more tech savvy in understanding how, where, and why to use algorithms, automation, to have more efficient decision-making.

Many business leaders have problems making business cases for why they should use AI. They are struggling to make sense of what AI can bring to their companies. Today most of them are influenced by surveys showing that as a business you have to engage in AI adoption because everyone else is doing it. But how it can benefit your own unique company is often less well understood.

Every company has data that is unique to it. You must work with that in terms of [shaping] your strategy, and in terms of the value that your company can and wishes to create. For this to be achieved, you also have to understand the values that define your company and that make it different your competitors. We are not doing a good job training our business leaders to think like this. Rather than making them think that they should become coders themselves, they should focus on becoming a bit more tech savvy so they can pursue their business strategy -- in line with their values -- in an environment where technology is part of the business process.

This implies that our business leaders do understand what an algorithm exactly does, but also what its limits are, what the potential is, and especially so where in the decision-making chain of the company AI can be used to promote productivity and efficiency. To achieve this, we need leaders who are tech savvy enough to optimize their extensive knowledge on business processes to maximize efficiency for the company and for society. It is there that I see a weakness for many business leaders today.

Without a doubt, AI will become the new co-worker. It will be important for us to decide where in the loop of the business process do you automate, where is it possible to take humans out of the loop, and where do you definitely keep humans in the loop to make sure that automation and the use of AI doesn’t lead to a work culture where people feel that they are being supervised by a machine, or being treated like robots. We must be sensitive to these questions. Leaders build cultures, and in doing this they communicate and represent the values and norms the company uses to decide how work needs to be done to create business value.

<strong>AIB: </strong>Are algorithms replacing the human mind as machines replaced the body? Or are algorithms and machines amplifying the capabilities of the mind and body? Should humans worry that AI will render the mental abilities of humans obsolete or simply change them?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>That is one of the big philosophical questions. We can refer to Descartes here, [who discovered the] <a href=""https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/discovery-mind-body-problem/"">body and mind</a> [problem]. With the Industrial Revolution, we can say that the body was replaced by machine. Some people do believe that with artificial intelligence the mind will now be replaced. So, body and mind are basically taken over by machines.
<blockquote>“We can use machines for good if we are clear about what our human identity is and the value we want to create for a humane society.”</blockquote>
As I outlined in my book, there is more sophistication to that. We also know that the body and mind are connected. What connects them is the soul. And that soul is not a machine. The machine at this moment has no real grasp of what it means to understand its environment or how meaning can be inferred from it. Even more important in light of the idea of humanity and AI, a machine does not think about humans, or what it means to be a human. It does not care about humans. If you die today, AI does not worry about that.

So, AI does not have a connection to reality in terms of understanding semantics and deeply felt emotions. AI has no soul. That is essential for body and mind to function. We say that one plus one is three if you want to make a great team. But in this case if we say AI or machines replace the body and then replace the mind, we still have one plus one is two, but we do not have three, we don’t have the magic. Because of that, I do not believe AI is replacing our mind.

Secondly, the simple definition that I postulated earlier is that artificial intelligence represents behaviors, or decisions that are being made by a machine that seem intelligent. That definition is based on the idea that machine intelligence is able to imitate the intelligent behavior that humans show. But, that machines seem able to act in ways like humans does not mean that we are talking about the same kind of intelligence and existence.

When we look at machine learning, it is modeled after neural networks. But we also know, for example, that neuroscience still knows little, maybe not even 10%, of how the brain works. So, we cannot say that we know everything and put that in a machine and argue that it replicated the human mind completely.

The simplest example I always use is that a computer works in ones and zeroes, but people do not work in ones and zeroes. When we talk about ethics with humans, things are mostly never black or white, but rather gray. As humans we are able to make sense of that gray area, because we have developed an intuition, a moral compass in the way we grew up and were educated. As a result, we can make sense of ambiguity. Computers at the moment cannot do that. Interestingly, efforts are being made today to see whether we can train machines like we educate children. If that succeeds, then machines will come closer to dealing with ambiguity as we do.

<strong>AIB: </strong>What implications do these questions have for leadership? What role can leaders play in encouraging the design of better technology that is used in wiser rather than smarter ways?
<blockquote>“That machines seem able to act in ways like humans does not mean that we are talking about the same kind of intelligence and existence.”</blockquote>
<strong>De Cremer: </strong>I make a distinction between managers and leaders. When we talk about running an organization, you need both management and leadership. Management provides the foundation for companies to work in a stable and orderly manner. We have procedures so we can make things a little bit more predictable. Since the early 20th century, as companies grew in size, you had to manage companies and [avoid] chaos. Management is thus the opposite of chaos. It is about structuring and [bringing] order to chaos by employing metrics to assess goals and KPI’s are achieved in more or less predictable ways. In a way, management as we know it, is a status-quo maintaining system.

Leadership, however, is not focused on the status quo but rather deals with change and the responsibility to give direction to deal with the chaos that comes along with change. That is why it is important for leadership to be able to adapt, to be agile, because once things change, as a leader you are looked upon to [provide solutions]. That is where our abilities to be creative, to think in proactive ways, understand what value people want to see and to adapt to ensure that this kind of value is achieved when change sets in.

AI will be extremely applicable to management because management is consistent, it tries to focus on the status quo, and because of its repetitiveness it is in essence a pretty predictable activity … and this is basically also how an algorithm works. AI is already doing this kind of work by predicting the behavior of employees, whether they will leave the company, or whether they are still motivated to do their job. Many managerial decisions are where I see algorithms can play a big role. It starts as AI being an advisor, providing information, but then slowly moving into management jobs. I call this management by algorithm – MBA. Theoretically and from a practical point of view, this will happen, because AI as we know it today in organizations is good at working with stationary data sets. It, however, has a problem dealing with complexities. This is where AI, as we know it today, falls short on the leadership front.

Computer scientists working in robotics and with self-driving cars say the biggest challenge for robots is interacting with people, physical contact, and coordinating their movements with the execution of tasks. Basically, it is more difficult for robots to work within the context of teams than sending a robot to Mars. The reason for this is that the more complex the environment, the more likely it is that robots will make mistakes. As we are less tolerant to having robots inflict harm on humans, it thus becomes a dangerous activity to have autonomous robots and vehicles interacting with humans.

Leadership is about dealing with change. It is about making decisions that you know are valuable to humans. You need to understand what it means to be a human, that you can have human concerns, taking into account that you can be compassionate, and you can be humane. At the same time, you need to be able to imagine and be proactive, because your strategy in a changing situation may need to be adjusted to create the same value. You need to be able to make abstraction of this, and AI is not able to do this.

<strong>AIB: </strong>I am glad you brought up the question of compassion. Do you believe that algorithm-based leadership is capable of empathy, compassion, curiosity, or creativity?
<blockquote>“[Artificial intelligence] has a problem dealing with complexities. This is where AI, as we know it today, falls short on the leadership front.”</blockquote>
<strong>De Cremer: </strong>Startups and scientists are working on what we call “<a href=""https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2020/09/16/making-technology-more-human-with-emotion-ai/?mod=Deloitte_cmo_nwsrl"">affective AI</a>”. Can AI detect and feel emotions? Conceptually it is easy to understand. So, yes, AI will be able to detect emotions, as long as we have enough training data available. Of course, emotions are complex – also to humans – so, really understanding what emotions signify to the human experience, that’s something AI will not be able to do (at least in decades to come). As I said before, AI does not understand what it means to be human, so, taking the emotional intelligence perspective of what makes us human is clearly a limit for machines. That is also why we call it artificial intelligence. It is important to point out that we can also say that humans have an AI; I call that authentic intelligence.

At this moment AI does not have authentic intelligence. People believe that AI systems cannot have authentic emotions and an authentic sense of morality. It is impossible because they do not have the empathic and existential qualities people are equipped with. Also, I am not too sure that algorithms achieve authentic intelligence easily given the fact that they do not have a soul. So, if we cannot infuse them with a common sense that corresponds to the common sense of humans, which can make sense of gray zones and ambiguity, I don’t think they can develop a real sense of empathy, which is authentic and genuine.

What they can learn -- and that is because of the imitation principle -- is what we call surface-level emotions. They will be able to respond, they will scan your face, they will listen to the tone of your voice, and they will be able to identify categories of emotions and respond to it in ways that humans usually respond to. That is a surface-level understanding of the emotions that humans express. And I do believe that this ability will help machines to be efficient in most interactions with humans.

Why will it work? Because as humans we are very attuned to the ability of our interaction partners to respond to our emotions. So almost immediately and unconsciously, when someone pays attention to us, we reciprocate. Recognizing surface-level emotions would already do the trick. The deeper-level emotions correspond with what I call authentic intelligence, which is genuine, and an understanding of those type of emotions is what is needed to develop friendships and long-term connections. AI as we know it today is not even close to such an ability.

With respect to creativity, it is a similar story. Creativity means bringing forward a new idea, something that is new and meaningful to people. It solves a problem that is useful, and it makes sense to people. AI can play a role there, especially in identifying something new. Algorithms are much faster than humans in connecting information because they can scan, analyze, and observe trends in data so much faster than we do. So, in the first stage of creativity, yes, AI can bring things we know together to create a new combination so much faster and better than humans. But, humans will be needed to assess whether the new combination makes sense to solve problems humans want to solve. Creative ideas gain in value when they become meaningful to people and therefore human supervision as the final step in the creativity process will be needed.
<blockquote>“One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it.”</blockquote>
Let me illustrate this point with the following example: Experiments have been conducted where AI was given several ingredients to make pizzas, and some pizzas turned out to be attractive to humans, but other pizzas ended up being products that humans were unlikely to eat, like pineapple with marmite. Marmite is popular in the U.K. and according to the commercials, people love it or hate it, so, it’s a difficult ingredient. AI, however, does not think about whether humans will like such products or find them useful – it just identifies new combinations. So, the human will always be needed to determine whether such ideas will at the end of the day be useful and regarded as a meaningful product.

<strong>AIB: </strong>What are the limits to management by algorithm?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>When we look at it from the narrow point of view of management, there are no limits. I believe that AI will be able to do almost any managerial task in the future. That is because of the way we define management as being focused on the idea of creating stability, order, consistency, predictability, by means of using metrics (e.g., KPIs).

<strong>AIB: </strong>How can we move towards a future where algorithms may not lead but still be at the service of humanity?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>First, all managers and leaders will have to understand what AI is. They must understand AI’s potential and its limits -- where humans must jump in and take responsibility. Humanity is important. We have to make sure that people not only look at technology from a utility perspective, where it can make a company run more efficiently because it reduces cost by not having to hire too many employees or not training people anymore to do certain tasks.

I would like to see a society where people become much more reflective. The job of the future may well be [that of] a philosopher…one who understands technology, what it means to our human identity, and what it means to the kind of society we would like to see. AI also makes us think about who we are as a species. What do we really want to achieve? Once we make AI a coworker, once we make AI a kind of citizen of our societies, I am sure the awareness of the idea “Us versus them” will become directive in the debates and discussions of the kind of institutes, organizations and society we would like to see. I called this awareness the “new diversity” in my book. Humans versus non-humans, or machines: It makes us think also about who we are, and we need that to determine what kind of value we want to create. That value will determine how we are going to use our technology.

One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it. For example, we all know that AI, in order to learn, needs data. But is data widely available to everyone or only a select few? Well, if we look at the usual suspects -- Amazon, Facebook, Apple and so forth -- we see that they own most of the data. They applied a business model where the customer became the product itself. Our data are valuable to them. As a result, these companies can run more sophisticated experiments, which are needed to improve our AI – which means that technology is also in the hands of a few. Democracy of data does not exist today. Given the fact that one important future direction in AI research is to make AI more powerful in terms of processing and predicting, obviously a certain fear exists that if we do not manage AI well, and we don’t think about it in terms of [whether] it is good for society as a whole, we may run into risks. Our future must be one where everyone can be tech-savvy but not one that eliminates our concerns and reflections on human identity. That is the kind of education I would like to see.",N/A,N/A,"
The increasing attention being paid to artificial intelligence raises important questions about its integration with social sciences and humanity, according to David De Cremer, founder and director of the Centre on AI Technology for Humankind at the National University of Singapore Business School. He is the author of the recent book, Leadership by Algorithm: Who Leads and Who Follows in the AI Era?
While AI today is good at repetitive tasks and can replace many managerial functions, it could over time acquire the “general intelligence” that humans have, he said in a recent interview with AI for Business (AIB), a new initiative at Analytics at Wharton. Headed by Wharton operations, information and decisions professor Kartik Hosanagar, AIB is a research initiative that focuses on helping students expand their knowledge and application of machine learning and understand the business and societal implications of AI. 
According to De Cremer, AI will never have “a soul” and it cannot replace human leadership qualities that let people be creative and have different perspectives. Leadership is required to guide the development and applications of AI in ways that best serve the needs of humans. “The job of the future may well be [that of] a philosopher who understands technology, what it means to our human identity, and what it means for the kind of society we would like to see,” he noted.

Every company has data that is unique to it. You must work with that in terms of [shaping] your strategy, and in terms of the value that your company can and wishes to create. For this to be achieved, you also have to understand the values that define your company and that make it different your competitors. We are not doing a good job training our business leaders to think like this. Rather than making them think that they should become coders themselves, they should focus on becoming a bit more tech savvy so they can pursue their business strategy — in line with their values — in an environment where technology is part of the business process.
This implies that our business leaders do understand what an algorithm exactly does, but also what its limits are, what the potential is, and especially so where in the decision-making chain of the company AI can be used to promote productivity and efficiency. To achieve this, we need leaders who are tech savvy enough to optimize their extensive knowledge on business processes to maximize efficiency for the company and for society. It is there that I see a weakness for many business leaders today.
Without a doubt, AI will become the new co-worker. It will be important for us to decide where in the loop of the business process do you automate, where is it possible to take humans out of the loop, and where do you definitely keep humans in the loop to make sure that automation and the use of AI doesn’t lead to a work culture where people feel that they are being supervised by a machine, or being treated like robots. We must be sensitive to these questions. Leaders build cultures, and in doing this they communicate and represent the values and norms the company uses to decide how work needs to be done to create business value.
AIB: Are algorithms replacing the human mind as machines replaced the body? Or are algorithms and machines amplifying the capabilities of the mind and body? Should humans worry that AI will render the mental abilities of humans obsolete or simply change them?
De Cremer: That is one of the big philosophical questions. We can refer to Descartes here, [who discovered the] body and mind [problem]. With the Industrial Revolution, we can say that the body was replaced by machine. Some people do believe that with artificial intelligence the mind will now be replaced. So, body and mind are basically taken over by machines.
“We can use machines for good if we are clear about what our human identity is and the value we want to create for a humane society.”
As I outlined in my book, there is more sophistication to that. We also know that the body and mind are connected. What connects them is the soul. And that soul is not a machine. The machine at this moment has no real grasp of what it means to understand its environment or how meaning can be inferred from it. Even more important in light of the idea of humanity and AI, a machine does not think about humans, or what it means to be a human. It does not care about humans. If you die today, AI does not worry about that.
So, AI does not have a connection to reality in terms of understanding semantics and deeply felt emotions. AI has no soul. That is essential for body and mind to function. We say that one plus one is three if you want to make a great team. But in this case if we say AI or machines replace the body and then replace the mind, we still have one plus one is two, but we do not have three, we don’t have the magic. Because of that, I do not believe AI is replacing our mind.
Secondly, the simple definition that I postulated earlier is that artificial intelligence represents behaviors, or decisions that are being made by a machine that seem intelligent. That definition is based on the idea that machine intelligence is able to imitate the intelligent behavior that humans show. But, that machines seem able to act in ways like humans does not mean that we are talking about the same kind of intelligence and existence.
When we look at machine learning, it is modeled after neural networks. But we also know, for example, that neuroscience still knows little, maybe not even 10%, of how the brain works. So, we cannot say that we know everything and put that in a machine and argue that it replicated the human mind completely.
The simplest example I always use is that a computer works in ones and zeroes, but people do not work in ones and zeroes. When we talk about ethics with humans, things are mostly never black or white, but rather gray. As humans we are able to make sense of that gray area, because we have developed an intuition, a moral compass in the way we grew up and were educated. As a result, we can make sense of ambiguity. Computers at the moment cannot do that. Interestingly, efforts are being made today to see whether we can train machines like we educate children. If that succeeds, then machines will come closer to dealing with ambiguity as we do.
AIB: What implications do these questions have for leadership? What role can leaders play in encouraging the design of better technology that is used in wiser rather than smarter ways?
“That machines seem able to act in ways like humans does not mean that we are talking about the same kind of intelligence and existence.”
De Cremer: I make a distinction between managers and leaders. When we talk about running an organization, you need both management and leadership. Management provides the foundation for companies to work in a stable and orderly manner. We have procedures so we can make things a little bit more predictable. Since the early 20th century, as companies grew in size, you had to manage companies and [avoid] chaos. Management is thus the opposite of chaos. It is about structuring and [bringing] order to chaos by employing metrics to assess goals and KPI’s are achieved in more or less predictable ways. In a way, management as we know it, is a status-quo maintaining system.
Leadership, however, is not focused on the status quo but rather deals with change and the responsibility to give direction to deal with the chaos that comes along with change. That is why it is important for leadership to be able to adapt, to be agile, because once things change, as a leader you are looked upon to [provide solutions]. That is where our abilities to be creative, to think in proactive ways, understand what value people want to see and to adapt to ensure that this kind of value is achieved when change sets in.
AI will be extremely applicable to management because management is consistent, it tries to focus on the status quo, and because of its repetitiveness it is in essence a pretty predictable activity … and this is basically also how an algorithm works. AI is already doing this kind of work by predicting the behavior of employees, whether they will leave the company, or whether they are still motivated to do their job. Many managerial decisions are where I see algorithms can play a big role. It starts as AI being an advisor, providing information, but then slowly moving into management jobs. I call this management by algorithm – MBA. Theoretically and from a practical point of view, this will happen, because AI as we know it today in organizations is good at working with stationary data sets. It, however, has a problem dealing with complexities. This is where AI, as we know it today, falls short on the leadership front.
Computer scientists working in robotics and with self-driving cars say the biggest challenge for robots is interacting with people, physical contact, and coordinating their movements with the execution of tasks. Basically, it is more difficult for robots to work within the context of teams than sending a robot to Mars. The reason for this is that the more complex the environment, the more likely it is that robots will make mistakes. As we are less tolerant to having robots inflict harm on humans, it thus becomes a dangerous activity to have autonomous robots and vehicles interacting with humans.
Leadership is about dealing with change. It is about making decisions that you know are valuable to humans. You need to understand what it means to be a human, that you can have human concerns, taking into account that you can be compassionate, and you can be humane. At the same time, you need to be able to imagine and be proactive, because your strategy in a changing situation may need to be adjusted to create the same value. You need to be able to make abstraction of this, and AI is not able to do this.
AIB: I am glad you brought up the question of compassion. Do you believe that algorithm-based leadership is capable of empathy, compassion, curiosity, or creativity?
“[Artificial intelligence] has a problem dealing with complexities. This is where AI, as we know it today, falls short on the leadership front.”
De Cremer: Startups and scientists are working on what we call “affective AI”. Can AI detect and feel emotions? Conceptually it is easy to understand. So, yes, AI will be able to detect emotions, as long as we have enough training data available. Of course, emotions are complex – also to humans – so, really understanding what emotions signify to the human experience, that’s something AI will not be able to do (at least in decades to come). As I said before, AI does not understand what it means to be human, so, taking the emotional intelligence perspective of what makes us human is clearly a limit for machines. That is also why we call it artificial intelligence. It is important to point out that we can also say that humans have an AI; I call that authentic intelligence.
At this moment AI does not have authentic intelligence. People believe that AI systems cannot have authentic emotions and an authentic sense of morality. It is impossible because they do not have the empathic and existential qualities people are equipped with. Also, I am not too sure that algorithms achieve authentic intelligence easily given the fact that they do not have a soul. So, if we cannot infuse them with a common sense that corresponds to the common sense of humans, which can make sense of gray zones and ambiguity, I don’t think they can develop a real sense of empathy, which is authentic and genuine.
What they can learn — and that is because of the imitation principle — is what we call surface-level emotions. They will be able to respond, they will scan your face, they will listen to the tone of your voice, and they will be able to identify categories of emotions and respond to it in ways that humans usually respond to. That is a surface-level understanding of the emotions that humans express. And I do believe that this ability will help machines to be efficient in most interactions with humans.
Why will it work? Because as humans we are very attuned to the ability of our interaction partners to respond to our emotions. So almost immediately and unconsciously, when someone pays attention to us, we reciprocate. Recognizing surface-level emotions would already do the trick. The deeper-level emotions correspond with what I call authentic intelligence, which is genuine, and an understanding of those type of emotions is what is needed to develop friendships and long-term connections. AI as we know it today is not even close to such an ability.
With respect to creativity, it is a similar story. Creativity means bringing forward a new idea, something that is new and meaningful to people. It solves a problem that is useful, and it makes sense to people. AI can play a role there, especially in identifying something new. Algorithms are much faster than humans in connecting information because they can scan, analyze, and observe trends in data so much faster than we do. So, in the first stage of creativity, yes, AI can bring things we know together to create a new combination so much faster and better than humans. But, humans will be needed to assess whether the new combination makes sense to solve problems humans want to solve. Creative ideas gain in value when they become meaningful to people and therefore human supervision as the final step in the creativity process will be needed.
“One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it.”
Let me illustrate this point with the following example: Experiments have been conducted where AI was given several ingredients to make pizzas, and some pizzas turned out to be attractive to humans, but other pizzas ended up being products that humans were unlikely to eat, like pineapple with marmite. Marmite is popular in the U.K. and according to the commercials, people love it or hate it, so, it’s a difficult ingredient. AI, however, does not think about whether humans will like such products or find them useful – it just identifies new combinations. So, the human will always be needed to determine whether such ideas will at the end of the day be useful and regarded as a meaningful product.
AIB: What are the limits to management by algorithm?
De Cremer: When we look at it from the narrow point of view of management, there are no limits. I believe that AI will be able to do almost any managerial task in the future. That is because of the way we define management as being focused on the idea of creating stability, order, consistency, predictability, by means of using metrics (e.g., KPIs).
AIB: How can we move towards a future where algorithms may not lead but still be at the service of humanity?
De Cremer: First, all managers and leaders will have to understand what AI is. They must understand AI’s potential and its limits — where humans must jump in and take responsibility. Humanity is important. We have to make sure that people not only look at technology from a utility perspective, where it can make a company run more efficiently because it reduces cost by not having to hire too many employees or not training people anymore to do certain tasks.
I would like to see a society where people become much more reflective. The job of the future may well be [that of] a philosopher…one who understands technology, what it means to our human identity, and what it means to the kind of society we would like to see. AI also makes us think about who we are as a species. What do we really want to achieve? Once we make AI a coworker, once we make AI a kind of citizen of our societies, I am sure the awareness of the idea “Us versus them” will become directive in the debates and discussions of the kind of institutes, organizations and society we would like to see. I called this awareness the “new diversity” in my book. Humans versus non-humans, or machines: It makes us think also about who we are, and we need that to determine what kind of value we want to create. That value will determine how we are going to use our technology.
One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it. For example, we all know that AI, in order to learn, needs data. But is data widely available to everyone or only a select few? Well, if we look at the usual suspects — Amazon, Facebook, Apple and so forth — we see that they own most of the data. They applied a business model where the customer became the product itself. Our data are valuable to them. As a result, these companies can run more sophisticated experiments, which are needed to improve our AI – which means that technology is also in the hands of a few. Democracy of data does not exist today. Given the fact that one important future direction in AI research is to make AI more powerful in terms of processing and predicting, obviously a certain fear exists that if we do not manage AI well, and we don’t think about it in terms of [whether] it is good for society as a whole, we may run into risks. Our future must be one where everyone can be tech-savvy but not one that eliminates our concerns and reflections on human identity. That is the kind of education I would like to see.

New Pathway Could Advance Artificial Intelligence in Radiology

Combining formal instruction with practical problem-solving for fourth-year residents could accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in radiology, according to a report published in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence.







Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated their potential to improve medical imaging, from enhancing the quality of CT scans to detecting breast cancer.
However, formal training in AI and machine learning is still rare in the medical imaging field: The report noted that organized AI and machine learning curricula are limited to a few institutions and training opportunities are lacking.
To better prepare radiology residents to use AI and machine learning, and to advance the use of these technologies in medical imaging, three senior radiology residents at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) recently developed a data science pathway to provide a well-rounded introductory experience to AI and machine learning for fourth-year residents.
The pathway incorporates formal instruction and practical problem-solving into residents’ curriculum, allowing them to collaborate with data scientists.
""Across the nation there are a number of radiology residency programs that are trying to figure out how to integrate AI into their training,"" said the paper's co-lead author Walter F. Wiggins, MD, PhD.
""We thought that perhaps our experience would help other programs figure out ways to integrate this type of training into either their elective pathways or their more general residency curriculum.""
The pathway provides residents with an immersion into AI and machine learning through a flexible schedule of educational, experimental, and research activities at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS).
Through the pathway, residents were exposed to all aspects of AI and machine learning application development, such as data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Residents contributed to model and tool development at different stages, and their work during the pilot led to 12 accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings.
Feedback from the pilot project led to the establishment of a formal AI and machine learning curriculum for future residents.
""Radiologists have always had to manage, analyze and process data in order to be able to do their work,"" Wiggins said. ""We already have the underlying skill sets and infrastructure that we can tap into to allow residents with an interest in AI and ML to really develop and become leaders in applying these skills clinically.""
The pathway provides radiology residents with the opportunity to work directly with data scientists to better understand how they approach image analysis issues with machine learning tools.
This partnership enabled the data scientists to better understand how radiologists approach a radiology problem in a clinical setting. The data scientists could be easily integrated into clinical practice.
""An important component of a curriculum like this is to learn the language the data scientists speak and teach them a little bit about the language that we as radiologists speak so that we can have better, more effective collaborations. Going through that process over several different projects was where I think I gained the best experience throughout all of this,"" said Wiggins.
""I also hope that people from other institutions might read this manuscript and find something useful for integrating into their residency curricula or for developing specialized pathways for informatics and/or data science.”
The team stated that the framework for the pathway could be easily implemented in other organizations, which could help contribute to the widespread use of AI and machine learning in radiology.
“The key factors that contributed to the success of the program that could be extrapolated to any other training institution were motivated learners, dedicated mentors, and integration into a multidisciplinary AI-ML research environment,” researchers concluded.
“It is our belief that each of these facets of the data science pathway experience will prepare residents to serve as leaders in multidisciplinary clinical data science an in radiology as a whole.”

Before Rihanna introduced her groundbreaking Fenty Beauty line with 40 shades of foundation in 2017, pushing competing brands to diversify their palettes or face public backlash, people with darker skin had few accessible options that matched and enhanced their complexion.
But what Rihanna has done to address the issue of foundation shade selection, Lui is now hoping to do for colour matching – finding the perfect shade of makeup is usually left to guesswork or performed by associates on the beauty department floor. With her computer vision tool, Nudemeter, users simply upload a selfie and complete a short quiz, and an algorithm suggests the product that best matches their skin tone.
Lui first conceived of the idea in 2016, during her final year at Harvard Business School, as a tool to empower dark-skinned shoppers to make purchases that helped boost their confidence. “I just went back to being a Black woman growing up in Topeka, Kansas, and just not feeling beautiful, not feeling like the standard of intelligence, not feeling good enough,” she explains. “Beauty is undervalued as a source of power in the world.”
But developing Nudemeter was no easy undertaking. The world of facial recognition technology is as guilty of light-skin bias as the beauty industry. A 2018 MIT study, led by Algorithmic Justice League founder Joy Buolamwini, found that commercial artificial intelligence systems had error rates as high as 35 per cent when identifying the features of darker-skinned women, compared to less than one per cent for lighter-skinned men – a discrepancy attributed to datasets “overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects.”
To avoid this problem, Lui had to train her algorithm with images that more accurately represented the skin-colour spectrum, from the palest whites to the darkest browns. To this end, she issued call outs encouraging volunteers of all skin tones to submit photos of themselves to aid in her mission to “change the standard of beauty to match the full range of diversity in human skin.” Once she had a dataset in place, she reached out to Michael Brown and Mahmoud Afifi at York University in Toronto, who specialise in color analysis and digital image processing, to make sure the algorithm could deduce the user’s true skin tone, regardless of their device or the conditions in which their photo was taken.
“[Our phones] are really intended to create beautiful images, not images with color accurate measurements… which makes the challenge that I'm working on that much more difficult,” Lui says. “It's all about using AI to predict the color of the real scene that is depicted in the image, and not actually measuring the color from the pixels.”
The potential for this technology hasn’t gone unnoticed. In 2018, beauty behemoth Coty, whose brands include Rimmel, Max Factor and Kylie Cosmetics, awarded Nudemeter the grand prize for their Digital Accelerator Start-Up Program, and helped Lui refine and stress test her algorithm. Last year, Spktrm Beauty, an independent brand targeting shoppers with darker skin, became the first to utilise Nudemeter on its website, and in May, hosiery company Nude Barre introduced the app to help shoppers pick out the right tights for them.
Looking to the future, Lui hopes to see further growth on the colour-matching side, but also sees potential for her technology beyond that. “I think there's power in using it for opportunities like virtual makeup try-on, or virtual glasses try-on, or even improving Instagram filters,” she says. “It's about feeling seen, feeling beautiful and having fun.”
She also envisions someday sharing her dataset (which is proprietary) with other companies attempting to create more inclusive AI technologies and combat existing biases. But in the meantime, her priority is refining and challenging the Nudemeter algorithm to be as inclusive as possible.
“I'm really proud of how well my technology can measure the skin tones, undertones and differences of dark-skinned women… But how is the technology reading the faces of people with vitiligo? What about people who are bald and have hair loss? What about people who are over 70 years old and might have a lot of wrinkles?” she says. “This work of creating inclusive and representative technology is never done.”

																Is Artificial Intelligence Ruining Photography or Are You Close Minded?							





Pye Jirsa,
                                    
                                                                            4 years ago                                            






Is artificial intelligence ruining photography or are you just a smidgen close-minded? I wanted to share my two cents on this matter because it’s a conversation I find myself having too often given the current trend of software and cameras. A special thank you to Skylum Software for sponsoring this video and allowing us to showcase the benefits of AI photo editing in our previous tutorials.



So here is the main question I see asked the most: “Is artificial intelligence ruining the process and the art behind photography or is there a place for this in the workflow?“. I thought the best way to answer this was to separate the conversation into different groups of people or schools of thought, but first, I would hate for you guys to have to wait until the end of a video just to figure out someone’s opinion on something, so here’s my opinion: NO, A.I. is not ruining photography. Now that you know my answer let’s work backward to see how I arrived at that stance.
Where is Photography Going & How Did We Get Here?
Newest SLR Lounge Premium Course: Creative Photography 101 (all images made with an iPhone 11 Pro Max)
Before we dive into DSLR’s or mirrorless cameras, let’s talk about the camera that almost every individual owns: smartphone cameras. They have incredibly sophisticated software systems and what’s known as computational photography built into them so much so that they can simulate depth of field, allow you to dial in manual exposure, capture RAW photos, and offer you a variety of lens choices. We even made an entire course dedicated to iphoneography called Creative Photography 101 to help smartphone owners become better photographers. The way that I see photography going is your towards the development of better tech for phone cameras. This is based purely on facts and stats of how many people use smartphone cameras and how that camera tech has developed since its fruition to become as robust as it is today.
A.I. Based Software
Software like Skylum Software, which we’ve shown in the past, allows you to easily swap out skies using A.I. and how you can batch retouch faces in order to speed up your editing workflow. We designed Visual Flow lighting condition-based presets to expedite the editing process in Lightroom to allow users to apply a preset based on the lighting in the scene. The next project that we’re working on is with Canon to design a piece of A.I. that detects the lighting conditions when you load the images onto your computer.
Four Schools of Thought
I can easily amend my previous ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ by changing my point of view and perspective on photography. To debate this, let’s create four different types of people that have responses to this question:

The Purist
The Professional
The Enthusiast
The End User

The Purist
 Yes, A.I. definitely ruins photography for those that have an obsession with the art and science of photography. This person finds their enjoyment and passion in the artistic process. They’re in this for the craft of being able to take something from their mind and translate it through the camera. When the transition from digital to film happened, we saw a bunch of naysayers and purist photographers say that the art of photography was being tarnished with the digital age.  Let’s use coffee as an example: there is a person that will spend 30 minutes grinding coffee beans by hand, placing the perfect filter, warming the water just right, pour and separate it, and then consume the coffee. As the coffee purist, your enjoyment comes from primarily the ritual the process of creating that cup of coffee. When this purist tastes instant coffee, they have an undeniable level of respect for this process and therefore cherish it and hold it to a higher regard.
I love my purist friends because they help me to celebrate the craft in a way that sometimes I forget to see myself so it’s a wonderful thing. The danger lies in that outlook lies in trying to decide for the entire industry if photography as an art form is subjective or if it’s the process of journalism. I want to use Ansel Adams as an example because I guarantee that if there was an easier way to manipulate his photographs in post-production, he would have done it in a heartbeat. As soon as you bring a camera up to your eye and decided on your intended composition, that is already a fictitious representation of reality. So where does the purist draw the line and at what point does the process of photography evolve with the times?
The Professional
For the professional, artificial intelligence and computational photography, from the point of capture all the way through to the point of editing, serves as enhancements to their workflow. Let’s take it back to the coffee example: you enjoy making that pour over cup of coffee for you and maybe a couple close friends and love the process. Let’s say you opened a coffee shop and it then becomes your job to serve 200 people using your pour-over technique. I would venture to bet that you’re very much going to lose your interest and entire passion for the ritual. You’ll need to start figuring out how to speed up the process without compromising the quality of the product. Now, back to photography: there is nothing interesting or fun about replacing a hundred different skies. For professional wedding, event, and portrait photographers you’re typically delivering 50-1000+ images and there’s nothing enjoyable about repeating the exact same step over and over, Monday through Friday, from one client to the next. If I can use Luminar’s A.I. to batch retouch my portraits, I’m a happy working professional that now has time to do things I enjoy rather than slave away editing photos. You’re going to look at these enhancements as just being quality of life improvements and you’re going to have a hard time seeing the purist mentality.
The Enthusiast
These are the people that enjoy taking pictures but don’t necessarily know or study photography. They may own a phone that might be their primary point of capture, they might be using a dedicated camera. So does A.I. ruin for them? Nope, it in fact provides a resounding improvement across the board because it manages to do the hardest parts of photography for them. Computational photography has enabled people that don’t understand anything about photography to not only appreciate photography but take semi-decent photographs with just their phones. Oftentimes, it’s from that process that they develop a passion for photography and they step into the entire process as an art form. It’s the accessibility that pulls them into the craft. Let’s move away from the coffee example and switch over to something I love comparing photography to – cars.  Do self-driving cars ruin driving for driving enthusiasts? I’ve spent much of my time on a track in a dedicated race car and now I want a Tesla because it drives itself. In my day-to-day life, I don’t want to deal with the hassle of driving and therefore a self-driving car that takes our tediousness of driving but still allows me to enjoy it when I want because the quality of the product/experience is a major win to me. A.I. computational photography can make the craft more enjoyable from day to day and still allows you to choose when you want to hone your craft or utilize your own judgment to create photos.
The End Consumer
These people don’t care at all about the art of photography, the process, your experience as a professional, the years of schooling, none of it.  Whether it’s a client, a person browsing Instagram, a troll on Facebook – they look at an image and they base its merits on the story that it’s telling, how visually appealing it is, and then they move on with their lives. All these people care about is the end result and what the image evokes. Obviously, this is on the complete opposite side of the spectrum from the purist, who spends hours fine-tuning their art and dissecting photographs to understand them. A.I. to the end consumer doesn’t ruin photography at all because that’s not at all what they are focusing on.
Conclusion… So Does A.I. Ruin Photography or Not?
I still stand by my answer that A.I. doesn’t ruin photography. For all the people that appreciate it, it’s a massive quality of life improvement. Not having to deal with all the parts in the process that are not enjoyable when you have to do them repeatedly over and over this is a huge factor for many professionals to consider. For the people that enjoy photography as just a pure process, guess what, you can still define exactly what that process is to you and ignore all those tools out there. I do think, from the standpoint of competitions and awards, it’s worthwhile defining what’s actually permissible in terms of the submitted images so if the competition is journalism. A.I. and computational photography don’t take away from your vision, they make it easier to achieve it. What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments below!

The AI Advantage explores which which businesses are leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and what works and what doesn’t in the field.
This article is part of our series that explore the business of artificial intelligence
The news about artificial intelligence is mostly dominated by sensational stories such as the ominous threat of deepfakes, deep learning algorithms that create fake blogs, AI bots that create their own language, and generative adversarial networks that create realistic portraits of non-existent people.
But the practical use of AI algorithms is much farther behind than the hype caused by the media. From peer-reviewed breakthrough research presented at mainstream AI conferences to PR-style videos created by large tech companies and well-funded research labs, only a trickle of the innovation we see in the field makes it into real business processes and applications.
And the organizations that are putting AI to good use are those who understand the powers and limits of today’s technology and master the challenges of integrating it into their processes and solutions.
“AI does offer a lot of business value, but much of that value isn’t terribly sexy or visible. Products and processes will be made somewhat better and easier to use. Decisions will be better informed. We’ll continue — and perhaps even accelerate a bit — the amazing progress that we’ve seen over the last couple of decades in data and analytics. But as all of the early adopters have discovered, it’s still difficult to create systems that think and communicate like humans — even in narrow domains,” academic and business author Thomas H. Davenport writes in his book The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work.
The book explores the mundane-but-practical side of artificial intelligence that is making a real difference at startups and large organizations. In it, Davenport discusses which organizations and sectors are making the best use of AI, what are the challenges business leaders and decision-makers face in adopting AI technologies, and how to develop a successful AI adoption strategy.
Following are some key insights from The AI Advantage, complemented by some exclusive comments and observations Davenport shared with TechTalks in October.

Hesitation in the adoption of AI technologies
While there’s an impression that AI is seeping into every aspect of life and business (and it eventually will), for the moment, a lot of organizations are on the fence. Albeit interested, many business leaders are loath to invest in a technology that entails a lot of risk.
“Almost every survey suggests that a high degree of enthusiasm about AI exists, but that it’s still early days in terms of broad corporate application,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage, which is largely based on interviews and examination of AI adoption strategies and outcomes at different firms.
The AI Advantage by Thomas H. Davenport
The AI Advantage was written in 2018. Since then and a lot of innovation has happened in the field since then, Davenport stresses that we are still in the early days in terms of production applications.
“A lot of companies did small experiments or pilots, but didn’t fully implement them. I think that companies are realizing that AI will be transformative over the long haul, but only moderately beneficial over the short run,” Davenport said in written comments to TechTalks.
The covid-19 pandemic has also highlighted some of the challenges of AI technologies and has forced companies to reconsider their AI adoption strategies.
“I think the COVID economy has meant that companies are re-prioritizing their applications and emphasizing those that have relatively short payback,” Davenport says, adding that some surveys he has worked on suggest an increased preference in buying AI solutions instead of building them in-house, which may be “a factor of COVID-related conservativism.”
AI adoption limited to tech startups and large companies
Given the barriers and risks involved in the integration of AI technologies, their adoption is currently limited to tech startups and large companies.
“Startups build their businesses around new technologies. Large enterprises are typically next in line; they have the technological sophistication to make informed investments in new technologies, and can hire the people to build and implement new solutions,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage.
Startups are not bound by established business processes and customers they need to keep satisfied. They don’t have liabilities and commitments that slow them down. They build for the future and raise funding for their ideas and innovations. The founding team already has the required AI talent to build the intended solution. AI is a core component of their business proposition and is integrated into their products from the get-go, therefore they don’t need to worry about making possibly breaking changes to an already working system. Although creating an AI product has many other challenges, startups at least have the fuel and gear to start the journey.
Large tech companies, on the other hand, have the financial resources and the flexibility to launch and manage AI pilot project on the side of their main business. They can create divisions that operate independently and manage their own business models, tailored for the dynamics of new markets created by artificial intelligence innovations. They can hire expensive AI talent and acquire startups that are developing promising technology. And as their proof-of-concept projects meet success, they integrate them into their main products.
More importantly, large companies have a lot customer data, a vital requirement for machine learning algorithms.

Small and medium businesses find themselves in an uncomfortable position. They don’t have the flexibility of startups or the extensive resources of big companies. They are bound to the demands of their current customers and dynamics of the markets they are competing in. They don’t have large data stores and the financial means to acquire AI talent and launch in-house moonshot projects.
And perhaps a key factor that is lacking in small to medium firms from an AI standpoint, Davenport points out in The AI Advantage, is awareness and understanding of what is possible. “Big firms have people whose job it is to look out for promising new technologies and inject them into the organization; small firms usually don’t,” he writes.
“I still see that divide being present. I’m not sure it will change much until traditional software vendors incorporate more AI capabilities into their offerings for SMBs. Then it will be an easy adoption,” Davenport said in his comments to TechTalks. “Before that, I don’t think that most SMBs have the spare time and energy to experiment that large firms do, and they don’t have the pressure to innovate that startups do.”
This does not mean SMBs are entirely deprived of AI innovation. There are established platforms that allow businesses to integrated AI technologies into their processes without much technical effort. One interesting example is natural language processing, which is still one of the most challenging subfields of AI and an active area of research. But while AI researchers continue to advance NLP with new deep learning models, the field has also seen the development of tools such as DialogFlow, which can help you create chatbots for your business and integrate them in your website and social media accounts without in an intuitive way. While DialogFlow is not at the cutting edge of NLP, it is accessible to anyone who can break down interactions with customers into distinct steps.
“Overall, it’s important for anyone implementing cognitive technologies to be aware that they are still somewhat immature. Progress is being made quickly in the current environment, but if your application is on the frontier of that progress you may encounter substantial technical challenges. Before you start with a particular project you may want to assess just how close to the frontier you are likely to come,” Davenport warns in The AI Advantage.
How to integrate AI into your organization’s process

Even when you’re a large company in the right market position, AI adoption is still fraught with perils. “It’s easy to make mistakes if you don’t understand the tradeoffs behind each technology,” Davenport writes. “Understanding these technologies and tradeoffs will inform decisions about which might best address specific needs, which vendors to work with, and how quickly a system of a given type can be implemented.”
The AI Advantage provides some key guidelines that can help companies develop a smooth integration strategy. Here are some of my favorite takeaways:
If your AI integration plan involves machine learning, you’ll need the help of talented data scientists to analytics teams to steer the project in the right direction.Don’t expect leaps: “In time, cognitive technologies will transform how companies do business. Today, however, it’s wiser to take incremental steps with the currently available technology while planning for transformational change in the not-too-distant future,” Davenport writes.Plan for redesigning your business processes based on cooperation between AI systems and human operators. “Organizations should think through how work will be done with a given new application, focusing specifically on the division of labor between humans and the AI… Systematic design activity is necessary to determine how humans and machines will augment each other’s strengths and compensate for their weaknesses,” Davenport writes.No matter how exciting a technology is, if it doesn’t provide business value, avoid it. “Cognitive technology may not result in savings from large layoffs anytime soon, but it does need to provide some business value,” Davenport writes.
The AI Advantage is filled with case studies and examples of successful and failed attempts to integrate artificial intelligence in businesses. The book paints a comprehensive picture of what is working and what isn’t, and how companies can find their way through the treacherous path of achieving AI success.
Per Davenport: “There is no reason virtually every large company shouldn’t be exploring cognitive technologies. Those who explore them earlier and more successfully, those who integrate AI with their business processes, and those who identify and nurture effective collaborations between humans and machines — those companies will dominate the future. They’ll have more appealing products and services, more productive and effective processes, and people who have the time and freedom to be creative and resourceful on behalf of customers.”

Globalisation, automation, and rapidly changing needs mean the future of employment will probably look very different from how it looks today. In fact, many current careers won’t exist in the next 10 to 20 years. So, it’s critical that students ask the important question: ‘Will my chosen study path lead to strong job opportunities after graduation and beyond?’
In this series, we’re exploring a range of occupations forecast to have strong employment prospects in the future. Some careers in the tech industry are quickly emerging. Plus, there are other existing careers that will also have an important place in the employment opportunities of tomorrow.
This article looks at the exciting and dynamic field of artificial intelligence. While you may have heard about the field, you might not know exactly what artificial intelligence is and what kinds of artificial intelligence careers are available.
What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building “smart” computers and machines, meaning they are capable of performing complicated tasks that usually require human intelligence or supervision. A critical aspect of this discipline is machine learning, a deep understanding of self-regulating computer systems. Leading scientists in artificial intelligence are now learning how to create computers that can process complex information, such as human emotion, expression, behaviour and languages. 
Artificial intelligence may sound futuristic, but it’s already here. Already it is being used across nearly every industry, including technology, healthcare, retail and transport. Think of Siri on your smartphone, Alexa in your home, computer modelling and predictive polling tools, speech recognition, manufacturing processes, conversation bots on websites, spam filters and recommendations for things you might like to watch on Netflix. All of these are examples of artificial intelligence. 










What is it like to work in artificial intelligence?
This branch of computer science is now so broad and aligned with so many different industries, that students have the opportunity to choose the type of work they are most inspired by. Mathematics, computer programming, statistics, networking, web development, software engineering and robotics are all key areas in the development of artificial intelligence. Students will often find they have a natural affinity for one or more of these skills, which in turn may determine their eventual career aspirations. The benefit of this is that, as a student, you can work out what you love to do while you are learning. As this is such a new area of study, you’re also likely to have the pick of available positions in the job market if you have the right qualifications. 
This is a cutting-edge science, where discoveries, breakthroughs, and never-before-seen advancements are common. It is also a fast-growing area of study and business, and is predicted to continue to grow. This makes artificial intelligence an ideal choice for those looking for an exciting, rewarding and varied career.
In Australia, jobs in artificial intelligence are high paying. Current statistics suggest that the average starting wage for an AI-focused role is around $75,000 per year, which jumps steeply once you have some industry experience. A senior software engineer typically earns more than $100,000 per year, while a senior solutions architect earns from $150,000 per year. Those figures only increase as the industry continues to grow. 
Are there artificial intelligence jobs in Australia?
Australia is already heavily invested in AI and is well-positioned to be a future leader of the industry. There are already several dedicated national agencies, as well as branches of well-known international AI-focused organisations. Some examples include the Australian Space Agency, SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre, MIT Living Lab, the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, and the Australian Cyber Collaboration Centre.
Accenture, one of the world’s largest technology and professional services firms, recently announced its move into South Australia with the establishment of the Adelaide Hub. This investment includes the development of national security operations and cyber defense capabilities, new advanced technology centres, and intelligent operations capabilities. It’s easy to see why career opportunities in AI are increasing and will continue to do so. 
Where can I study artificial intelligence?
This highly specialised industry requires extensive study. Entry-level positions require at least a bachelor’s degree, while senior positions entailing leadership, supervision or business management skills often require a master’s or postgraduate degree in addition to some industry experience. 
Typical coursework involves the study of mathematics (including probability, statistics, algebra, calculus, logic and algorithms), networking, modelling, physics, engineering, robotics, computer science, programming languages and coding.
If you’re interested in a career in artificial intelligence, look for degree programs that offer specific majors in AI, such as the Bachelor of Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) offered at Flinders University. Alternatively, you can pursue an AI specialisation within majors such as health informatics, graphic design, information technology and engineering.

Robyn Begley, DNP, RN, CEO of the American Organization for Nursing Leadership ,
      Molly McCarthy









 




Experts say that artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to have a bigger impact on health care than anything the field has experienced in our lifetime. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re seeing how AI is helping clinicians screen for, and diagnose, COVID-19; it’s aiding researchers’ efforts to develop new drugs and vaccines. Though some health care workers worry that AI tools could replace their jobs, in fact AI is driving innovation, process improvements and better patient outcomes. It’s enhancing providers’ ability to care for more patients safely.
The American Hospital Association and Microsoft now offer a free, one-hour course, for continuing education credits, to guide health care teams through key considerations and specific actions for AI’s responsible and strategic implementation.
Preparing Your Workforce for AI Adoption
It’s important to educate key stakeholders and clinical staff on the implications of adopting AI in a health care setting, including the risks and opportunities that accompany it. That’s why AHA and Microsoft partnered to develop an easy-to-navigate course, “AI in Health Care: Leading Through Change.”

This AHA-Microsoft course can help your organization reinvent the cultures around AI, moving away from fear and hesitancy and toward innovation.

The engaging training modules feature interactive activities (such as a strategic planner) and videos. You can complete the entire course in about one hour or take more time as needed, while saving and tracking your progress. Expert instructors lead you through different topics and also share practical insights based on their experiences using AI in different health care settings.
Course topics include:

Learning the fundamentals to ensure your organization, particularly among key stakeholders on your staff, has a universal baseline understanding of AI and how it works.
How to proactively communicate to your leaders and staff on the concept of AI, its building blocks and how these drive various AI technologies.
Addressing myths and barriers to adopting various AI tools and technologies.
Considerations to guide your AI investments, including identifying common oversights and techniques that should be mastered.
How data can be used to integrate AI across your organization and be used for transformation and continuous innovation.

Aligning AI with Your Organization’s Culture and Structure
Transformation requires people, process and technology. Technology cannot stand alone. Health care leaders and staff must work to align culture, structure and work processes to support strategy for AI’s use and adoption across the organization.
Since AI drives process improvements, the organization will need process improvement leaders who will focus on workforce transformation and use education and training to apply AI tools in support of the organization’s goals and mission. In addition to your organization’s technical teams, steering committees and operational groups must be involved from the beginning of AI adoption. Being open and transparent is crucial to ensuring your teams not only have buy-in to this change but also claim ownership, so they can leverage AI tools more effectively. Engaging stakeholders can help break down barriers and myths about AI.
Addressing Common Challenges and Moving Toward Success
Stakeholders may be intimidated by AI or show no interest because of their lack of knowledge of its value. Designating internal AI champions will help encourage buy-in and ownership. Organizations also will need a clear IT- and data-staffing plan for AI implementation, so identifying a data champion is a key step toward ensuring a smooth, effective process.
Another common challenge is managing employees’ fears that AI adoption will lead to job cuts. That’s not what the data show. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, there will be a workforce deficit of between 42,699 and 121,300 clinicians by 2030. AI can help alleviate looming shortages and address time and cost pressures to improve patient experiences and outcomes.
You can make assuaging employees’ fears of AI a part of your organization’s strategic plan and create a communications and feedback platform. You also can address any workforce concerns directly, sharing cases of successful implementation and demonstrating how your organization will differentiate its approach. It’s important that key stakeholders understand the overall need for AI and how it will deliver a return on investment that does not include cutting jobs.
This AHA-Microsoft course can help your organization reinvent the cultures around AI, moving away from fear and hesitancy and toward innovation.
AI is creating a space for innovation and enabling clinicians and staff to work more efficiently and effectively in the face of unprecedented change. By developing a robust strategic vision for AI adoption, your organization will be well positioned to deliver smarter, safer and better care to your patients.
Robyn Begley is chief executive officer of the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) and senior vice president, chief nursing officer, of the American Hospital Association. Molly McCarthy is national director, U.S. health providers and health plans, at Microsoft.

People leave calling cards wherever they go in the form of unique fingerprints. As every Sherlock Holmes fan can attest, they provide a crucial means for law enforcement to determine someone’s identity. But it turns out that humans aren’t alone in having diagnostic prints. An Alberta wildlife reserve is turning to artificial intelligence to identify individual black bears based on their paw prints. The footprint identification technology (FIT) provides an inexpensive and non-invasive way of tracking wildlife, and the technology may assist researchers in determining what wildlife populations are at risk and need conservation help. 
The Cochrane Ecological Institute chose to use FIT software developed by the organization Wildtrack as a method for monitoring black bears following their release after rehabilitation. 
“When you’re doing wildlife rehab, pretty much all the animals you receive in a wildlife sanctuary have been injured or orphaned through human activity,” says Simon L’Allier, a biology intern at Cochrane Ecological Institute and a Master of Science candidate at York University. “When it’s human-caused, it’s our responsibility to get these animals back on track.”

One of the major bonuses for using FIT is that the process is simple and low cost. “All you need is a ruler and a camera. A smartphone camera can do the job quite well,” says L’Allier.  
One hitch? Getting the project up and running requires the researchers to “train” the FIT software to recognize individual black bear pawprints. And, turns out, “you can’t train the model with just random tracks you find in the wild,” says L’Allier. When you capture photos of prints, you need to know the individual, the sex, and the age of the black bear who made those prints. This information is sent back to Wildtrack, who teaches the artificial intelligence model to recognize individuals in the database from a single paw print. 
Once the model is trained, it will be able to distinguish pawprints from bears that aren’t in the database. “It can tell you: this is a bear track, and this is from an unknown individual because it’s not in our system,” says L’Allier. “You add it to the database, so once you see that track again in the wild for a second time, you know you’ve seen this individual before.” 
The ability to recognize new bear paw prints and add them to a database provides a huge advantage over other monitoring technology. While GPS collars have their uses and can provide fine data readings like an animal’s heartbeat, “with GPS collars, you have to capture every single bear in the area and put a collar on them,” says L’Allier. In contrast, FIT doesn’t require researchers to tranquilize or handle the bears.
Typically to train the AI model to be accurate, you need data from twenty individual black bears, says L’Allier. The model requires twenty photos of each bear’s front left paw print. Gathering that many clear photos can prove tricky. “Bears walk in their own tracks,” says L’Allier. “The back foot will go on the front paw track and so forth.” This can distort the shape of the track. 


The ground cover bears trek across affects the quality of the paw print. Coarse sand is an ideal substrate for making clear paw prints, says L’Allier. Mud doesn’t produce great tracks, because it sticks to the bear as the paw pulls back, he adds. You run into the same problem with snow. 
There is an exception: the snow on a “late afternoon when there’s a lot of sun and it starts melting on the surface” can create readable tracks, says L’Allier. 
L’Allier was able to begin the tracking project with a rehabilitated black bear named Siksi’naan who was released in early October. But with winter setting in and bears heading into hibernation, data collection is on hold until spring of 2021. 
In the meantime, wildlife enthusiasts can contribute to WildTrack’s database by joining the Wildtrack Fast Data Collection project on the Epicollect 5 app and submitting their own photos. As a bonus, the app can identify tracks to species. Now you can finally settle if the mystery tracks around your cottage garbage can are from a raccoon or a black bear.

Kobelco collaborating with Leica Geosystems to develop remote machine control operations


 



Kobelco Construction Machinery (KCM) has announced a collaboration with Leica Geosystems to develop integrated 2D and 3D machine control solutions which can be operated remotely.
Part of Kobelco’s ‘K-DIVE CONCEPT’ – the Japanese equipment maker’s remote control system – the system involves manipulating a dedicated cockpit with displays showing the job-site from an office. Operators can control excavators remotely without going to the real job-site.
“With a focus on bringing more efficiency, safety and productivity through digitalisation to the heavy construction industry, KCM and Leica Geosystems are working together to help facilitate the remote operation of excavators. The relationship will take advantage of Leica Geosystems’ know-how in relation to K-DIVE CONCEPT’s next generation Telework System using remote operation technology for operators,” said a statement from Kobelco.
The concept will allow a diverse range of operators to work efficiently with access to any job-site without being restricted by location. Using a remote system enables contractors to view progress of jobsites virtually and also use it as virtual training for operators.
Yoichiro Yamazaki, KCM general manager, Business Development Department, Corporate Planning Division, said: “We have great ambitions with K-DIVE CONCEPT, and in our search for technology to achieve this, we are excited to work with Leica Geosystems. Our IoT revolutionises the improvement of safety and on-site productivity, allowing a diverse range of operators to work remotely.”
Magnus Thibblin, Leica Geosystems Machine Control president, added: “We are honoured to be chosen as technology partner in our common journey towards an autonomous jobsite. Working with a leading excavator manufacturer like KCM, fulfils our ambition to be at the forefront of technology within the heavy construction industry.”
The advanced Leica iCON 3D excavator machine control solution guides the operator using reference models and GNSS in 3D. Design information and real-time cut/fill indications are displayed on the control panel, allowing the operators to rapidly excavate to the reference design on projects, such as large road and infrastructure construction, subdivision building, industrial sites and demolition works. By using that solution via K-DIVE CONCEPT, remote operators can easily control excavators’ performance on a jobsite in real-time. Also, KCM will take advantage of high-speed 5G mobile communication systems as the core of K-DIVE CONCEPT in the future.
The K-DIVE CONCEPT is under development for practical application in Japan at the moment, said Kobelco, and its global expansion has not been decided yet.

Emerging Tech




								How a small AI company found a way to scale its work for DOD							

								Shield AI, an artificial intelligence startup focused on military work, has found a tried-and-true way to scale its work with the DOD.

Despite all the prototype contracts and research grants the Department of Defense feeds to eager startups, that work rarely scales to the type of multimillion-dollar deals the government gives to big prime contractors. It’s a frustrating reality for both sides, particularly as Pentagon officials clamor to infuse emerging technology into defense systems.
But there are ways to keep startups invested in government work once the initial projects are finished. Artificial intelligence company Shield AI recently inked the kind of deal that could set an example for other small firms that work with emerging tech.
Shield AI entered a partnership with defense and aerospace company Textron Systems to develop prototypes and scale its work with the DOD. The relationship, which took “months” to come together, according to both companies, will couple the startup’s autonomy-enabling AI with Textron’s robotic vehicles, with the goal of protecting troops in battle.
“We had long tracked the work that Textron was doing,” Gayle Lemmon, a partner and chief policy and marketing officer of Shield, said in an interview. “Together we could take their leadership … and really think about what we specialize in, which is operationalizing AI.”

Officials at Shield AI did not want to talk about exactly how the two companies would work together, saying it could damage the security of the project. Lemmon did say that the project began with a “proof of concept” that was based on their “shared values.” A Shield AI spokesman teased at more announcements coming soon from “well-known” partners.
So far, Shield AI’s main customer has been U.S. Special Operations Command — a fit that makes perfect sense: The company’s offices are nearby in San Diego, and co-founder Brandon Tseng is a former Navy SEAL operator. Shield AI, unlike some of its Silicon Valley counterparts that have a more complicated relationship with military work, was created expressly with the goal of serving the Pentagon.
But any company with that kind of profile, working with SOCOM — which has unique purchasing acquisition authorities and can buy technology in smaller batches — has limitations. Scaling up work both within the command and to service-level acquisition is where revenue can become more sizable, more stable and more appealing to talented tech workers.
In September, the company announced it won a $7.2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with the DOD’s Strategic Capabilities Office, a sizable chunk of change compared to the initial $100,000 of family-raised seed money the company started with, according to a recent profile in Wired. But now that the company employs about 150 people, a single-digit million-dollar contract through a program like SBIR may not be enough for the long term. (Shield has investments from firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Breyer Capital, Homebrew, and Silicon Valley Bank.)
No surprises from analysts

News of Shield’s deal with Textron came as no surprise to Nathan Ruiz, managing director for partnerships at government technology accelerator Dcode, he told FedScoop. Analysts have found a common way tech companies big and small work with the government is through subcontracts and partnerships.
“Partnering with primes is often the quickest way into [the federal market],” he said. It also is often a boon for the big primes that don’t need to invest in developing its own emerging technology which is a hit-or-miss game. Ruiz leads Dcode’s efforts to help small companies team up across industry and also coach big primes, or “systems integrator” companies, on what makes a successful partnership with startups.
“Aligning with good emerging tech companies is the best thing a systems integrator can do to remain at the forefront,” Ruiz said.
The key for small companies is to prove viability in their products and business. Primes don’t want to have to tell a government agency they won’t be able to deliver because the startup folded after six months of burning through investment cash. And for the primes, it’s all about being open to new tech and seeing how emerging trends can advance their own products, Ruiz said.
For a customer like the DOD, getting emerging technology in the Pentagon is the easy part. Getting it to scale — recurring and large purchasing orders that a company can regularly fill — is the hard part. Senior officials have said that hindrance to scaling is in part due to its risk-averse culture and acquisition practices that can take years. Those in industry have described the space between small research grants and earning contracts that can be a part of a company’s bottom line as the “valley of death.”

Other emerging tech companies that have tried to jump that valley with partnership include TrueFace, a facial recognition company that recently partnered with Modzy, a Booz Allen Hamilton enterprise AI platform. Deloitte also recently won a contract with the DOD’s Joint AI Center that requires them to subcontract with small emerging tech companies.
Helpful for the primes too
Large prime contractors that are tuned into the inner workings of the federal procurement bureaucracy can create inhibiting bureaucracies of their own. Working with small emerging technology companies can provide them with new life and innovation.
“Our work with Shield AI epitomizes our long-standing approach of how we help our customers distill an array of industry potential into meaningful and mission-ready solutions,” technical director for Textron Systems, Sean Baity, told FedScoop.
For Shield and Textron, the partnership could bring the type of AI applications other research shows the DOD is most interested in fielding. The partnership between the two companies aims to deliver autonomous systems that can assist troops on the battlefield, taking on tasks that can help keep humans out of harm’s way.

“We are forging strategic partnerships with other firms linked to the national security industrial and innovation base. We are also having ongoing discussions with others outside of the defense industry,” Raval said. Shield didn’t disclose how many companies it is partnered with, only saying it continues in “collaborating with several industry partners,” and that the mystery number could grow soon.

Despite the disruption 2020 has delivered, the opportunities around AI show no sign of losing their momentum. AI is no more science fiction and is already being adopted by public and private organizations globally..People are far away from the mythical thought that AI robots are coming for humans. The fact is, as a society, humankind is relying more on artificial intelligence with its growth. AI is a step closer towards creating and inventing more technological discoveries by implementing the logic and intelligence of humans. AI algorithms and deep machine learning mechanism are looking for ways to make day to day activities comfortable. The innovation and advancements in the field of technology have brought this complicated but sophisticated new source called sci-fi tech into reality. AI has invaded almost every field like blockchain, healthcare, education, banking, etc. The most impressive way AI is proving its proactiveness in recent years is through web development..Artificial Intelligence is modifying Web Development.Back in 1993, the introduction of Mosaic graphical web browser touched off a revolution in the way the public experiences the content of the website. Since then, web developers across the globe have worked continuously to establish and refine what solid user experience means online..In this digital era, web development is growing at an unprecedented rate. People prefer to go for secure, scalable and feature-packed web applications. The desire of users for enhanced experience along with customized content is ever-spiking. Artificial intelligence can fulfill all the needs. AI can transform web development by automating the tasks that are related to the developers..Around 38% of people leave a website if the content or layout is unattractive. More than 75% of customers decide a business's credibility based on its website design. Users take just 0.5 seconds to form an opinion about a website. A websites design matters more to visitors than we think. Henceforth, it is essential for technology to involve in the world of web development. By using AI, these industries improve user experience with chatbots, web design, marketing strategy, etc..Web development is widely seen as a place where hyper-customized user experience is necessary. Web development companies are seeking help from AI as they face challenges in terms of user expectations and traditional methods of website designing and development. Instead of pressuring web developers to work extensively and fulfill customer expectations, it is a fair job to automate the process using AI. Incorporating artificial intelligence is the best way to transform traditional web development approaches to a revolutionary web development field..By implying AI to develop a site, the system decides color, theme and style by itself. AI builds a site, which arranges and designs in accordance with user experience needs. Here is a list of AI-enabled features that are seen commonly in good sites..• User experience- The most pivotal role in site development is user experience. A site should be user-friendly, that the person visiting it should find relevant products or content within seconds of entering the web. Many customer-centric web applications are starting to rely on AI in order to improve enhance the customer experience..• Personalised content- AI analyzes dataand generates the idea to eliminate the web architectures irregularities. AI can also suggest new videos, music, and other relevant content for users based on their past behaviors..• Virtual assistant and voice search optimization- Virtual assistantsare simplifying web development works related to layouts, templates designing, and creating personalized content. Some websites provide AI-chatbot feature that takes care of customer queries..Even though when AI is designed to do extensive jobs that even humans can't contemplate, it is more unlikely that the technology could function on its own. AI needs human intervention to have a check now and then. However, the same can't be anticipated for the future. AI is not taking away web developers job for now as it needs their interference to check if things are going fine. It might turn upside down soon..The Future Ahead.Artificial Intelligence is a never-ending sector. The growth will double, triple and get ten-fold in a very short time. As technology spreads, experts envision AI to do more than just web designing at a small scale. AI is already doing tedious tasks in web designing to make websites from scratch. It is predicted to expand further in future..• AI, with its cognitive abilities, will create designs and themes..• Internet of Things(IoT) can help in building attractive and eye-catching graphics for the website..• AI's smart algorithm will understand the need of users and what it should do in that context by taking the help of cognitive capabilities and user preference..• Machine learning will be useful in picking up the difference in design inconsistencies, helpful in fixing them..• AI can detect and frame every pixel in an image..With more modern technologies being unravelled every day, the expectation for a customized web future is lying ahead. AI's support in web development will yield customers websites capable of adopting and perfecting themselves with user-by-user requirements..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
