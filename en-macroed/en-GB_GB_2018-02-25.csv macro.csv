Just as manufacturing has seen huge benefits from Lean, automation and advanced IT, Artificial Intelligence promises to be the next breakthrough in productivity improvement.



AI-driven analytics and real-time insights have already begun to help businesses grow their revenues and market shares – image courtesy of Microsoft.


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance and extend the capabilities of humans, and help businesses achieve more, faster and more efficiently.
Though by no means a new concept, several more recent developments have enabled AI to cross into the mainstream: namely, cloud computing, big data, and improved machine learning algorithms.
AI-driven analytics and real-time insights have already begun to help businesses grow their revenues and market shares faster than their peers in industries as diverse as healthcare, finance, utilities and ecommerce.
The Manufacturer’s Annual Manufacturing Report 2018 found that 92% of senior manufacturing executives believe that ‘Smart Factory’ digital technologies – including Artificial Intelligence – will enable them to increase their productivity levels and empower staff to work smarter.
A positive outlook for the future, perhaps, but uncertainty still exists. A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group found that a significant gap lies between an organisation’s ‘ambition and execution’, with only one in five companies incorporating AI into one or more of their processes.
Similarly, global research firm, Forrester says that 58% of business and technology professionals are researching AI systems, yet only 12% are actively using them.
So, to learn more about the opportunities Artificial Intelligence holds for manufacturing organisations, The Manufacturer spoke with Jamie Hall, senior solutions specialist for Microsoft.
How much and how fast will AI transform the manufacturing industry?
Jamie Hall: Manufacturers around the world are rapidly investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) to create new products and services, while driving down production costs over the longer term.
This transformation is changing the way companies think about how they engage their customers, empower their employees and optimise their operations.
However, delivering IoT is only part of the journey to achieving manufacturing excellence. For companies to realise the full potential of IoT, they need to combine the data collected from connected devices with rapidly advancing Artificial Intelligence to enable ‘smart machines’.
These will, in turn, simulate intelligent behaviour with little or no human intervention.
Predominantly, the AI in smart machines currently manages the more traditional repetitive tasks; however, this is advancing very quickly. The ability of AI to adapt to continuously changing tasks will move quickly into the mainstream, I expect.
This will be a paradigm shift from assisted intelligence swinging all the way across to full autonomous intelligence where machines are able to learn enough to make recommendations that humans can trust.
Besides smart machines on the shop floor, the use of AI and big data will be huge over the coming five years with dependable algorithms being used in all areas of an operation from weather prediction for the shipping of raw materials through to predictive maintenance of the resulting product.
How do you think that disruption will affect business operations and strategy?
Applying AI to manufacturing requires some key foundational technologies to be in place. A smart factory will need to be networked, taking data from production lines, design & engineering teams, and quality control to form an integrated, intelligent operation.
If manufacturers don’t have the right smart machines and the right data collection points, it’s just data with little or no insight, and insight is what creates world class optimised operations.
Industrial companies will need to become digital companies to survive as the asset and customer become increasingly more centric to their operations.
The days of a linear journey form sourcing product through to the on-going support have gone. Creating a 360-degree view of the customer and being able to bring the product to the centre of the operations and understanding intimately how a product is used brings huge benefits from new product development through to improved go to market models.
Each of these will, of course, add data collection points for AI, machine learning and cognitive services to advance the operation and ultimately the customer experience.
What are the key benefits AI offers to a manufacturing organisation?
With the right foundations in place manufacturers will see AI make many more informed decisions at each stage in the production process in real time.
In the case of production, we will see sensors spotting defects on the production line. The data is then fed to the cloud to verify, which will immediately remove the defective part
from the line and order a replacement all while calculating in real-time just-in-time schedules.
With real-time problem-solving, manufacturers can potentially save millions of pounds in recalls, repairs and lost business.
As use cases continue to evolve, AI will be pivotal in all areas of an organisation from fraud prevention to predictive ordering and opportunity assessment; all of which bring time, productivity and cost benefits which can be passed onto the customer.
Each one of these intelligent insights will turn information into tangible outcomes.
What are the future AI trends and/or developments manufacturers should be aware of?
As AI becomes more mainstream within organisations, a trust and dependability will surface which brings a level of intelligence that becomes mission critical to organisations.
As businesses build their own technology foundations through the use of technology, the advancement to de-centralised AI – where AI solutions can speak at every level of the supply chain from customers through to vendors, data sharing and decision-making will be performed immediately where it would have taken teams of people days and weeks to replicate.
As more emerging technologies come to the fore including Blockchain, Augmented Reality and AI, the inevitable convergence of these trends will happen quickly, and manufacturers should look to embrace and invest now.
Disrupters stand to gain the most from these new and exciting technologies.
Key takeaway for leaders in manufacturing to think about:
With data being the core ingredient for AI, big data and machine learning, more considered thought needs to be made on who owns the data, whether it is collected from IoT-enabled devices or not.
This is often overlooked, yet the outcomes can only occur with lots of it and therefore holds the biggest value for all manufacturers. The decision we make now will have a profound impact on the future.

MIT and SenseTime today announced that SenseTime, a leading artificial intelligence (AI) company, is joining MIT's efforts to define the next frontier of human and machine intelligence.
SenseTime was founded by MIT alumnus Xiao’ou Tang PhD ’96 and specializes in computer vision and deep learning technologies. The MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence aims to open up new avenues of discovery across MIT in areas such as computer vision, human-intelligence-inspired algorithms, medical imaging, and robotics; drive technological breakthroughs in AI that have the potential to confront some of the world’s greatest challenges; and empower MIT faculty and students to pursue interdisciplinary projects at the vanguard of intelligence research. 
SenseTime is the first company to join a new Institute-wide initiative, the MIT Intelligence Quest, since its launch earlier this month. The MIT Intelligence Quest seeks to leverage the Institute’s strengths in brain and cognitive science and computer science to advance research into human and machine intelligence in service to all humanity. It will apply the fruits of its discoveries to diverse fields — from materials design to finance to early disease diagnosis — while considering deeply the economic, cultural, and ethical implications of AI. 
An essential element of the new initiative is forging connections with innovative companies and individuals who share MIT’s passion for work in intelligence. 
""As an MIT alumnus, I’m grateful to have this opportunity to collaborate with my alma mater, especially on something that is dear to my heart — to advance research on artificial intelligence,” says Tang, who is also a professor of information engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “SenseTime is committed to innovating in the fields of computer vision and deep learning. With the creation of the MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence, I’m confident that we will bring together the world’s best and brightest talent to further advance the state of the art for AI to the benefit of society.”
Li Xu, CEO and co-founder of SenseTime, adds, “MIT has long been at the forefront of research into artificial intelligence. As the largest provider of AI algorithms in China, SenseTime has worked with more than 400 leading customers and partners to solve hard, real-world problems. We are very excited to join hands with MIT to lead global AI research into the next frontier.”
The alliance emerges from a longstanding connection between MIT and Tang, who conducted his PhD research in underwater robotics and computer vision at the Institute more than 25 years ago, applying computer vision to the study and classification of underwater imagery. One of his advisors was W. Eric L. Grimson PhD ’80, now the chancellor for academic advancement at MIT and the Bernard M. Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering.
“Xiao’ou has used the same practical approach to computation and artificial intelligence that he displayed at MIT to build a highly successful academic and applied research career and a tremendously successful, technologically impressive startup company in SenseTime,” Grimson says. “He has become well known throughout China and the world as a leader in the field of AI, and especially computer vision and deep learning. Xiao’ou has always kept MIT front of mind, both as a professor and an entrepreneur. He has shared intellectual ideas and is ever on the lookout for impressive young talent whom he encourages to apply to the Institute. I personally am proud of Xiao’ou’s success and the impact he is making on the world, and look forward to a deepened, mutually beneficial relationship between MIT and SenseTime.”
Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who recently helped to lead the development of the MIT Intelligence Quest, says, “I am thrilled that SenseTime has chosen to join us as we embark on our quest to achieve a deeper understanding of the science and engineering of intelligence and to harness that understanding to create a better world. Dr. Tang is no stranger to innovative research, and the MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence will facilitate boundary-pushing research in intelligence across the Institute and give faculty and students opportunities to unlock new thinking through intense collaboration. This is an exciting moment for both MIT and SenseTime.”
MIT has been on the frontier of intelligence research since the 1950s, when pioneers Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy helped establish the field of artificial intelligence. MIT pushed several major advances in the subsequent decades — from neural networks to data encryption to quantum computing to crowdsourcing — and the Institute now has more than 200 principal investigators whose research bears directly on intelligence. Currently, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT Media Lab, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, and MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society serve as connected hubs for AI and related research at MIT.
Considered China’s leading AI “unicorn” valued at more than $3 billion, SenseTime has developed a sophisticated proprietary deep learning platform and built applications for multiple industries. The company has applied its core computer vision technologies, including face recognition, video analysis, text recognition, and autonomous driving, across industries such as automobile, finance, mobile Internet, robotics, security, and smartphones.
SenseTime is currently working on developing autonomous driving, intelligent medical treatment, and deep learning hardware optimization. It is also strengthening its technology platform and attracting leading talent from around the world to open up greater applications scenarios and a SenseTime-driven AI commercial ecosystem. The company has offices in Beijing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, Kyoto, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore, and Tokyo.

But despite almost 12,000 kilometres separating the two, tech groups in the United States are beginning to pay attention to the Australian coastal city's explorations in artificial intelligence (AI). ""Our work has caused a bit of interest in those circles,"" says Derel Wust, the managing director of software company 4Tel.For the past two years, 4Tel has been collaborating with a university robotics lab to develop AI in trains. ""This stuff is not years and years away at all,"" Mr Wust says.In fact, he says AI could be used in trains within Australia as early as this year.""The technology certainly has the potential to create autonomous trains, and that will happen in tunnels or closed systems,"" he says. Thousands of passengers in Sydney were left stranded by a two-day disruption earlier this year.(AAP: Glenn Campbell)Automated trains already exist in some metro cities around the world, but Mr Wust says they are either remotely controlled or pre-programmed — AI technology is not currently being used to drive trains.""We see that the most immediate application is to make the driver's work safer and help the driver, not replace the driver,"" he says. ""For the travelling public, the future AI agents will improve the safety of the system because they will not get tired or distracted.""As for running on time … the ability to get on the train and know that it's going to get to the destination when promised is fundamentally what a lot of people are after, and any improvements in the processes to enable that to happen are going to be appreciated by the public.""Going into the future, these types of technologies are going to make the job easier, and they are coming."" Will AI trains be safer? Derel Wust says AI could be used in trains in Australia as early as this year.(ABC RN: Sophie Kesteven )Mr Wust says the technology his company is working on is similar to what's being used in the autonomous car industry. It involves attaching radars and lidars — a detection device used for measuring distances — and various cameras and acoustic sensors to trains. He says the use of AI could ""result in a safer and more efficient industry"".""[The AI will] look around and access what is going on such as operating conditions, speed and weather. Those things will become routinely calculated through an AI agent,"" he says. ""And while we won't be able to stop all accidents by any means — because sometimes things go wrong — we are hopeful that we will be able to intervene a lot quicker, sooner and effectively than what has happened in the past.""Australia has a good safety record, but if I can generalise that to look around the world, a lot of the accidents come about by staff being distracted, obstacles on the track, or something going wrong in the infrastructure … and most of those items are candidates to be detected by artificial intelligence.""Tapping into young minds University of Newcastle students are applying their knowledge of deep learning to improve train safety.(ABC RN: Sophie Kesteven )Students at the University of Newcastle are helping to develop the AI used by Mr Wust's company.Inside the university's Robotics and Brain Architecture Laboratory, students can occasionally be found modifying a small robot, NUgus.Its large, black beady eyes recognises faces, and it can also detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and signals in everyday environments.

There, they work alongside engineering and technical staff to apply deep learning to problems that occur in train safety. ""One of the PhD students has developed some new software engineering and computer vision approaches. He has applied it in various aspects of robotics, and now as an industrial application with 4Tel,"" says Associate Professor Stephan Chalup, who leads the robotics lab.""A lot of it is about visual recognition of signs and tracks and objects on the track, and behaviour of humans that pass the track. ""Another topic is localisation where the trains are on the track, and there's a lot of visual pattern recognition.""'AI is our friend, not our foe'He thinks Australia could be a world leader on AI in trains.""I think there's a great opportunity right now for Australia to become leaders in AI on trains using deep learning because nobody else is doing it, and we already have a great collaboration here,"" he says.Mr Wust agrees, and says it's now up to the industry to take up the new technology.The driverless car revolutionSoon, you'll be able to do all the things you'd rather be doing while driving.

It has lights, signals, tracks, points and all the same sort of infrastructure, and yet AI is going to impact it everywhere in the world,"" he says.""And if Australia can create technology that's competitive in that market, now's the time to do it, because over time that window will close.""Mr Wust says there's an opportunity for AI to be used in many other modes of transport in Australia, such as trams, trucks, and buses. It's part of the reason why he's been invited to present a paper on his work at an AI and deep learning conference in California next month.  He says we are going to be advantaged as a society by having computers assisting us more intensely, rather than relying on the techniques of the past.""I'm a firm believer that AI is our friend, and it's not our foe,"" he says. ""One of my observations in this is that in Australia … there is a bit of a disconnect between expertise and industry, and our collaboration with the University of Newcastle shows what can be achieved when you have a common domain interest and mutually supporting arrangements.""Posted 26 Feb 201826 Feb 2018Mon 26 Feb 2018 at 4:00pm, updated 26 Feb 201826 Feb 2018Mon 26 Feb 2018 at 6:46pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesMore delays could be ahead for Sydney's 'tangled' train network10 predictions about the AI revolutionAI set to affect every Australian worker within 15 years: reportMore on:NewcastleRoboticsSydneyTransport IndustryUniversitiesTop StoriesThe red flags at the centre of AFP's suspicions about the couple charged with spying for RussiaPicasso estate responds to MONA's faked artworksAnalysisVice-President Trump and President Putin of Ukraine — Joe Biden's gaffes keep coming, but he says he's not budgingSeven stand-out moments from Joe Biden's high-pressure press conferenceCFMEU boss John Setka steps down 'Time is running out': Collingwood's premiership defence on thin ice after loss to Geelong in crucial clashBritish man sentenced to life in prison for attempted kidnap and murder of UK presenter Holly WilloughbyWhy Shelley Duvall disappeared from HollywoodBenji apologises to fans after the Tigers are smashed 58-6 by CronullaVenice's debated tourist fee expected to increase 'in coming years', says tourism councillorAussie killed in Ukraine among many 'lulled' to fight war without military trainingRussian-Australian woman charged with spying offences was well-travelled, made lifestyle videosPhilippines police open special investigation into suspected murder of Australian couple as hunt for suspect continuesDubbed the 'Star Wars Project', South Korea plans to use drone-melting lasers against North Korea'All they took was two pies', says Gippsland bakery owner after armed robbers tie up staff in early morning raidPopular NowDon't miss news that matters to you.

Ken Mulvany left his CEO post at Proximagen to found artificial intelligence firm BenevolentAI (originally known as Stratified Medical) in 2013. Now, having successfully grown the business into a bioinformatics unicorn, he has gone back and bought up part of his former employer.BenevolentAI bought Proximagen’s U.K. operations—a drug discovery and development facility on the Babraham Research Campus in Cambridge—for an undisclosed sum. It allows BenevolentAI to cover the entire drug R&D process, the first time an AI company is able to do so, said the company.“The acquisition has expanded our scale and capability overnight and created something that previously did not exist—an AI company truly integrated across every stage of the drug development process,” said Mulvany in a statement.One of the largest AI enterprises in the world, BenevolentAI has built an AI-powered platform that mines scientific data to draw meaningful insights for drug discovery, either for designing new drugs or potentially repurposing drugs for other diseases. But prior to this acquisition, the company could only deal with discovery in-house and had to rely on CROs to clinically develop drug programs.Mulvany and several colleagues are no strangers to Proximagen; after all, it was he who sold Proximagen to Upsher-Smith Laboratories for $553 million in 2012.Home to a team of 44 scientists, the Cambridge site has expertise across areas including assay development and screening; medicinal and synthetic chemistry; drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics; in vivo pharmacology; as well as preclinical and clinical development.Adding those capabilities to its portfolio means the company can generate biological hypotheses at scale, significantly reduce hypotheses validation time and diversify its range of projects and therapeutic areas, a company spokesperson told FierceBiotech.RELATED: BenevolentAI poaches drug discovery executive from GlaxoSmithKline The U.K. site’s current research activity centers around a wide breadth of areas including pain, cognition and inflammation. The two companies' shared interest in those therapeutic areas could also mean a smooth team integration process.Since spinning its bioscience-focused capabilities into BenevolentBio, the company has expanded its pipeline to include 19 programs, and it expects the amount and diversity of research programs to grow significantly with the Proximagen deal.In November 2016, it in-licensed several clinical small-molecule compounds from Janssen to further develop their potentials in hard-to-treat diseases. The company pushed one of the candidates licensed, bavisant, in a phase 2b in Parkinson’s patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.Working with the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, it made a breakthrough in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2017, having validated that a drug candidate discovered by its AI platform could work.

Paul Allen is pouring more money into artificial intelligence research.
The Microsoft co-founder on Wednesday announced Project Alexandria, a new initiative that aims to help develop “common sense AI.” Allen is committing $125 million over the next three years to the project, housed at the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). The money will go toward Project Alexandria, as well as other work being done at AI2.
AI research has seen exponential advancements over the past decade, but machines are still incapable of certain types of problem solving or dealing with unpredictable situations.
“When I founded AI2, I wanted to expand the capabilities of artificial intelligence through high-impact research,” Allen said in a statement. “Early in AI research, there was a great deal of focus on common sense, but that work stalled. AI still lacks what most 10-year-olds possess: ordinary common sense. We want to jump start that research to achieve major breakthroughs in the field.”

Allen added that “this is an extremely complicated challenge.”
“If we want AI to approach human abilities and have the broadest possible impact in research, medicine and business, we need to fundamentally advance AI’s common sense abilities,” he said in a statement.

Project Alexandria, named after the ancient library in Alexandria, Egypt, will pull from AI2’s existing projects in machine learning and reasoning; natural language and understanding; and computer vision.
“Despite the recent AI successes, common sense — which is trivially easy for people — is remarkably difficult for AI,” Oren Etzioni, CEO of AI2, said in a statement. “No AI system currently deployed can reliably answer a broad range of simple questions such as: ‘If I put my socks in a drawer, will they still be in there tomorrow?’ or ‘How can you tell if a milk carton is full?’ For example, when AlphaGo beat the number one Go player in the world in 2016, the program did not know that Go is a board game.”
The New York Times reported that Allen’s new investment will double AI2’s budget over the next three years.
Founded in 2014 by Allen and Etzioni, a longtime computer science researcher and entrepreneur, AI2 is now the largest nonprofit AI research center in North America and has gained credibility around the globe for its performance in AI contests, research papers, ability to attract top AI talent, and two spinout companies, Kitt.ai and Xnor.ai.

The beehive of activities for the sixth edition of Social Media Week Lagos kicked off on Monday, February 26 with various interactive sessions, speeches, workshops, master classes, presentations and networking.
One of the interactive sessions was a conversation with the Chairman and CEO of Channels Media group, John Momoh (OON), where social media enthusiast had the opportunity to ask questions bordering on use of social media in Nigeria media.
The veteran broadcaster and media entrepreneur during the session which was titled Future of Media: A Conversation with John Momoh went down memorable lane digging out lessons learnt on his career journey.
Explaining how he started out as a presenter in 1977, he revealed how he worked as a radio presenter for five years, to later work in Television Station. As a young broadcaster, John Momoh was not only hard working; he was restless and curious making him garner a wealth of experience in different departments.

“After five years, I crossed to Television. I joined National Television Authority of Africa (NTA). I was reporting, directing, editing and even worked in engineering,” he said.
The interactive session with the media mogul was not only about learning from his life experience. Mr Momoh also seized the opportunity to talk to the attendants on digital disruption and leveraging on artificial intelligence.
“The biggest disruption to media landscape is that now, you have to go after the consumers. To ensure they get what they want. We have to cast our contents on all mobile devices. Because the world is changing, you cannot do things same way,” he said.

On how to avoid the spread of fake news, Mr Momoh said the responsibility is on the great number of people who mean well for Nigeria media space, adding that consumers should lookout for trustworthy media outlet.
“Fake news is not news. The onus is on the great number of people who mean well. Lookout for brands you can trust. Networks built on trust.”
Artificial intelligence according to Mr Momoh needs to be maximised to  improve broadcasting and journalism and not necessarily render people jobless. He said there is the need to breed young and creative Nigerian broadcasters coupled with the use of artificial intelligence to increase quality.
“Artificial intelligence is to improve our work and not to add to the problem of unemployment,” he said.
