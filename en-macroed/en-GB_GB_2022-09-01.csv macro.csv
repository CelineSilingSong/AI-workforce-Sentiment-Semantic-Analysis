Was it cheating?One judge said the striking piece evoked Renaissance art. But some critics compared it to ‘entering a marathon and driving a Lamborghini to the finish line.’Jason Allen at the Westgate in Las Vegas. (Mikayla Whitmore)12 min770Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.By  Drew HarwellSeptember 2, 2022 at 11:08 a.m. EDTWhen Jason Allen submitted his “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” into the Colorado State Fair’s fine arts competition last week, the sumptuous print was an immediate hit, beating 20 other artists in the “digitally manipulated photography” category to win the first-place blue ribbon and a $300 prize.What Allen had only hinted at, however, was that the artwork had been created in large part by an artificial-intelligence tool, Midjourney, that can generate realistic images at a user’s command. The portrait of three figures, dressed in flowing robes, staring out to a bright beyond, was so finely detailed the judges couldn’t tell.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAllen’s piece offers a clear example of how rapidly AI-generated art has advanced. Trained on billions of internet images, the systems have decisively pushed the boundaries of what computers can create.But it has also sparked a massive debate over the meaning of art, with Allen facing accusations that he had been deceptive in beating out other human artists with something he asked a machine to create.Text-to-image tools like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney have quickly increased in sophistication and become one of the hottest topics in AI. They can generate not just fake people, objects and locations but mimic entire visual styles. Users can demand the art piece look like a cartoon storybook or a historical diagram or an Associated Press photograph, and the system will do its best to oblige.But AI-generated art has been criticized as automated plagiarism, because it relies on millions of ingested art pieces that are then parroted en masse. It has also fueled deeper fears: of decimating people’s creative work, blurring the boundaries of reality or smothering human art.Allen said his art piece shows people need to “get past their denial and fear” of a technology that could empower new inventions and reshape our world. The AI, he said, “is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowBut he also struck a note of defiance at the critics he believed did not appreciate the profound message in his AI-generated art.“You said AI would never be as good as you, that AI would never do the work you do, and I said, ‘Oh really? How about this? I won,’” he said. “It’s here now. Recognize it. Stop denying the reality. AI isn’t going away.”***Allen, 39, lives south of his hometown of Colorado Springs and runs a company, Incarnate Games, that makes tabletop fantasy games. He went into the Air Force after high school and got a computer science degree at a Colorado technical school. He does not consider himself an artist and had never entered an arts competition before.Earlier this year, he said, he started noticing people posting more AI art on social media, but he had been initially skeptical to try it himself due to “spiritual reasons.” Elon Musk, he remembered, had compared AI to “summoning the demon,” and the practice felt like it could be “a gateway into communicating with the unknown.”“That’s what it feels like. This isn’t being created by a human,” Allen said Thursday while watching a jiujitsu tournament in Las Vegas. “There’s a lot to be said about the spiritual meddling of our reality. They would use anything they could to influence humanity.”But the art was just so intricate, he said, that he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He started playing with AI-powered art tools: WOMBO Dream, NightCafe, starryai. Then, someone invited him to Midjourney, and he became obsessed.The Google engineer who thinks the company’s AI has come to lifeMidjourney has become one of the most popular AI art generators largely because it allows anyone to freely create new images on command. Using the prompt “/imagine,” a user can type in whatever they want to see and the AI will return four newly created images in 60 seconds. The user can also ask the AI to improve, or “upscale,” the visual quality with new variations on the same idea.The start-up, which calls itself “an independent research lab … expanding the imaginative powers of the human species,” operates largely out of a 1-million-follower network on the chat service Discord, with rooms devoted to character creation, environments and “show and tell.”After paying for a corporate account, Allen started generating thousands of images, changing the text prompts with every creation. He experimented with new settings, scenarios and effects. He asked for images in the styles of Leonardo da Vinci and the American psychedelic artist Alex Grey.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe pieces that really caught his attention, though, were what he now calls his “space opera theater” series. He started with a simple mental image — “a woman in a Victorian frilly dress, wearing a space helmet” — and kept fine-tuning the prompts, “using tests to really make an epic scene, like out of a dream.” He said he spent 80 hours making more than 900 iterations of the art, adding words like “opulent” and “lavish” to fine tune its tone and feel. He declined to share the full series of words he used to create his art, saying it is his artistic product, and that he intends to publish it later. “If there’s one thing you can take ownership of, it’s your prompt,” he said.“I was like: Dude,” he said. “This is so sick! I want to see more of it! I’m addicted! I’m obsessed!”When he found images he really liked, he pulled them into Adobe Photoshop to remove visual artifacts. In one image, the central figure was missing a head, so he also painted in a crop of dark, wavy hair. He used another machine-learning tool, Gigapixel AI, to increase the photos’ quality and sharpness, then printed the three pieces on canvas — all variations on the French phrase for “space opera theater,” which he thought sounded cool — and drove to submit them to the state fair.When he looked at the pieces, he said, he saw “a supernatural reality … something we haven’t even been able to experience yet, past the great beyond.” But the pace of AI art is moving perhaps even faster than the internet. “You’re looking at art from a month ago,” he added. “In technology terms, that’s decades. This piece is antiquated compared to what Midjourney is doing now.”***The state fair in Pueblo, Colo., was an unlikely place for the writing of a new chapter in art history. The 150-year-old festival, known for its horse and livestock competitions, runs a series of more traditional art competitions, including for homemade dolls, quilts, porcelain art and needlework, as well as for the best canned carrots, medicinal remedies and holiday breads.Of the 596 entries in the “fine arts” competition, 21 amateur “emerging artists” submitted pieces of “digitally manipulated photography,” one of the fair’s newest categories. Asked what art materials he had used, Allen told state fair officials only that he used Midjourney — though he did not exactly go into detail, and no one seems to have asked.One of the judges, Dagny McKinley, an author and art historian who runs a playwright festival in nearby Steamboat Springs, remembers walking past Allen’s canvas and being immediately drawn to a piece that felt reminiscent of Renaissance art.“It had an immediate story: People looking out into another world, everyone with their backs to you, no one facing or engaging with the viewers,” she said. “You get interested: What are they seeing?”McKinley said she did not realize the art was AI-generated but said it wouldn’t have changed her judgment anyway; Allen, she said, “had a concept and a vision he brought to reality, and it’s really a beautiful piece.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSebastian Smee, The Washington Post’s art critic, said the piece’s textures and lighting are reminiscent of Gustave Moreau, a late 19th-century artist, associated with the Decadents, who influenced Edgar Degas and Henri Matisse. (He also recalled a quote from the artist Sol LeWitt, who said, “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.”)When Allen announced his victory himself on Midjourney’s Discord channel, saying he had spent “many weeks of fine tuning and curating,” the responses spiraled between muted excitement to outright dread. In a chat board devoted to philosophical debates, one user compared the win to “entering a marathon and driving a Lamborghini to the finish line.” Another user wrote that the “stunt” threatened to “get this tool banned and hated even more.”Ready or not, mass video deepfakes are comingThe win also triggered a flood of rage online. A tweet expressing profane dismay at Allen’s win has been liked more than 85,000 times. Another person tweeted, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.” Allen said he has also gotten “a lot of very nasty hate” in his online inboxes; on his game company’s Instagram profile, one user said he should return his award and “post a public apology before some MAJOR backlash comes your way.”Some of the frustration has come from how the tools were built: a similar tool, Stable Diffusion, was “trained” on 2 billion images taken from the internet, including from personal blogs and amateur-art sites like Flickr and DeviantArt.Allen, however, dismisses the point as shallow: “Where did you learn how to do your art? You looked at art. Whose art was it? You learned their techniques, you studied their art, you added it to your repertoire,” he said.Allen listed the pieces for $750 each, he said, and two were sold at the fair to unknown buyers, though he now frets that he should have charged far more, given that it could be “essentially a piece of art history.” On Discord, some users asked whether he should have been more explicit, to which Allen replied: “Did I have to?”Despite the online furor, Allen’s neighbors seemed more sanguine about adapting to AI. As far as anyone at the Colorado Department of Agriculture can tell, Allen did not break any rules. Pieces for the category are only required to involve “technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Digital filters, color-manipulation tools and the “recombination of images” are all expressly allowed.No one has filed an official grievance over the result, either, department spokeswoman Olga Robak said, though there has been an unrelated dispute in the fair’s goat-shearing contest.Robak, who studied art history, finds the controversy fascinating. “People put bananas on the wall and called it art,” she said. “Even photography was not considered an art form for a long time; people said it was just pushing a button, and now we realize it’s about composition, color, light. Who are we to say that AI is not the same way?”Don’t ask if the duct-tape banana is art. Ask if it’s any good.***Jessica Hair, a 25-year-old receptionist at a doctor’s office who won third place in the competition, said she did not feel Allen had acted unfairly and had no hard feelings about his win.Hair said her “Judge, Jury, Executioner,” which depicts a tuxedoed skeleton on a golden throne surrounded by skulls, took 15 hours to create with a stylus on an iPad Pro. But Allen’s piece took time, effort and subjective judgment, too, and “how do we qualify what is and isn’t art?” she said.She did wonder, though, if it might have broken the fair’s rules requiring all art to have been made by Colorado residents. Would the AI, wherever it exists, qualify?McKinley, the contest judge, said she understands the frustrations from some artists feeling spurned in their craft, and she believes the festival should consider a category purely devoted to AI art. But she sees such technology as opening up a new world of possibilities for artists — and as something it’d be better to embrace, since it isn’t going away.“It’s not going to take away from a beautiful painting or a sculpture you can touch,” she said. “It’s just one more tool we have to advance what we can create.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGregory Block, an oil painter in Denver who was not a part of the competition, said he finds it hard to imagine an AI generator supplanting the hundreds of hours — and all the “heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears” — he’s invested into his art. But he also thinks back to the artists that first inspired him, who used rudimentary devices like the camera lucida, in the 1800s, to aid their own designs.“That was thought of as cheating, too,” he said. “Yet they used it to make these incredible paintings: anatomically correct figures, beautiful soft lighting. … Those steps in technology are elemental to our art. Otherwise, we’d still be doing cave paintings with just our hands and blood.”The AI, he said, can imbue the art with a mysterious beauty, made all the more special because it is so hard to understand. But “the soul any of us can find in a piece of artwork, the emotion, the human struggle we identify with in art is always our own.”“It doesn’t have to necessarily be created out of a human soul, the artwork itself. It is for us to see and react to,” Block said. “We the viewers are, in the end, the ultimate artists. We’re the ones creating the world that is coming in through our eyeballs. That world is in our mind.”Nitasha Tiku contributed to this report.Share770 Comments","[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Technology', 'position': 1, 'item': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Without American chips from companies such as Nvidia and AMD, Chinese organisations will be unable to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for image and speech recognition, among many other tasks.Image recognition and natural language processing are common in consumer applications like smartphones that can answer queries and tag photos. They also have military uses such as scouring satellite imagery for weapons or bases and filtering digital communications for intelligence-gathering purposes.Nvidia said it had booked $400m in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule but has “no assurances” that US officials will grant them.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedDonald Trump’s run of good luck could end this weekend – if Joe Biden does the right thingJonathan FreedlandLiveMore Democrats call for Biden to exit 2024 race as president vows to return to campaign trail – liveJapan asks young people why they are not marrying amid population crisisLiveWindows IT outage live: CrowdStrike CEO ‘deeply sorry’ for global chaos caused by update and warns fix may take time to workMicrosoft Windows IT outage: more than 2,000 flights canceled across US; Fedex and UPS report service delays – as it happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do more-highly cited journals have higher-quality peer review? Reviews are generally confidential and the definition of ‘quality’ is elusive, so this is a difficult question to answer. But researchers who used machine learning to study 10,000 peer-review reports in biomedical journals have tried. They invented proxy measures for quality, which they term thoroughness and helpfulness.

They offer specific solutions for recruiting personnel and cull applications “to leave a manageable number of resumes that meet a position’s requirements,” explains Carme Roselló, the coordinator of labor market projects at Barcelona Activa.First and foremost, automation allows for “fast screening,” says recruitment consultant Juan Gonzalez. Softgarden, the company he works for, currently processes 2 million applications a year for 40,000 recruiters. “There are companies that receive 400 candidates for one position. If you’re hiring for four jobs, how could you sift through 1,200 candidates at once?” he asks.Technologies like Softgarden, a Software as a Service (SaaS) system that allows candidates and companies to connect to applications installed in the cloud, “streamline tasks, accomplishing in 30 minutes what used to take two hours,” says González. He also points out the importance of “respecting the digital rights” set forth in European data protection regulations.One must “make sure that the resume includes the position’s keywords, because the algorithm works like a dictionary”The system “uses artificial intelligence to automatically collect data [by] searching for keywords in the text,” González notes. That’s why he recommends that candidates use a “textual resume, without columns or graphics, that have a simple format and list experience, education and languages in reverse chronological order. Applicants should avoid symbols, illustrations and diagrams because creativity works against us in ATS searches. The resume should be simple and use standard fonts like Arial or Verdana because machines don’t read them all equally well,” Roselló adds.One must “make sure that the position’s keywords appear on the resume, because the algorithm works like a dictionary to match different descriptions,” advises Jaume Alemany, the co-founder of the Etalentum recruitment company. His company just invested $497,650 to create the Robinson system, “a robot that can manage millions of data [bytes] and reduces the risk of automated discards.”Keywords and employee proximityRobinson’s algorithm is “based on information from more than 3,000 recruitment processes, so its learning system identifies the variables that companies consider most important. Even with the rise in telecommuting since the pandemic,” the first concern is employee proximity, Etalentum’s co-founder says. “Although it sounds ridiculous, it’s important to indicate the city where you live and where you want to work, if they’re not the same. For example, if you say that you work in [Los Angeles], but you want to move to [New York City] or take a job there, include the latter city, because otherwise the machine will discard your resume,” Softgarden consultant Juan González notes.Language can also be an important factor to bear in mind. “Depending on the position you’re applying for, it’s [generally] advisable to write your resume in two or three languages, especially in English, because there are machines that are better trained to read [that language],” Alemany points out.Because “recruitment processes are increasingly automated, especially when applications are initially received and screened, we need to personalize and optimize [our] resumes according to the job description and emphasize the information that’s most relevant to the position,” says Nilton Navarro, the brand manager at Infojobs.Carme Roselló notes that it’s essential for “a resume to contain the position’s keywords.” For that reason, she recommends researching the qualities that companies, or robots in this case, are seeking for a given position. “There are many ways to search for keywords,” she says. The most basic way is to analyze the terminology that companies use and find information about similar job profiles on networks like LinkedIn.To make sure that your resume isn’t discarded even though you meet the job requirements, you can avail yourself of tools such as Resume Worded or Zipjob. They let you “upload your resume to perform a scan and see if it would pass the ATS filter,” Roselló says. She also mentions Google’s “very interesting” Interview Warmup, which is “a key interview training tool that gives you information about the words used most frequently in the sector you’re targeting”; she says using it is “a great practice.” The expert insists that it’s important to “stay up to date” on these tricks, because “technology advances very quickly.” She notes that it’s unfortunate that automated systems sometimes discard “good candidates” because of “something outside [the applicants’] control.”The risk of algorithm biasThe proliferation of smart technology and automated decision systems “can jeopardize some working people’s fundamental rights and increase the risk of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or simply personal tastes ... that has an impact that goes beyond the digital world and can widen the social gap, especially among more vulnerable groups,” warns Digital Future Society’s director Cristina Colom.However, she notes that “companies’ use of algorithms and artificial intelligence is here to stay, so the solution isn’t to eliminate the technology but to better control how it’s used and ensure that it protects labor rights and equal opportunities to workplace access.”Colom says that it’s important to practice “technological humanism” from the get-go in designing these digital solutions. She advocates “integrating different visions to create them, with greater diversity in the design and programming teams in terms of gender, race and religion, as well as by discipline, broadening them to include areas such as psychology, anthropology and sociology, to ensure that the sources that feed AI aren’t biased.” Finally, she emphasizes that “technology can help us to be more efficient and effective, but it can never fully replace people.”Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

South Africa intends to enhance the teaching of robotics and coding in public schools through the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Institute.
Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said the AI Institute is being established in partnership with institutions of higher learning, in particular the Johannesburg Business School of the University of Johannesburg and the Tshwane University of Technology, which are co-founder institutions together with the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies.
“It is essential that we invest significantly to provide our youth with access to modern training, skill sets and formal education. To achieve this, our Department of Basic Education has introduced robotics and coding as school subjects in primary and high schools.
“At present, learners in over a 1 000 schools are designing and producing robots both for gaming and to complete tasks the learners find tedious for human completion.
“Next year, learners in these and additional schools that will join this category will compete in a National Robotics Development Challenge,” the Minister said on Thursday during the G20 Digital Economy Ministers Meeting in Bali, Indonesia.
Government’s focus on digital skills includes creating platforms to support and promote the ability of the youth, and small and medium enterprises, in particular start-ups to develop digital content.
“In this regard, South Africa will launch an App Store to be known as DigiTech on the 13 September 2022. We have undertaken to our sister countries within Africa to ensure that content producers from the rest of the Africa can have their Apps enrolled on the DigiTech App Store,” the Minister said.
Bridging the digital divide
With technology changing how people work and live, Ntshavheni said governments have the responsibility to continue to use technology as a primary catalyst for change in the world that should advance accessible public services, inclusive growth, and sustainable development.
She noted that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the negative impact of the digital divide in human development in particular the poor.
“In South Africa and the majority of the developing world, in particular in Africa, where the poor remained unconnected, the poor were severely marginalised during the COVID-19 pandemic because they were excluded from accessing basic services such as education, health and ability to work.
“It is for this reason that we prioritised and concluded the licensing of the high demand spectrum and also secured the commitment of our telecommunications regulator to ensure that the Frequency Spectrum licence holders contribute towards the national broadband penetration objectives by connecting key public institutions such as schools, health facilities, and traditional authorities.
“In addition, this year we will finalise the roadmap towards the deployment of 4G and 5G networks including to rural towns. We continue to work to attain the objectives of our South Africa Connect programme to ensure that we attain universal access to the internet by 2024,” the Minister said.
Government is also extending email addresses to all learners/students in public schools and their parents as part of requirements of basic e-learning. – SAnews.gov.za

While the development has reignited the fierce debate over AI in art, the man behind the artwork is unfazed. Amid criticism, he told The New York Times, “I’m not going to apologise for it…I won, and I didn’t break any rules.” Artwork and the winner The winner, Jason Allen, is president of Colorado-based tabletop gaming company Incarnate Games. He won in the digital art category with a work called “Théâtre D'opéra Spatial” or ‘Space Opera Theater’. As the title suggests, the artwork depicts a space setting with figures in robes looking out through a viewport. The work brings together space opera and classical Baroque elements. How was the artwork created? It was created using Midjourney, which is an AI software that converts text prompts into visual images. The beta version of the software was available from July 2022 and it has allowed users with no training in art to create highly detailed artworks. Critics of AI-generated art, such as this one, argue that converting prompts into art is like painting-by-numbers, which means that there is no real artistry or skill involved. Midjourney, in a matter of minutes, can create a digital artwork that would ordinarily take hours, if not days. “Users type a series of words in a message to Midjourney; the bot spits back an image seconds later,” The NYT noted. AI threat to art? After Allen’s post about his award-winning artwork made it to Twitter, it was met with severe backlash. “This is so gross,” a user wrote. “I can see how AI art can be beneficial, but claiming you’re an artist by generating one? Absolutely not.” Yet another tweet went, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold before our eyes — if creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsolete.” The winner’s defence Midjourney typically creates a number of versions using the prompts and users choose the best outcomes. Allen reportedly had hundreds of iterations of which he chose the top three, and printed them on canvas. According to reports, he submitted it in the digital art category under the name “Jason M Allen via Midjourney”, which meant that he had disclosed the nature of the artwork to the judges. Furthermore, as The New York Times reported, the category’s rules allow any “artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” This could mean that using AI programs to create art is no different from using other software such as Photoshop. The judges, however, were unaware that Midjourney was an AI program but went on to state that they would have declared Allen as the winner even if they had. Many believe that the increasing popularity of AI-based will lead to the creation of a separate category that keeps it distinct from other forms of digital art.",explained,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-19,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/09/ai-art-1.jpg', 'caption': 'Jason Allen&#039;s “Théâtre D&#039;opéra Spatial” or ‘Space Opera Theater’.

Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.In August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division's ""digital arts/digitally manipulated photography"" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition.His winning image, titled Théâtre D'opéra Spatial (French for Space Opera Theatre), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts.

And it think everyone should see it,"" Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.Allen's winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It's one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use ""digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process"". Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.

The newness of these tools, how they're used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney's Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen's win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice's Motherboard reported earlier this week.""This sucks for the exact same reason we don't let robots participate in the Olympics,"" one Twitter user wrote.
""This is the literal definition of 'pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece',"" another Tweeted.""AI artwork is the 'banana taped to the wall' of the digital world now.""Yet while Allen didn't use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.""It's not like you're just smashing words together and winning competitions,"" he said.You can feed a phrase like ""an oil painting of an angry strawberry"" to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen's process wasn't that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.First, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said.Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and colour harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images.He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless.Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.""Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognise that it's a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,"" Allen said.Cal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen's piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn't realise that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a ""beautiful piece"".Near-complete dinosaur skeleton sells for 10 times predictionView Gallery""I think there's a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,"" he said.Allen won't yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he's planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.Continue readingArtificial IntelligenceartsTechcompetitionWorldUSACONTACT USSend your stories to contact@9news.com.auProperty News: Watch as the ocean creeps in to swallow this waterfront mansion.

Intel plans to launch several initiatives such as &#039;AI for future workforce&#039; and &#039;AI for current workforce&#039; by the end of this year with an aim to build skill-ready workforce, Shweta Khurana, senior director – Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ), government partnerships and initiatives, global government affairs, Intel told FE Education Online. “AI for future workforce will cater to 18 years and above and AI for current workforce is for professionals with primary focus on women driven small and medium enterprises (SMEs),” Khurana said. The programme will be delivered virtually by an Intel certified coach. As per the company, the curriculum designed for AI for future workforce is technical; however; students does not require any prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, projects under the programme are focussed on industrial impacts such as common trade application, predictive maintenance, viral post protection, insurance fraud protection among others. “Through virtual training in a real-world environment for three months learners will be exposed to the challenges, and how to build solutions for the same,” Khurana added. Earlier initiatives from Intel included Intel AI for youth, Responsible AI for Youth and Building AI Readiness among Young Innovators. Under these three initiatives, over 3,50,000 students have been trained with AI skills since 2019. Under Intel AI for youth programmes the learners acquire technical skills in data science, computer vision and natural language processes as well as social skills focused on AI ethics and biases and AI solutions-building. For this, Intel has collaborated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and the Ministry of Education (MoE) and AI curriculum for students, setting up focused AI skill labs, and creation of AI-readiness by skilling facilitators in CBSE schools. Responsible AI for youth initiative empowers government school students between eight to 12th grade with a new-age technology mindset, relevant skill sets, and access to required tools. Intel has collaborated with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEitY), Government of India (GoI), National e-Governance Division (NeGD), to launch this programme. In July 2021, Intel launched the AI For All initiative in collaboration with the MoE&nbsp; with the purpose of creating a basic understanding of AI for everyone in India. AI For All is a four hour, self-paced learning program that demystifies AI in an inclusive manner. It is applicable to a student or a stay-at-home parent, a professional in any field or even a senior citizen. The programme is aimed to demystify AI for one million Indian citizens in its first year. Furthermore, in March 2022, Intel joined hands with the Department of Science and Technology (DST), GoI for its programme ‘Building AI Readiness among Young Innovators’ that aims to build digital readiness among students between six to 10 grade enrolled under DST’s INSPIRE – Awards MANAK scheme. The programme aims to build an AI-ready generation to empower students with the knowledge and skills to leverage AI in an inclusive way.
