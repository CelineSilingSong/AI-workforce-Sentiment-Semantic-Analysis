PricewaterhouseCoopers, the large accounting and management consulting firm, released a startling report indicating that workers will be highly impacted by the fast-growing rise of artificial intelligence, robots and related technologies.


Banking and financial services employees, factory workers and office staff will seemingly face the loss of their jobs—or need to find a way to reinvent themselves in this brave new world. 

 The term “artificial intelligence” is loosely used to describe the ability of a machine to mimic human behavior. AI includes well-known applications, such as Siri, GPS, Spotify, self-driving vehicles and the larger-than-life robots made by Boston Robotics that perform incredible feats.

While many reports tout the benefits of AI, there are many risks and unintended consequences, including the likelihood of replacing millions of human workers and unethical uses of the technology. For instance, China is using facial recognition to closely scrutinize its citizens who could be punished for certain transgressions. The country has been accused of using facial recognition to profile Muslims in its Xinjiang region. Recently, there were privacy concerns raised about FaceApp, the Russian-backed, face-ageing application.

Bloomberg reports that “more than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” The amount of individuals who will be impacted is immense. The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence claims Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm. It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.

While the study claims that employees can learn new skills, its logic is suspect to the realities. In an effort to save billions of dollars in labor costs, Amazon warehouses have thousands of little, cute, orange robots made by Kiva, a robotics company acquired by Amazon for $775 million. The Kiva robots needs only 15 minutes to find, pick and package an order, whereas a human needs about 60-75 minutes to accomplish the same tasks. I’ve spoken with workers at Amazon fulfillment centers and they claim that the pace and toll it takes on the human body is too much too handle. Humans simply can’t compete against robots due to our inherent limitations.

Mark Cuban, who became a billionaire with his tech company and is now the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said in a CNBC interview, “President Donald Trump should be more aware of tech advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence and how that will impact America’s future.” Cuban said, “I’m willing to bet that these companies building new plants...this will lead to fewer people being employed.”
“Computers, intelligent machine, and robots seem like the workforce of the future. And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government,” predicts Elon Musk, the cofounder and CEO of Tesla.
AI, robotics and technology will displace millions of workers. It's already happening. AI is used by investment banks, law and accounting firms, hospitals and corporations to displace people involved with rote activities and lower-end, white-collar jobs. If your job can be replaced by AI, it will—and you’ll need a new career.
This has already adversely impacted highly-paid Wall Street professionals including stock and bond traders. These are the people who used to work on the trading floors at investment bank and trade securities for their banks, clients and themselves. It was a very lucrative profession until algorithms, quant-trading software and programs disrupted the business and rendered their skills unnecessary—compared to the fast-acting technology. 
There is no hiding from the robots. Well-trained and experienced doctors will be pushed aside by sophisticated robots that can perform delicate surgeries better and read x-rays more efficiently and accurately to detect cancerous cells that can’t be readily seen by the human eye. Shoppers use self checkout machines at a Kroger Co. supermarket in Louisville, Kentucky, ...

Truck and cab drivers, cashiers, retail sales associates and people who work in manufacturing plants and factories have and will continue to be replaced by robotics and technology. Driverless vehicles, kiosks in fast food restaurants and self-help, quick-phone scans at stores will soon eliminate most minimum-wage and low-skilled jobs.
This trend will benefit coders and computer engineers. They will be the great beneficiaries of this emergence—that is until AI can learn to code as well as—or better— than the humans. To be fair, there are and will be new jobs created along with the disruption. Run a search on Google for Jobs and you’ll see thousands of listings for AI, robotics, coding, data analytics, coding, tech and related postings. The studies are somewhat optimistic and claim that the rise of the machines aren’t taking away all the jobs. Rather, they will change the descriptions of jobs and add more roles.
Andrew Yang, Democratic presidential hopeful, is one of the few candidates vocalizing concerns about the ascendancy of AI.  Yang’s official website offers the following:
“Advances in automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold the potential to bring about new levels of prosperity humans have never seen. They also hold the potential to disrupt our economies, ruin lives throughout several generations, and, if experts such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are to be believed, destroy humanity.
Billionaire founder of Microsoft and outspoken philanthropist, Bill Gates, has called for a tax on robots due to the disruption that will occur, resulting in the loss of jobs and tax revenue. “Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level,” Gates said in an interview with Quartz. ""You cross the threshold of job replacement of certain activities of all sorts at once,"" Gates added. ""So, you know, warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there's quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that, certainly in the next 20 years [will go away].""
Technology is advancing at a pace never before seen in human history. Even those developing it, don’t fully understand how it works or what direction it’s taking. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that a computer—given certain directives—can learn tasks much faster than humans thought possible even a year ago. We’re heading into this new world with no idea on how to regulate it, and a regulatory system that’s designed for technology that’s much less sophisticated than what we’re facing in the near future.
Technological innovation shouldn’t be stopped, but it should be monitored and analyzed to make sure we don’t move past a point of no return. This will require cooperation between the government and private industry to ensure that developing technologies can continue to improve our lives without destroying them.”

Published: Sep 28, 2019 10:06 AM ESTSusan Fourtané5 years ago0ShareHuman+Machine Collaboration AndreyPopov/iStock In this age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we are witnessing a transformation in the way we live, work, and do business. From robots that share our environment and smart homes to supply chains that think and act in real-time, forward-thinking companies are using AI to innovate and expand their business more rapidly than ever. 
Indeed, this is a time of change and change happens fast. Those able to understand that the future includes living, working, co-existing, and collaborating with AI are set to succeed in the coming years. On the other hand, those who neglect the fact that business transformation in the digital age depends on human and machine collaboration will inevitably be left behind.   Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

Humans and machines can complement each other resulting in increasing productivity. This collaboration could increase revenue by 38 percent by 2022, according to Accenture Research. At least 61 percent of business leaders agree that the intersection of human and machine collaboration is going to help them achieve their strategic priorities faster and more efficiently. 
Human and machine collaboration is paramount for organizations. Having the right mindset for AI means being at ease with the concept of human+machine, leaving the mindset of human Vs. machine behind. Thanks to AI, factories are now requiring a little more humanity; and AI is boosting the value of engineers and manufacturers. 
Business transformation in the era of AI 
The emergence of AI is creating brand new roles and opportunities for humans up and down the value chain. From workers in the assembly line and maintenance specialists to robot engineers and operations managers, AI is regenerating the concept and meaning of work in an industrial setting. 
According to Accenture‘s Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, and H. James Wilson, Managing Director of Information Technology and Business Research, AI is transforming business processes in five ways: 


Flexibility: A change from rigid manufacturing processes with automation done in the past by dumb robots to smart individualized production following real-time customer choices brings flexibility to businesses. This is particularly visible in the automotive manufacturing industry where customers can customize their vehicle at the dealership. They can choose everything from dashboard components to the seat leather –or vegan leather– to tire valve caps. For instance, at Stuttgart’s Mercedes-Benz assembly line there are no two vehicles that are the same. 


Speed: Speed is super important in many industries, including finance. The detection of credit card fraud on the spot can guarantee a card holder that a transaction will not be approved if fraud was involved, saving time and headaches if this is detected too late. According to Daugherty and Wilson, HSBC Holdings developed an AI-based solution that uses improved speed and accuracy in fraud detection. The solution can monitor millions of transactions on a daily basis seeking subtle pattern that can possibly signal fraud. This type of solution is great for financial institutions. Yet, they need the human collaboration to be continually updated. Without the updates required, soon the algorithms would become useless for combating fraud. Data analysts and financial fraud experts must keep an eye on the software at all times to assure the AI solution is at least one step ahead of criminals. 

Scale: In order to accelerate its recruiting evaluation to improve diversity, Unilever adopted an AI-based hiring system that assesses candidate’s body language and personality traits. Using this solution, Unilever was able to broaden its recruiting scale; job applicants doubled to 30,000, and the average time for arriving to a hiring decision decreased to four weeks. The process used to take up to four months before the adoption of the AI system. 


Decision Making: There is no secret to the fact that the best decision that people make are based on specific, tailored information received in vast amounts. Using machine learning and AI a huge amount of data can be quickly available at the fingertips of workers on the factory floor, or to service technicians solving problems out in the field. All data previously collected and analyzed brings invaluable information that helps humans solve problems much faster or even prevent such problems before they happen. Take the case of GE and its Predix application. The solution uses machine-learning algorithms to predict when a specific part in a specific machine might fail. Predix alerts workers to potential problems before they become serious. In many cases, GE could save millions of dollars thanks to this technology collaborating with fast human action.

Personalization: AI makes possible individual tailoring, on-demand brand experiences at great scale. Music streaming service Pandora, for instance, applies AI algorithms to generate personalized playlists based on preferences in songs, artists, and genres. AI can use data to personalize anything and everything delivering a more enjoyable user experience. AI brings marketing to a new level. 

AI will create new roles and opportunities 
Of course, some roles will come to an end as it has happened in the history of humanity every time there has been a technological revolution. However, the changes toward human and machine collaboration require the creation of new roles and the recruiting of new talent; it is not just a matter of implementing AI technology. We also need to remember that there is no evolution without change. 
Robotics and AI will replace some jobs liberating humans for other kinds of tasks, many that do not yet exist as many of today’s positions and jobs did not exist a few decades ago. Since 2000, the United States has lost five million manufacturing jobs. However, Daugherty and Wilson think that things are not as clear cut as they might seem.
In the United States alone, there are going to be needed around 3.4 million more job openings covered in the manufacturing sector. One reason for this is the need to cover the Baby Boomers’ retirement plans.
Re-skilling: Developing fusion skills
Re-skilling is now paramount and applies to everyone who wishes to remain relevant. Paul Daugherty recommends enterprises to help existing employees develop what he calls fusion skills. 
In their book Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, a must-read for business leaders looking for a practical guide on adopting AI into their organization, Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson identify eight fusion skills for the workplace:
Rehumanizing time: People will have more time to dedicate toward more human activities, such as increasing interpersonal interactions and creativity.
Responsible normalizing: It is time to normalize the purpose and perception of human and machine interaction as it relates to individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. 
Judgment integration: A machine may be uncertain about something or lack the necessary business or ethical context to make decisions. In such case, humans must be prepared to sense where, how, and when to step in and provide input. 
Intelligent interrogation: Humans simply can’t probe massively complex systems or predict interactions between complex layers of data on their own. It is imperative to have the ability to ask machines the right smart questions across multiple levels. 
Bot-based empowerment: A variety of bots are available to help people be more productive and become better at their jobs. Using the power of AI agents can extend human’s capabilities, reinvent business processes, and even boost a human’s professional career. 
Holistic (physical and mental) melding: In the age of human and machine fusion, holistic melding will become increasingly important. The full reimagination of business processes only becomes possible when humans create working mental models of how machines work and learn, and when machines capture user-behavior data to update their interactions.
Reciprocal apprenticing: In the past, technological education has gone in one direction: People have learned how to use machines. But with AI, machines are learning from humans, and humans, in turn, learn again from machines. In the future, humans will perform tasks alongside AI agents to learn new skills, and will receive on-the-job training to work well within AI-enhanced processes. 
Relentless reimagining: This hybrid skill is the ability to reimagine how things currently are—and to keep reimagining how AI can transform and improve work, organizational processes, business models, and even entire industries.
In Human + Machine, the authors propose a continuous circle of learning, an exchange of knowledge between humans and machines. Humans can work better and more efficiently with the help of AI. According to the authors, in the long term, companies will start rethinking their business processes, and as they do they will cover the needs for new humans in the new ways of doing business. 
They believe that “before we rewrite the business processes, job descriptions, and business models, we need to answer these questions: What tasks do humans do best? And, what do machines do best?” The transfer of jobs is not simply one way. In many cases, AI is freeing up to creativity and human capital, letting people work more like humans and less like robots. 
Giving these paramount questions and the concepts proposed by Daugherty and Wilson, giving them some thought might be crucial at the time of deciding what is the best strategy you should take as a business leader in your organization in order to change and adapt in the age of AI. 
The authors highlight how embracing the new rules of AI can be beneficial at the time businesses are reimagining processes with a focus on an exchange of knowledge between humans and machines.  RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Prolific science and science fiction writer Isaac Asimov (1920–1992) developed the Three Laws of Robotics, in the hope of guarding against potentially dangerous artificial intelligence. They first appeared in his 1942 short story Runaround:
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
Asimov fans tell us that the laws were implicit in his earlier stories. 
A 0th law was added in Robots and Empire (1985): “A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”
Here’s Asimov discussing his Laws:



Chris Stokes, a philosopher at Wuhan University in China, says, “Many computer engineers use the three laws as a tool for how they think about programming.” But the trouble is, they don’t work. 
He explains in an open-access paper: 
The First Law fails because of ambiguity in language, and because of complicated ethical problems that are too complex to have a simple yes or no answer.    The Second Law fails because of the unethical nature of having a law that requires sentient beings to remain as slaves.   The Third Law fails because it results in a permanent social stratification, with the vast amount of potential exploitation built into this system of laws.    The ‘Zeroth’ Law, like the first, fails because of ambiguous ideology. All of the Laws also fail because of how easy it is to circumvent the spirit of the law but still remaining bound by the letter of the law.  Chris Stokes, “Why the three laws of robotics do not work” at International Journal of Research in Engineering and Innovation (IJREI) 
Maybe we’d better hope it never gets tested in real life?  At any rate, here at Mind Matters News, it’s Sci-Fi Saturday so we asked some of our contributors for reactions to the laws and to Stokes’s doubts about them: 
Jonathan Bartlett: The laws of robotics utilize ordinary and purposive language.  That works for ordinary and purposive human beings.  But robots are not human.  Therefore, those rules should be adapted to be the rules of the robot-makers, not those of the robots themselves.  These can be translated into rules for robot-makers as follows:
Bartlett offers rules for robot makers instead: 
1) Robots should only be built with human safety in mind.  Designers should recognize that humans can make mistakes and safeguards against preventable mistakes should be built-in.
2A) Robotic behavior should be predictable so that human operators can appropriately understand how the robot’s input will direct its actions.  The goal should be to make the behavior understandable/predictable by the human so that the human can work with it in a seamless manner.
2B) There should be clarity regarding which user(s) is in control of the robot, both for the robot itself and for those around it.  That is, if a robot is following a task that will lead to danger, it should be clear to others nearby who has the ability and responsibility to cancel the request.  
2C) The robot should be built such that the person in control should remain in control unless privilege is explicitly transferred by the original party or is taken by someone with greater privilege (i.e., a foreman, a policeman, etc.)
2D) An exception is that a robot’s actions should be cancellable by anyone nearer to the situation than the operator
2E) Any sequence of robot coordination should not be endangered if any robot’s actions in the sequence are canceled (i.e., canceling the actions of a robot endangering a human should not inadvertently cause danger to other parts of the process)
3) Robots should have internal sensors, controls, and reporting so that they can report to humans any detectable or predictable malfunction before it causes a hazard.
He adds: The laws of robots, as they were envisioned by Asimov, assumed that you could program a computer just as if you were speaking to a human.  If we treat robotics as an engineering discipline instead, we can develop rules for robot development that do indeed prevent danger to humans.  Imagining the future is fun, and even necessary.  However, trying to find appropriate rules for future robots that may never exist should not interfere with developing good ethical ground rules for developing robots in the near future.
Brendan Dixon pops in to say: It’s even worse than he says! The “laws” are ambiguous, even for a human. For example, what does it mean to not “harm”? Actually quite sticky to work out.
The flaw with the laws is this: They assume that morality and moral decisions can be made by means of an algorithm, that discrete yes/no answers suffice to “solve” moral quandaries. They are not sufficient. (Or, to be sufficient would require many, many, many more “laws” than those specified to cover the vast array of “what if” and “but he” qualifications that always arise.)
Law of Hammurabi chiseled in stone
Here is an interesting data point: I recently learned that the Law of Hammurabi (approximately 1750 BC, chiseled into a stele now in the Louvre) was the most frequently copied ancient law code. And yet, in all the law cases we’ve discovered, it is never referenced or used. Why? Because ancient law codes sought to teach users how to think about making wise decisions vs. encoding specific rules about the decisions you should make. This highlights the challenge of robotics: Robots would require that we can code into rules the decisions they should make, but moral decisions require wisdom, a mind trained how to think so that it can handle each case properly.
Eric Holloway offered: I find it ironic that while there are supposedly objective moral laws for robots, humans themselves do not have objective moral laws
I wonder if a logical consequence of the 3 robot laws that the robots must teach humans objective moral laws, e.g. in order to avoid “through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”  So, for instance, the robots would bring a halt to all war, abortions, and euthanasia throughout the world, and embark on a massive evangelization effort to prevent humans causing themselves infinite harm by going to hell.
Brendan Dixon responded by identifying the underlying conflict between the 0th law and the others: Nice thought, but it assumes a definition of harm with an individualized focus. What if harm instead (and I don’t agree with this) is measured in utilitarian terms at the level of a population? Whole other ball game. That’s the problem.
Eric Holloway suggested how the robot might think that out: In which case, the best way to minimize harm to the population is to wipe out everyone.  Of course, there is a lot of short term harm in wiping out everyone, but it is much less in aggregate than the accumulation of harm throughout many thousands of future generations. Or, a bit less extreme, sterilize everyone.  That way minimize harm to currently existing humans, and there will be no future humans to be harmed.
Well! Perhaps it’s a good thing that artificial general intelligence of the sort Asimov was trying to make laws for is doubtful for a variety of reasons anyway. 
Here’s Computerphile’s view: The Laws never worked even in fiction. Asimov’s robot books “are all about the way these laws go wrong, with various consequences.” 




Just for fun, Eric Holloway explains why “friendly” artificial intelligence will kill you: 
Is that a shocking idea? Let’s follow the logic: We don’t want to invent a stupid god who accidentally turns the universe into grey goo or paperclips, But any god we create in our image will be just as incompetent and evil as we are, if not more so. A dilemma!

AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOTS (AMRs) work collaboratively with people to create highly productive work environments by automating repetitive and injury-prone material transportation. While the robots use sensors and algorithms to safely navigate even dynamic environments, they aren’t able to apply this sensory input for advanced decision-making. The next step in the evolution of AMRs is the addition of artificial intelligence (AI) to increase the capabilities of smart mobile robots. AI will make these robots even more efficient, increase the range of tasks the robots can perform, and reduce the need for work-environment adaptations to accommodate them.
 
The Transition to Artificial Intelligence
Today, mobile robots use sensors and software for control (to define where and how the robot should move) and perception (to allow the robot to understand and react to its surroundings). Data comes from integrated laser scanners, 3D cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, wheel encoders, and more to produce the most efficient decisions for each situation. These technologies give AMRs many of the capabilities that have become familiar and desirable in today’s automobiles. The robots are able to dynamically navigate using the most efficient routes, have environmental awareness so they can avoid obstacles or people in their path, and can automatically charge when needed. Without AI, however, the robots react the same way to all obstacles, slowing and attempting to navigate around the person or object if possible, or stopping or backing up if there is no safe way to maneuver around it. The AMR’s standard approach is appropriate in nearly every situation, but in the same way that AI is powering new capabilities for self-driving cars and intelligent drones, it is also poised to dramatically change robotics.

Artificial Intelligence includes several branches. The AI that is used in autonomous mobile robots at this stage is focused on machine learning and vision systems.

The strategically placed MiR AI Camera static cameras enable the MiR robots to foresee obstacles on their routes, so they are able to re-route beforehand for optimized navigation.
AI for collaborative robots is focused primarily on machine learning (ML) and vision systems today, which are dramatically extending earlier sensor-based capabilities. Technology advances and market maturity in several key areas are enabling these innovations:


A wide array of small, low-cost, and power-efficient sensors allow mobile and remote devices to capture and transmit huge amounts of data about the robot’s immediate, extended, and anticipated environment as well as internal conditions.


Cloud computing and broadband wireless communications allow the data to be stored, processed, and accessed almost instantly, from any access point. Secure virtual networks can adapt to dynamic requirements and nearly eliminate downtime and bottlenecks.


Powerful new AI-focused processor architectures are widely available from both traditional semiconductor companies such as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm as well as new players in the field, including Google and Microsoft. While traditional broad-use semiconductors are facing the limits of Moore’s Law, these new chips are purpose-designed for AI calculations, which is driving up capabilities while driving down costs. Low-power, cost-effective AI processors can be incorporated into even small mobile or remote devices, allowing onsite computation for fast, efficient decisions.


Sophisticated software algorithms analyze and process data in the most productive locations—in the robot, in the cloud, or even in remote, extended sensors that provide additional intelligence data for the robot to anticipate needs and proactively adapt its behavior.


Using these capabilities, fleets of robots behave like a group of students taking online classes. They learn while they are online, and then are able to perform without constant access to online content. Low-power, AI-capable devices and efficientAI techniques support new robotic systems with low latency and fast reaction times, high autonomy, and low power consumption—all key elements for success.

Artificial Intelligence in AMRs Improves Path Planning and Environmental Interaction
Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR) is driving advances in AI in mobile robots and establishing new industry expectations. Innovative AI capabilities maintain the robots’ safety protocols and drive improved efficiency in path planning and environmental interaction.
AI is implemented in advanced learning algorithms in the robot’s software as well as in remote, connected cameras that can be mounted in high-traffic areas or in the paths of fork trucks or other automated vehicles. The cameras are equipped with small, efficient embedded computers that can process anonymized data and run sophisticated analysis software to identify whether objects in the area are humans, fixed obstacles, or other types of mobile devices, such as AGVs. The cameras then feed this information to the robot, extending the robot’s understanding of its surroundings so it can adapt its behavior appropriately, even before it enters an area. The AI-capable network helps the robot avoid high-traffic areas during specific times, such as when goods are regularly delivered and transferred by fork truck, or when large crowds of workers are present, such as during breaks or shift changes.
With AI, MiR robots can efficiently and appropriately react to different types of obstacles to improve navigation and efficiency. As an example, if they face an AMR from another manufacturer, they can predict that vehicle’s motion and adjust appropriately. When encountering a new, unknown object, the robot can be cautious and observant, collecting data so that it can calculate the best possible behavior for future interactions.
Similarly, in complex, highly dynamic environments—such as those with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that can’t deviate from their fixed path or with human-driven fork trucks or other unpredictable vehicles—the robot’s ability to maneuver may be limited. AGVs’ safety mechanisms are typically limited to forced stops when encountering obstacles, for instance, which can block the AMR. AI-powered MiR AMRs can identify the AGV and be aware of its limitations, so that instead of stopping and requiring operator intervention to reroute it, they can automatically wait in a safe position until the AGV has passed, resuming their mission when it is safe to do so.
While the robots’ built-in safety mechanisms will always stop the robot from colliding with an object, person, or vehicle in its path, other vehicles, such as human-driven fork trucks, may not have those capabilities, leaving the risk of one of them running into the robot. A MiR robot system can detect high-traffic areas before it arrives and can identify other vehicles and behave appropriately to decrease the risk of collision.In this way, not only are AMRs improving their own behavior with AI, but are also adapting to other vehicles’ limitations.

Left: MiR AI Camera detects an object it was configured to react to, which prevents MiR robots from crossing the zone marked in red.Right: MiR camera detects a person and is configured not to react in this case, since the person is capable of efficiently avoiding the robot. The zone marked in green can be crossed by MiR robots in this case.
 
Addressing AI Concerns
AI is still new enough to raise concerns around security and privacy of the data being captured and used, as well as ensuring safety if AI systems fail or are interfered with. Key questions for customers as they consider AI-powered systems include:


Where and how is data stored, secured, and processed?


How long is data stored?


What personally identifiable information is captured?


What back-up safety mechanisms are in place?


To protect security and privacy, MiR robots and AI cameras only send decisions, not images. Since all the required computational power exists inside each device, data captured by vision sensors is processed right away into shapes, sizes, and colors, then classified into specific categories and used for decision-making. Therefore, the only kind of data that can be sent are commands that AMRs can understand, such as stop or resume; information on changes to the environment, such as a blocked path or a crowded area; or new actions to be taken, such as the choice of an alternative route.
While safety in robotic AI systems is sometimes raised as a concern, MiR’s primary safety mechanisms are core to the robot and cannot be overridden by AI decisions. For instance, while laser scanners on the robot provide data for AI systems, they also make fundamental safety decisions to mechanically stop MiR robots from proceeding under any circumstances if there are people or obstacles in the robot’s path.
 
The Future of Robotic AI
Mobile robots will continue to be collaborative entities, and with AI, the technological barrier between them and humans will continue to shrink, increasing collaboration and efficiency.
As AI advances, we will gain the ability to interact with robots more naturally using speech or gestures. That might include holding up a hand to make the robot stop, pointing it to a preferred direction, or waving it on to pass or follow—or simply telling it, “This hallway will be blocked for the next two hours, take another route until then.”
While mobile robots will still be a controllable tool with emergency stop buttons, they will gain autonomy that will make them even more valuable. They will be able to understand where their routine can be improved and suggest better paths to their destination, more productive times of the day to execute tasks, other robots that could be deployed for more efficient workflows, and the most appropriate time to recharge.
AI-powered AMRS will help turn workplaces into organic, data-driven environments, in which robots share relevant data from their own or remote sensors to help fleets of robots make informed decisions. With this data-sharing model, each robot essentially has access to every sensor in every other robot or camera, providing it with a much more detailed view of its entire environment, thus enabling much more efficient path-planning performance.
 
AI: Powering the Next Industrial Revolution
As in previous industrial revolutions, AI and robotics will make many laborious and undesirable tasks obsolete. With AI, MiR robots can manage repetitive, low-value material-transport tasks even more efficiently and cost-effectively, freeing humans for more meaningful activities. And with severe labor shortages holding back companies around the world, smarter mobile robots will allow companies to offer rewarding roles that help them attract and retain valued employees.
