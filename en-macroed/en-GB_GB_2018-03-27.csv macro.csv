In 2017 companies spent around $22bn on AI-related mergers and acquisitions, about 26 times more than in 2015. The McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank within a consultancy, reckons that just applying AI to marketing, sales and supply chains could create economic value, including profits and efficiencies, of $2.7trn over the next 20 years.

We live in amazing times. Driverless cars, drones delivering packages and chatbots taking our fast food orders. In fact, this entire “thing” of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is now being called the next industrial revolution. And it does not come without a lot of fear about a large workforce losing its jobs and means of making a living.

When the first industrial revolution hit, factories and mass production drew workers to the cities in droves. Manufacturing put individual craftsmen out of business. Consumers could get products cheaper and faster and that was a good thing. Yes, some workers were obviously displaced. But along with the “revolution,” new jobs were created and, over time, employment reached high levels.
Fears about the new robotic revolution
Of course, technology will eliminate many jobs – it has always done so. And predictions about those job losses range from a few million to over a billion, as a recent MIT study revealed.
PROMOTED
Why this variance? Because no one can predict accurately exactly all of the jobs that robots and AI will assume from humans over the next few decades. We just don’t know where the technology will take us.

At the same time, we cannot predict the numbers of new jobs/careers that new technology will create. One study from Gartner Research states that while 1.8 million jobs will be lost by 2020, 2.3 million new ones will be created.
Even today, there are a huge number of technology jobs that did not exist ten years ago: State-of-the-art programming, data science, web security, marketing and sales. There is no reason to believe that the need for humans to create and manage new technology will decrease.

And in developed countries, with comparative salary data readily available for various industries, far fewer people are willing to enter low-paying work force jobs that require no thinking and that do not allow people to have a decent lifestyle. Young people who graduate high school often have vocational-technical skills that allow them to enter the workforce with skills that are needed. Others opt for vocational-technical or community college programs where they learn to use the latest technology.
China is a prime example. Automation, through robotics and AI, has moved China to a major economic force in the global economy. Because of its focus on automation and new technology, China now exports far more than it imports, and as a result, is having a huge impact on the global supply chain. Smaller countries with less to invest are seeing some negative consequences and they will suffer from the inability to compete. On the other hand, they can take a lesson from countries like India that have moved into areas of technology that are in high demand. There are jobs – the key is the right training of people to work within an environment of robotics and AI.
Humans create and humans control
Robots and AI have been created by humans – they are tools that we can use when we give the right instructions. The point is that humans and technology must work together, humans in control and the technology providing what it is programmed to provide. The idea that technology will replace the need for creative thinking, problem-solving, leadership, teamwork and initiative is rather silly right now. The idea that humans can leverage technology to provide a better world for all of us is not silly, however. It’s fascinating.
Consider this: One of the industries that have seen the greatest disruption of robotics and AI has been medicine. We now have robotic and AI tools that can perform amazingly accurate diagnoses and precise surgery. Have we lost doctors to this technology? The answer is “no.” Doctors have simply learned to leverage the new technology to provide better healthcare.
Finding your place in a robotic world
Robots and AI will certainly replace jobs – boring, dangerous, and dirty ones mostly. Consider coal mining for example. How many people still want to go down into a mineshaft and dig out coal? How many want to subject themselves to black lung disease and a host of other health problems from that job? This is why coal mining towns are dying out. Young people in these towns are moving on to the brighter job prospects. And technology is taking over what’s left of the mining industry. Green energy is taking over, and with it, a host of new, clean jobs and careers. It’s the march of civilization that will never cease.
Those entering the workforce today will have to be adaptable. They'll have to be hungry for knowledge and committed to continuing education whether that's by taking an online MBA, attending conferences, reading books, consuming podcasts or taking traditional advanced degrees. What robots can do is make humans more productive than ever before. Workers will need to develop technical skills and keep those skills updated as technology moves forward. Those who do not want to deal with technology need to pursue careers where it is not as much a factor or where demand for human skills and talents remains high.Andrew ArnoldI am a writer and lifestyle entrepreneur.

Rather than being a disruptor, artificial intelligence will amplify the human ingenuity of Singapore’s greatest asset – her people.
By Richard Koh, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Singapore
This article was first published in The Business Times on 26 March 2018.
Today, our morning routines will probably see us checking our smartphones for updates on the latest news headlines and updates of our friends’ social lives. You read the work emails arrived overnight, text your sister to confirm dinner plans, and perhaps check traffic conditions as you head to work.
In 2038, or probably earlier, digital devices will help us do more with one of our most precious commodities: time. At Microsoft, we imagine a world where your personal digital assistants such as Microsoft’s Cortana will be trained to anticipate our needs, help manage our schedule, prepare us for meetings, assist as we plan our social lives, reply to and route communications, and drive cars.
Artificial intelligence will enable breakthrough advances in areas like healthcare, agriculture, education and transportation. It is already happening in impressive ways.
In the office, AI is already helping companies understand customers better by analysing their preference and consumption patterns. In the fields, AI is helping farmers analyse weather patterns and soil conditions to help optimise their harvest. At home, smart devices such as lighting control and music players work together to provide the perfect ambience to unwind after a long day.
Beyond becoming the catalyst for some of the most dramatic changes in the way we live, work and play today, embracing AI will yield both economic and societal benefits.
By 2021, digital transformation will add an estimated US$10 billion to Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to a study released last month by research firm IDC, in partnership with Microsoft. The study also found that digital transformation will boost growth by an additional 0.6 per cent annually; and this will accelerate as digital technologies and services are enabled by AI, along with the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics.
The projected economic growth is possible with businesses adopting transformative technologies, of which AI is a central piece. In this future economy, new startups will sprout even as traditional businesses find new niches to grow into.
But as we have witnessed over the past 20 years, new technology also inevitably raises complex questions and broad societal concerns.
How do we ensure that AI is designed and used responsibly? How do we establish ethical principles to protect people? How should we govern its use? And how will AI impact employment and jobs?
To answer these tough questions, technologists will need to work closely with government, academia, business, civil society and other stakeholders. At Microsoft, we identified six ethical principles – fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability – to guide the cross-disciplinary development and use of artificial intelligence. The better we understand these or similar issues — and the more technology developers and users can share best practices to address them — the better served the world will be as we contemplate societal rules to govern AI.
We must also pay attention to AI’s impact on workers. One constant over 250 years of technological change has been the ongoing impact of technology on jobs — the creation of new jobs, the elimination of existing jobs and the evolution of job tasks and content.
Some key conclusions are emerging.
First, the companies and countries that will fare best in the AI era will be those that embrace these changes rapidly and effectively. This is because new jobs and economic growth will come to those that embrace the technology, not those that resist or delay adopting it.
Second, while we believe that AI will help solve big societal problems, we must look to this future with a critical eye. There will be challenges as well as opportunities. We must address the need for strong ethical principles, the evolution of laws, training for new skills and even labour market reforms. This must all come together if we are going to make the most of AI.
Third, we need to act with a sense of shared responsibility because AI will not be created by the tech sector alone. At Microsoft, we are working to democratise AI in a manner that is similar to how we made the PC available to everyone. This means we are creating tools to make it easy for every developer, business and government to build AI-based solutions and accelerate the benefit to society.
All of this leads us to what may be one of the most important conclusions of all. Skilling-up for an AI-powered world involves more than science, technology, engineering and math. As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even more important. Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions. If AI is to reach its potential in serving humans, then every engineer will need to learn more about the liberal arts and every liberal arts major will need to learn more about engineering.
Singapore’s ability to nurture a future-ready workforce will be key to thriving in the digital economy, one where digital products and services will make up 60 per cent of our economy. We need to constantly reassess and prepare ourselves for a future that appears to be shaping up differently each time you take another look at the crystal ball.
Yet, that concept is not new to Singapore, a young country that has both experienced and embraced change over the years. Singapore’s success has always depended on the skill, intelligence and determination of its people. Aided by AI, this human ingenuity will be even more important in the years ahead.
With AI, we have more power at our fingertips than entire generations that came before us. The questions will be what we will do with it.

Predictions are big business. The market for predictive analytics is expected to reach $12.4 Billion by 2022 as Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread in Demand Planning organizations. But we’re not losing our jobs – don’t worry – because even though a lot of the analytical work will be automated, new roles are emerging to implement and manage AI, and interpret the findings. Here are the four types of AI in Demand Planning, and the new roles required to leverage them.1. Limited Memory AIToday, most Limited Memory Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications rely on an age-old premise: use vast stores of historical data together with current observations to predict future outcomes. A Demand Planner calculating the base forecast on a product is likely to use past sales to trend as a starting point. Depending on the number of products in a portfolio, this task could be executed efficiently without the use of AI applications, say for instance in a small enterprise. However, for large organisations such as multinationals, Limited Memory AI could execute this task with speed and accuracy providing live or on demand recommendations for review by the Demand Planner.For any organization, investments in technology must provide a Return on Investment, with any decisions on AI implementation first requiring an extensive review of data stores to ensure they meet the required standard. Garbage in garbage out still applies and if you want quality data, you need a human.Working In Reactive AI: Demand Planners with an interest in the technical aspects of the role may specialize as Demand Planning Scientists with a focus on Data Management and algorithm development, optimisation and maintenance. This function would support the initial preparation of data, selection and fine-tuning of the organization’s specific algorithms.2. Reactive AIReactive AI, a second type of application, could also support Demand Planners. Scenario Planning and one-off decisions, which combines multiple information sources together, benefits launch and promotional planning where historical trending is not possible. Reliability of this proposition would depend on the extent of connectivity between the organization and it’s customers or key partners. Inputs could be drawn virtually from various stakeholders when scenarios are triggered as part of automated workflow processes.Working In Reactive AI: Demand Planners could specialize in this area as Launch & Promo Planners. Successful collaboration with other departments has always been a differentiator of top talent in this area. Weak AI deployed in Limited Memory and Reactive applications do not offer direct substitutes for this aspect of human capability.3. Theory Of Mind AIDeveloped social characteristics of human communication and trust have proven difficult to replicate in AI. The Theory of Mind category of these applications deliver outcomes based on predictions of how people will behave within a given environment through perception of that environment and those within it. Where technological advancement of this type enables AI to read body language and interpret non-verbal cues to inform decision-making, opportunity may arise in collaborative forecasting processes.Working With Theory Of Mind AI: AI assistants trained to work with teams may be well placed to provide a second opinion. Managerial and strategic skills would enable Demand Planners to thrive in such scenarios. Those individuals with the required capabilities may be qualified to be promoted to Demand Manager, overseeing AI decision recommendations, validating them and making the last call.4. Self-Aware AIAI in the fourth category is differentiated from the others based on its self-awareness capability, which draws on internal concepts of feelings and uses these additionally in the outcomes produced. This type of AI does not exist in the full capacity of that category definition, although strides are being made. To replace Demand Planners, AI would need those skills and more. Instinct, intuition, creativity to generate new ideas, social energy and charisma to influence are characteristics humans themselves are unable to quantify – far less replicate. These allow new ways of doing things and decisions to be taken outside of information that is available or could be generated. These include, for example, unprecedented events and rapid changes in consumer tastes including those for food or emerging fashion trends. [bar id=”527″] Working With Self-Aware AI: There’s is no new Demand Planner role for the type of AI (yet, anyway). That’s because in these circumstances, data does not usually exist. In professions where errors translate into costs such as lost sales and inventory builds, AI would excel in driving quality of information, automating mundane tasks, providing secondary opinions and recommendations. It could succeed under supervision, which would create a new Demand Planning role. How much time is committed to this would determine the viability of the application and the role. For those aspects of human nature, which enable social interaction, AI would fail and create a void in organizational cultures that could be detrimental to creativity, engagement and performance. [For jobs in Demand Planning, Predictive Analytics and S&OP, check out IBF’s jobs board]        TweetShareSharePin0 Shares AIartificial intelligencedemand planning jobsPrevious ArticleHow To Balance Demand & Supply In OmnichannelNext ArticlePredictive Analytics: Real Life Use CasesRelated PostsIn New Product Forecasting, Human Beats MachineOlga GerasymchukSeptember 9, 2019Beware The Pitfalls Of AI In Demand PlanningDaniel FitzpatrickFebruary 16, 20215 Laws Of Demand Planning You (& Executives) Must Never ForgetEric Wilson, ACPFDecember 17, 2018My “Future Shock” with ChatGPTPatrick BowerFebruary 14, 2023AI Is a Forecasting Silver Bullet, So Why Aren’t You Using It?Yuan ShenDecember 10, 2018Will AI Revolutionize Demand Planning?

Artificial Intelligence and Asian Security


Event Recap


  March 27th, 2018

  
  



On March 27, the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) hosted a public discussion entitled, Drones, Bots, and Smart Weapons: Artificial Intelligence and Asian Security. The panel discussion from the event can be watched above. It features Joshua Marcuse, Executive Director of the Defense Innovation Board, Office of the Secretary of Defense; Dr. Heather Roff, Associate Fellow at the University of Cambridge Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence; R. Shashank Reddy, Research Analyst at Carnegie India; Dr. Heigo Sato, Professor and Vice President of the Institute of World Affairs at Takushoku University; and moderator Lindsey Ford, ASPI's Director for Political-Security Affairs. (58 min., 29 sec.)
Ambassador Amandeep Singh Gill, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament and the Chair of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems, delivered keynote remarks at the event. He delivered his remarks remotely, via a live video feed. Below is an unedited transcript of the speech.   
Keynote Remarks by Amb. Amandeep Singh Gill
Thank you Lindsey. I am grateful to Asia Society for this opportunity and I am delighted to see the distinguished panelists you have gathered for this discussion. Professor Sato, Dr. Heather Roff, Shashank, it is good to be thinking about this issue with you again.
Whether it was the socially-disruptive cross bow in medieval times or the dual use horse stirrups that allowed the Mongols to stand erect and shoot, technology has always mattered in the security space. Paradigm-shifting advances such as nuclear weapons can even rewrite security strategies. As battlespaces expand to cover the globe, as the speed of engagement accelerates and as peer-powers compete in information-degraded battle environments thousands of miles away from the home-base, autonomy, and intelligent autonomy in particular, will rise in salience. If nuclear weapons helped rewrite strategy – just think of Brodie, Kissinger, Kahn, Wohlstetter, autonomy might also change the way humans relate to weapons. Throughout the history of conflict, the weapon and the wielder have been separate. What happens when the weapon becomes the wielder? Who do the laws of war apply to and how? But it is the potential shock and awe of swarms of intelligent autonomous systems “learning” their way through defences that is focusing a lot of minds in the security space.
Some of that focus is on compatibility and compliance with the laws of war or IHL, some on what lethal autonomous systems mean for strategic stability, crisis stability, arms race stability and good old fashioned proliferation, including to non-state actors as well as some on potential shifts in thinking about the distinction between war and peace, the lowering of the threshold for use of force in international relations – in other words are some countries going to be more trigger happy if body-bags are replaced by mangled metal? Then there is no other sector, with the exception perhaps of the cyber domain, where the commercial stakes are so high and so intertwined with the security stakes. As important and cut-throat as the military edge is the economic edge as advanced economies try to squeeze out an extra percentage point of growth and as the emerging economies attempt catch up with leapfrogging technologies. If we look at the dozen or so countries with the relevant upstream capabilities –U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, France, Russia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Israel – you see this entanglement at work. Eight of these eleven by the way are in the Asia-Pacific region.
In the context of the Group that I chair in Geneva in the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, we are looking at the risks associated with the potential deployment of autonomous intelligent systems in weapons capabilities and whether these risks can be managed within existing legal frameworks and how or whether some explicit rules of the road – political or legal – prohibitions and/or regulations are required. Our mandate is such that we have to look at emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems, in other words we have to focus on the novel, the unexpected, not just what is quantitatively different but what is qualitatively different from existing weapon systems. We are not looking so much at discrete, countable, “feelable” systems as we are at the penetration of AI/AS into weapons capabilities. As I am fond of saying, we are neither going far back into the past in terms of legacy systems nor are we going far into the future in Hollywoodian terms.
This focus on the mandate for the GGE allows me to segue from the why and what of the security dimension to the how of our work.  How are we tackling the humanitarian and international security concerns arising out of lethal autonomy in a multilateral inter-governmental setting? We started last year in a formal sense building on 3 years of informal discussions that were triggered by the first set of reflections on the issue in the human rights context. What the informal meetings in 2014-2016 did was to raise awareness of the complex dimensions of the issue – humanitarian, ethical, military, legal and techno-commercial and to underline the importance of the CCW as a platform for addressing these various dimensions. The CCW sits at the junction of IHL and arms control; it recognises the principle of military necessity alongside the IHL humanitarian principles. Thus it provides comfort to the governmental stakeholders to engage.It has a modular construct and can be updated as the security and technology landscapes evolve. Its rules of procedure allow the participation of a broad range of stakeholders.
I took up the reins in 2017 from my French and German predecessors and started a formal discussion using a Food for Thought paper and other devices of multilateral diplomacy on three specific dimensions – the legal/ethical, the military and the technological. I also brought in a broader set of stakeholders into the conversation, in particular industry as a civil society actor. The gender and age representativeness were strengthened and participation was encouraged from the Global South.  The November 2017 meeting was successful in underlining the appropriateness of the CCW as the venue for dealing with this issue. We also managed to lock in some basic principles as a bedrock on which to build on. They include:

One, IHL continues to apply fully to all weapons systems, including the potential development and use of LAWS;
Two, responsibility for the deployment of any weapons system in armed conflict remains with States and States must ensure accountability for lethal action by any weapon system used by its forces in armed conflict;
Three, given the dual nature of technologies in the area of intelligent autonomous systems that continue to develop rapidly, the work on LAWS should not hamper progress in or access to civilian R&D and use of these technologies;
And, four, given the pace of technology development and uncertainty regarding the pathways for emergence of increased autonomy, there would be need to keep potential military applications of related technologies under review.

Importantly, we also managed to shape an agenda for the future. This is what will guide our work in two weeks from now in April and then again in August.
The three plus one agenda we have developed is as follows:
i)  characterisation of the systems under consideration in order to promote a common understanding on concepts and characteristics relevant to the objectives and purposes of the CCW;
ii) further consideration of the human element in the use of lethal force and further assessment of aspects of the human-machine interaction in the development, deployment and use of emerging technologies in the area of LAWS;
iii) possible options for addressing the humanitarian and international security challenges posed by emerging technologies in the area of LAWS – these options could include a politically-binding declaration, a legally-binding instrument, a moratorium or some other pathway; plus
iv) a review of military applications of related technologies in the context of the Group’s work. I see the last two items – the political and technical aspects if you will – as something of a continuing focus. This year, we hope to be able to make progress on characterisation and the various touch points in the human-machine interface.
Let me conclude by sharing with you my sense of where we are and where we could be at the end of the year based on the consultations I have had so far, bilaterally with thirty odd delegations, with regional groups, NGOs, academics and industry, I am optimistic that we can have a high quality discussion with the participation of all stakeholders as we did last year. And like last year we can capture our work in text that is acceptable to everyone in the room. Thus, we would be able to advance our mandate in a step-by-step and pragmatic manner while ensuring that everyone stays on board. I am particularly heartened by the Working Papers that countries are bringing to the table after extensive inter-agency work in capitals. I am also heartened by the attention our work is garnering, as this event today underlines.

If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure,"" says French President Emmanuel Macron.Laura StevensSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database →ApplicationEthicsRegulationEnd UserGovernmentSectorPublic safetyOn Thursday, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, gave a speech laying out a new national strategy for artificial intelligence in his country. The French government will spend €1.5 billion ($1.85 billion) over five years to support research in the field, encourage startups, and collect data that can be used, and shared, by engineers. The goal is to start catching up to the US and China and to make sure the smartest minds in AI—hello Yann LeCun—choose Paris over Palo Alto.Directly after his talk, he gave an exclusive and extensive interview, entirely in English, to WIRED Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Thompson about the topic and why he has come to care so passionately about it.Nicholas Thompson: First off, thank you for letting me speak with you. It was refreshing to see a national leader talk about an issue like this in such depth and complexity. To get started, let me ask you an easy one. You and your team spoke to hundreds of people while preparing for this. What was the example of how AI works that struck you the most and that made you think, ‘Ok, this is going to be really, really important’?Trending NowThe Fascinating Robot That Teaches Itself How to Grab New ObjectsEmmanuel Macron: Probably in healthcare—where you have this personalized and preventive medicine and treatment. We had some innovations that I saw several times in medicine to predict, via better analysis, the diseases you may have in the future and prevent them or better treat you. A few years ago, I went to CES. I was very impressed by some of these companies. I had with me some French companies, but I discovered US, Israeli and other companies operating in the same field. Innovation that artificial intelligence brings into healthcare systems can totally change things: with new ways to treat people, to prevent various diseases, and a way—not to replace the doctors—but to reduce the potential risk.The second field is probably mobility: we have some great French companies and also a lot of US companies performing in this sector. Autonomous driving impresses me a lot. I think these two sectors, I would say, healthcare and mobility, really struck me as promising. It’s impossible when you are looking at these companies, not to say, Wow, something is changing drastically and what you thought was for the next decade, is in fact now. There is a huge acceleration.NT: It seems you’re doing this partly because it is clearly in France’s national interest to be strong in AI. But it also seemed in the speech that you feel like there are French or European values that can help shape the development of AI? Is that correct, and what are those values?AdvertisementEM: I think artificial intelligence will disrupt all the different business models and it’s the next disruption to come. So I want to be part of it. Otherwise I will just be subjected to this disruption without creating jobs in this country. So that’s where we are. And there is a huge acceleration and as always the winner takes all in this field. So that’s why my first objective in terms of education, training, research, and the creation of startups is to streamline a lot of things, to have the adaptable systems, the adapted financing, the adapted regulations, in order to build champions here and to attract the existing champions.Laura StevensBut you’re right at the same time: AI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy and our collective preferences. For instance, if you take healthcare: you can totally transform medical care making it much more predictive and personalized if you get access to a lot of data. We will open our data in France. I made this decision and announced it this afternoon. But the day you start dealing with privacy issues, the day you open this data and unveil personal information, you open a Pandora’s Box, with potential use cases that will not be increasing the common good and improving the way to treat you. In particular, it’s creating a potential for all the players to select you. This can be a very profitable business model: this data can be used to better treat people, it can be used to monitor patients, but it can also be sold to an insurer that will have intelligence on you and your medical risks, and could get a lot of money out of this information. The day we start to make such business out of this data is when a huge opportunity becomes a huge risk. It could totally dismantle our national cohesion and the way we live together. This leads me to the conclusion that this huge technological revolution is in fact a political revolution.When you look at artificial intelligence today, the two leaders are the US and China. In the US, it is entirely driven by the private sector, large corporations, and some startups dealing with them. All the choices they will make are private choices that deal with collective values. That’s exactly the problem you have with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica or autonomous driving. On the other side, Chinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours. And Europe has not exactly the same collective preferences as US or China. If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution . That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale.AI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy.The key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress. This is a huge issue. I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values. I mean, Europe is the place where the DNA of democracy was shaped, and therefore I think Europe has to get to grips with what could become a big challenge for democracies.NT: So the stakes here in your mind aren’t just French economic growth, it’s the whole value system that will be incorporated into this transformative technology the world over. And you want to make sure that the values you have, your country has, your continent has, are involved in that?Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDEM: Sure, exactly. I want to create an advantage for my country in artificial intelligence, directly. And that’s why we have these announcements made by Facebook, Google, Samsung, IBM, DeepMind, Fujitsu who choose Paris to create AI labs and research centers: this is very important to me. Second, I want my country to be part of the revolution that AI will trigger in mobility, energy, defense, finance, healthcare and so on. Because it will create value as well. Third, I want AI to be totally federalized. Why? Because AI is about disruption and dealing with impacts of disruption. For instance, this kind of disruption can destroy a lot of jobs in some sectors and create a need to retrain people. But AI could also be one of the solutions to better train these people and help them to find new jobs, which is good for my country, and very important.I want my country to be the place where this new perspective on AI is built, on the basis of interdisciplinarity: this means crossing maths, social sciences, technology, and philosophy. That’s absolutely critical. Because at one point in time, if you don’t frame these innovations from the start, a worst-case scenario will force you to deal with this debate down the line. I think privacy has been a hidden debate for a long time in the US. Now, it emerged because of the Facebook issue. Security was also a hidden debate of autonomous driving. Now, because we’ve had this issue with Uber, it rises to the surface. So if you don't want to block innovation, it is better to frame it by design within ethical and philosophical boundaries. And I think we are very well equipped to do it, on top of developing the business in my country.But I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy. For instance, we are using artificial intelligence to organize the access to universities for our students That puts a lot of responsibility on an algorithm. A lot of people see it as a black box, they don't understand how the student selection process happens. But the day they start to understand that this relies on an algorithm, this algorithm has a specific responsibility. If you want, precisely, to structure this debate, you have to create the conditions of fairness of the algorithm and of its full transparency. I have to be confident for my people that there is no bias, at least no unfair bias, in this algorithm. I have to be able to tell French citizens, “OK, I encouraged this innovation because it will allow you to get access to new services, it will improve your lives—that’s a good innovation to you.” I have to guarantee there is no bias in terms of gender, age, or other individual characteristics, except if this is the one I decided on behalf of them or in front of them. This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. If you don’t deal with it from the very beginning, if you don’t consider it is as important as developing innovation, you will miss something and at a point in time, it will block everything. Because people will eventually reject this innovation.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDNT: So the steps you’re taking to guarantee that is that all of the algorithms developed by the French government will be open, algorithms developed by any company getting money from the French government will also be required to be open?EM: Yes.NT: And is there a third step you’re doing to help guarantee this transparency?I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy.EM: We will increase the collective pressure to make these algorithms transparent. We will open data from government, publicly funded projects, and we will open access from this project and we will favor, incentivize the private players to make it totally public and transparent. Obviously some of them will say, there is a commercial value in my algorithm, I don't want to make it transparent. But I think we need a fair discussion between service providers and consumers, who are also citizens and will say: “I have to better understand your algorithm and be sure that this is trustworthy.” The power of consumption society is so strong that it gets people to accept to provide a lot of personal information in order to get access to services largely driven by artificial intelligence on their apps, laptops and so on. But at some point, as citizens, people will say, “I want to be sure that all of this personal data is not used against me, but used ethically, and that everything is monitored. I want to understand what is behind this algorithm that plays a role in my life.” And I’m sure that a lot of startups or labs or initiatives which will emerge in the future, will reach out to their customers and say “I allow you to better understand the algorithm we use and the bias or non-bias.” I’m quite sure that’s one of the next waves coming in AI. I think it will increase the pressure on private players. These new apps or sites will be able to tell people: “OK! You can go to this company or this app because we cross-check everything for you. It’s safe,"" or on the contrary: “If you go to this website or this app or this research model, it’s not OK, I have no guarantee, I was not able to check or access the right information about the algorithm”.NT: When you talk about how AI will transform democracy, do you imagine a day where you make decisions based on recommendations from AI-based algorithms, where there’s a system that tells you what a labor reform should be and you say, “OK?”EM: At this point, I think it could help you. But it will never replace the way you decide. When you make a decision, it’s the result of a series of cross-checks. AI can help you because sometimes when you pass a reform, you’re not totally clear about the potential effects, direct or indirect, and you can have hesitations. So it can help you to make the right decision. An algorithm is relevant for this part of the equation. For instance, on economic and social reforms, to have a clearer view about direct and indirect measurable effects. But on top of it, when you take a political decision, you need to have a part of personal judgment. That’s the quality of the decision maker, and artificial intelligence will never replace that. And there is a thing that AI could never replace; which is accountability and responsibility. Because this is his decision and will be held accountable for it, a political leader could never say, “OK I’m sorry this decision was bad because it was a decision of an algorithm.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDNT: Let’s get back to disruption for a second. You’ve talked a lot about transportation, you talked about it in your speech. AI is going to massively disrupt transportation, and it’s going to make a lot of people lose their jobs as we go to driverless cars. It will create new jobs, but this is already an area where people in France have been protesting. There were railroad strikes this weekend, there were trucker strikes this fall. Aren’t you taking a huge risk by aligning yourself with a force that is going to disrupt an industry that has already been protesting like crazy?EM: Look, I think in this country---and in a lot of countries---you have a tradition of controversy. I launched a series of reforms that a lot of people thought impossible to be conducted in France. So, I'm absolutely sure it's possible, when you explain to people, when you have the energy and determination, to pass such reforms. I’m certainly not reluctant to do so and I’m certainly not, I would say, upset or threatened by dealing with artificial intelligence and convincing my people of its rightful implementation. As consumers, they are already big fans of artificial intelligence. And big fans of innovative solutions. All the tech guys can tell you that the French market is a very good market. People love technology here. I think that’s why the overall philosophy I have stuck to from the very beginning of my mandate is to say: blocking changes and being focused on protecting jobs is not the right answer. It’s the people you need to protect. You do so by giving them opportunities and by training and retraining them again to get new jobs. Don’t block the change because it’s coming and people will accept it. But try to be at the fore-front of change to better understand it and deal with it. Change can destroy jobs in the very short run, but create new ones in other sectors at the same time.Laura StevensFor me, one of the key issues of artificial intelligence is that it will probably reduce the most replicable and straining human activities. And naturally you will raise a whole range of other opportunities for people with low, middle and high qualifications. The big risk for our society is to increase opportunities only for very highly qualified people and, in a way, very low-qualified workers. It is especially necessary to monitor the qualification of the middle class, because they can be the most disrupted. If I take your examples, that would encompass taxi drivers, people working in the industry, or people working in highly repetitive tasks. So you have to train them either to change their sector of activity or to increase their qualification to work with a machine. We will need people working with machines.For I do not believe that autonomous vehicles will exist without any drivers at all. For me, that’s pure imagination. You already have fully automated programs to drive planes. Therefore we technically could have planes with no pilots. But you still have two pilots in every plane. Even if almost everything is automated. That’s because you need to have responsibility, precisely. So what we will reduce with autonomous cars is the number of risks. What you will reduce is how painful it is to be a driver for a long period of time ; but you will need people to make the critical choice at critical moments for autonomous vehicles. I’m almost sure about that. So AI will change the practice but it will not kill transportation jobs in many cases.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDBottom line, my point is: I can convince my country about change precisely because I embrace it. My role is not to block this change, but to be able to train or retrain people for them to get opportunities in this new world.NT: Got it. I want to ask you a military question. I know that the UN has had discussions on restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons. Do you think machines---artificial intelligence machines---can ever be trusted to make decisions to kill without human intervention?EM: I’m dead against that. Because I think you always need responsibility and assertion of responsibility. And technically speaking, you can have in some situations, some automation which will be possible. But automation or machines put in a situation precisely to do that would create an absence of responsibility. Which, for me, is a critical issue. So that’s absolutely impossible. That’s why you always need a human check. And in certain ways, a human gateway. At a point of time, the machine can prepare everything, can reduce uncertainties, can reduce until nil the uncertainties and that’s an improvement which is impossible without it, but at a point of time, the go or no-go decision should be a human decision because you need somebody to be responsible for it.Blocking changes is not the right answer. You have to protect people and to think about opportunities.NT: Let me ask you about the national competition in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk tweeted some months ago: “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of World War3 in my opinion.” Do you think Musk is overstating it? Or do you think that this is going to get very intense, particularly between the United States and China?EM: I think it will become very intense. I will not be so pessimistic, because I think that the core basis of artificial intelligence is research. And research is global. And I think this artificial intelligence deals with cooperation and competition, permanently. So you need an open world and a lot of cooperation if you want to be competitive. And at a point of time, in some issues, you need competition. But I think you will have to rethink a sort of sovereignty. I addressed that in my speech today. Artificial intelligence is a global innovation scheme in which you have private big players and one government with a lot of data—China. My goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI, as I told you at the beginning of this discussion, especially on regulation. You will have sovereignty battles to regulate, with countries trying to defend their collective choices. You will have a trade and innovation fight precisely as you have in different sectors. But I don't believe that it will go to the extreme extents Elon Musk talks about, because I think if you want to progress, there is a huge advantage in an open innovation model.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceNT: So this is a slightly cynical response to that, but let me ask you this: If France starts to build up an AI sector, in some ways it’s competitive to Google and Facebook. So won’t there be an incentive for Europe and for France to regulate Facebook and Google in ever-tougher ways? Doesn’t it create a strange dynamic where you might have incentives to bring more regulation and antitrust?EM: Look, I would say exactly the opposite. Today, Google, Facebook, and so on, on artificial intelligence, they are very much welcome. Most people like them, these companies invest in France, they also recruit a lot of our talents and they develop their jobs here. So they are part of our ecosystem. The issue for these big players is the fact that they will have to deal with several issues. First, they have a very classical issue in a monopoly situation; they are huge players. At a point of time--but I think it will be a US problem, not a European problem--at a point of time, your government, your people, may say, “Wake up. They are too big.” Not just too big to fail, but too big to be governed. Which is brand new. So at this point, you may choose to dismantle. That’s what happened at the very beginning of the oil sector when you had these big giants. That’s a competition issue.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDBut second, I have a territorial issue due to the fact that they are totally digital players. They disrupt traditional economic sectors. In some ways, this might be fine because they can also provide new solutions. But we have to retrain our people. These companies will not pay for that; the government will. Today the GAFA [an acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon] don’t pay all the taxes they should in Europe. So they don’t contribute to dealing with negative externalities they create. And they ask the sectors they disrupt to pay, because these guys, the old sectors pay VAT, corporate taxes and so on. That’s not sustainable.Third, people should remain sovereign when it comes to pivacy rules. France and Europe have their preferences in this regard. I want to protect privacy in this way or in that way. You don't have the same rule in the US. And speaking about US players, how can I guarantee French people that US players will respect our regulation? So at a point of time, they will have to create actual legal bodies and incorporate it in Europe, being submitted to these rules. Which means in terms of processing information, organizing themselves, and so on, they will need, indeed, a much more European or national organization. Which in turn means that we will have to redesign themselves for a much more fragmented world. And that’s for sure because accountability and democracy happen at national or regional level but not at a global scale. If I don’t walk down this path, I cannot protect French citizens and guarantee their rights. If I don't do that, I cannot guarantee French companies they are fairly treated. Because today, when I speak about GAFA, they are very much welcome I want them to be part of my ecosystem, but they don’t play on the same level-playing field as the other players in the digital or traditional economy. And I cannot in the long run guarantee my citizens that their collective preferences or my rules can be totally implemented by these players because you don't have the same regulation on the US side. All I know is that if I don’t, at a point of time, have this discussion and regulate them, I put myself in a situation not to be sovereign anymore.NT: But aren’t those two goals very much in tension? You want the GAFA to come to France, you’ve touted it—Google has been invested in AI [in France] since 2012—but you also really want to crack down on them. How do you do both simultaneously?EM: No. Look, because I think first, you don’t just have the GAFA. You have a lot of other players, startups, and so on. And I think, even for them, I mean they are discovering they will have to deal with democratic and political issues in your country.NT: They’re just starting to learn that!EM: Yes, yes! I mean, it’s fair. That’s the end of the very first phase, that was a sort of an early phase without any regulation, where they were in a situation to set up all the rules. Now they will have to deal with governments — but I want to do it in a cooperative way. I don't want to say, “I don’t want this guy anymore.” Exactly the opposite. I want a permanent dialogue. But I want them to understand and respect my constraints. I want them to be part of my reflection and to take into consideration their own reflection. I want them to better understand the fact that it is unfeasible to have a world without any responsibility and without a clear democratic accountability.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDNT: Got it. So back to the big question, what will be success? How will you know that this has worked? And what will be failure? When you look at this a couple years from now?EM: Look, first of all I think it’s very hard to answer this question because by definition, I don't have a clear view on what will happen for artificial intelligence in five years time. But I would say, if I manage to develop a very strong, powerful ecosystem, number one in Europe on artificial intelligence dealing with mobility, defense, healthcare, fintech, etc. I think it will be a success. And for me, if a majority of people in France understand and endorse this change it will be a success. It will be a failure if we are stuck with fears and blocked by big scares. My concern is that there is a disconnect between the speediness of innovation and some practices, and the time for digestion for a lot of people in our democracies. I have to build a sort of reciprocal or mutual trust coming from researchers, private players, startups, and my citizens. If the first category of people trust a country as being a relevant ecosystem for them, and at the same time, if I manage to build trust with my citizens for AI, I’m done. If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

The day we start to make such business out of this data is when a huge opportunity becomes a huge risk. It could totally dismantle our national cohesion and the way we live together. This leads me to the conclusion that this huge technological revolution is in fact a political revolution.
When you look at artificial intelligence today, the two leaders are the US and China. In the US, it is entirely driven by the private sector, large corporations, and some startups dealing with them. All the choices they will make are private choices that deal with collective values. That’s exactly the problem you have with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica or autonomous driving. On the other side, Chinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours. And Europe has not exactly the same collective preferences as US or China. If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution . That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale.
The key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress. This is a huge issue. I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values. I mean, Europe is the place where the DNA of democracy was shaped, and therefore I think Europe has to get to grips with what could become a big challenge for democracies.
NT: So the stakes here in your mind aren’t just French economic growth, it’s the whole value system that will be incorporated into this transformative technology the world over. And you want to make sure that the values you have, your country has, your continent has, are involved in that?
EM: Sure, exactly. I want to create an advantage for my country in artificial intelligence, directly. And that’s why we have these announcements made by Facebook, Google, Samsung, IBM, DeepMind, Fujitsu who choose Paris to create AI labs and research centers: this is very important to me. Second, I want my country to be part of the revolution that AI will trigger in mobility, energy, defense, finance, healthcare and so on. Because it will create value as well. Third, I want AI to be totally federalized. Why? Because AI is about disruption and dealing with impacts of disruption. For instance, this kind of disruption can destroy a lot of jobs in some sectors and create a need to retrain people. But AI could also be one of the solutions to better train these people and help them to find new jobs, which is good for my country, and very important.
I want my country to be the place where this new perspective on AI is built, on the basis of interdisciplinarity: this means crossing maths, social sciences, technology, and philosophy. That’s absolutely critical. Because at one point in time, if you don’t frame these innovations from the start, a worst-case scenario will force you to deal with this debate down the line. I think privacy has been a hidden debate for a long time in the US. Now, it emerged because of the Facebook issue. Security was also a hidden debate of autonomous driving. Now, because we’ve had this issue with Uber, it rises to the surface. So if you don't want to block innovation, it is better to frame it by design within ethical and philosophical boundaries. And I think we are very well equipped to do it, on top of developing the business in my country.
But I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy. For instance, we are using artificial intelligence to organize the access to universities for our students That puts a lot of responsibility on an algorithm. A lot of people see it as a black box, they don't understand how the student selection process happens. But the day they start to understand that this relies on an algorithm, this algorithm has a specific responsibility. If you want, precisely, to structure this debate, you have to create the conditions of fairness of the algorithm and of its full transparency. I have to be confident for my people that there is no bias, at least no unfair bias, in this algorithm. I have to be able to tell French citizens, “OK, I encouraged this innovation because it will allow you to get access to new services, it will improve your lives—that’s a good innovation to you.” I have to guarantee there is no bias in terms of gender, age, or other individual characteristics, except if this is the one I decided on behalf of them or in front of them. This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. If you don’t deal with it from the very beginning, if you don’t consider it is as important as developing innovation, you will miss something and at a point in time, it will block everything. Because people will eventually reject this innovation.
NT: So the steps you’re taking to guarantee that is that all of the algorithms developed by the French government will be open, algorithms developed by any company getting money from the French government will also be required to be open?
EM: Yes.
NT: And is there a third step you’re doing to help guarantee this transparency?
EM: We will increase the collective pressure to make these algorithms transparent. We will open data from government, publicly funded projects, and we will open access from this project and we will favor, incentivize the private players to make it totally public and transparent. Obviously some of them will say, there is a commercial value in my algorithm, I don't want to make it transparent. But I think we need a fair discussion between service providers and consumers, who are also citizens and will say: “I have to better understand your algorithm and be sure that this is trustworthy.” The power of consumption society is so strong that it gets people to accept to provide a lot of personal information in order to get access to services largely driven by artificial intelligence on their apps, laptops and so on. But at some point, as citizens, people will say, “I want to be sure that all of this personal data is not used against me, but used ethically, and that everything is monitored. I want to understand what is behind this algorithm that plays a role in my life.” And I’m sure that a lot of startups or labs or initiatives which will emerge in the future, will reach out to their customers and say “I allow you to better understand the algorithm we use and the bias or non-bias.” I’m quite sure that’s one of the next waves coming in AI. I think it will increase the pressure on private players. These new apps or sites will be able to tell people: “OK! You can go to this company or this app because we cross-check everything for you. It’s safe,"" or on the contrary: “If you go to this website or this app or this research model, it’s not OK, I have no guarantee, I was not able to check or access the right information about the algorithm”.
NT: When you talk about how AI will transform democracy, do you imagine a day where you make decisions based on recommendations from AI-based algorithms, where there’s a system that tells you what a labor reform should be and you say, “OK?”
EM: At this point, I think it could help you. But it will never replace the way you decide. When you make a decision, it’s the result of a series of cross-checks. AI can help you because sometimes when you pass a reform, you’re not totally clear about the potential effects, direct or indirect, and you can have hesitations. So it can help you to make the right decision. An algorithm is relevant for this part of the equation. For instance, on economic and social reforms, to have a clearer view about direct and indirect measurable effects. But on top of it, when you take a political decision, you need to have a part of personal judgment. That’s the quality of the decision maker, and artificial intelligence will never replace that. And there is a thing that AI could never replace; which is accountability and responsibility. Because this is his decision and will be held accountable for it, a political leader could never say, “OK I’m sorry this decision was bad because it was a decision of an algorithm.”
NT: Let’s get back to disruption for a second. You’ve talked a lot about transportation, you talked about it in your speech. AI is going to massively disrupt transportation, and it’s going to make a lot of people lose their jobs as we go to driverless cars. It will create new jobs, but this is already an area where people in France have been protesting. There were railroad strikes this weekend, there were trucker strikes this fall. Aren’t you taking a huge risk by aligning yourself with a force that is going to disrupt an industry that has already been protesting like crazy?
EM: Look, I think in this country---and in a lot of countries---you have a tradition of controversy. I launched a series of reforms that a lot of people thought impossible to be conducted in France. So, I'm absolutely sure it's possible, when you explain to people, when you have the energy and determination, to pass such reforms. I’m certainly not reluctant to do so and I’m certainly not, I would say, upset or threatened by dealing with artificial intelligence and convincing my people of its rightful implementation. As consumers, they are already big fans of artificial intelligence. And big fans of innovative solutions. All the tech guys can tell you that the French market is a very good market. People love technology here. I think that’s why the overall philosophy I have stuck to from the very beginning of my mandate is to say: blocking changes and being focused on protecting jobs is not the right answer. It’s the people you need to protect. You do so by giving them opportunities and by training and retraining them again to get new jobs. Don’t block the change because it’s coming and people will accept it. But try to be at the fore-front of change to better understand it and deal with it. Change can destroy jobs in the very short run, but create new ones in other sectors at the same time.
For me, one of the key issues of artificial intelligence is that it will probably reduce the most replicable and straining human activities. And naturally you will raise a whole range of other opportunities for people with low, middle and high qualifications. The big risk for our society is to increase opportunities only for very highly qualified people and, in a way, very low-qualified workers. It is especially necessary to monitor the qualification of the middle class, because they can be the most disrupted. If I take your examples, that would encompass taxi drivers, people working in the industry, or people working in highly repetitive tasks. So you have to train them either to change their sector of activity or to increase their qualification to work with a machine. We will need people working with machines.
For I do not believe that autonomous vehicles will exist without any drivers at all. For me, that’s pure imagination. You already have fully automated programs to drive planes. Therefore we technically could have planes with no pilots. But you still have two pilots in every plane. Even if almost everything is automated. That’s because you need to have responsibility, precisely. So what we will reduce with autonomous cars is the number of risks. What you will reduce is how painful it is to be a driver for a long period of time ; but you will need people to make the critical choice at critical moments for autonomous vehicles. I’m almost sure about that. So AI will change the practice but it will not kill transportation jobs in many cases.
Bottom line, my point is: I can convince my country about change precisely because I embrace it. My role is not to block this change, but to be able to train or retrain people for them to get opportunities in this new world.
NT: Got it. I want to ask you a military question. I know that the UN has had discussions on restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons. Do you think machines---artificial intelligence machines---can ever be trusted to make decisions to kill without human intervention?
EM: I’m dead against that. Because I think you always need responsibility and assertion of responsibility. And technically speaking, you can have in some situations, some automation which will be possible. But automation or machines put in a situation precisely to do that would create an absence of responsibility. Which, for me, is a critical issue. So that’s absolutely impossible. That’s why you always need a human check. And in certain ways, a human gateway. At a point of time, the machine can prepare everything, can reduce uncertainties, can reduce until nil the uncertainties and that’s an improvement which is impossible without it, but at a point of time, the go or no-go decision should be a human decision because you need somebody to be responsible for it.
NT: Let me ask you about the national competition in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk tweeted some months ago: “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of World War3 in my opinion.” Do you think Musk is overstating it? Or do you think that this is going to get very intense, particularly between the United States and China?
EM: I think it will become very intense. I will not be so pessimistic, because I think that the core basis of artificial intelligence is research. And research is global. And I think this artificial intelligence deals with cooperation and competition, permanently. So you need an open world and a lot of cooperation if you want to be competitive. And at a point of time, in some issues, you need competition. But I think you will have to rethink a sort of sovereignty. I addressed that in my speech today. Artificial intelligence is a global innovation scheme in which you have private big players and one government with a lot of data—China. My goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI, as I told you at the beginning of this discussion, especially on regulation. You will have sovereignty battles to regulate, with countries trying to defend their collective choices. You will have a trade and innovation fight precisely as you have in different sectors. But I don't believe that it will go to the extreme extents Elon Musk talks about, because I think if you want to progress, there is a huge advantage in an open innovation model.
NT: So this is a slightly cynical response to that, but let me ask you this: If France starts to build up an AI sector, in some ways it’s competitive to Google and Facebook. So won’t there be an incentive for Europe and for France to regulate Facebook and Google in ever-tougher ways? Doesn’t it create a strange dynamic where you might have incentives to bring more regulation and antitrust?
EM: Look, I would say exactly the opposite. Today, Google, Facebook, and so on, on artificial intelligence, they are very much welcome. Most people like them, these companies invest in France, they also recruit a lot of our talents and they develop their jobs here. So they are part of our ecosystem. The issue for these big players is the fact that they will have to deal with several issues. First, they have a very classical issue in a monopoly situation; they are huge players. At a point of time--but I think it will be a US problem, not a European problem--at a point of time, your government, your people, may say, “Wake up. They are too big.” Not just too big to fail, but too big to be governed. Which is brand new. So at this point, you may choose to dismantle. That’s what happened at the very beginning of the oil sector when you had these big giants. That’s a competition issue.
But second, I have a territorial issue due to the fact that they are totally digital players. They disrupt traditional economic sectors. In some ways, this might be fine because they can also provide new solutions. But we have to retrain our people. These companies will not pay for that; the government will. Today the GAFA [an acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon] don’t pay all the taxes they should in Europe. So they don’t contribute to dealing with negative externalities they create. And they ask the sectors they disrupt to pay, because these guys, the old sectors pay VAT, corporate taxes and so on. That’s not sustainable.
Third, people should remain sovereign when it comes to pivacy rules. France and Europe have their preferences in this regard. I want to protect privacy in this way or in that way. You don't have the same rule in the US. And speaking about US players, how can I guarantee French people that US players will respect our regulation? So at a point of time, they will have to create actual legal bodies and incorporate it in Europe, being submitted to these rules. Which means in terms of processing information, organizing themselves, and so on, they will need, indeed, a much more European or national organization. Which in turn means that we will have to redesign themselves for a much more fragmented world. And that’s for sure because accountability and democracy happen at national or regional level but not at a global scale. If I don’t walk down this path, I cannot protect French citizens and guarantee their rights. If I don't do that, I cannot guarantee French companies they are fairly treated. Because today, when I speak about GAFA, they are very much welcome I want them to be part of my ecosystem, but they don’t play on the same level-playing field as the other players in the digital or traditional economy. And I cannot in the long run guarantee my citizens that their collective preferences or my rules can be totally implemented by these players because you don't have the same regulation on the US side. All I know is that if I don’t, at a point of time, have this discussion and regulate them, I put myself in a situation not to be sovereign anymore.
NT: But aren’t those two goals very much in tension? You want the GAFA to come to France, you’ve touted it—Google has been invested in AI [in France] since 2012—but you also really want to crack down on them. How do you do both simultaneously?
EM: No. Look, because I think first, you don’t just have the GAFA. You have a lot of other players, startups, and so on. And I think, even for them, I mean they are discovering they will have to deal with democratic and political issues in your country.
NT: They’re just starting to learn that!
EM: Yes, yes! I mean, it’s fair. That’s the end of the very first phase, that was a sort of an early phase without any regulation, where they were in a situation to set up all the rules. Now they will have to deal with governments — but I want to do it in a cooperative way. I don't want to say, “I don’t want this guy anymore.” Exactly the opposite. I want a permanent dialogue. But I want them to understand and respect my constraints. I want them to be part of my reflection and to take into consideration their own reflection. I want them to better understand the fact that it is unfeasible to have a world without any responsibility and without a clear democratic accountability.
NT: Got it. So back to the big question, what will be success? How will you know that this has worked? And what will be failure? When you look at this a couple years from now?
EM: Look, first of all I think it’s very hard to answer this question because by definition, I don't have a clear view on what will happen for artificial intelligence in five years time. But I would say, if I manage to develop a very strong, powerful ecosystem, number one in Europe on artificial intelligence dealing with mobility, defense, healthcare, fintech, etc. I think it will be a success. And for me, if a majority of people in France understand and endorse this change it will be a success. It will be a failure if we are stuck with fears and blocked by big scares. My concern is that there is a disconnect between the speediness of innovation and some practices, and the time for digestion for a lot of people in our democracies. I have to build a sort of reciprocal or mutual trust coming from researchers, private players, startups, and my citizens. If the first category of people trust a country as being a relevant ecosystem for them, and at the same time, if I manage to build trust with my citizens for AI, I’m done. If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure.

Chemists have a new lab assistant: artificial intelligence. Researchers have developed a ‘deep learning’ computer program that produces blueprints for the sequences of reactions needed to create small organic molecules, such as drug compounds. The pathways that the tool suggests look just as good on paper as those devised by human chemists.

        When we think about agriculture, we tend to think about subsistence farming. Although many people may think that the agricultural community is behind the curve when it comes to implementing new technologies, there is lots of evidence that farmers are actually moving quite quickly to modernise almost everything about the farming process.
According to Techopedia, these farmers are using artificial intelligence in new and amazing ways to bring the process of food cultivation into the future.
Sowing the seeds
High-tech agriculture starts at the very second that the seed is first placed in the ground. Experts in the field are familiar with variable rate planting equipment that does more than just planting a seed down into the dirt somewhere. 






All sorts of artificial intelligence work is being done behind the scenes on predictions – where a seed will grow best, what soil conditions are likely to be, etc.
The power of artificial intelligence is being applied to agricultural big data in order to make farming much more efficient.
Harvesting technologies        
Companies are already producing robotic harvesting equipment, partially in response to labour gaps that have left farmers scrambling to harvest crops like fruits and berries.
You can see a lot of this at work in documentation from companies like Harvest Croo, which has produced an autonomous strawberry picking machine, and Abundant Technologies, where a vacuum apparatus harvests mature apples from trees.
While manufacturing robots have been around for a while, these harvesting technologies are something new in many ways.
Harvest technologies like the Harvest Croo berry picker operate on the basis of machine vision and sensor fusion to identify where harvest fruits and berries are. They use sophisticated directed movements to pick precisely.
This is the kind of functionality that is very much in the artificial intelligence field and mimics human cognition and directed action.
Agricultural robotics is filling a need as labour pools decrease. But it’s also saving humans from one of the most repetitive and difficult jobs in our economy.
People simply don’t want to have to harvest enormous amounts of produce all day, every day. In that sense, harvest robotics is also making our world a little more enjoyable. Now, if people do want to pick by hand, boutique orchards and gardens offer that option!     
Harvest robotics presents a real landmark in the very rapid modernisation of the farming world.
Eye in the sky
How are farms using artificial intelligence to direct crop planting, harvesting and more, and how are they getting that data in the first place?
In some trade journals, you can see unmanned aerial vehicles or drones being outfitted with precision sensors, in order to run the fields and get the data that is needed. These airborne surveillance engines can look for stunted crops, signs of pest or weed damage, dryness and many other variables that are part of the difficulty of farming in general. With all of this data in hand, farmers can enhance their production models and their strategies across the lay of the land to decrease risk, waste and liability.
Pest and weed control
Yesterday’s farmers were living in fear of the windstorm and the grasshopper but not anymore. Farmers are quickly adopting new high-tech ways of protecting plants against weeds and various kinds of pests outdoors. Another alternative is to grow in greenhouses, which is being done as well, but some of the most amazing farming technology is being deployed outside.
The See and Spray model acquired by John Deere recently is an excellent example of harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision.  
“We welcome the opportunity to work with a Blue River Technology team that is highly-skilled and intensely dedicated to rapidly advancing the implementation of machine learning in agriculture,” the President, Agricultural Solutions, and Chief Information Officer at Deere, John May, said in a press statement, weighing in on the potential of new technologies in farming.  Related News  How to protect your gadgets from power surge  Strix promotes access to gadgets  8 ways to protect gadgets from cyberattacks   
“As a leader in precision agriculture, John Deere recognises the importance of technology to our customers. Machine learning is an important capability for Deere’s future.”
We know that artificial intelligence excels at image processing – computers can now “see” almost as well as we can.
So by deploying mobile technologies with AI and computer vision built in, farmers can find weeds and eradicate them, instead of blanket spraying an entire crop.
That makes the food cleaner, and it saves enormous amounts of money. It’s just another example of real new technologies that are having a dramatic impact on yields and everything else.
Yield boosting algorithms
When we talk about machine learning and artificial intelligence, we often talk about algorithms. The mathematical models behind the computer science are the fundamental basis for how we deal with big data to make decisions.     
Companies are now quickly developing agricultural yield-boosting algorithms that can show farmers what’s going to be best for a crop. Despite some concerns about the difficulty of doing this type of analysis in nature, farmers and others have been able to make quite a lot of headway in maximising crop yield, simply by applying the algorithms and intelligence generators that we’ve built to help computers imitate our own cognitive abilities.
The farmer’s Alexa
There is one more very interesting groundbreaking technology that may also be one of the highlights in the modern farmer’s tech toolkit.
Yes, companies are talking about creating chatbots for farmers, artificial intelligence personalities like the smart home helper “Alexa” that are able to converse with farmers to help them figure out tough problems. We’re hoping that these specialised farming chatbots are a little more capable than Alexa, since the current consumer technology basically provides encyclopaedic facts and figures and not much else. However, if they’re packed with the right answers and analytics information, the farmer’s chatbot could be a real boon to busy farm managers who are doing all they can to expand and grow their businesses.
Population growth and climate change will be massive challenges, but artificial intelligence deployment can help reduce the impact of these and other challenges, and make smart farming much more resistant to the problems that farmers face.

Impressions        
Impressions track how many times a webpage or element on a webpage is viewed. It is one of the standard metrics used in website analytics software. The term “impressions” most often refers to page impressions, which is synonymous with page views. Each time a page is viewed, a page impression is counted. Therefore, a single visitor can rack up multiple impressions on a website by visiting multiple pages.
Unique impressions, or page views by different visitors, according to www.techterms.com, are useful for measuring the number of daily unique visitors to a website. Website analytics software may record unique impressions by either saving a 24-hour cookie on visitors’ browsers or by resetting the record of unique visitors at the start of each day.
Most analytics software records both total and unique impressions. These two metrics can be used to determine the average number of pages visitors view before leaving the website.
While impressions typically refer to page views, they may also define how many times individual elements on a webpage are viewed. For example, in online advertising, “ad impressions” track the number of times individual advertisements are displayed. If a webpage contains three ad units, each page view will produce three ad impressions.
By tracking the number of ad impressions, webmasters can monitor the performance of individual ads. This information can be used in combination with revenue per 1,000 page views, to determine the ideal amount of ads for each webpage.

In the wider world, there is a big debate on the likely effects of artificial intelligence ( AI) and robotics. There is a fear that robots will replace not just manual labour but a lot of brainwork as well. There are scenarios being painted where no human being may be needed for any paid work and robots will do everything. Of course, a few people will be needed to produce robots and improve their quality. That would be the investment. The idea that automation will make human effort redundant, and it will create a problem of no work and too much leisure, was rife in the 1960s. Each wave of innovation leads to the fear that jobs will be destroyed. But so far while some jobs have been destroyed, other jobs have been created. World has gone through phases where agriculture was the principal occupation. Then, we moved on to manufacturing. Now, a lot of the world is in a phase where services are the principal sector. Will AI and robotics be different ? With robots replacing human labour, capital will provide machines as well as labour. All output will belong to the capitalists. Robots neither eat nor drink nor sleep. So, labour costs are just those of repairs and replacement. Take an extreme case. If all income goes to profits, how do people carry on? Many economists have come to the idea that some sort of universal income entitlement will have to be created. To finance this, the state will have to tax profits. The level of basic income will depend on the tax collection. Thus, if a tax rate of 50% were feasible, everyone can have half of per capita income as their entitlement (ignoring administrative costs of tax collection, bureaucracy, etc). Indeed, in general, the tax rate determines the fraction of per capita income which can be paid. But, will the capitalists agree? Why should they? Here is where Keynes (and even Marx) comes in. The capitalists need people to purchase their product to be able to realise profits. The amount of income distributed as purchasing power will determine the revenue realised by the capitalists. So, we are on the horns of the circular flow dilemma. The capitalists have to give away money to get it back. They may want to give 80-90% away to get it back. Thus, whatever the world is like under AI, it will provide for all. There are two positive elements to this extreme scenario. Notice, first, that this world has most incomes equal except for the capitalists who have all the profits. After tax, income will be substantially equal if 99% get just the basic income. Secondly, women who do unpaid work in the household will get paid the same as those who used to do paid work. This is a simple fairy tale. It reassures that the world of no human work is not a world of poverty and starvation. But truth is that robots cannot do everything. You can programme a robot for all the foreseen and foreseeable contingencies. At present, robots are quite simple and can only handle simple contingencies. But, as the case of the driverless car recently showed, they may cause accidents and death when an unforeseen event (someone crossing in the dark at a place which is not a designated crossing) occurs. But even supposing that the smartest machines are designed, there will always be radical uncertainty. As Keynes put it, you can calculate probabilities of all possible outcomes but that is risk. Uncertainty is when you cannot foresee the possibilities. One of the most uncertain phenomenon is human behaviour. For older people with dementia, you need a human helper who can cope with unexpected turns of behaviour. Indeed, in healthcare in general, you require human empathy and ability to communicate to be effective. There is an estimate that in the US, as much as 40% of workforce may be in healthcare in the near future. As people live longer, the demands for healthcare are going to rise. This is also the case with most one-to-one activities such as tutoring. No robot can be your physical instructor or teacher. Indeed, if we are not doing boring manual work, we could be doing interesting one-to-one activities. This would extend to artistic and sports activities where coaching and mentoring cannot be done by even the best machines. Indeed, we may have many more people available for these sorts of work. The profits of the capitalists will still need to provide a large part of public revenue, but there will be employment for many people. So relax. AI and robotics will not wreck our lives—just change them.
