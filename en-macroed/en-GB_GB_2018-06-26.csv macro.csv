<p>Globally-renowned AI expert Dr Demis Hassabis will today be confirmed as an adviser to the new Office for Artificial Intelligence as the UK looks to cement its place as a world leader in the fast-growing technology.</p>

<p>Hassabis, who is the co-founder of leading AI research company DeepMind, will provide expert industry guidance to help the country build the skills and capability it needs to capitalise on the huge social and economic potential of AI - a key part of the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy.</p>

<p>Digital Secretary Matt Hancock will also confirm Tabitha Goldstaub as the chair and spokesperson of the AI Council, a new industry body tasked with increasing growth in the AI sector and promoting its adoption in other sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>Tabitha Goldstaub is the co-founder of AI company CognitionX, an online platform which provides companies with information and access to AI experts to boost their businesses, and runs CogX, one of the largest gatherings of AI experts in the world.</p>

<p>She led the team who wrote the influential report London: the AI Growth Capital of Europe, and was the co-founder of Rightster, the largest online video distribution company outside the US. She is also the co-founder of Future Girl Corp and an adviser to Founders 4 Schools.</p>

<p>The announcements form part of the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy, and follow the Grand Challenges announced by the Prime Minister to use the county’s power in research and innovation to ensure the benefits of technology are felt by everyone. It also builds on the £1 billion joint Government and private sector investment announced earlier this year to put the nation at the forefront of the global AI industry.</p>

<p>One of the four Grand Challenges is on AI and data, which is at the centre of the Government’s plans to unlock the potential of the data-driven economy and put the UK at the forefront of AI technologies. It will be led by a Business Champion and a Skills Champion, working alongside Ministers and responsible for engaging industry voices and raising the profile of the challenge.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock will also today announce Dame Wendy Hall, who led last year’s independent review on AI, as a Skills Champion for AI, and Tabitha Goldstaub as the AI Business Champion.</p>

<p>Speaking in London, Digital Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s improving travel, making banking easier or helping people live longer, AI is already revolutionising our economy and our society.</p>

  <p>Britain is already an authority in AI, with the world’s best AI company and the leading use of AI in Government. We are determined to capitalize on this position.</p>

  <p>Cutting-edge technology is the basis of the future of our economy. Under this Government, investment in the tech sector doubled in the last year, is growing at three times the pace of the rest of the economy, unemployment is at a 40-year low, inequality is falling, and we are seeing the first sustained fall in debt in a generation. We must build on these strengths.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We want to harness the best possible AI leadership to help us seize this opportunity. Demis Hassabis, Tabitha Goldstaub, and Wendy Hall have the expertise and vision to help us make sure the huge benefits of this powerful new technology are available to everyone.</p>

				Robots and AI won’t displace job categories whole cloth, but may help make jobs easier in the future, as more tasks are automated for improved productivity or safety.

AI, machine learning, deep learning and automation are no longer future technologies, they’ve already found traction in the enterprise. Whether it’s to organize data, to uncover trends or to make human’s lives easier, AI can have a positive impact on the enterprise – if we let it. 
At least, that was the message at The Future of Work in a World of AI, ML, and Automation panel, held at MIT’s CIO Symposium 2018 conference this May, a one-day event where industry thought leaders and educators gathered to discuss the impact of evolving IT trends.

“The one thing that is certain is that there is going to be a lot of disruption over the next five to 10 years as these technologies work their way through each of your companies, through each of your industries and through each of your geographies,” says Erik Brynjolfsson director of MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “But if we understand better those effects and if we work to reinvent our business processes, we’re going to be able to take advantage of these technologies to create a lot of wealth, a lot of benefits for lots of different people.”











 
 
 
AI won’t wipe out entire job categories
The Department of Labor created a dataset called ONET, which includes the descriptions for 964 occupations in the US. Each job has a list that includes around 20 to 32 tasks, with a total of over 18,000 tasks that exist in the economy.

Brynjolfsson’s team took this data set and evaluated each skillset to determine which tasks could be done better by AI, and which were performed better by humans. The team found that for plenty of jobs there were always tasks that AI could do better than humans, but there were still plenty of tasks that humans excelled at over AI and machine learning.
“This was the pattern we found in occupation after occupation — that very rarely did machine learning just run the table. In most cases, machine learning was able to do some tasks but not others within a given occupation,” Brynjolfsson says. “That means that most of the jobs in your organization will be partly affected by machine learning, but there’ll also be things that the humans need to continue to do.”











 
 
 
This will require coordination to help AI and humans work together, “but very rarely will we just completely wipe out entire job categories,” Brynjolfsson says. 
Upskilling the workforce
But what about AI-assisted robots? There, the conclusion is the same. In plenty of instances, robots can help alleviate time-consuming, menial, tedious or even physically-strenuous tasks, without employees losing their jobs. In fact, the most likely scenario would see humans and robots working together, with many robots purpose-built for collaboration, also known as co-bots.
We’re still far off from “artificial general intelligence,” which is the type of automation you might see in a movie, where robots can “outwit people on every dimension,” says Brynjolfsson. But AI can make a big difference in the enterprise — especially with any task with sufficient data that has a “set of inputs that map to a set of outputs.”











 
 
 
Panelist Jason Jackson, an assistant professor in political economy and urban planning at MIT, gave the example of healthcare workers. Automating tasks such as patient transfers and lifts can help alleviate some of the physical burden on workers, Jackson says, while also protecting patients and preventing injury. It’s a task that requires strength and effort on the healthcare practitioner’s side — so in this case, automating one skill won’t replace healthcare workers, it will just help them be more effective while also delivering a safer environment for the workers and patients, he adds.

There’s a similar trend in the automotive and manufacturing industries, according to panelist Elisabeth Reynolds, executive director of MIT’s Work of the Future Task Force. She argues that co-bots are creating more upward growth and opportunities for workers now that they’re free to work on more complex tasks. And, while some industries may face displacement, Reynolds says “it is a small percentage of the growth that we see.”
Ownership of AI and machine learning data
The future of robots and AI in the enterprise isn’t without risk. As with past technologies, businesses need to look ahead at potential risks, problems or roadblocks. One key area of anticipated concern revolves around data.











 
 
 
“Many people thought that social media would usher in this wonderful future of connectedness and community, but in many ways it didn’t. It led to some very dysfunctional outcomes. So how do we manage the risk so that AI and automation won’t have those similar unintended consequences?” says Reynolds.
Toronto, for example, let Google install sensors and other equipment to gather data on a street or in a community to deliver valuable information about the city and to discover new insights into the infrastructure, she says. But who owns that data? Does the data belong to Google, or to Toronto?
“It’s obviously owned by the city as well, but does the city have the resources or capabilities to actually do good with that?” Reynolds asks. These are all important questions businesses will have to ask themselves as they commit to relying on data, especially as AI blends further into the workforce and our lives.











 
 
 
As businesses embrace AI, robots, machine learning and deep learning, they will need a clear strategy for leveraging the technology without creating fear around the displacement of jobs or crossing ethical lines. 
“The point here is to affirm and assert that there will be work in the future and our challenge is to make sure that that work is a quality work, that is meaningful work, that is accessible work,” says Reynolds.

News Branch Air Force 
This Is Not How ‘Skynet’ Begins, Air Force Says of Artificial Intelligence Efforts

A top Air Force commander has assured reporters that no, the military’s experiments with artificial intelligence are not the first step toward “Skynet,” the evil defense network in the “Terminator” movies that tried to wipe out humanity.
Google recently announced that it will not work with the Pentagon beyond its 2017 contract on Project Maven, an effort to have artificial intelligence help analyze footage from drones.
Speaking at a Defense Writers Group breakfast on Thursday morning, Air Force Gen. Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, said that the purpose of Project Maven is to determine whether “machines can learn to do the things that people are doing.” 
Holmes went on to explain that the Air Force does not have enough people to watch all of the full motion video taken from drones, so airmen are using so-called “learning algorithms” to teach machines what to look for in the endless footage. 
“The way we’ve been doing that kind of the same way I watch 3-year-olds learn things on their iPads“,” Holmes said. “Pick all the green things. Is that green? No. Is that green? Yes. So you do the same thing with a machine.” 
When machines recognize something important in the drone footage they can alert intelligence analysts, Holmes continued. Having machines do the repetitive tasks frees up people to “focus on things that people do best” and allows decision-makers to get important information quicker.
A related effort is Air Operations Center Pathfinder, in which coders and operators work together to quickly develop software that reduces the time needed to plan mission, task aircraft, and develop targets.
The Pentagon’s interest in artificial intelligence has raised concerns in Silicon Valley. Executives with Google, a subcontractor for Project Maven, said in June 7 statements that the company “would not support the use of AI for weaponized systems,” though it would continue to work with military on cybersecurity, recruitment, veterans’ healthcare and search and rescue.
Holmes said he is confident that the Air Force can continue to work with Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence technologies that can deter wars by making sure that enemies know that any attack against the United States is doomed to fail.
“What I would like to do is convince people that we’re all in the business of avoiding major war,” Holmes said. “That’s what we’re trying to do. We’re going to have to rely on our industrial capabilities that are on that business and AI side if we’re going to do that. So how we can work together to set a rule set so we can go forward?”
But for decades Hollywood has been warning us that artificial intelligence will inevitably go rogue. So, naturally, Task & Purpose asked Holmes directly if Project Maven is the first step toward Skynet. 
“I certainly hope not,” he replied.
To ease concerns about a possible robot insurrection, Holmes pointed to the fact that, although learning machines have beat experts at chess, Go, and other games, they are far less effective without the assistance of experienced human operators.
“We’re going to have to work through as Americans our comfort level on how technologies are used and how they are applied,” Holmes said. “I understand the views of the people there. It goes into being a member of the military: I wield some pretty impressive technologies and our job is to make sure that we use them for good and in accordance with the rules that are laid out in the Constitution.”
“These are all complex issues that we’ll have to work through, but I’m not worried yet about AOC Pathfinder taking over as Skynet,” Holmes added.

How many times in the last year have you heard the question, ""Is artificial intelligence going to take over our jobs?"" For marketers, this question is just as relevant, but I'm here to tell you that robots are our marketing friends.Related: Is Artificial Intelligence Replacing Your Intelligence?We are just at the start of tapping into artificial intelligence (AI) for marketing, but there are already a number of great ways that this  technology is improving our jobs, not killing them.



AI, in fact, has the potential to do the jobs we don't want and the jobs we can't do, and to ultimately help us do the jobs we already do, better. Here's more on each prediction:AI is doing the jobs we don't want to do.The first obvious application of artificial intelligence is to automate the tasks that we humans don't want to do -- those repetitive, low- skill tasks. AI can be easily programmed to do such work and do it faster, more cheaply and more reliably. A great example is the cataloguing of marketing data to be used for analysis.


Say, for example, that you wanted to write a unique blog article on the topic of ""video marketing."" In order to figure out a unique angle for your article, you may want to catalogue all of the existing content on the topic of ""video marketing"" and even categorize each article by website, author and share metrics. This could be a very manual process for a human  and something that would invite human error into the process.Where AI shines is that it can do such repetitive tasks -- but at scale. Imagine that, in the same time frame, a junior marketer could catalogue 100 ""video marketing"" articles while a machine could catalogue more than 1,000 articles on the same topic, along with 1,000 articles each for 100 more topics.Such AI ability becomes particularly useful for marketers who are attempting to aggregate data about what's happening outside of their company -- what's being published by their competitors, customers or industry peers. There are tens of millions of pieces of content data created every minute, and if marketers want to leverage it, we need to employ machines to help.AI is doing the jobs we can't do.Not only is AI automating jobs we don't want to do, it's also opening the doors to jobs we can't do. Since AI has the ability to process an infinitely larger dataset than a human can, it can leverage that scale to identify marketing insights that would otherwise be lost.


Say you want to take the next step in that content-marketing data-collection project: You not only want to catalogue all of the ""video marketing"" content, but to catalogue all of the content being published in your industry more broadly. Ultimately, you'll want to use this catalogue to drive market-informed content campaigns of our own.Identifying new topics emerging or types of articles that garner above-average shares can help direct new content creation to align with existing trends. A given article could have many different qualities that could lead to its success. It's AI's ability to tag and compare many data points that ultimately produce the marketing takeaway.Related: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on 2018's Top HR TrendsAI's strength in turning a mass of data into insight truly shines in the noisiest, highest-volume channels that a marketer hopes to master. Social media, content marketing, news and PR are great places to start, but even competitors' job postings and website changes can be great inputs for marketing campaigns if a business can manage to extract insight out of the noise.


Again, AI-based technologies have the ability to throw out the noise -- whether that means the same old promotional tweet or a website update to fix a typo. Those technologies can then focus on the signal -- like a tweet about an acquisition or a website change to alter a competitor's pricing. In this way, AI can see both the forest and the trees in online data to surface takeaways for marketers they would not be able to find manually -- and in real-time, at that.AI is improving the jobs we already do.By incorporating AI into our marketing, we have the opportunity to free up that expensive, intelligent, creative resource that is a marketer to do higher value work. Instead of collecting data, marketers can analyze it. Instead of sifting through data, marketers can act on it.Related: 5 Innovative Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Advancing TechnologyBy delegating work to AI-driven technologies, marketers can improve their work by creating content they know will stand out, by implementing conversion-optimization strategies observed from competitors' sites and enabling sales using the latest competitor pricing. And that's just the start of what AI can potentially do.

AI Background Checks for the Gig EconomyDo AI Background Checks Work Well?Real-time Background Checks Using AIDue Diligence Background Checks Using AIConclusion 









People are creepy, and we’re not just talking about clowns and people who drive cargo vans. We recently learned that nearly one-third of our fellow American adults, more than 70 million people, have been arrested on a felony charge at some point in their lives. We should note that arrests do not equal convictions, so don’t load up the van with the kiddos and head for the hills just yet. No doubt many of those arrests were (in the past) for smoking the sweet leaf, so you gotta figure about 90 percent of those at a Phish concert are felons. Still, most companies aren’t taking any chances when it comes to hiring employees. 
About 72 percent of employers conduct background checks of some kind, according to CareerBuilder. (This is different from “identity verification”, which is something companies like Onfido do.) Once a company knows that you are who you say you are, then they want to make sure there’s nothing in your background that might raise red flags. And for that, they’re turning to artificial intelligence (AI).
AI Background Checks for the Gig Economy
One of the faster-growing companies doing background checks using AI is a startup called Checkr. The San Francisco company hooked a $100 million Series C megaround in April that included previous investors Accel Partners and Y Combinator. The global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) led the round. Even Google got involved back in a $9 million Series A in October 2014. That brings total disclosed funding to $149 million since then. 
Update 09/19/2019: Checkr has raised $160 million in fresh funding to expand internationally, past the U.S. and Canada where it got its start in 2014. This brings the company’s total funding to $309 million to date.  
In those four years, Checkr has scaled to run one million background checks per month for more than 10,000 customers. We briefly profiled Checkr last year for our article on “6 Digital Identity Verification Startups to Check Out.”

The company plans to nearly double its workforce with the new infusion of cash, as well as build out its technology, including increasing the speed, data insights, and accuracy of its AI platform for background checks. Much digital ink has been spilled over how artificial intelligence has certain biases based on the data it has been trained on, such as facial recognition software that mistook pictures of black people for apes. That’s not the case with Checkr, co-founder Daniel Yanisse told Entrepreneur. In fact, he said the AI does not attempt to predict if a person will be a good fit for the job or even make recommendations. Instead, the machine automates data classification for fact-based categories, such as determining whether an offense is a driving violation or an assault.
In fact, Yanisse and team believe that by using AI for background checks, Checkr is helping take human bias out of the hiring and recruiting equation. Clients can customize the AI-powered background check to exclude certain criminal offenses that might not be relevant to the job.
Do AI Background Checks Work Well?
Good question. If you asked the victims of sexual assault or abuse in the 103 alleged cases involving Uber drivers in the United States, they’d probably give you a collective “fcuk no” for an answer. (Just to be clear, we’re talking about cases where guilt has been established in a court of law, not the kangaroo courts on Twitter.) Even then, half of all convicted sex offenses in London cabs in 2016 were committed by Uber drivers, according to Business Insider. Last year, Colorado fined Uber nearly $9 million when it was discovered that 57 drivers had criminal or motor vehicle violations that should have disqualified them from working for the ride-hailing company. On the other hand, Uber provides about 15 million rides per day around the world, most of which involve nothing more sinister than awkward silence or being subjected to the musical whims of a tone-deaf driver.
Background checks by Checkr using artificial intelligence typically screen potential Uber drivers’ records within the past seven years, according to a report by CNN. Felony convictions, violent crime or sexual offenses, or a registration on the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender public website automatically disqualifies an applicant from being an Uber driver. In addition, Uber announced it would conduct annual background checks of its drivers. At an estimated $35 a pop for each driver (though we would guess Uber has negotiated some sort of discount), that’s a steady stream of revenue for Checkr. As a private company—the world’s biggest second biggest in fact—Uber doesn’t release employment numbers, but some educated guesses put its on-demand workforce at about two million drivers.

Checkr was originally founded to serve the gig (or freelance) economy, which by some estimates accounts for a third of the U.S. workforce. In that regard, they promised a turnaround of one to two days on most background checks. In addition to Uber, the company counts on-demand employers like Lyft, Grubhub, Instacart, and Postmates, as well as more traditional employers such as Allstate, as clients. If two days is too long, then our next startup might be able to help.
Real-time Background Checks Using AI
Founded in 2014, Intelligo Group offers background checks using artificial intelligence on both individuals and companies. It has raised $6.8 million, the most recent round a $5.7 million Series A last October. Intelligo’s AI platform, dubbed Clarity, collects and monitors data from thousands of sources including global news media, sanctions and blacklists, politically exposed person records (whatever that means), civil and criminal legal records, SEC filings, corporate records, social media, blogs and more. Algorithms then attack the data, likely using natural language understanding or processing to pore over volumes of structured and unstructured data, simulating the “thought process of human analysts by piecing scattered information together to extract meaningful insights.”

Intelligo markets its background check platform for more than just employment verification. One of its proposed markets is for investment funds. In that case, Clarity allows clients to monitor and conduct due diligence on executives, fund managers, investors, third-party vendors, employees, and management teams. For example, an investor may want to investigate the management team of a potential early-stage investment. It’s sort of background check meets business intelligence. Would it have caught Theranos before it walked away with $700 million in investments? This next company might have.
Due Diligence Background Checks Using AI
While we typically associate background checks with humans, there’s an equally important need to assess the worthiness of business entities. We come across this problem all the time when looking through some of the nefarious organizations that over-the-counter (OTC) companies align themselves with. That’s where our next solution comes in. The story starts with a Canadian startup called OutsideIQ which developed an AI-based automated due diligence solution that you can use to analyze potential clients, investments, transactions, third-parties, and counterparties. Says the company:

DDIQ is an automated risk analytics product that learns about its search subject by going to thousands of sources. It identifies, evaluates and rates risks presenting the data which can be immediately used to make key business decisions. All in about 5 minutes.
In 2017, they were acquired by a leading regtech firm called Exiger. The tool can now be used to monitor risk on a daily basis. You can be sure that all of this is moving more towards real-time risk assessments where companies can quickly disassociate themselves with any problematic persons or parties that may suddenly raise red flags. This underscores the importance of following the judicial process that’s been in place for decades, as opposed to “guilt by accusation”.
Conclusion
We already know that big data can be used to pull together all sorts of reports about us thanks to huge amounts of data exhaust we create online, especially through social media channels. Cambridge Analytica certainly isn’t the only company to ever engage in debatable data-mining practices. Combined with artificial intelligence, big data empowers companies to learn just about anything they might want to know about customers or competitors – whether that’s Coca Cola just trying to sell more sugary drinks that increase diabetes risk and obesity, or a startup turning online behavior into a credit score. The market potential to package each person’s digital data based on business potential—in this case, background checks on individuals and companies—can seem creepier than a circus clown. But those clowns will be laughing all the way to the bank.

Some of your articles are interesting but I’m going to remove you from my email white list. Disturbed people like you seem to think it’s fashionable to use 4 letter words in public venues. It seems to be a growing trend on the left. But it just shows a lack the skills to express yourself normally, and you have personality dis-orders. No I’m not a Victorian prude. I served in the military where I frequently used every swear word/phrase in the book, in 2 languages. The military, football fields, locker rooms, buddys having beers in a back yard, etc. are the kinds of places such language belongs. Not on a public web page where kids and grandmas will probably see it.

A beautiful space-exploration friendship between human and machine may have just begun.Early this morning (June 29), a small robot endowed with artificial intelligence (AI) launched on a two-day trip to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule. No other AI-equipped machine has ever flown to space before, project team members said.The mission of the bantam astronaut assistant — known as CIMON, short for ""Crew Interactive Mobile Companion"" — is relatively short and modest. But its work off-Earth could help pave the way for some pretty big things, according to NASA officials.

""We'll have to have tools like this to have the species successfully live far away from Earth.""A smart flying sphereCIMON was developed by the European aerospace company Airbus on behalf of the German space agency, which is known by its German acronym, DLR. The robot's AI is IBM's famous Watson system.CIMON is roughly spherical and weighs 11 lbs. (5 kilograms). The robot can converse with people, and it knows whom it's talking to thanks to facial-recognition software. (CIMON has a face of its own — a simple cartoon one.) The astronaut assistant is also mobile; once aboard the ISS, CIMON will be able to fly around, by sucking air in and expelling it through special tubes.Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Though CIMON is flexible enough to interact with anyone, it's ""tailored to"" European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst, who arrived at the ISS aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft earlier this month. CIMON's mission calls for the robot to work with Gerst on three separate investigations. A close-up of CIMON, the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, an A.I.-equipped robot that is the first of its kind to fly in space.

(Image credit: DLR/T. Bourry/ESA)""They will experiment with crystals, work together to solve the Rubik's cube and perform a complex medical experiment using CIMON as an 'intelligent' flying camera,"" Airbus representatives wrote in a mission description earlier this year.CIMON will be a very involved partner in this work, which will take a total of 3 hours.""Alexander Gerst could say something like, 'CIMON, could you please help me perform a certain experiment? Could you please help me with the procedure?'"" Philipp Schulien, a CIMON system engineer at Airbus, said during a different news conference yesterday. ""And then CIMON will fly towards Alexander Gerst, and they will already start the communication.""CIMON will be able to access lots of relevant information, including photos and videos, about the procedure in question. And the astronaut assistant is smart enough to deal with ""questions beyond the procedure"" that Gerst might have, Schulien added.A step toward the futureCIMON's mission is a technology demonstration designed to show researchers how humans and machines can interact and collaborate in the space environment. It'll be a while before intelligent robots are ready to do any really heavy lifting in the final frontier — say, helping astronauts repair damaged spacecraft systems or treating sick crewmembers. But that day is probably coming.""For us, this is a piece of the future of human spaceflight,"" Christian Karrasch, CIMON project leader at DLR, said yesterday.""If you go out to the moon or to Mars, you cannot take all mankind and engineers with you,"" Karrasch added. ""So, the astronauts, they will be on their own. But with an artificial intelligence, you have instantly all the knowledge of mankind.""Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

He helped build the internet's fundamental architecture in the 1970s — creating the transmission protocols that allow computers to talk to each other — when the project was still funded by the military.Today, ties to the armed forces are causing trouble for Google, where Dr Cerf now holds the only-in-America title of ""Chief Internet Evangelist"".This article contains content that is no longer available.In late May, the New York Times reported that Google's involvement with the US Department of Defence's Maven Program, which aims to use artificial intelligence to assess video, had set off ""an existential crisis"" internally.Employees resigned, morally opposed to the work that some feared could be used to facilitate drone strikes. About 4,000 workers signed a petition demanding ""a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology"".By June, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had unveiled a set of seven principles to guide the company's artificial intelligence work, and promised not to pursue ""weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people"".Google will not renew its Maven contract with the Pentagon.Internet started with the militaryThe internet precursor, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) sent its first message in 1969.The network's early iterations were reserved mostly for academia and the armed forces up until the late 1980s.Decades later, the internet co-designer appears to be more comfortable with the company's recent work than some of his protesting colleagues.""The purposes of the Maven project, as I understood it anyway, had a lot to do with situational awareness so that you could understand what's in the field of view — are there vehicles in the field of view? ... This is just to understand what's going on,"" Dr Cerf told the ABC.""Some people, I think, extrapolated from that kind of capability to all kinds of other things that they thought we shouldn't be involved with.""Nevertheless, the debate over Google's new principles was an important albeit sometimes painful discussion to have, he told an audience at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.""I think it's early days yet, but the intent is to establish oversight committees that will evaluate projects before we start them in order to assess the degree to which they might be harmful,"" he explained later.Artificial intelligence is 'artificial idiocy' Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently announced the company's artificial intelligence principles.(Getty Images: VCG/VCG)Despite the fears of ""killer robots"" and weaponised algorithms, Dr Cerf suggested artificial intelligence is sometimes best called ""artificial idiocy"".""I can say that I've always been a little sceptical,"" he said.For now, he is concerned these systems are still often ""brittle"". They are deep and narrow in their capabilities, and no match for human ability.Once you or I know what a table is, for example, you begin to know that any flat location perpendicular to the Earth's gravitational surface could be used as a table.""A lap, your chair, a real table, this stage,"" he said. ""In just a few examples, we've generalised the notion of table. Human beings do this really well. Computers don't know how to do this well.""I asked everyone, from Facebook to data brokers to Stan, for my infoIt got messy.Read moreInternet is still vibrantIn fact, Dr Cerf would not countenance too much internet doom and gloom.Besides the Federal Communications Commission's recent repeal of net neutrality in the United States, which he did see as a serious setback, he suggested the internet ecosystem remained vibrant. And the internet's co-parent isn't caught up by technological anxiety.""I'm not persuaded that what we're living through is any more traumatic or dramatic than what happened in the first half of the 20th century or the second half of the 20th century,"" he said, pointing to jet planes and televisions and radio.Nevertheless, this future doesn't seem to involve much rest. Dr Cerf suggested that lifelong education is essential if we want to survive the coming decades (he's now deep into microbiology himself).""It's certain that there will be technological changes in eight decades that make the world look very different from what it was when you went to school,"" he told the ABC.""I think that's a really cool outcome, that we work and study and work and study and work and study in order to stay current.""Posted 27 Jun 201827 Jun 2018Wed 27 Jun 2018 at 9:48pm, updated 27 Jun 201827 Jun 2018Wed 27 Jun 2018 at 11:00pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)More on:AustraliaComputer ScienceInformation and CommunicationInternetInternet CultureRoboticsScience and TechnologyUnited StatesTop StoriesHow politics, engagement bait and money opened up a firehose of falsehoods after Trump's shootingJudge tosses Trump documents case, ruling prosecutor unlawfully appointedWe came for the spectacle of a Trump rally.
