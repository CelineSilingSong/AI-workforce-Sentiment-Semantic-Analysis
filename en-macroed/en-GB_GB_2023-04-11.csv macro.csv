Today, most of your workforce wouldn’t identify themselves as content creators or even knowledge workers. However, many individuals throughout your company are constantly tasked with producing and curating content. Whether they are summarizing meeting notes, conducting research for a report or preparing documentation for a new product launch, they are frequently waist deep in creating, editing and sharing information both internally and externally.


A small portion of this content is highly strategic to your business—it must be high-quality, authoritative and original. Nobody will question the time and effort that’s spent on this content to get it right. While still important to your operations, the rest of the less strategic content being produced is mostly routine, mundane and repetitive. Even though this tactical form of content doesn’t need to be the equivalent of a gourmet meal, it still needs to be tasty, healthy and safe to eat. In other words, at a minimum, the content must be on point, clear, consistent and error-free.

Creating content can be an involved process as it can span multiple steps such as planning, researching, writing, editing and publishing. To move new content through all these stages on a weekly basis can often be a tedious and time-consuming process. While companies have been able to outsource some content creation responsibilities to outside contractors, technology solutions haven’t been able to significantly lessen the burden of content creation—until recently.

PROMOTED
Enter Generative AI
Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content such as text, images, audio and other media based on prompts from users. With the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to the general public in November 2022, a tremor was felt around the world as the power of AI was democratized to the masses. In only five days after launching, the online service surpassed one million users—something that took Instagram two-and-a-half months and Spotify five months to accomplish. Now, countless startups and software applications have begun touting their own generative AI capabilities and integrations.

Many businesses are beginning to pay closer attention to what generative AI has to offer as well. In a recently released study by Salesforce, 57 percent of senior IT leaders believed generative AI is a ‘game changer.’ Even though a third of the respondents (515 IT leaders) felt it was overhyped, 80 percent of these skeptics still felt generative AI could help their organizations better serve their customers. Goldman Sachs Research predicts generative AI “could drive a seven percent (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.”

In a recent OpenAI study, researchers predicted that generative AI could impact at least ten percent of work tasks for approximately 80 percent of the US workforce. Nineteen percent of workers could see at least 50 percent of their tasks impacted. While the emergence of generative AI may end up displacing some workers, it will fundamentally transform how most people produce content, especially with the routine, repetitive and mundane tasks. ARK Big Ideas 2023 predicts that by 2030 knowledge workers will see a more than fourfold increase in productivity by leveraging AI technologies.

How will Generative AI transform worker productivity?
We are starting to get some glimpses into the productivity gains offered by generative AI. Research analyst Joachim Klement shared a couple of early studies that reveal its promise. The first study asked a group of programmers to complete a programming task. Half of the participants were given access to a generative AI (GitHub Copilot) and were able to complete the task in 71 minutes, which was about 56 percent less time than the programmers who didn’t use AI assistance (161 minutes).

In a second study, 200 university-educated professionals were given a writing task that half could use ChatGPT to complete. The AI-assisted participants were able to complete the task in less time—17 minutes compared to 27 minutes (a 37 percent boost in productivity). Not only where they faster but when the assignments were graded by independent judges, the AI-enabled participants received a higher average grade (B versus C+). The researchers also discovered the weaker participants benefited the most from using the generative AI technology, as it essentially leveled out the performance between low and top performers.
By combining the massive processing power of algorithms with the crowdsourced knowledge and expertise contained within its training data, generative AI helps workers shorten the time it takes to complete their tasks and enhances the quality of their outputs. Every worker can benefit from a personal assistant that can help perform manual tasks, help brainstorm ideas, proofread drafts, develop sample designs and so on. Eventually, generative AI technology will provide workforces with an array of specialized AI assistants to perform a variety of common tasks. Unlike their human counterparts, they are always available, willing to help and won’t care how you leverage their suggestions.
The productivity gains from generative AI will quickly emerge from several areas. A helpful way of understanding the sources of these efficiency gains is through the perspective of the key stages in content creation:Generative AI can assist with all five steps in the content creation process. Brent Dykes


Plan. Creating a strategy for what content you need and how you will approach it is an important first step in the process. Generative AI can provide guidance on building a plan for creating, structuring and deploying content. For example, an entrepreneur could prompt for an outline for her business plan or get help in devising a content calendar with recommendations on what topics and channels to target.
Research. Until now, research has primarily involved using search engines to scour the internet for relevant and trusted information. Now, based on simple prompts, generative AI can process a massive amount of information and produce summarized key findings on a topic. For instance, a product manager could use generative AI to research the top consumer pain points in relation to his new product concept and get comprehensive results related to the problem.
Write/design. Developing a first draft of any content can often be the most time-intensive step. Generative AI can streamline the process of creating an initial draft in whatever writing style and format you desire. For example, a senior manager can provide a generative AI tool with a set of bullet points on different market trends and have it write up an entire long form marketing blog post with relevant examples optimized around specific SEO keywords.
Edit/polish. Once you’ve created an initial draft, you often need to further revise, consolidate and improve it. While generative AI doesn’t remove the responsibility for human editing—and may even require more oversight—it can also contribute to streamlining your editing process. For instance, a sales representative can use generative AI to proofread an RFP response for sentence structure and word choice as well as experiment with different tones or styles to better match the sales opportunity.
Publish. After you finalize your content, you may need to format it differently so it can be distributed across different channels. Generative AI can be used to quickly refactor content to fit different formats. For example, a designer could use the technology to rapidly create and distribute variations of a single design across multiple social media channels.


From the inception to the delivery of content, generative AI can play an integral role in simplifying and streamlining each stage of the content creation process. When you aggregate the time savings across all these stages, you start to appreciate the tremendous value this technology offers. However, at this early stage in its development, organizations still need to be cautious with how it’s applied within their businesses.
Some bumps in the road before Generative AI can be fully adopted
Recently, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said artificial intelligence was the second biggest innovation in his lifetime after the graphical user interface in 1980. However, many business leaders are not yet convinced it’s ready for primetime—with good reasons too. While early results are promising and extremely compelling, more focus and attention will be needed on the following issues:


Accuracy concerns. Generative AI can’t always distinguish between fact and fiction. It can argue confidently that cow eggs are much bigger than chicken eggs. Without proper factchecking, users can be fed bad information that sounds coherent but is complete nonsense.
Privacy and security concerns. Sensitive (HIPAA) or proprietary information should not be shared with public generative AI tools. Unfortunately, companies such as Samsung are discovering their employees have uploaded confidential source code and strategic meeting notes into non-private generative AI tools.
Bias concerns. Currently, generative AI tools are mostly trained on data collected from the Internet. Human biases that are rampant online become ingrained in these algorithms, and they end up further reinforcing prejudices based on gender, race, nationality and politics. Microsoft’s Tay—a Twitter chatbot—and Meta’s Galactica—a large learning model (LLM) based on scientific articles—were both quickly shut down (16 hours and three days respectively) after they were caught mimicking sexist and racist language.
Ethical concerns. When generative AI’s training data relies on the text and images from other people, it raises concerns about attribution and intellectual property. Getty Images recently sued Stable Diffusion for copyright infringement when the art generative AI tool copied 12 million images for training purposes without permission or attribution to the artists. In addition, generative AI can be used to create deepfakes, misinformation and propaganda.


Before organizations can fully embrace this promising technology, more work on standards, policies and guidelines must be done by vendors, governments and client organizations to help mitigate these issues. Generative AI is going to play an important but disruptive role in how we work going forward. While your organization can choose to wait until everything is figured out, it may not be the best strategy based on the accelerating pace of AI innovation.
Start experimenting with Generative AI today
After years of business intelligence consulting experience, Nick Kelly started his own analytics training and consulting business that specializes in dashboard design and adoption. Like many other entrepreneurs, he was amazed by AI’s capabilities—but the technology also made him anxious about his future.
Rather than waiting to see how things would play out, Kelly launched a bold experiment. He challenged ChatGPT to replicate his expertise in creating the requirements for enterprise dashboards. He trained the generative AI tool using more than 50,000 words from his book and other training materials.
What he then discovered was astonishing. Using ChatGPT, he was able to rapidly generate industry-specific questions and a reasonable set of starting requirements to review with his clients, which greatly shortened the discovery process by hours. In addition, with ChatGPT, he found he could generate sample metrics for his dashboard wireframes that were largely aligned with industry standards and only needed minor revisions.
Although he was impressed with these results, Kelly was still skeptical of whether generative AI could also help with dashboard UI design. In general, he has found professionals struggle the most with the design aspects. However, using Midjourney—an image-focused generative AI—Kelly discovered he was able to produce visually stunning mock designs in a fraction of the time it took him previously. The color choices and design cues from these AI-generated mock-ups inspired more appealing interfaces for his dashboards.
Prior to his experiment, Kelly felt threatened by generative AI and skeptical of how it could help his business. Now, he is adapting his skills to this transformative technology and integrating AI tools throughout his new process. The results have been impressive—greater efficiency, wowed clients and a sharpened focus on how he can deliver more value.
Author Frank Herbert said, “Technology is both a tool for helping humans and for destroying them. This is the paradox of our times which we’re compelled to face.” While your organization must be careful how it uses generative AI, you’ll benefit from the lessons your teams learn now as the technology continues to mature. The productivity stakes are too high to cling to the status quo and not explore how generative AI can enhance your existing workflows. Personally, I’m excited to test this technology within my own data storytelling business—and I hope you are too.

The seeds of a machine learning (ML) paradigm shift have existed for decades, but with the ready availability of scalable compute capacity, a massive proliferation of data, and the rapid advancement of ML technologies, customers across industries are transforming their businesses. Just recently, generative AI applications like ChatGPT have captured widespread attention and imagination. We are truly at an exciting inflection point in the widespread adoption of ML, and we believe most customer experiences and applications will be reinvented with generative AI.
AI and ML have been a focus for Amazon for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers use with Amazon are driven by ML. Our e-commerce recommendations engine is driven by ML; the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers are driven by ML; and our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are informed by ML. Prime Air (our drones) and the computer vision technology in Amazon Go (our physical retail experience that lets consumers select items off a shelf and leave the store without having to formally check out) use deep learning. Alexa, powered by more than 30 different ML systems, helps customers billions of times each week to manage smart homes, shop, get information and entertainment, and more. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to ML, and it’s a big part of our heritage, current ethos, and future.
At AWS, we have played a key role in democratizing ML and making it accessible to anyone who wants to use it, including more than 100,000 customers of all sizes and industries. AWS has the broadest and deepest portfolio of AI and ML services at all three layers of the stack. We’ve invested and innovated to offer the most performant, scalable infrastructure for cost-effective ML training and inference; developed Amazon SageMaker, which is the easiest way for all developers to build, train, and deploy models; and launched a wide range of services that allow customers to add AI capabilities like image recognition, forecasting, and intelligent search to applications with a simple API call. This is why customers like Intuit, Thomson Reuters, AstraZeneca, Ferrari, Bundesliga, 3M, and BMW, as well as thousands of startups and government agencies around the world, are transforming themselves, their industries, and their missions with ML. We take the same democratizing approach to generative AI: we work to take these technologies out of the realm of research and experiments and extend their availability far beyond a handful of startups and large, well-funded tech companies. That’s why today I’m excited to announce several new innovations that will make it easy and practical for our customers to use generative AI in their businesses.


Building with Generative AI on AWS

Generative AI and foundation models
Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Like all AI, generative AI is powered by ML models—very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and commonly referred to as Foundation Models (FMs). Recent advancements in ML (specifically the invention of the transformer-based neural network architecture) have led to the rise of models that contain billions of parameters or variables. To give a sense for the change in scale, the largest pre-trained model in 2019 was 330M parameters. Now, the largest models are more than 500B parameters—a 1,600x increase in size in just a few years. Today’s FMs, such as the large language models (LLMs) GPT3.5 or BLOOM, and the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion from Stability AI, can perform a wide range of tasks that span multiple domains, like writing blog posts, generating images, solving math problems, engaging in dialog, and answering questions based on a document. The size and general-purpose nature of FMs make them different from traditional ML models, which typically perform specific tasks, like analyzing text for sentiment, classifying images, and forecasting trends.
FMs can perform so many more tasks because they contain such a large number of parameters that make them capable of learning complex concepts. And through their pre-training exposure to internet-scale data in all its various forms and myriad of patterns, FMs learn to apply their knowledge within a wide range of contexts. While the capabilities and resulting possibilities of a pre-trained FM are amazing, customers get really excited because these generally capable models can also be customized to perform domain-specific functions that are differentiating to their businesses, using only a small fraction of the data and compute required to train a model from scratch. The customized FMs can create a unique customer experience, embodying the company’s voice, style, and services across a wide variety of consumer industries, like banking, travel, and healthcare. For instance, a financial firm that needs to auto-generate a daily activity report for internal circulation using all the relevant transactions can customize the model with proprietary data, which will include past reports, so that the FM learns how these reports should read and what data was used to generate them.
The potential of FMs is incredibly exciting. But, we are still in the very early days. While ChatGPT has been the first broad generative AI experience to catch customers’ attention, most folks studying generative AI have quickly come to realize that several companies have been working on FMs for years, and there are several different FMs available—each with unique strengths and characteristics. As we’ve seen over the years with fast-moving technologies, and in the evolution of ML, things change rapidly. We expect new architectures to arise in the future, and this diversity of FMs will set off a wave of innovation. We’re already seeing new application experiences never seen before. AWS customers have asked us how they can quickly take advantage of what is out there today (and what is likely coming tomorrow) and quickly begin using FMs and generative AI within their businesses and organizations to drive new levels of productivity and transform their offerings.
Announcing Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Titan models, the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with FMs
Customers have told us there are a few big things standing in their way today. First, they need a straightforward way to find and access high-performing FMs that give outstanding results and are best-suited for their purposes. Second, customers want integration into applications to be seamless, without having to manage huge clusters of infrastructure or incur large costs. Finally, customers want it to be easy to take the base FM, and build differentiated apps using their own data (a little data or a lot). Since the data customers want to use for customization is incredibly valuable IP, they need it to stay completely protected, secure, and private during that process, and they want control over how their data is shared and used.
We took all of that feedback from customers, and today we are excited to announce Amazon Bedrock, a new service that makes FMs from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon accessible via an API. Bedrock is the easiest way for customers to build and scale generative AI-based applications using FMs, democratizing access for all builders. Bedrock will offer the ability to access a range of powerful FMs for text and images—including Amazon’s Titan FMs, which consist of two new LLMs we’re also announcing today—through a scalable, reliable, and secure AWS managed service. With Bedrock’s serverless experience, customers can easily find the right model for what they’re trying to get done, get started quickly, privately customize FMs with their own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into their applications using the AWS tools and capabilities they are familiar with, without having to manage any infrastructure (including integrations with Amazon SageMaker ML features like Experiments to test different models and Pipelines to manage their FMs at scale).
Bedrock customers can choose from some of the most cutting-edge FMs available today. This includes the Jurassic-2 family of multilingual LLMs from AI21 Labs, which follow natural language instructions to generate text in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, and Dutch. Claude, Anthropic’s LLM, can perform a wide variety of conversational and text processing tasks and is based on Anthropic’s extensive research into training honest and responsible AI systems. Bedrock also makes it easy to access Stability AI’s suite of text-to-image foundation models, including Stable Diffusion (the most popular of its kind), which is capable of generating unique, realistic, high-quality images, art, logos, and designs.
One of the most important capabilities of Bedrock is how easy it is to customize a model. Customers simply point Bedrock at a few labeled examples in Amazon S3, and the service can fine-tune the model for a particular task without having to annotate large volumes of data (as few as 20 examples is enough). Imagine a content marketing manager who works at a leading fashion retailer and needs to develop fresh, targeted ad and campaign copy for an upcoming new line of handbags. To do this, they provide Bedrock a few labeled examples of their best performing taglines from past campaigns, along with the associated product descriptions. Bedrock makes a separate copy of the base foundational model that is accessible only to the customer and trains this private copy of the model. After training, Bedrock will automatically start generating effective social media, display ad, and web copy for the new handbags. None of the customer’s data is used to train the original base models, and since all data is encrypted and does not leave a customer’s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), customers can trust that their data will remain private and confidential.
Bedrock is now in limited preview, and customers like Coda are excited about how fast their development teams have gotten up and running. Shishir Mehrotra, Co-founder and CEO of Coda, says, “As a longtime happy AWS customer, we’re excited about how Amazon Bedrock can bring quality, scalability, and performance to Coda AI. Since all our data is already on AWS, we are able to quickly incorporate generative AI using Bedrock, with all the security and privacy we need to protect our data built-in. With over tens of thousands of teams running on Coda, including large teams like Uber, the New York Times, and Square, reliability and scalability are really important.”
We have been previewing Amazon’s new Titan FMs with a few customers before we make them available more broadly in the coming months. We’ll initially have two Titan models. The first is a generative LLM for tasks such as summarization, text generation (for example, creating a blog post), classification, open-ended Q&A, and information extraction. The second is an embeddings LLM that translates text inputs (words, phrases or possibly large units of text) into numerical representations (known as embeddings) that contain the semantic meaning of the text. While this LLM will not generate text, it is useful for applications like personalization and search because by comparing embeddings the model will produce more relevant and contextual responses than word matching. In fact, Amazon.com’s product search capability uses a similar embeddings model among others to help customers find the products they’re looking for. To continue supporting best practices in the responsible use of AI, Titan FMs are built to detect and remove harmful content in the data, reject inappropriate content in the user input, and filter the models’ outputs that contain inappropriate content (such as hate speech, profanity, and violence).
Bedrock makes the power of FMs accessible to companies of all sizes so that they can accelerate the use of ML across their organizations and build their own generative AI applications because it will be easy for all developers. We think Bedrock will be a massive step forward in democratizing FMs, and our partners like Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, and Slalom are building practices to help enterprises go faster with generative AI. Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) like C3 AI and Pega are excited to leverage Bedrock for easy access to its great selection of FMs with all of the security, privacy, and reliability they expect from AWS.
Announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 Trn1n instances powered by AWS Trainium and Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances powered by AWS Inferentia2, the most cost-effective cloud infrastructure for generative AI
Whatever customers are trying to do with FMs—running them, building them, customizing them—they need the most performant, cost-effective infrastructure that is purpose-built for ML. Over the last five years, AWS has been investing in our own silicon to push the envelope on performance and price performance for demanding workloads like ML training and Inference, and our AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips offer the lowest cost for training models and running inference in the cloud. This ability to maximize performance and control costs by choosing the optimal ML infrastructure is why leading AI startups, like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Grammarly, Hugging Face, Runway, and Stability AI run on AWS.
Trn1 instances, powered by Trainium, can deliver up to 50% savings on training costs over any other EC2 instance, and are optimized to distribute training across multiple servers connected with 800 Gbps of second-generation Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) networking. Customers can deploy Trn1 instances in UltraClusters that can scale up to 30,000 Trainium chips (more than 6 exaflops of compute) located in the same AWS Availability Zone with petabit scale networking. Many AWS customers, including Helixon, Money Forward, and the Amazon Search team, use Trn1 instances to help reduce the time required to train the largest-scale deep learning models from months to weeks or even days while lowering their costs. 800 Gbps is a lot of bandwidth, but we have continued to innovate to deliver more, and today we are announcing the general availability of new, network-optimized Trn1n instances, which offer 1600 Gbps of network bandwidth and are designed to deliver 20% higher performance over Trn1 for large, network-intensive models.
Today, most of the time and money spent on FMs goes into training them. This is because many customers are only just starting to deploy FMs into production. However, in the future, when FMs are deployed at scale, most costs will be associated with running the models and doing inference. While you typically train a model periodically, a production application can be constantly generating predictions, known as inferences, potentially generating millions per hour. And these predictions need to happen in real-time, which requires very low-latency and high-throughput networking. Alexa is a great example with millions of requests coming in every minute, which accounts for 40% of all compute costs.
Because we knew that most of the future ML costs would come from running inferences, we prioritized inference-optimized silicon when we started investing in new chips a few years ago. In 2018, we announced Inferentia, the first purpose-built chip for inference. Every year, Inferentia helps Amazon run trillions of inferences and has saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense already. The results are impressive, and we see many opportunities to keep innovating as workloads will only increase in size and complexity as more customers integrate generative AI into their applications.
That’s why we’re announcing today the general availability of Inf2 instances powered by AWS Inferentia2, which are optimized specifically for large-scale generative AI applications with models containing hundreds of billions of parameters. Inf2 instances deliver up to 4x higher throughput and up to 10x lower latency compared to the prior generation Inferentia-based instances. They also have ultra-high-speed connectivity between accelerators to support large-scale distributed inference. These capabilities drive up to 40% better inference price performance than other comparable Amazon EC2 instances and the lowest cost for inference in the cloud. Customers like Runway are seeing up to 2x higher throughput with Inf2 than comparable Amazon EC2 instances for some of their models. This high-performance, low-cost inference will enable Runway to introduce more features, deploy more complex models, and ultimately deliver a better experience for the millions of creators using Runway.
Announcing the general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, free for individual developers
We know that building with the right FMs and running Generative AI applications at scale on the most performant cloud infrastructure will be transformative for customers. The new wave of experiences will also be transformative for users. With generative AI built-in, users will be able to have more natural and seamless interactions with applications and systems. Think of how we can unlock our mobile phones just by looking at them, without needing to know anything about the powerful ML models that make this feature possible.
One area where we foresee the use of generative AI growing rapidly is in coding. Software developers today spend a significant amount of their time writing code that is pretty straightforward and undifferentiated. They also spend a lot of time trying to keep up with a complex and ever-changing tool and technology landscape. All of this leaves developers less time to develop new, innovative capabilities and services. Developers try to overcome this by copying and modifying code snippets from the web, which can result in inadvertently copying code that doesn’t work, contains security vulnerabilities, or doesn’t track usage of open source software. And, ultimately, searching and copying still takes time away from the good stuff.
Generative AI can take this heavy lifting out of the equation by “writing” much of the undifferentiated code, allowing developers to build faster while freeing them up to focus on the more creative aspects of coding. This is why, last year, we announced the preview of Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI coding companion that uses a FM under the hood to radically improve developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real-time based on developers’ comments in natural language and prior code in their Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Developers can simply tell CodeWhisperer to do a task, such as “parse a CSV string of songs” and ask it to return a structured list based on values such as artist, title, and highest chart rank. CodeWhisperer provides a productivity boost by generating an entire function that parses the string and returns the list as specified. Developer response to the preview has been overwhelmingly positive, and we continue to believe that helping developers code could end up being one of the most powerful uses of generative AI we’ll see in the coming years. During the preview, we ran a productivity challenge, and participants who used CodeWhisperer completed tasks 57% faster, on average, and were 27% more likely to complete them successfully than those who didn’t use CodeWhisperer. This is a giant leap forward in developer productivity, and we believe this is only the beginning.
Today, we’re excited to announce the general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer for Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#—plus ten new languages, including Go, Kotlin, Rust, PHP, and SQL. CodeWhisperer can be accessed from IDEs such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, AWS Cloud9, and many more via the AWS Toolkit IDE extensions. CodeWhisperer is also available in the AWS Lambda console. In addition to learning from the billions of lines of publicly available code, CodeWhisperer has been trained on Amazon code. We believe CodeWhisperer is now the most accurate, fastest, and most secure way to generate code for AWS services, including Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3.
Developers aren’t truly going to be more productive if code suggested by their generative AI tool contains hidden security vulnerabilities or fails to handle open source responsibly. CodeWhisperer is the only AI coding companion with built-in security scanning (powered by automated reasoning) for finding and suggesting remediations for hard-to-detect vulnerabilities, such as those in the top ten Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP), those that don’t meet crypto library best practices, and others. To help developers code responsibly, CodeWhisperer filters out code suggestions that might be considered biased or unfair, and CodeWhisperer is the only coding companion that can filter and flag code suggestions that resemble open source code that customers may want to reference or license for use.
We know generative AI is going to change the game for developers, and we want it to be useful to as many as possible. This is why CodeWhisperer is free for all individual users with no qualifications or time limits for generating code! Anyone can sign up for CodeWhisperer with just an email account and become more productive within minutes. You don’t even have to have an AWS account. For business users, we’re offering a CodeWhisperer Professional Tier that includes administration features like single sign-on (SSO) with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) integration, as well as higher limits on security scanning.
Building powerful applications like CodeWhisperer is transformative for developers and all our customers. We have a lot more coming, and we are excited about what you will build with generative AI on AWS. Our mission is to make it possible for developers of all skill levels and for organizations of all sizes to innovate using generative AI. This is just the beginning of what we believe will be the next wave of ML powering new possibilities for you.

	“It’s like collaborating with an alien.”


	“Everything is becoming much easier.”


	“It feels like I’ve hired an intern.”


	“What used to take me around a half-hour to write now takes one minute.”


	“It’s enormous fun.”



The Upshot35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right NowBy Francesca Paris and Larry BuchananApril 14, 2023Share full article710






	The public release of ChatGPT last fall kicked off a wave of interest in artificial intelligence. A.I. models have since snaked their way into many people’s everyday lives. Despite their flaws, ChatGPT and other A.I. tools are helping people to save time at work, to code without knowing how to code, to make daily life easier or just to have fun.


	It goes beyond everyday fiddling: In the last few years, companies and scholars have started to use A.I. to supercharge work they could never have imagined, designing new molecules with the help of an algorithm or building alien-like spaceship parts.


	Here’s how 35 real people are using A.I. for work, life, play and procrastination.





	People are using A.I. to …



	Plan gardens.


John Pritzlaff Gardener


	Mr. Pritzlaff is building a permaculture garden in his backyard in Phoenix, where he uses drought-resistant trees to give shade to other species.


	“I do these ultra-high-density planting arrangements,” he said. “And I’ve been employing ChatGPT to give me inspiration on species that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred to me, and for choosing the site for each tree: the best part of the yard with regard to the sun at different times of the year.”


	Taking into account his geographical location, it suggested, for example, that he might use a moringa tree to provide shade for a star apple.




	Plan workouts.


Louis Maddox Data scientist


	Mr. Maddox finds ChatGPT the perfect companion for his workouts. For example, one day he pasted in his workout notes and said:


	Give a concisely formatted summary of this workout and the muscle groups activated. Note any muscle groups that were missed and suggest how to cover them with extras/replacements.


	After summarizing the notes, ChatGPT said:


Missed Muscle Groups & Suggestions: Quadriceps: Add leg press, squats or lunges. Calves: Add standing or seated calf raises. Glute Activation: Consider adding glute bridges or hip thrusts for better glute focus.


	From there he asked ChatGPT what to prioritize if he didn’t have much time for the gym, and to sketch out roughly how long it might all take.


	It’s not perfect, he says, but it gets the job done. Mostly, he says, ChatGPT helps him get going under time constraints, and not let the busywork “become an excuse not to do it.”




	Plan meals.


Kelsey Szemborski Stay-at-home mother of three


	Ms. Szemborski is a busy mom who is “always on the lookout for something that will make my life easier.” So when she found ChatGPT, she tried asking it for a gluten-free meal plan. And she added:


	It needs to be both budget-friendly and also kid-friendly for kids who are picky eaters and we need to avoid peanuts. Please include a grocery list. Thank you!


	And ChatGPT obliged. Here’s the first day of a week’s meals:


	Breakfast: Gluten-free oatmeal with banana and honey  Snack: Fresh fruit (apples, bananas, oranges)  Lunch: Grilled cheese sandwich on gluten-free bread with tomato soup  Snack: Gluten-free crackers with hummus  Dinner: Slow-cooked beef stew with gluten-free biscuits


	“It completely eliminated my normal meal-planning process that involved searching for recipes, trying to think of meal ideas, configuring a list of all of those ideas, and then making a list of the ingredients I need, too.”




	Make a gift.


Matt Strain Technology and innovation consultant


	Mr. Strain used ChatGPT to create a custom book of cocktails based on the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine written in the style of the J. Peterman catalog. He took the idea further the next day, using DALL-E to generate images of the cocktails for the final book, which he gave to his girlfriend for Valentine’s Day.

	Design parts for spaceships.


Ryan McClelland NASA research engineer


	Mr. McClelland’s job is to design mission hardware that’s both light and strong. It’s a job that has always required a lot of trial and error.


	But where a human might make a couple of iterations in a week, the commercial A.I. tool he uses can go through 30 or 40 ideas in an hour. It’s also spitting back ideas that no human would come up with.



















The A.I.’s designs are stronger and lighter than human-designed parts, and they would be “very difficult to model” with the traditional engineering tools that NASA uses.
NASA/Henry Dennis



	“The resulting design is a third of the mass; it’s stiffer, stronger and lighter,” he said. “It comes up with things that, not only we wouldn’t think of, but we wouldn’t be able to model even if we did think of it.”


	Sometimes the A.I. errs in ways no human would: It might fill in a hole the part needs to attach to the rest of the craft.


	“It’s like collaborating with an alien,” he said.




	Organize a messy computer desktop.


Alex Cai College sophomore


	“I had a lot of unsorted notes lying around, and I wanted to get them sorted into my file system so I can find them more easily in the future. I basically just gave ChatGPT a directory, a list of all my folder names, and the names of all my files. And it gave me a list of which notes should go into which folders!”




	Write a wedding speech.


Jonathan Wegener Occasional wedding officiant


	Mr. Wegener and his girlfriend were officiating a friend’s wedding in December, but he procrastinated.


	“A few hours before, I said, ‘Can GPT-3 write this officiant speech?’” he recalled. “The first version was generic, full of platitudes. Then I steered it.”


	Adam is a great lover of plants


	“The speech came back with these beautiful metaphors. It nailed it.” It was just missing one important part.


	Can you add that thing about in sickness and in health?




	Write an email.


Nicholas Wirth Systems administrator


	Mr. Wirth uses ChatGPT to simplify tech jargon when he emails his bosses: “My organization specifically pays me to keep the computer’s internet online, and my own literacy is limited. I work with C-level executives, and their time is not to be wasted.”


	He also gets it to generate first drafts of long emails. He might say:


	I need a midsized summary email written pertaining to data not being given to us in time.


	He also asks for a bullet-point list of the concerns that have to be addressed in the email.


	And ChatGPT starts a reply:


	Subject: Data not received in time – Phone and internet provider informationHello [Name], I want to bring to your attention an issue we are facing with the data that was supposed to be provided to us by [Date.] As of now, we have not received the following information that is critical for our project …




	Get a first read.


Charles Becker Entrepreneurship professor


	“So I’ll have a paragraph I might be putting into a test for a student, or instructions. I say:


	Where might people have trouble with this? What’s unclear about this? What’s clear about this?


	“I generate a lot of writing both for my work and for my hobbies, and a lot of time I run out of people who are excited to give me first-pass edits.”




	Play devil’s advocate.


Paul De Salvo Data engineer


	“I use ChatGPT every day for work,” he said. “It feels like I’ve hired an intern.”


	Part of Mr. De Salvo’s job is convincing his bosses that they should replace certain tools. That means pitching them on why the old tool won’t cut it anymore.


	“I use ChatGPT to simulate arguments in favor of keeping the existing tool,” he said. “So that I can anticipate potential counterarguments.”








	Build a clock that gives you a new poem every minute.


Matt Webb Consultant and blogger



















Matt Webb



	“Yes, programmatic A.I. is useful,” he said. “But more than that, it’s enormous fun.”




	Organize research for a thesis.


Anicca Harriot Ph.D. student


	Anicca Harriott has been powering through her Ph.D. thesis in biology with the help of Scholarcy and Scite, among other A.I. tools that find, aggregate and summarize relevant papers.


	“Collectively, they take weeks off of the writing process.”




	Skim dozens of academic articles.


Pablo Peña Rodríguez Private equity analytics director


	Mr. Rodriguez works for a private equity fund that invests in soccer players. And that means reading a lot.


	“We use our own data sets and methodology, but I always want to have a solid understanding of the academic literature that has been published,” he said.


	Instead of picking through Google Scholar, he now uses an A.I. tool called Elicit. It lets him ask questions of the paper itself. It helps him find out, without having to read the whole thing, whether the paper touches on the question he’s asking.


	“It doesn’t immediately make me ‘smart,’ but it does allow me to have a very quick sense of which papers I should pay attention to when approaching a new question.”




	Cope with ADHD …


Rhiannon Payne Product marketer and author


	“With ADHD, getting started and getting an outline together is the hardest part,” Ms. Payne said. “Once that’s done, it’s a lot easier to let the work flow.”


	She writes content to run marketing tests. To get going, she feeds GPT a few blog posts she’s written on the subject, other materials she’s gathered and the customer profile.


	“Describing the audience I’m speaking to, that context is super important to actually get anything usable out of the tool,” she said. What comes back is a starter framework she can then change and build out.




	… and dyslexia, too.


Eugene Capon Tech founder


	Imagine yourself as a copywriter that I just hired to proofread documents.


	“Because I’m dyslexic, it takes me a really long time to get an article down on paper,” Mr. Capon said. “So the hack I’ve come up with is, I’ll dictate my entire article. Then I’ll have ChatGPT basically correct my spelling and grammar.


	“So something that was taking like a full day to do, I can now do in like an hour and a half.”




	Sort through an archive of pictures.


Daniel Patt Software engineer


	On From Numbers to Names, a site built by the Google engineer Daniel Patt in his free time, Holocaust survivors and family members can upload photos and scan through half a million pictures to find other pictures of their loved ones. It’s a task that otherwise would take a gargantuan number of hours.


	“We’re really using the A.I. to save time,” he said. “Time is of the essence, as survivors are getting older. I can’t think of any other way we could achieve what we’re doing with the identification and discoveries we’re making.”




	Transcribe a doctor’s visit into clinical notes.


 Dr. Jeff Gladd Integrative medicine physician


	Dr. Gladd uses Nabla’s Copilot to take notes during online medical consultations. It’s a Chrome extension that listens into the visit and grabs the necessary details for his charts. Before: Writing up notes after a visit took about 20 percent of consult time. Now: The whole task lasts as long as it takes him to copy and paste the results from Copilot.




	Appeal an insurance denial.


Dr. Jeffrey Ryckman Radiation oncologist


	Dr. Ryckman uses ChatGPT to write the notes he needs to send insurers when they’ve refused to pay for radiation treatment for one of his cancer patients.


	“What used to take me around a half-hour to write now takes one minute,” he said.


	Write an insurance rebuttal to an insurance company about treatment of the primary prostate tumor and single site of metastases. Make the tone polite but assertive. Use the terms ‘medically necessary’ and ‘would render the patient without evidence of radiographic disease.’




	Write Excel formulas.


Mike Jungbluth Video game animator


	“I could ask a specific question on the type of formula I wanted, and then I could reword my question based on the answer it gave me. This allowed for a more interactive and iterative process towards finding the answer than I found through tutorials, articles or random message board posts.”


	Mr. Jungbluth had needed a formula that would assign time estimates when he picked out a combination of variables. With a few prompts to ChatGPT, eventually he got it:


	=IF(OR(C263=”GroupAType1”, C263=”GroupAType2”, C263=”GroupAType3”, C263=”GroupAType4”), IF(D263=”GroupASize1”, Key!$K$3, IF(D263=”GroupASize2”, Key$K$4, IF(D263=”GroupASize3”, Key!$K$5, “NA”))), IF(OR(C263=”GroupBType1”, C263=”GroupBType2”), IF(D263=”GroupBSize1”, Key!$K$8, IF(D263=”GroupBSize2”, Key!$K$9, IF(D263=”GroupBSize3”, Key!$K$10, “NA”))), “NA”))




	Get feedback on fiction.


Paul Gamlowski Microfiction author


	“After I finish 98 percent of a story, I prompt ChatGPT with:”


	Summarize the meaning or symbolism of this story I wrote. Mention any plot twist. Speculate on the moral of the story. Analyze how well the story reads to an average reader grammatically and structurally. Analyze if the title matches appropriately.


	If ChatGPT misses the point, or the moral, “that tells me as a writer probably many readers will miss it too.” And he’ll give it another shot. “So I just adjust a few words or a phrase and have it re-analyze and it gets it. It doesn’t take away from the story because I still write in a literary symbolic way, but it helps me get insight into what a future reader might get or miss.”








	Get homework help.


Maya Upadhyay High school student


	Ms. Upadhyay takes advanced placement math classes, like statistics and calculus, and says when she’s confused with a homework question, she’ll feed it into ChatGPT.


	It will give her an answer, but also step-by-step instructions on how it got there — a kind of self-guided tutoring process that she once used math apps or Khan Academy videos for.


	“Sometimes if I’m still confused, I can ask the A.I. to put it into simpler terms. It’s just become another option for me to use and it’s been really helpful to have whenever I need it.”




	Learn Chinese.


Jason Phang Ph.D. student in data science


	“My Chinese teacher has actually recommended I use ChatGPT to supplement my learning. ChatGPT generally writes more fluently/formally than I can.”


	Mr. Phang uses it as a two-way street, sometimes writing a paragraph in Chinese, then asking ChatGPT to clean up his work. Other times he asks ChatGPT to write the paragraph first, then he combs the paragraph for phrases or sentence structures and writes from there.




	Get help when English is your second language.


Ronald Mannak Entrepreneur


	“If I can’t think of a particular word, for example, it is super easy to just describe the word, and GPT almost always knows what I mean, even if the description is really bad.”




	Create an app when you’ve never coded before.


Ethan Mollick Professor at the University of Pennsylvania


	“I wondered if I could make a button on my computer that, when I hit it, will automatically summarize a document for me. I said:


	Can you do that?


	“And GPT-4 said:


	Sure! Here’s a Python program.


	“I pasted in everything it told me to paste in. Now I have a button on my computer to summarize documents. And I can’t code, by the way.”




	Fix bugs in your code.


Roman Pshichenko Software engineer


	When his code doesn’t run, Mr. Psichenko’s go-to fix is ChatGPT. He pastes in his code, and he often gets a decent suggestion for how to rewrite it.


	“It’s like if you had a good, mostly respectable co-worker, that can give you the time to make their suggestions match your tools, your environment, everything that couldn’t possibly be addressed in one of those generic posts online.”




	Play Pong …


Pietro Schiarno Developer and designer


	“It did it in 60 seconds. I asked it:


	Give me Pong.


	“It spat out the code. All I had to do was copy-paste, run it, and it worked.”

	… or 3D games.


Ammaar Reshi Design manager


	Mr. Reshi first tried using GPT-4 to make the game Snake, and that was too easy. So then he tried something in 3D: SkyRoads, one of his childhood favorites.


	It took time, and help from another chatbot (Anthropic’s A.I. assistant Claude), but ultimately Mr. Reshi — who does not himself know how to code — was able to replicate a simple version of the game.

	Build entirely new games.


Daniel Tait Hobby game designer


	Mr. Tait was playing Sudoku, and got a little bored. It occurred to him that ChatGPT might have a few ideas for a new game. So he asked:


	Can you create me a puzzle game like Sudoku?


	“Instantly, it came up with some pretty good puzzle game ideas,” he said. “I found one I was happy with.”


	Then he wrote:


	Can you code me a playable version of this?


	“Lo and behold, a couple seconds later, I had a playable version of the puzzle.”



















Daniel Tait’s game, Sumplete, was created by ChatGPT



	He even let the A.I. name the game.




	Teach people to curl like a pro.


Levi Lelis Assistant professor


	Mr. Lelis trained an A.I. to come up with the best curling strategy, and now he’s figuring out the best ways to use its results to teach players. His most recent research shows that the program can make a decent coach. The key, he says, is that the program doesn’t just give the player the answer — where exactly to aim the stone — but also the justification. It shows you a similar but not quite identical scenario, and tells you how much worse that placement would be.


	He found that it was an effective teacher, but it has one shortcoming. It doesn’t adapt to the skill level of the person it’s teaching. “We only focus on strategy,” he said. “We do assume the person would be Olympic level.”




	Create new proteins in minutes.


Christoffer Norn Senior Researcher at BioInnovation Institute


	Two years ago researchers cracked the code on using A.I. to predict the shape of proteins.


	Creating new proteins can be a critical scientific endeavor: In the past, humans have been able to make insulin analogs for diabetics and immune cells that fight cancer.


	But all of that is hard. Building a new protein requires determining how a sequence of amino acids will fold up into a final molecular structure, to figure out how the protein actually functions.


	“Beforehand, we had to draw out a blueprint of how we wanted the new protein to look, and then we’d spend a lot of time having the computer generate examples and, rarely, those examples worked,” Mr. Norn said.


	Now A.I. can do it. He used it recently to make a light-generating firefly-esque protein while at the University of Washington. Other researchers have used A.I. in the search for a malaria vaccine, and for Parkinson’s research.

	“We can only test so many hypotheses in a day,” he said. “I can have an idea, maybe a protein of a particular structure, but I have not memorized all the protein structures. The algorithms have. They’ve looked at all of them, and generalized rules for how to put together new structures. It’s pretty amazing.”


	He has done protein research for a decade. This, he says, is the most efficient he has ever been.


	“It’s crazy,” he said. “Everything is becoming much easier.”




	Identify diseases in banana plants.


Michael Selvaraj Scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture


	There are a lot of ways a banana plant can die, from Xanthomonas wilt to banana bunchy top virus. And the farmers responsible for producing more than 100 million tons of bananas each year aren’t trained as diagnosticians.

	“Classification of disease is really difficult,” said Mr. Selvaraj, a senior scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture.


	He trained an A.I. on nearly 20,000 pictures of all kinds of banana plants: sick, healthy, young and old. Now farmers across India, Latin America and Africa can use his app, Tumaini, to take pictures of their crop and get a diagnosis.


	“If we know the disease is coming, this will be helpful for scientists, stakeholders and government,” he said.




	Draw like Sol LeWitt.


Amy Goodchild Generative artist


	The famed artist Sol LeWitt’s instructions were prescriptive and specific, the kind you might want to hand over to an A.I. model. So Ms. Goodchild did, seeing if A.I. could create art by carrying out Lewitt’s instructions and generating Javascript code.


	With OpenAI’s older model, GPT-3, it was mostly a flop. But GPT-4 did OK — on some of them.


	On a wall surface, any continuous stretch of wall, using a hard pencil, place 50 points at random. The points should be evenly distributed over the area of the wall. All of the points should be connected by straight lines.

	Describe entire Dungeons & Dragons worlds.


Jackson Green Dungeon master


	When you run a Dungeons & Dragons game, Mr. Green says, you have to be creative, but that almost always means pulling from existing fantasy literature.


	“The game is sometimes wholesale lifted and reskinned, like a kind of collaborative plagiarism,” he said. And ChatGPT is great at it.


	Describe a fantasy medieval city that has an enormous network of canals for travel. What factions and guilds are there?


	The city of Venoria is a bustling metropolis located on the shores of a great inland sea. It is known for its impressive network of canals, which crisscross the city and serve as the primary means of transportation for its residents. Boats and gondolas ply the waterways, ferrying people and goods from one part of the city to another. Venoria is a city of many factions and guilds, each with its own interests and agendas. The Merchant's Guild is a powerful force in the city, controlling much of the trade that flows through its ports. The Artisans' Guild is also influential, with its members producing everything from fine jewelry to intricate clockwork mechanisms ...




	Make a Spotify playlist


Jonathan Soma Journalism professor at Columbia University


	Mr. Soma wanted “on-demand, vibes-based” playlists. All Sum 41 songs, with none of the slow ones, for example. So he hooked up GPT-3 to Spotify.


	Now he can just type:


	Give me songs that are acoustic but energetic.


	Play the Cars but none of those boring slow songs.


	And he gets back his playlist.

	Play with language.


Bethany Grace Howe Writer and comedian


	Ms. Howe doesn’t actually try out jokes on ChatGPT. But the A.I. is useful when she needs a creative boost.


	“Sometimes I have an idea about something that I think might be funny, and so I will get ChatGPT working on alliteration or words that rhyme or synonyms that start with a certain letter or whatever, so that I can kind of build a joke.”


	It’s particularly helpful for bizarre acronyms, like this:


	Please tell me the words I could use to create the acronym ‘BIBERE’ to identify an organization dedicated to getting together after work to hit the bar — without saying we’re going to the bar in a workplace email.


	ChatGPT offered:


	Break, Indulge, Brainstorm Escaping, Relax and Enjoy

Published 1 year ago on  April 13, 2023 By  Haziqa Sajid  Table Of Contents Generative AI is transforming many industries, including entertainment, manufacturing, automotive, and knowledge-based. In knowledge-based industries, it has the potential to automate certain tasks, such as generating legal documents and automating financial analysis, that can increase the productivity of knowledge workers. A report by Research and Markets states generative AI is projected to become a $200.73 billion market by 2032.Recently, Bill Gates, in his blog post, said, “In the future, ChatGPT will be like having a white-collar worker available to assist you with various tasks,”But since generative AI is still in its early stages, it has limitations and unintended consequences. While it can perform tasks, it cannot replace the reasoning abilities and cognitive flexibility of humans essential to white-collar knowledge work.Let’s explore whether generative AI is becoming the new white-collar worker and its impact on knowledge-based industries.What Is Generative AI?Generative AI is an AI technology that can generate new content, including text, images, and videos. Emerging generative AI technologies like GPT enable access to a wider range of applications. Applications include chatbots, deep fakes, art, product demos, drug compounds, music, and more. It's also useful for writing email responses, dating profiles, and term papers while improving dubbing and design for buildings and products.Generative AI offers several advantages that are given below.Generative AI enhances efficiency by automating processes and eliminating the need for manual labor in various tasks. This results in substantial savings of both time and money, faster completion of projects, shorter timelines, and increased productivity.It aids in generating high-quality content, including images, videos, and text, that are visually appealing and more accurate than those created manually.Generative AI can assist in informing marketing strategies, product development, and improving customer experience, thereby facilitating businesses in making better business decisions.In inverse design, generative AI can be employed to produce new designs that meet specific criteria or constraints.What Are White-Collar Knowledge Workers?White-collar knowledge workers are professionals who use their cognitive abilities, knowledge, and skills to perform their jobs. They are responsible for analyzing data, managing teams, making strategic decisions, and creating solutions to complex problems. Typical white-collar jobs include lawyers, company management, accountants, consultants, financiers, insurance, and computer programmers.The current wave of uninterrupted technologization has significantly impacted white-collar jobs by automating repetitive and routine tasks and analyzing data faster than humans. For instance, software programs can now handle data entry, filing, and other administrative tasks, freeing up time for white-collar workers to focus on more tasks that need convergent, divergent, and critical thinking. If used properly, generative AI can lead to a 10x increase in the coding productivity of knowledge workers.However, increased reliance on technology has also led to a major shift in the job market. Millions of workers worldwide have had to either change their occupations or enhance their skill sets to stay employable. In a global economic report, Goldman Sachs economists predict that the latest high-velocity AI development and accessibility, which has given rise to platforms like ChatGPT, could automate up to 300 million full-time jobs globally. Furthermore, research by the University of Pennsylvania and Open AI estimates that the impact of automation is expected to be felt most significantly by highly educated white-collar workers who earn up to $80,000 annually.The Intersection of Generative AI & White-Collar WorkImage by Blue Planet Studio from Adobe StockThe intersection of generative AI and white-collar work has been particularly notable. It has significantly automated repetitive and tedious tasks, such as data entry, analysis, and report writing. New AI capabilities that recognize context and concepts allow machines to collaborate more effectively with knowledge workers. The intersection can also lead to upskilling opportunities as workers learn to collaborate with machines and use AI to augment their abilities.A few examples where generative AI aids white-collar work are:AI can streamline HR tasks, such as candidate screening. A digital assistant can conduct initial interviews and ask job-related questions to filter out unsuitable candidates. This saves time for HR professionals by automatically handling data and volume in a secure environment, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.Since generative AI can generate news articles, reports, and other written content, it frees up time for human journalists to focus on in-depth reporting and analysis.As the use of AI expands, it creates new job opportunities, requiring people to build, program, and maintain these intelligent machines. With millions of AI-related job roles available worldwide, new opportunities are arising for data scientists, robotic engineers, and more.Here are two industries where generative AI is transforming knowledge work and increasing work efficiency.Legal Services: An attorney recently used ChatGPT to publish a 14-page legal paper covering various legal prompts, indicating that AI bots can potentially address access to justice issues. AI startups like Lawgeex have already begun using AI to read contracts faster and more accurately than humans.Finance & Banking: According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum, over half of the banks have integrated AI, with 56% using it for management and 52% for revenue generation. Morgan Stanley is already using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organize its wealth management database, leading to increased efficiency.The Future of Generative AI & White-Collar WorkThe future of generative AI looks promising. Tools such as ChatGPT and DALL-E-2, become more sophisticated and capable of automating several tasks. However, there are still shortcomings to consider. Generative AI lacks the human context, knowledge, and history that allows us to do tasks better.Furthermore, the output generated by AI is not always ready to be used as-is and often requires human intervention, which can sometimes take longer. Additionally, large language models can hallucinate or generate biased results, which is why human oversight is necessary to ensure fairness and accuracy.In a rapidly accelerating AI environment, white-collar workers can develop new skills and competencies, such as data and digital literacy. They will need to learn how to use and integrate generative AI into their work ethically. Also, they need to develop deep functional, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving skills. Employees must develop skills like data analysis,  AI programming, and machine learning to stay competitive in the job market.Despite generative AI’s capabilities, there are still areas where it lacks compared to human intelligence. For instance, AI lacks common sense reasoning and understanding of context. It can struggle with tasks that require a basic human-level understanding of everyday situations. Moreover, it cannot easily automate soft skills like empathy, social intelligence, and relationship building. Additionally, AI systems can be biased or limited by the data they are trained on. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair outcomes.Going forward, AI will be most effective as a tool to enhance human work rather than replace human labor. Ultimately, the co-existence of generative AI and human workers can set the bar higher, as workers using AI tools can have better productivity.Visit Unite.ai to stay updated on the advancements of generative AI.

 Large language models (LLMs) are the underlying technology that has powered the meteoric rise of generative AI chatbots. Tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat all rely on LLMs to generate human-like responses to your prompts and questions. 







 But just what are LLMs, and how do they work? Here we set out to demystify LLMs. 


 What Is a Large Language Model? 
 In its simplest terms, an LLM is a massive database of text data that can be referenced to generate human-like responses to your prompts. The text comes from a range of sources and can amount to billions of words. 

 Among common sources of text data used are: 
Literature: LLMs often contain enormous amounts of contemporary and classical literature. This can include books, poetry, and plays. Online content: An LLM will most often contain a large repository of online content, including blogs, web content, forum questions & responses, and other online text. News and current affairs: Some, but not all, LLMs can access current news topics. Certain LLMs, like GPT-3.5, are restricted in this sense. Social Media: Social media represents a huge resource of natural language. LLMs use text from major platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  





 Of course, having a huge database of text is one thing, but LLMs need to be trained to make sense of it to produce human-like responses. How it does this is what we cover next. 



 How Do LLMs Work? 
 How do LLMs use these repositories to create their responses? The first step is to analyze the data using a process called deep learning. 

 Deep learning is used to identify the patterns and nuances of human language. This includes gaining an understanding of grammar and syntax. But importantly, it also includes context. Understanding context is a crucial part of LLMs. 

 Let's look at an example of how LLMs can use context. 

 The prompt in the following image mentions seeing a bat at night. From this, ChatGPT understood that we were talking about an animal and not, for instance, a baseball bat. Of course, other chatbots like Bing Chat or Google Bard may answer this completely differently. 






    

 However, it isn't infallible, and as this example shows, sometimes you will need to supply additional information to get the desired response. 

    

 In this instance, we deliberately threw a bit of a curve ball to demonstrate how easily context is lost. But humans can misunderstand the context of questions too, and it only needs an extra prompt to correct the response. 






    

 To generate these responses, LLMs use a technique called natural language generation (NLG). This involves examining the input and using the patterns learned from its data repository to generate a contextually correct and relevant response. 

 But LLMs go deeper than this. They can also tailor replies to suit the emotional tone of the input. When combined with contextual understanding, the two facets are the main drivers that allow LLMs to create human-like responses. 

 To summarize, LLMs use a massive text database with a combination of deep learning and NLG techniques to create human-like responses to your prompts. But there are limitations to what this can achieve. 








 What Are the Limitations of LLMs? 
    

 LLMs represent an impressive technological achievement. But the technology is far from perfect, and there are still plenty of limitations as to what they can achieve. Some of the more notable of these are listed below: 
Contextual understanding: We mentioned this as something LLMs incorporate into their answers. However, they don't always get it right and are often unable to understand the context, leading to inappropriate or just plain wrong answers. Bias: Any biases present in the training data can often be present in responses. This includes biases towards gender, race, geography, and culture. Common sense: Common sense is difficult to quantify, but humans learn this from an early age simply by watching the world around them. LLMs do not have this inherent experience to fall back on. They only understand what has been supplied to them through their training data, and this does not give them a true comprehension of the world they exist in. An LLM is only as good as its training data: Accuracy can never be guaranteed. The old computer adage of ""Garbage In, Garbage Out"" sums this limitation up perfectly. LLMs are only as good as the quality and quantity of their training data allow them to be.  





 There is also an argument that ethical concerns can be considered a limitation of LLMs, but this subject falls outside the scope of this article. 



 3 Examples of Popular LLMs 
 The continuing advance of AI is now largely underpinned by LLMs. So while they aren't exactly a new technology, they have certainly reached a point of critical momentum, and there are now many models. 

 Here are some of the most widely used LLMs. 

 1. GPT 
 Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is perhaps the most widely known LLM. GPT-3.5 powers the ChatGPT platform used for the examples in this article, while the newest version, GPT-4, is available through a ChatGPT Plus subscription. Microsoft also uses the latest version in its Bing Chat platform. 

 2. LaMDA 
 This is the initial LLM used by Google Bard, Google's AI chatbot. The version Bard was initially rolled out with was described as a ""lite"" version of the LLM. The more powerful PaLM iteration of the LLM superseded this. 





 3. BERT 
 BERT stands for Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers. The bidirectional characteristics of the model differentiate BERT from other LLMs like GPT. 

 Plenty more LLMs have been developed, and offshoots are common from the major LLMs. As they develop, these will continue to grow in complexity, accuracy, and relevance. But what does the future hold for LLMs? 



 The Future of LLMs 
 These will undoubtedly shape the way we interact with technology in the future. The rapid uptake of models like ChatGPT and Bing Chat is a testament to this fact. In the short term, AI is unlikely to replace you at work. But there is still uncertainty about just how big a part in our lives these will play in the future. 

 Ethical arguments may yet have a say in how we integrate these tools into society. However, putting this to one side, some of the expected LLM developments include: 
Improved Efficiency: With LLMs featuring hundreds of millions of parameters, they are incredibly resource hungry. With improvements in hardware and algorithms, they are likely to become more energy-efficient. This will also quicken response times. Improved Contextual Awareness: LLMs are self-training; the more usage and feedback they get, the better they become. Importantly, this is without any further major engineering. As technology progresses, this will see improvements in language capabilities and contextual awareness. Trained for Specific Tasks: The Jack-of-all-trade tools that are the public face of LLMs are prone to errors. But as they develop and users train them for specific needs, LLMs can play a large role in fields like medicine, law, finance, and education. Greater Integration: LLMs could become personal digital assistants. Think of Siri on steroids, and you get the idea. LLMs could become virtual assistants that help you with everything from suggesting meals to dealing with your correspondence.  





 These are just a few of the areas where LLMs are likely to become a larger part of the way we live. 



 LLMs Transforming and Educating 
 LLMs are opening up an exciting world of possibilities. The rapid rise of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard is evidence of the resources being poured into the field. 

 Such a proliferation of resources can only see these tools becoming more powerful, versatile, and accurate. The potential applications of such tools are vast, and at the moment, we are only scratching the surface of an incredible new resource.

Amazon is working on generative AI, too, CEO Andy Jassy assures shareholders in annual letter

What about Amazon?
That question comes up frequently these days in tech industry conversations about generative artificial intelligence, especially as Open AI leverages its partnership with Microsoft Azure, the Amazon Web Services cloud rival, to train the GPT-4 large language model (LLM) that powers applications including ChatGPT. 
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy spends a chunk of his annual letter to shareholders, released Thursday morning, planting the company’s flag in the world of generative AI, and making the case that Amazon actually has a longstanding beachhead in this realm through its investments in machine learning. 
“We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now,” Jassy writes toward the end of the letter. Amazon believes these emerging forms of artificial intelligence will “transform and improve virtually every customer experience,” and the company “will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences,” he adds.
Longstanding work by AWS in machine learning, including specialized chips, will help AWS customers affordably train and build their own LLMs, Jassy writes. 
He also cites Amazon’s CodeWhisperer (a rival to Microsoft-owned GitHub’s AI-powered CoPilot virtual pair programmer) as another example of the company’s generative AI work.
“I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter,” he concludes. “Let’s just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.”
[Update: AWS this morning announced new tools for building large language models and generative AI.]
Amazon will evaluate costs and ‘proceed adaptively’: Toward the beginning of the letter, Jassy addresses the company’s recent cutbacks, including its decision to lay off 27,000 corporate workers. 
He writes that Amazon “took a deep look across the company, business by business, invention by invention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital.”
But perhaps the most notable sentence in this section hints that Amazon might not be done cutting costs. Jassy writes that he and Amazon’s leaders “will continue to evaluate what we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.”
Big bets and long-term focus: This is Jassy’s second letter to shareholders since becoming CEO. His predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, set the tone in 1997 with a letter that defined Amazon’s approach — putting investors on notice about its focus on long-term impact over short-term profits. 
Jassy’s new letter addresses the challenges Amazon is facing in the larger economy, comparing this period to the dot-com bust, when Amazon had to borrow money to bolster its holiday inventory; and the Great Recession, when it decided to continue investing in its then-nascent cloud business. 
He points to the subsequent success of AWS, now generating revenue at a rate of $85 billion per year, to establish credibility for some of the business bets that might seem similarly outlandish today.
Toward the end of the letter, he cites two examples: Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellite broadband initiative and Amazon Healthcare, including its OneMedical primary care acquisition. 
Checking the name-checks: For those keeping score, other businesses receiving extensive ink in this year’s letter include Amazon grocery, fulfillment and logistics, advertising, international stores, Amazon Business, Buy with Prime, and of course AWS, which Jassy previously led and describes as still in its early days given the large volume of global IT spending that has yet to shift to the cloud. 
The word “devices” is used one time in the letter, referencing the company’s decision to move on from “some newer devices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns.” That compares with 10 “devices” mentions in last year’s annual letter. 
Return to the office: In case there was any lingering doubt, Jassy makes it clear that the company isn’t backing down from its push to get employees back in the office for at least three days a week starting in May. The Amazon CEO dedicates a section of the letter to this topic, amounting to his own return-to-work manifesto. 
This is a portion:

We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we’re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on one another’s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate’s office later that day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates. Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantly easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues. 

Jassy concludes this section by writing, “Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.”

Published: 12 Apr 2023


 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are examples of neural networks -- a type of deep learning algorithm modeled after how the human brain works.







CNNs, one of the oldest and most popular of the deep learning models, were introduced in the 1980s and are often used in visual recognition tasks.
GANs are relatively newer. Introduced in 2014, GANs were one of the first deep learning models used for generative AI.
CNNs are sometimes used within GANs to generate and discern visual and audio content.
""GANs are essentially pairs of CNNs hooked together in an 'adversarial' way, so the difference is one of approach to output or insight creation, albeit there exists an inherent underlying similarity,"" said John Blankenbaker, principal data scientist at SSA & Company, a global management consulting firm. ""How they answer a given question, however, is slightly different.""
For example, CNNs might try to determine if a picture contains a cat -- a recognition task -- while GANs will try to make a picture of a cat, a generation task. In both cases, the networks are building up a representation of what makes a picture of a cat distinctive.

Let's look deeper into CNNs and GANs.







Understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
History. French computer scientist Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and chief AI scientist at Meta, invented CNNs in the 1980s when he was a researcher at the University of Toronto. His aim was to improve the tools for recognizing handwritten digits by using neural networks. Although his work on optical character recognition was seminal, it stalled due to limited training data sets and computing power.
Interest in the technique exploded after 2010, following the introduction of ImageNet -- a large, labeled database of images -- and the launch of its annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). One of the most promising entries in the inaugural year of the competition was the AlexNet model based on CNNs, which was optimized for GPUs. Its success demonstrated that CNNs could efficiently scale to achieve good performance on even the largest image databases.
How they work. ""CNNs are designed to use data with spatial structure such as images or video,"" said Donncha Carroll, a partner at Lotis Blue Consulting who leads the firm's Data Science Center of Excellence.
The convolutional neural network is composed of filters that move across the data and produce an output at every position. For example, a convolutional neural network designed to recognize animals in an image would activate when it recognizes legs, a body or a head.
It's also important to note that CNNs are designed to recognize the lines, edges and textures in patterns near each other, said Blankenbaker. ""The 'C' in CNNs stands for convolutional, which means that we are processing something where the idea of neighborhood is important -- such as, for example, pixels around a given pixel or signal values slightly before and after a given moment.""

Understanding generative adversarial networks (GANs)
History. GANs were invented by American computer scientist Ian Goodfellow, currently a research scientist at DeepMind, when he was working at Google Brain from 2014 to 2016.
GANs, as noted, are a type of deep learning model used to generate images of numbers and realistic-looking faces. The field exploded once researchers discovered it could be applied to synthesizing voices, drugs and other types of images. GANs and their variations were heralded by CNN inventor LeCun as the most interesting idea of the last 10 years in machine learning.
How they work. The term adversarial comes from the two competing networks creating and discerning content -- a generator network and a discriminator network. For example, in an image-generation use case, the generator network creates new images that look like faces. In contrast, the discriminator network tries to tell the difference between authentic and generated images. The discriminator performance data then helps to train the overall system.

CNN vs. GAN: Key differences and uses, explained
One important distinction between CNNs and GANs, Carroll said, is that the generator in GANs reverses the convolution process. ""Convolution extracts features from images, while deconvolution expands images from features.""
Here is a rundown of the chief differences between CNNs and GANs and their respective use cases.
CNN

CNNs are used for recognizing objects, sounds or characteristics such as faces, biometrics, faulty parts or medical conditions. They are also ideal for interpreting images, speech or other audio signals.
CNNs are trained using a supervised learning approach, with input data labeled for a particular output.
The convolutional aspect of CNNs extracts features from images.
Common use cases include reading documents, visually inspecting machine parts, listening to machinery to detect wear and hearing customer sentiment in customer service or sales calls.

GAN

GANs are used to generate realistic-looking people, objects, sounds or characteristics.
GANs are trained using an unsupervised learning approach -- i.e. they can be trained independently without requiring humans to label data.
An inverse convolutional process, called deconvolution, expands images from features.
Common use cases include generating realistic human-looking faces or an image of a specific individual, giving rise to the phenomenon known as deepfakes. They are also good at generating voices that sound like an individual or synthesizing someone's voice and tone in another language for more realistic dubbing. Other common use cases include generating all kinds of text, including news, poetry and code; speeding up drug discovery; and detecting fraud.



How can CNNs and GANs work together?
Although GANs are getting a lot of the attention lately, CNNs continue to be used under the hood -- that is, within GANs for generating and discerning authenticity. Indeed, Pierre Custeau, CTO of ToolsGroup, a supply chain planning and optimization firm, considers the two neural networks to be complementary in terms of function. ""Since CNNs are so effective at image processing, both the generator and discriminator networks are by default CNNs,"" he said.
It is important to note that CNNs and GANs only tend to be combined in one way, said Matthew Mead, CTO at IT consultancy SPR.
""GANs typically work with image data and can use CNNs as the discriminator. But this doesn't work the other way around, meaning a CNN cannot use a GAN,"" Mead said.



One of the biggest challenges is always the data quality itself for training the models, especially when we're talking about business-specific solutions instead something as generic as a cat.

Early GANs generated relatively simple, low-resolution faces. One of the reasons interest in GANs has grown is the dramatic decline in cost per unit of compute, which has enabled teams to build more complex neural networks, Carroll pointed out. Advancements in hardware, software and neural network design have also fueled the growth of other generative AI models like transformers, variational autoencoders and diffusion.
Blankenbaker cautions against getting caught up in the latest model rather than focusing on specific goals and the underlying data. ""We see too many companies getting excited about the buzzwords and trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, resulting in overspending on overkill solutions,"" Blakenbaker said.
""One of the biggest challenges is always the data quality itself for training the models, especially when we're talking about business-specific solutions instead something as generic as a cat,"" he said.

Will artificial intelligence — especially generative AI — be an accelerant or a drain to the creativity and innovation of today’s workforce? No one knows for sure, but some industry observers are taking educated guesses about the direction things may take.


While the popular perception is that AI will eliminate or severely displace human creativity, it appears many humans are happy to have generative AI in their lives. A recent survey by Fishbowl, an anonymous social network for professionals, finds that 43% of professionals have used AI tools, including ChatGPT, for work-related tasks — without any prompting or even knowledge of their managers.

So we have a push-pull going on within workplaces when it comes to AI and generative AI. It may serve as a super-productive assistant to workers and professionals, or it may usurp their roles. Can AI be creative? Can it innovate on a greater scale that humans?

PROMOTED
The conventional wisdom is that humans will always have the edge as creators and innovators. “Generative AI applications such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are threatening to upend this special status and significantly alter creative work, both independent and salaried,” according to David De Cremer, Nicola Morini Bianzino, and Ben Falk, writing in Harvard Business Review. “These new generative AI models learn from huge datasets and user feedback, and can produce new content in the form of text, images, and audio or a combination of those. As such, jobs focused on delivering content — writing, creating images, coding, and other jobs that typically require an intensity of knowledge and information — now seem likely to be uniquely affected by generative AI. What isn’t clear yet is what shape this kind of impact will take. ""

De Cremer and his co-authors paint three possible scenarios for the impact of AI on creative work:
Scenario 1: AI augments work, and boosts productivity. Generative AI tools deliver the ultimate democratization of AI. “In fact, most of these applications are so easy to use that even children with elementary-level verbal skills can use them to create content right now,” the co-authors state. “Rather than putting many creators out of work, AI will support humans to do the work they already perform, but simply allowing them to do it with greater speed and efficiency. In this scenario, productivity would rise, as reliance on generative AI tools that use natural language reduces the time and effort required to come up with new ideas or pieces of text.”

Scenario 2: Generative AI creates a flood of cheap content that drives out human creatives. Intellectual-property laws are still being worked out, and in the meantime, content creation will run amok. “Unfair algorithmic competition and inadequate governance leads to the crowding out of authentic human creativity,” the co-authors speculate. “Here, human writers, producers, and creators are drowned out by a tsunami of algorithmically generated content, with some talented creators even opting out of the market.”

Scenario 3: Human-made creative work demands a premium. With the potential of AI-generated work flooding the market, people may hunger for the “real thing” — and be willing to pay for the authenticity. “While generative models demonstrate remarkable and sometimes emergent capabilities, they suffer from problems with accuracy, frequently producing text that sounds legitimate but is riddled with factual errors and erroneous logic,” De Cremer and his co-authors observe.
It’s possible we may experience a combination of these scenarios, depending on the nature of the business. To paraphrase the oft-quoted adage, culture eats technology for breakfast. The ability to adapt to changes in the vision and purpose of the business is where humans are likely to be irreplaceable. “Culture changes much more quickly than generative algorithms can be trained, so humans maintain a dynamism that algorithms cannot compete against,” the co-authors suggest.

Johnny Taylor Jr., CEO of the Society of Human Resource Management, offshored the job of a tech employee to India, saving 40% in the labor-cost arbitrage, when she asked to relocate from Arlington, Virginia, where the HR membership group is based, to North Carolina, according to the Wall Street Journal.


Companies are accelerating their efforts to send jobs to lower-cost countries in response to the challenge of finding workers and inflation driving up wages. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta survey found that 7.3% of leadership in the United States plans to move more jobs offshore as the next step from remote work within America.

Richard Baldwin, an economics professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva who studied the “offshoreability” of teleworking jobs, gave a warning at the European-based Center for Economic Policy Research last year, “If you can do your job from home, be scared.” Baldwin added, “Be very scared because somebody in India or wherever is willing to do it for much less.”

PROMOTED
Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University and an expert in workplace matters, told the Wall Street Journal, “About 10% to 20% of U.S. service support jobs, like software developers, human-resources professionals and payroll administrators, could move overseas in the next decade.”

Cutting Costs And Jobs
Outsourcing has become a popular business tool for companies across the U.S. looking for ways to increase profit margins and cut costs. According to Zippia, about 300,000 U.S. jobs are outsourced yearly, and 66% of businesses in America outsource at least one department. Moreover, roughly 30 million jobs are vulnerable to outsourcing.

Highly industrialized countries, like the U.S., offshore to developing countries to curtail operational costs, receive tax benefits and access cheap raw materials.
Information technology is the most outsourced industry and business division. The average IT department allocates 13.6% of its budget to offshored roles, and roughly 37% of IT tasks are outsourced. The top five jobs most vulnerable to offshoring include computer programmers, data entry keyers and other computer and information personnel.

This Has Been Going On For A Long Time
The trend began in the late 1970s at large manufacturers, including General Electric. Jack Welch, GE’s chief executive at the time, argued that public corporations owe their primary allegiance to stockholders, not employees. Welch said that companies should seek to lower costs and maximize profits by moving operations wherever is cheapest.

In 2011, Forbes reported that U.S. companies, like GE, Caterpillar, Microsoft and Wal-Mart, employed 20% of all U.S. workers. In the 2000s, these corporations reduced their workforces in America by 2.9 million, while increasing their outsourced roles by 2.4 million. In 2009, large corporations employed 21.1 million American workers and 10.3 million employees outside the U.S.
Startups Are Focused On Offshoring White-Collar Professionals
The offshoring movement is gaining even more momentum in well-funded startups focused on making it easier for jobs to move around the world.
Startups, like Remote.com and Deel, make it easy for companies to hire personnel worldwide. These organizations have established the mechanisms and systems for global corporations to hire, onboard and manage the taxes and compliance for remote workers in countries throughout the world.
AngelList Talent scours the globe to find job hunters who want to get hired remotely. Job seekers can share what kind of remote work culture they want, time-zone preferences and other important factors. They then take assessments to demonstrate their skills. For example, engineering candidates can take assessments for frontend, backend, iOS, Android and more and display their scores for recruiters to see.
In Addition To Offshoring Jobs, Workers Need To Worry About AI
If generative AI lives up to its hype, the workforce in the U.S. and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs recently reported. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.
Office administrative support, legal, architecture and engineering, business and financial operations, management, sales, healthcare and art and design are some sectors that automation will impact.
