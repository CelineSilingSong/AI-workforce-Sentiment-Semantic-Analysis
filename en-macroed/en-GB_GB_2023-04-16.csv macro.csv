OpenAI’s chatbot, powered by its latest large language model, can write poems, tell jokes, and churn out essays that look like a human created them. Prompt ChatGPT with a few words, and out comes love poems in the form of Yelp reviews, or song lyrics in the style of Nick Cave.The last time generative AI loomed this large, the breakthroughs were in computer vision. Selfies transformed into Renaissance-style portraits and prematurely aged faces filled social media feeds. Five years later, it’s the leap forward in natural language processing, and the ability of large language models to riff on just about any theme, that has seized the popular imagination. And it’s not just language: Generative models can also learn the grammar of software code, molecules, natural images, and a variety of other data types.The applications for this technology are growing every day, and we’re just starting to explore the possibilities. At IBM Research, we’re working to help our customers use generative models to write high-quality software code faster, discover new molecules, and train trustworthy conversational chatbots grounded on enterprise data. We’re even using generative AI to create synthetic data to build more robust and trustworthy AI models and to stand-in for real data protected by privacy and copyright laws.As the field continues to evolve, we thought we’d take a step back and explain what we mean by generative AI, how we got here, and how these models work.An overview from IBM expert Kate SouleWhat are generative AI models?The rise of deep generative modelsGenerative AI refers to deep-learning models that can take raw data — say, all of Wikipedia or the collected works of Rembrandt — and “learn” to generate statistically probable outputs when prompted. At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data and draw from it to create a new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.Generative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. The rise of deep learning, however, made it possible to extend them to images, speech, and other complex data types. Among the first class of models to achieve this cross-over feat were variational autoencoders, or VAEs, introduced in 2013. VAEs were the first deep-learning models to be widely used for generating realistic images and speech.“VAEs opened the floodgates to deep generative modeling by making models easier to scale,” said Akash Srivastava, an expert on generative AI at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. “Much of what we think of today as generative AI started here.”Hear from other AI expertsDmitri Krotov is on a quest to improve AI.Ruchir Puri leads the charge on code modernization.Kush Varshney explains how governance is applied throughout the AI pipeline.Autoencoders work by encoding unlabeled data into a compressed representation, and then decoding the data back into its original form. “Plain” autoencoders were used for a variety of purposes, including reconstructing corrupted or blurry images. Variational autoencoders added the critical ability to not just reconstruct data, but to output variations on the original data.This ability to generate novel data ignited a rapid-fire succession of new technologies, from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to diffusion models, capable of producing ever more realistic — but fake — images. In this way, VAEs set the stage for today’s generative AI.They are built out of blocks of encoders and decoders, an architecture that also underpins today’s large language models. Encoders compress a dataset into a dense representation, arranging similar data points closer together in an abstract space. Decoders sample from this space to create something new while preserving the dataset’s most important features.Transformers, introduced by Google in 2017 in a landmark paper  “Attention Is All You Need,” combined the encoder-decoder architecture with a text-processing mechanism called attention to change how language models were trained. An encoder converts raw unannotated text into representations known as embeddings; the decoder takes these embeddings together with previous outputs of the model, and successively predicts each word in a sentence.Through fill-in-the-blank guessing games, the encoder learns how words and sentences relate to each other, building up a powerful representation of language without anyone having to label parts of speech and other grammatical features. Transformers, in fact, can be pre-trained at the outset without a particular task in mind. Once these powerful representations are learned, the models can later be specialized — with much less data — to perform a given task.Several innovations made this possible. Transformers processed words in a sentence all at once, allowing text to be processed in parallel, speeding up training. Earlier techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks processed words one by one. Transformers also learned the positions of words and their relationships, context that allowed them to infer meaning and disambiguate words like “it” in long sentences.By eliminating the need to define a task upfront, transformers made it practical to pre-train language models on vast amounts of raw text, allowing them to grow dramatically in size. Previously, people gathered and labeled data to train one model on a specific task. With transformers, you could train one model on a massive amount of data and then adapt it to multiple tasks by fine-tuning it on a small amount of labeled task-specific data.Transformers have come to be known as foundation models for their versatility. “If you wanted to improve a classifier, you used to have to feed it more labeled data,” said Srivastava. “Now, with foundation models, you can feed the model large amounts of unlabeled data to learn a representation that generalizes well to many tasks.”Language transformers today are used for non-generative tasks like classification and entity extraction as well as generative tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering. More recently, transformers have stunned the world with their capacity to generate convincing dialogue, essays, and other content.Language transformers fall into three main categories: encoder-only models, decoder-only models, and encoder-decoder models.Encoder-only models like BERT power search engines and customer-service chatbots, including IBM’s Watson Assistant. Encoder-only models are widely used for non-generative tasks like classifying customer feedback and extracting information from long documents. In a project with NASA, IBM is building an encoder-only model to mine millions of earth-science journals for new knowledge.Decoder-only models like the GPT family of models are trained to predict the next word without an encoded representation. GPT-3, at 175 billion parameters, was the largest language model of its kind when OpenAI released it in 2020. Other massive models — Google’s PaLM (540 billion parameters) and open-access BLOOM (176 billion parameters), among others, have since joined the scene.Encoder-decoder models, like Google’s Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, or T5, combine features of both BERT and GPT-style models. They can do many of the generative tasks that decoder-only models can, but their compact size makes them faster and cheaper to tune and serve.Generative AI and large language models have been progressing at a dizzying pace, with new models, architectures, and innovations appearing almost daily.Supervised learning strikes backThe ability to harness unlabeled data was the key innovation that unlocked the power of generative AI. But human supervision has recently made a comeback and is now helping to drive large language models forward. AI developers are increasingly using supervised learning to shape our interactions with generative models and their powerful embedded representations.Instruction-tuning, introduced with Google’s FLAN series of models, has enabled generative models to move beyond simple tasks to assist in a more interactive, generalized way. Feeding the model instructions paired with responses on a wide range of topics can prime it to generate not just statistically probable text, but humanlike answers to questions like, “What is the capital of France?” or requests like, “Sort the following list of numbers.”By carefully engineering a set of prompts — the initial inputs fed to a foundation model — the model can be customized to perform a wide range of tasks. In some cases, no labeled data is required at all. You simply ask the model to perform a task, including those it hasn’t explicitly been trained to do. This completely data-free approach is called zero-shot learning, because it requires no examples. To improve the odds the model will produce what you’re looking for, you can also provide one or more examples in what’s known as one- or few-shot learning.Zero- and few-shot learning dramatically lower the time it takes to build an AI solution, since minimal data gathering is required to get a result. But as powerful as zero- and few-shot learning are, they come with a few limitations. First, many generative models are sensitive to how their instructions are formatted, which has inspired a new AI discipline known as prompt-engineering. A good instruction prompt will deliver the desired results in one or two tries, but this often comes down to placing colons and carriage returns in the right place. While effective, prompt engineering can also be fiddly. A prompt that works beautifully on one model may not transfer to other models.Another limitation of zero- and few-shot prompting for enterprises is the difficulty of incorporating proprietary data, often a key asset. If the generative model is large, fine-tuning it on enterprise data can become prohibitively expensive. Techniques like prompt-tuning and adaptors have emerged as alternatives. They allow you to adapt the model without having to adjust its billions to trillions of parameters. They work by distilling the user’s data and target task into a small number of parameters that are inserted into a frozen large model. There, they modulate the model’s behavior without directly changing it.“Parameter-efficient tuning methods allow users to have their cake and eat it too,” said David Cox, IBM director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. “You can leverage the power of a large pre-trained model with your own proprietary data. Together, prompt engineering and parameter-efficient tuning provide a powerful suite of tools for getting a model to do what you want, without spending time and money on traditional deep-learning solutions.”Most recently, human supervision is shaping generative models by aligning their behavior with ours. Alignment refers to the idea that we can shape a generative model’s responses so that they better align with what we want to see. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an alignment method popularized by OpenAI that gives models like ChatGPT their uncannily human-like conversational abilities. In RLHF, a generative model outputs a set of candidate responses that humans rate for correctness. Through reinforcement learning, the model is adjusted to output more responses like those highly rated by humans. This style of training results in an AI system that can output what humans deem as high-quality conversational text.Where is generative AI headed?Until recently, a dominant trend in generative AI has been scale, with larger models trained on ever-growing datasets achieving better and better results. You can now estimate how powerful a new, larger model will be based on how previous models, whether larger in size or trained on more data, have scaled. Scaling laws allow AI researchers to make reasoned guesses about how large models will perform before investing in the massive computing resources it takes to train them.On the flip side, there’s a continued interest in the emergent capabilities that arise when a model reaches a certain size. It’s not just the model’s architecture that causes these skills to emerge but its scale. Examples include glimmers of logical reasoning and the ability to follow instructions. Some labs continue to train ever larger models chasing these emergent capabilities.Recent evidence, however, is bucking the trend toward larger models. Several research groups have shown that smaller models trained on more domain-specific data can often outperform larger, general-purpose models. Researchers at Stanford, for example, trained a relatively small model, PubMedGPT 2.75B, on biomedical abstracts and found that it could answer medical questions significantly better than a generalist model the same size. Their work suggests that smaller, domain-specialized models may be the right choice when domain-specific performance is important.“When you want specific advice, it may be better to ask a domain expert for help rather than trying to find the single smartest person you know,” said Cox, at MIT-IBM. “Specialization also comes with other advantages; a smaller model is vastly cheaper and less carbon-intensive to run.”The question of whether generative models will be bigger or smaller than they are today is further muddied by the emerging trend of model distillation. A group from Stanford recently tried to “distill” the capabilities of OpenAI’s large language model, GPT-3.5, into its Alpaca chatbot, built on a much smaller model. The researchers asked GPT-3.5 to generate thousands of paired instructions and responses, and through instruction-tuning, used this AI-generated data to infuse Alpaca with ChatGPT-like conversational skills. Since then, a herd of similar models with names like Vicuna and Dolly have landed on the internet.“The Alpaca approach calls into question whether large models are essential for emergent capabilities,” said Cox. “Some models, like Dolly 2, are even skipping the distillation step and instead crowdsourcing instruction-response data directly from humans. Taken together, recent events suggest we may be entering an era where more compact models are sufficient for a wide variety of practical use cases.”Generative AI holds enormous potential to create new capabilities and value for enterprise. However, it also can introduce new risks, be they legal, financial or reputational. Many generative models, including those powering ChatGPT, can spout information that sounds authoritative but isn’t true (sometimes called “hallucinations”) or is objectionable and biased. Generative models can also inadvertently ingest information that’s personal or copyrighted in their training data and output it later, creating unique challenges for privacy and intellectual property laws. Solving these issues is an open area of research, and something we covered in our next blog post.Learn more about the future of AIEnhancing LLMs with a framework called retrieval-augmented generation.Putting trained AI models to the test through inferencing.Developing tools to make generative AI more transparent.Subscribe to our Future Forward newsletter and stay up to date on the latest research newsSubscribe to our newsletterHome↳ BlogDate20 Apr 2023AuthorsKim MartineauTopicsAIGenerative AIShareMeet AI-Hilbert, a new algorithm for transforming scientific discoveryNewsPeter Hess19 Jul 2024AIExploratory SciencePhysical SciencesWhat are LLM AI agents?ExplainerKim Martineau18 Jul 2024AIAI for Business AutomationFoundation ModelsGenerative AIIBM reaffirms its commitment to the Rome Call for AI ethicsNewsMike Murphy15 Jul 2024AIFairness, Accountability, TransparencyRevolutionizing geospatial data managementTechnical noteRomeo Kienzler and Thomas Brunschwiler09 Jul 2024AIClimate and SustainabilityFoundation Models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can we get past the fear and find a silver lining?Claire has worked as a PR at a major consulting firm, based in London, for six years. The 34-year-old enjoys her job and earns a comfortable salary, but in the past six months, she’s started to feel apprehensive about the future of her career. The reason: artificial intelligence.“I don’t think the quality of the work that I’m producing could be matched by a machine just yet,” says Claire, whose last name is being withheld to protect her job security. “But at the same time, I’m amazed at how quickly ChatGPT has become so sophisticated. Give it a few more years, and I can absolutely imagine a world in which a bot does my job just as well as I can. I hate to think what that might mean for my employability.”In recent years, as headlines about robots stealing human jobs have proliferated – and as generative AI tools like ChatGPT have quickly become more accessible – some workers report starting to feel anxious about their futures and whether the skills they have will be relevant to the labour market in years to come. In March, Goldman Sachs published a report showing that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. Last year, PwC’s annual global workforce survey showed that almost a third of respondents said they were worried about the prospect of their role being replaced by technology in three years.“I think a lot of creatives are concerned,” says Alys Marshall, a 29-year-old copywriter based in Bristol, UK. “We’re all just hoping that our clients will recognise [our] value, and choose the authenticity of [a human] over the price and convenience of AI tools.”Now, career coaches and HR experts are saying that although some anxiety might be justified, employees need to focus on what they can control. Instead of panicking about possibly losing their jobs to machines, they should invest in learning how to work alongside technology. If they treat it as a resource and not a threat, add the experts, they’ll make themselves more valuable to potential employers – and feel less anxious. Getty ImagesAs headlines about robots stealing human jobs proliferate some workers report feeling anxious about their futures (Credit: Getty Images)Fear of the unknown For some people, generative AI tools feel as if they’ve come on fast and furious. OpenAI’s ChatGPT broke out seemingly overnight, and the “AI arms race” is ramping up more every day, creating continuing uncertainty for workers.Carolyn Montrose, a career coach and lecturer at Columbia University in New York, acknowledges the pace of technological innovation and change can be scary. “It is normal to feel anxiety about the impact of AI because its evolution is fluid, and there are many unknown application factors,” she says.But as unnerving as the new technology is, she also says workers don’t necessarily have to feel existential dread. People have the power to make their own decisions about how much they worry: they can either “choose to feel anxious about AI, or empowered to learn about it and use it to their advantage”.PwC’s Scott Likens, who specialises in understanding issues around trust and technology, echoes this. “Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, technology has the potential to automate or streamline work processes. However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements,” he says. “In order to feel less anxious about the rapid adoption of AI, employees must lean into the technology. Education and training [are] key for employees to learn about AI and what it can do for their particular role as well as help them develop new skills. Instead of shying away from AI, employees should plan to embrace and educate.”It may also be helpful to remember that, according to Likens, “this isn’t the first time we have encountered industry disruptions – from automation and manufacturing to e-commerce and retail – we have found ways to adapt”. Indeed, the introduction of new technology has often been unnerving for some people, but Montrose explains that plenty good has come from past new developments: she says technological change has always been a key ingredient for society’s advancement.Regardless of how people respond to AI technology, adds Montrose, it’s here to stay. And it can be a lot more helpful to remain positive and look forward. “If people feel anxious instead of acting to improve their skills, that will hurt them more than the AI itself,” she says. This isn’t the first time we have encountered industry disruptions – from automation and manufacturing to e-commerce and retail – we have found ways to adapt – Scott LikensUnique value of humansAlthough experts say some level of anxiety is justified, it may not be time to hit the panic button yet. Some research has recently shown fears of robots taking over human jobs might be overblown. November 2022 research by sociology professor Eric Dahlin at Brigham Young University in Utah, US, showed that not only are robots not replacing human workers at the rate most people believe, but some people also misperceive the rate at which automation tools are taking over. His data showed about 14% of workers said they had seen their job replaced by a robot. But both workers who had experienced job displacement due to technology as well as those who hadn’t tended to overstate the pace and volume of the trend – their estimates were far off reality.“Overall, our perceptions of robots taking over is greatly exaggerated. Those who hadn’t lost jobs overestimated by about double, and those who had lost jobs overestimated by about three times,” said Dahlin in presenting his research. While Dahlin said that some new technologies would likely be adopted and implemented without considering all implications, it’s also true that “just because a technology can be used for something does not mean that it will be implemented”.Stefanie Coleman, a principal in consultancy EY's people advisory services business, also points out that we shouldn’t expect the workforce of the future to be “binary”. In other words, a combination of both humans and robots will always need to exist.""Humans will always have a role to play in business by performing the important work that robots cannot. This kind of work typically requires innate human qualities, such as relationship building, creativity and emotional intelligence,” she says. ""Recognising the unique value of humans in the workforce, when compared to machines, is an important step in navigating the fears that surround this topic.""A few weeks ago, Claire, the PR worker, decided she wanted to start learning more about the technology that’s transforming her industry. She’s now researching online courses through which she hopes to learn to code. “A lot of tech used to scare me, so I just ignored it, but based on everything I’m seeing, that’s sort of stupid,” she says. “Ignoring something definitely won’t make it go away, and I’m slowly starting to understand that if I take the time to make it less unfamiliar – which makes it less scary – it might actually be able to help me a lot.”How we workFeatures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new report discusses the evolving attitudes towards the use of generative AI and ChatGPT within law firms, surveying lawyers about the opportunities and potential risks

It didn’t take long after OpenAI released its ChatGPT prototype for public use — shedding light on the myriad abilities that its underlying technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), possessed — that many lawyers and legal industry experts became keenly aware of what these tools could mean for the profession and for law firms in particular.
Not surprisingly, strong opinions arose, not only about the potential sea-change in the delivery, pricing, and execution of legal services that the wider use of generative AI could bring, but also about the unknown risks that such usage could pose.
In fact, a recent survey of law firm lawyers illustrated this dichotomy well — a large majority (82%) of those surveyed said they believe that ChatGPT and generative AI can be readily applied to legal work; and a slightly smaller majority (51%) said that ChatGPT and generative AI should be applied to legal work.

The survey, conducted in late-March by the Thomson Reuters Institute, gathered insight from more than 440 respondent lawyers at large and midsize law firms in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The survey forms the basis of a new report, ChatGPT & Generative AI within Law Firms, which takes a deep look at the evolving attitudes towards generative AI and ChatGPT within law firms, measuring awareness and adoption of the technology as well as lawyers’ views on its potential risks.
The report also reveals several key findings that deserve special attention from law firm leaders and other legal professionals as ChatGPT and generative AI evolve from concept to reality for the vast majority of the legal industry participants. These findings include:





Attitudes are evolving around this technology — While almost everybody we surveyed had heard of ChatGPT and generative AI, actual use among law firms thus far was quite limited, with just 3% of respondents saying they are actually using generative AI right now. Of course, a much larger portion (34%) said their firm was still considering whether or not to use generative AI for legal operations.
Firms are taking a cautiously proactive approach — About 15% of respondents said their firms have warned employees against unauthorized generative AI use at work, and 6% said their firms have banned unauthorized usage outright, indicating that many lawyers clearly understand the importance of applying guardrails to generative AI use. In fact, all those interviewed noted that they do not fully trust generative AI tools — and particularly the public-facing ChatGPT tool — with confidential client data. Yet, even as this mistrust exists, our research shows that attitudes are changing, and potential use cases are being explored by many law firms.
There’s a growing awareness of the risks — A large portion of respondents had concerns with use of ChatGPT and generative AI at work — 62%, which included 80% of partners or managing partners. Further, many of the concerns voiced in our survey seemed to revolve around the technology’s accuracy and security, most specifically about how law firms’ concerns of privacy and client confidentiality will be addressed. Still, many legal industry observers (and many of our respondents) know that by any measure, we are still early in the game for generative AI and ChatGPTs. It is expected that time and experimentation will make users more comfortable with these tools, and a day will come when generative AI and ChatGPT is in as common use within law firms as online legal research and electronic contract signing are now.





Yet, whichever side of the debate over this fledgling technology a lawyer might find themselves, one idea the report makes clear — whatever the level of use of ChatGPT and generative AI eventually reaches among law firms and throughout legal, this technology has the potential to change the industry. And even in its infancy, the growing acceptance of ChatGPT and generative AI is being seen as a watershed moment.
“Within the next six months everybody at the firm will be using it,” said Charlotte Woolven-Brown, Head of Employment and a Partner at law firm Sternberg Reed in the United Kingdom. “And there’s absolutely no way you’re going to stop that, because people will get more in tune with what’s happening and how quickly this technology is developing.”

The light and dark sides of AI have been in the public spotlight for many years. Think facial recognition, algorithms making loan and sentencing recommendations, and medical image analysis. But the impressive – and sometimes scary – capabilities of ChatGPT, DALL-E 2 and other conversational and image-conjuring artificial intelligence programs feel like a turning point.
The key change has been the emergence within the last year of powerful generative AI, software that not only learns from vast amounts of data but also produces things – convincingly written documents, engaging conversation, photorealistic images and clones of celebrity voices.
Generative AI has been around for nearly a decade, as long-standing worries about deepfake videos can attest. Now, though, the AI models have become so large and have digested such vast swaths of the internet that people have become unsure of what AI means for the future of knowledge work, the nature of creativity and the origins and truthfulness of content on the internet.
Here are five articles from our archives that take the measure of this new generation of artificial intelligence.
1. Generative AI and work
A panel of five AI experts discussed the implications of generative AI for artists and knowledge workers. It’s not simply a matter of whether the technology will replace you or make you more productive.
University of Tennessee computer scientist Lynne Parker wrote that while there are significant benefits to generative AI, like making creativity and knowledge work more accessible, the new tools also have downsides. Specifically, they could lead to an erosion of skills like writing, and they raise issues of intellectual property protections given that the models are trained on human creations.
University of Colorado Boulder computer scientist Daniel Acuña has found the tools to be useful in his own creative endeavors but is concerned about inaccuracy, bias and plagiarism.
University of Michigan computer scientist Kentaro Toyama wrote that human skill is likely to become costly and extraneous in some fields. “If history is any guide, it’s almost certain that advances in AI will cause more jobs to vanish, that creative-class people with human-only skills will become richer but fewer in number, and that those who own creative technology will become the new mega-rich.”
Florida International University computer scientist Mark Finlayson wrote that some jobs are likely to disappear, but that new skills in working with these AI tools are likely to become valued. By analogy, he noted that the rise of word processing software largely eliminated the need for typists but allowed nearly anyone with access to a computer to produce typeset documents and led to a new class of skills to list on a resume.
University of Colorado Anschutz biomedical informatics researcher Casey Greene wrote that just as Google led people to develop skills in finding information on the internet, AI language models will lead people to develop skills to get the best output from the tools. “As with many technological advances, how people interact with the world will change in the era of widely accessible AI models. The question is whether society will use this moment to advance equity or exacerbate disparities.”

2. Conjuring images from words
Generative AI can seem like magic. It’s hard to imagine how image-generating AIs can take a few words of text and produce an image that matches the words.



A few keywords – pink hair, Asian boy, cyberpunk, stadium jacket, Manga – yield striking and believable images of a person who never existed.

Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley computer scientist who specializes in image forensics, explained the process. The software is trained on a massive set of images, each of which includes a short text description.
“The model progressively corrupts each image until only visual noise remains, and then trains a neural network to reverse this corruption. Repeating this process hundreds of millions of times, the model learns how to convert pure noise into a coherent image from any caption,” he wrote.

3. Marking the machine
Many of the images produced by generative AI are difficult to distinguish from photographs, and AI-generated video is rapidly improving. This raises the stakes for combating fraud and misinformation. Fake videos of corporate executives could be used to manipulate stock prices, and fake videos of political leaders could be used to spread dangerous misinformation.
Farid explained how it’s possible to produce AI-generated photos and video that contain watermarks verifying that they are synthetic. The trick is to produce digital watermarks that can’t be altered or removed. “These watermarks can be baked into the generative AI systems by watermarking all the training data, after which the generated content will contain the same watermark,” he wrote.

4. Flood of ideas
For all the legitimate concern about the downsides of generative AI, the tools are proving to be useful for some artists, designers and writers. People in creative fields can use the image generators to quickly sketch out ideas, including unexpected off-the-wall material.


AI as an idea generator for designers.

Rochester Institute of Technology industrial designer and professor Juan Noguera and his students use tools like DALL-E or Midjourney to produce thousands of images from abstract ideas – a sort of sketchbook on steroids.
“Enter any sentence – no matter how crazy – and you’ll receive a set of unique images generated just for you. Want to design a teapot? Here, have 1,000 of them,” he wrote. “While only a small subset of them may be usable as a teapot, they provide a seed of inspiration that the designer can nurture and refine into a finished product.”

5. Shortchanging the creative process
However, using AI to produce finished artworks is another matter, according to Nir Eisikovits and Alec Stubbs, philosophers at the Applied Ethics Center at University of Massachusetts Boston. They note that the process of making art is more than just coming up with ideas.
The hands-on process of producing something, iterating the process and making refinements – often in the moment in response to audience reactions – are indispensable aspects of creating art, they wrote.
“It is the work of making something real and working through its details that carries value, not simply that moment of imagining it,” they wrote. “Artistic works are lauded not merely for the finished product, but for the struggle, the playful interaction and the skillful engagement with the artistic task, all of which carry the artist from the moment of inception to the end result.”

	The rapidly advancing creative capabilities of generative AI have led to questions about artificial intelligence becoming increasingly capable of replacing creative workers across film and TV production, game development and music creation.

	Talent might increasingly view and use generative AI in more straightforward ways as simply a new creative tool in their belt, just as other disruptive technologies through time have entered and changed how people make and distribute their creative work.

	In effect, there will still — and always — be a need for people to be the primary agents in the creative development process.

	“Talent will incorporate AI tools into their existing processes or to make certain aspects of their process more efficient and scalable,” said Brent Weinstein, chief development officer at Candle Media, who has worked extensively with content companies and creators in developing next-gen digital-media strategies and pioneering new businesses and models that sit at the intersection of content and technology.    

	The disruptive impact of generative AI will certainly be felt in numerous creative roles, but fears about total machine takeover of creative professions are most likely overblown. Experts believe generative AI won’t be a direct substitute for artists, but it can be a tool that augments their capabilities.

	“For the type of premium content that has always defined the entertainment industry, the starting point will continue to be extraordinarily and uniquely talented artists,” Weinstein continued. “Actors, writers, directors, producers, musicians, visual effects supervisors, editors, game creators and more, along with a new generation of artists that — similar to the creators who figured out YouTube early on — learns to master these innovative new tools.”

	Joanna Popper, chief metaverse officer at CAA, brings expertise on all emerging technologies relevant for creative talent and the potential to impact content creation, distribution and community engagement. 

	“Ideally, creatives use AI tools to collaborate and enhance our abilities, similar to creatives using technical tools since the beginning of filmmaking,” Popper said. “We’ve seen technology used throughout history to help filmmakers and content creators either produce stories in innovative ways, enable stories to reach new audiences and/or enable audiences to interact with those stories in different ways.”

	









	A Goldman Sachs study released last month of how AI would impact economic growth estimated that 26% of work tasks would be automated within the “arts, design, sports, entertainment and media” industries, roughly in line with the average across all industries.  

	In February, Netflix received backlash after releasing a short anime film that partly used AI-driven animation. Voice actors in Latin America who were replaced by automated software have also spoken out. 

	Julian Togelius, associate professor of computer science and engineering and director of the Game Innovation Lab at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, has done extensive research in artificial intelligence and games. “Generative AI is more like a new toolset that people need to master within existing professions in the game industry,” he said. “In the end, someone still needs to use the tool. People will always supervise and initiate the process, so there’s no true replacemen. Game developers now just have more powerful tools.”

Adults have to do a lot of unpleasant jobs; it’s part of the gig. Taking out the trash, cleaning the toilet and making the daily school run are unavoidable when it comes to keeping life running smoothly.But there’s one particular job that fills me with dread: calling a “helpline."" Every time I pick up the phone to discuss tax codes, remortgage rates, insurance quotes, doctor’s appointments or some other exciting aspect of modern life, my knees go slack and my head starts to pound. Cue generic hold music and a constant robotic reminder of my place in the virtual queue.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksSmart Lifestyle TrendsCheapest Way To Get A Walk In Tub If You're On MedicareSmart Lifestyle TrendsUndoOnce you do get through to a person, things rarely improve. The poor soul on the other end of the line guides me through mundane security questions before reading from a pre-prepared script. Often, they fail to offer up a single noteworthy piece of advice when questioned directly.LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide
Tom's Guide


















During one of these recent calls, it occurred to me everyone involved would benefit from letting artificial intelligence handle the task. I don’t mean the basic interactive voice response (IVR) program that routes your call based on how you answer recorded questions; I mean a full conversational AI agent capable of discussing and actioning my requests with no human input. I’d get through the process faster (because the organization wouldn’t need to wait for available humans to assign) and it wouldn’t require a living, breathing person to spend their days on the phone to an aggravated person like me. Similarly, an AI doesn’t need to clock off at the end of a shift, so the call could be handled any time of the day or night.Let me hear a voice(Image credit: FrameStockFootages/Shutterstock)Plenty of companies have implemented browser or app-based chat clients but, the fact is, a huge amount of people still prefer to pick up the phone and do things by voice. And I think most industry leaders recognize this. Humana, a healthcare insurance provider with over 13 million customers, partnered with IBM’s Data and AI Expert Labs in 2019 to implement natural language understanding (NLU) software into its call centers to respond to spoken sentences. The machines either rerouted the call to the relevant person or, where necessary, simply provided the information. This came after Humana recognized that 60% of the million-or-so calls they were getting each month were just queries for information.According to a blog post from IBM, “The Voice Assistant uses significant speech customization with seven language models and two acoustic models, each targeted to a specific type of user input collected by Humana. “Through speech customization training, the solution achieves an average of 90-95% sentence error rate accuracy level on the significant data inputs. The implementation handles several sub-intents within the major groupings of eligibility, benefits, claims, authorization and referrals, enabling Humana to quickly answer questions that were never answerable before.”The cost of AI(Image credit: Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The obvious stumbling block for most companies will be the cost. After all, OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT charges for API access while Meta’s LLaMA is partially open-source but doesn’t permit commercial use.However, given time, the cost for implementing machine learning solutions will come down. For example, Databricks, a U.S.-based enterprise company recently launched Dolly 2.0, a 12-billion parameter model that’s completely open source. It will allow companies and organizations to create large language models (LLMs) without having to pay costly API fees to the likes of Microsoft, Google or Meta. With more of these advancements being made, the AI adoption rate for small and medium-sized businesses will (and should) increase.According to recent research by industry analysts Gartner, around 10% of so-called agent interactions will be performed by conversational AI by 2026. At present, the number stands at around 1.6%.""Many organizations are challenged by agent staff shortages and the need to curtail labor expenses, which can represent up to 95 percent of contact center costs,” explained Daniel O'Connell, a VP analyst at Gartner. “Conversational AI makes agents more efficient and effective, while also improving the customer experience.""You could even make the experience a bit more fun. Imagine if a company got the license to utilize James Earl Jones’ voice for its call center AI.

And if a company simply opts for a one-size-fits-all AI approach, rather than tailoring it to specific customer requirements, we won’t be any better off.Zooming out for a second, I appreciate that we’re yet to fully consider all the ethical questions posed by the rapid advancements in AI. Regulation will surely become a factor (if it can keep pace) and upskilling a workforce to become comfortable with the new system will be something for industry leaders and educational institutions to grapple with.But I still think a good place to start is letting the robots take care of mundane helpline tasks — it’s for the good of humanity.More from Tom's Guide7 Bard announcements Google should make at I/O to beat ChatGPTChatGPT could rival human intelligence with next-level upgradeElon Musk and other leaders call on ChatGPT and Bard to halt AI trainingToday's best Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) deals $94.95View Deal $99.59View Deal $99.99View DealShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices

How does AI actually work?



April 17, 2023




Kristina Bravo








Artificial intelligence has entered a new era. From search to education to art, recent advancements in AI promise to shake up the way we work and live.
Yet for some of us, AI poses more questions than answers. How will it affect us? Are there risks? How do we make it trustworthy?
Before we can answer these complex questions, it helps to get the basics down on AI. Read on for a crash course on artificial intelligence.
First, what exactly is AI?
AI is essentially software that can learn patterns from information. Think language, images, audio, online behavior and more. Using patterns from existing and new data, AI makes predictions to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence – like finding products we’re likely to buy or finishing a sentence in an email.
How does it work?
Take a customer service chatbot, for example. After you type a question, the chatbot uses an algorithm – or a set of rules  – to recognize keywords and identify what kind of help you need. The machine learning model, based on the existing and new information it has, then generates an appropriate response. The chatbot improves over time as it interacts with new customers and receives more data. 
“Think about the algorithm as the program that works with the dataset, and the model is the output that makes the prediction,” explained Mozilla researcher Becca Ricks.
Why are chatbots like ChatGPT sounding more… human?
The latest chatbots use a type of machine learning model called a neural network. Inspired by the structure of the human brain, it’s designed to learn increasingly complex patterns to come up with predictions and recommendations. With chatbots, the model learns language from a large amount of existing and new data, making it really good at sounding how a person might talk. 
Can AI get things wrong?
Absolutely. AI models learn from data, which can be incomplete. ChatGPT, for instance, is a language model trained on data on the internet. That’s why it may have trouble solving simple math problems. 
AI can also produce biased outputs. For example, image recognition trained on a set of images featuring mostly light-skinned people may not be able to recognize individuals with darker skin tones. Algorithms and data come from humans, so AI technologies typically follow biases that exist – like ones based on race, gender and age. 
“They might affect whether or not our friends are seeing what we post,” Becca said. “Or, they might affect whether or not we’re getting resources from our local government.” 
How do we make sure we can trust AI?
The first step is learning about it. From there, we can demand transparency and accountability.
“The more that we all know the way AI systems work, the easier it makes for us to imagine what better looks like,” Becca said. “And it makes it easier for us to design alternatives that benefit society and reflect the values of our communities.”

AI exists in almost everything we use on the internet, like search engines and our social media feeds. But if you want to reduce the amount of personal information you have out on the web, don’t give away your true email and phone number when signing up for the latest AI apps.Like any other application, an AI app can expose your information to online trackers, spammers and hackers.

Claims About Generative AI Replacing Jobs Are Hyperbolic and Misleading

Lately, the news cycle has included a series of ever-shifting claims about what impact generative AI systems will have on jobs. The purported impact varies wildly from outlet to outlet but the central message from the news media is clear: AI is here to take almost all the jobs, not just the blue-collar ones, the white-collar ones too. The problem is, many of the claims are hokum. Let’s unpack one of the worst recent examples: Vice Media’s article “OpenAI Research Says 80% of U.S. Workers’ Jobs Will Be Impacted by GPT.”
Vice leads with a sound bite statistic. Its headline is eye-catching, emotionally resonating, and easily repeatable, but it is narrowly true and broadly misleading. The statistic comes from a research paper by OpenAI, but the paper doesn’t simply say 80 percent of jobs will be impacted, it says “around 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected.” That means the real statistic is that large language models (LLMs) might impact at least 8 percent of work in the U.S. economy. A significantly less dramatic picture of the research findings but a more honest one.
If the statistics in Vice’s headline are a bullhorn for impending job disruption though, the words it uses are a dog whistle. Rather than saying jobs “could be impacted,” it says jobs “will be impacted,” subtly suggesting the impact on jobs is urgent and certain, which the OpenAI researchers themselves say is by no means the case. The ability for firms in different segments of the economy to adopt LLM models hinges on a myriad of factors, such as the availability of data for training the models, the regulatory environment, and innovation culture within businesses, to name just a few. 
More importantly, just because a job is exposed to LLM automation “doesn’t determine whether the technology is likely to replace workers or merely augment their skills” as the New York Times more accurately reports. Tools like ChatGPT might be able to draft a legal document in half the time a human legal secretary can, but that doesn’t necessarily mean law firms can or should substitute their staff in favor of LLMs because these tools are still at a stage where they can misrepresent key facts and cite evidence that doesn’t exist. They still need humans to verify and check their outputs. 
Unfortunately, Vice is not the only outlet exhibiting this vice (pun intended). Forbes recently published a hyperbolic article titled “Goldman Sachs Predicts 300 Million Jobs Will Be Lost Or Degraded By Artificial Intelligence,” based on a recent report from the investment firm. The report takes U.S. and EU data on job tasks, identifies the ones generative AI systems can do, and calculates exposure. The 300 million jobs number it comes up with is arguably presumptuous because it’s an extrapolated figure for the number of jobs around the entire world that might one day be exposed to generative AI automation (when that day is supposed to be isn’t entirely clear from the report). Still, Forbes has no qualms in spinning this potential “exposure” metric into a spurious narrative about seemingly certain job displacement. Several other outlets fall into the same trap.
Granted, conveying facts without any editorial color isn’t very well-suited to the modern world. The media has an important role to play in keeping the public informed in a way that is engaging and accessible, but there is a line between using data to tell a story and statistical spin-doctoring. Consider that Goldman Sachs’ own blog summarizing its research is titled “Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%” because one of its central messages is that generative AI may displace some jobs but can also create new jobs, which history has shown are typically higher-paying jobs in the same industry. The Financial Times portrays this message more faithfully, noting “Goldman’s base case is for 7 percent of workers to lose their jobs entirely in the decade after generative AI reaches half of employers, but most will find something nearly as productive to do.” In fact, since many of the jobs that might be substituted involve mundane, repetitive tasks, there is no reason why many would not find jobs they find more creative and more rewarding.
It is easier for reporters to write these attention-grabbing headlines than to dig into real substance. But they should look at the facts. Concerns about AI taking jobs are based on the “lump of labor fallacy,” the idea that there is a fixed amount of work, and thus productivity growth, such as from automation, will reduce the number of jobs. But the data tells a different story, labor productivity has grown steadily for the past century (even if that growth has been slower recently) and unemployment is near an all-time low. 
It is becoming more difficult to wade through the hogwash of claims about AI but if readers, and more importantly policymakers, aren’t prudent, they will make decisions based on unfounded fears or hype. Worse, such balderdash can distract from the real issues related to AI systems: how to spur their safe development and responsible use.

Getty Images/iStockphotopart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Rani Molla is a senior correspondent at Vox and has been focusing her reporting on the future of work. She has covered business and technology for more than a decade — often in charts — including at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.AI is probably going to affect your job. We just don’t yet know when or how much — or how to feel about it exactly. Most Americans agree that AI will have a major impact on workers in the next 20 years, and they’re more likely to say it will hurt more than help, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. But at the same time, most Americans think AI will have little or no impact on them personally.In other words, AI will harm thee, but not me.That’s a similar sentiment to what Vox heard talking to workers who’ve deployed generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard at work. Knowledge workers said the software helps them save time and avoid drudge work, allowing them to write code more quickly or spin up business memos or marketing copy with just a few prompts. But, to a person, these workers felt that even though others’ jobs might be at risk of being obviated by AI, theirs was likely safe thanks in part to their mastery over those tools.The rise of artificial intelligence, explainedHow does AI actually work? How is AI changing our society?Is AI coming for your job?Should we be worried about AI?Who will regulate AI?The refrain was frequently a version of this tweet: “AI will not replace you. A person using AI will.” While people are certainly embracing some forms of AI, they find some types, like those that would hire, fire, or monitor them, distasteful. That could be an issue depending on how exactly AI becomes integrated into the workplace.The truth is that while AI tools show a remarkable ability to replicate what was often high-paid human work, we don’t yet know if that will translate into less work for humans or simply different — and perhaps even better — work. A recent study by OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT and its more advanced successor GPT-4, found that high-paid jobs that require degrees had the most exposure to the capabilities of these tools. The study didn’t say whether those jobs would be erased or augmented by the technology. “This could be a trust-building opportunity rather than a trust-destroying opportunity”Other forms of AI have been incorporated into various workplace applications in both manual and computer-assisted work for the last decade, according to Julia Dhar, managing director, partner, and global lead of the Behavioral Science Lab at Boston Consulting Group. In manufacturing, that’s meant AI decides when to start producing one good instead of another based on sales and other demand forecasts. In services, it’s shown up in call centers, prompting workers to offer different responses based on how the interaction progresses or even the tone of a person’s voice.But so far, thanks to the costs and technical capabilities needed to scale AI in the workplace, AI penetration in the workplace is still low. Dhar sees that as an opportunity to make sure that the way AI is used at work is beneficial both to companies and to workers. “I think that we have focused not enough of the public conversation around trust,” Dhar said. “We’ve talked about trustworthy AI, but we have talked hardly at all about trust between employers and employees, and how this could be a trust-building opportunity rather than a trust-destroying opportunity.”Related:Maybe AI can finally kill the cover letterThe Pew study, which surveyed more than 11,000 Americans, suggests that trust is lacking. While people like certain types of AI at work, lots of it has them on edge, specifically when it’s used in hiring, firing, and monitoring. Seventy-one percent opposed the idea of AI making final hiring decisions (just 7 percent were for it) and 55 percent were against its use in making firing decisions, according to the Pew report. A plurality didn’t want it to be used to review applications at all or to decide who gets promotions. Many felt AI lacked the human touch that would allow it to see things like the potential in a candidate who didn’t exactly match a job description or how well a person might get along with their coworkers. The use of AI is already commonplace in so-called applicant tracking software, which most major companies use in their hiring process. This widespread technology allows companies to use keywords or criteria — like whether or not they have a college degree or a gap in their resume — to automatically winnow down the mass of incoming online applications. But many, including employers themselves, fear that those broad strokes could end up excluding people who would be perfectly good candidates.“[AI in job interviews is] prevalent enough that our students are being trained by career services on how to handle those interviews”Jason Schloetzer, associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, found that more than half of human resource managers are either using AI-based tech in hiring or intend to do so very soon. He says that AI is creeping into more advanced levels of the hiring process, like the first round of interviews, where he says candidates respond to employer questions into a webcam, and employers use AI to analyze their response and even body language to decide whether or not they make it to the next round.“It’s prevalent enough that our students are being trained by career services on how to handle those interviews,” Schloetzer added. In a way, these practices have encouraged workers and candidates to use AI themselves. Many are turning to tools like ChatGPT to write their resumes or cover letters — in part to offload a tedious task, but also as a way to fight back in the hiring process, bot to bot.Unsurprisingly, most people surveyed by Pew also oppose using AI in creepier ways, like monitoring their movements and facial expressions while they work or tracking when they’re at their desks and what exactly they’re doing. This sort of technology has become increasingly common in the workplace, from Amazon warehouses to the office, since the start of the pandemic as bosses, leery of remote work and quiet quitting, try to ensure productivity. But as the Wall Street Journal reported, there’s little proof the technology works, and some evidence suggests it can even be counterproductive, causing people to be demoralized and less productive. Such so-called productivity trackers have also led to a rise in people trying to outwit them, with hacks like mouse jigglers — devices that can physically move a mouse on a desk with no human present — that make it look like they’re working.Related:The promise and peril of AI, according to 5 expertsVox spoke with a professional services worker at a midsize marketing company that uses activity monitoring software to track remote workers’ keystrokes and mouse movements and takes occasional photographs to check that she’s at her computer. The employee, who asked that we not use her name so as not to get her in trouble at work, said that while she finds the software annoying, she’s developed ways to get around it. She browses social media on her personal phone and makes sure not to slack off for more than 10 minutes at a time so the software doesn’t flag her to her bosses. Overall, she’s ambivalent and doesn’t think it affects her productivity one way or another. She does believe there’s a bright side in that she doesn’t do any work that’s not at her computer, so when she’s off she’s really off. “I hate that I don’t hate it,” she said, but added that she’d probably opt next time for a job that didn’t track her. As for the facial monitoring, she said, “If they want to see how busted I show up for my remote job, then good for them.”BCG’s Dhar, however, warns against such monitoring AI, saying it causes companies to “mistake activity for productivity.”“It really sends a message to people that doing anything that is observable is better than doing the very often unobservable hard work of human cognition or relationship building or spotting safety hazards,” she said.For now, it’s impossible to predict how exactly AI adoption will impact the workplace. Georgetown’s Schloetzer said it will likely mean some jobs are lost, some are added, but for the most part, a lot of existing jobs will be reconfigured. What’s certain is that prominent use of AI in the workplace will eventually happen.“I don’t even think it’s worth debating this stuff,” Schloetzer said “I think we just need to be prepared for it to be rolled out.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

They argue the systems  are unscientific and include biases.The TUC says AI is being used to analyse facial expressions, tone of voice and accents to assess candidates' suitability for roles.Left unchecked, it argues, AI could lead to greater discrimination at work. For example tools that analyse facial expressions, may disadvantage candidates or employees with certain disabilities.UK rules out new AI regulatorAI tools fail to reduce recruitment bias - studyHowever, some of the firms promoting AI tools argue that conversely computer systems will make more impartial decisions than humans alone.Mary Towers, an employment rights policy officer at the TUC, told the BBC its research had found AI tools used in a variety of industries ""at the recruitment stage in things like CV sifting, but then beyond that in team allocation, allocation of work, disciplinary measures, right through to termination of employment"". ""We found evidence of AI powered tools being used in all the different ways in which you would expect a human manager to carry out functions at work,"" she said.  'Unrealistic targets'AI tools can also be used to track worker performance, sometimes making automated decisions to effectively fire employees.The TUC warns AI could ""set unrealistic targets that then result in workers being put in dangerous situations that impact negatively on their both physical health and mental well being"".Some employers require workers to carry devices which record data about their activity which can then be analysed. One warehouse worker told AI policy campaigners Connected by Data that it meant that if they took too many toilet breaks it would be flagged and they would have to explain why they weren't working.Last month the government published its white paper on AI which proposed spreading regulation of the technology across different existing bodies rather than creating a single new watchdog.According to the TUC, the paper offered only ""vague"" and ""flimsy"" guidance to regulators on how to ensure AI is used ethically at work, ""and no additional capacity or resource to cope with rising demand"".It also suggested the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, which had its second reading Monday, will water down many protections in current data protection legislation - including the right to human review of automated decisions.'Human review'The TUC wants firms to reveal how AI is being used to make decisions about staff. All decisions should be subject to a human review so that workers may challenge them, it says.The government believes its reforms do not alter workers' rights to seek human review of significant, solely automated decisions. The bill will maintain protections that UK workers currently have while giving organisations greater flexibility, it says.But other organisations have made similar criticisms of the bill. Connected by Data told the BBC: ""The bill reduces the ability of workers to access data that is held about them, or to challenge how it is used, meaning they may never be able to know why their ability to earn a living has been threatened.""To show why such rules are important it points to a recent court case which ordered two ride-hailing firms to turn over information related to automated decisions to dismiss workers in the UK and Portugal.Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader and shadow secretary of state for the future of work, also supported the TUC's call, telling the BBC that AI was ""already transforming the economy"".Workers must ""have a proper say in how technologies are implemented"", she said. ""Labour will update employment rights and protections so they are fit for the modern economy.""UK rules out new AI regulatorAI tools fail to reduce recruitment bias - studyTrades Union CongressArtificial intelligenceEmployment",,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D849/production/_129396355_index-gettyimages-1426471287.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the meteoric rise of ChatGPT has led many to ask themselves the same question that those working in manufacturing have asked themselves for many years now: will my job be replaced with AI?With businesses discovering new ways to use ChatGPT every day, you can understand why workers in all sorts of roles are looking over their shoulders. With AI tools worming their way into the day-to-day routines of employees and solving all sorts of problems, it’s unsurprising that over two-thirds of employees are hiding the fact they use it from their bosses.We’ve spoken to AI experts, entrepreneurs developing AI tools, and businesspeople using them to find out exactly which jobs they think will be automated first, how AI might make things easier, and how you can make yourself AI-proof for the job market.

Is AI Replacing Jobs?It’s unlikely that AI will suddenly replace huge swathes of the human workforce by the end of this week, but the idea this sort of change may happen in the near future has never seemed more realistic than it does at present.A report published by the World Economic Forum in 2020, for example, predicted 85 million jobs will be replaced by AI by the year 2025. Mckinsey’s more conservative 2021 estimate, on the other hand, is 45 million by 2030.Our own Tech.co research has also found that 47% of business leaders would consider using AI instead of hiring for roles at their company.But arguably, these estimations now seem too small. In the wake of ChatGPT’s explosive popularity, Goldman Sachs revealed its predictions that around 300 million jobs could soon be replaced by artificial intelligence or automated in some way or another.At the moment, AI is competently completing tasks within job remits, rather than subsuming whole job roles. But it’s not difficult to imagine how this may progress to entire positions being taken over by artifical intelligence.Indeed, rather than entire roles disappearing into thin air and being replaced with a chatbot like ChatGPT, What we’re more likely to see in the next year or so is AI being used as a tool to aid some duties performed by an increasingly large class of workers.OpenAI predicted in a recent paper that artificial intelligence will soon be able to help with around 10% of tasks for eight out of 10 workers, while 19% of workers will be able to use AI to complete 50% of their tasks. This sort of spread suggests AI replacing jobs will be a slow, gradual process rather than a sudden change.The Top 10 Jobs Most Likely to Be Replaced by AIWe’ve put together a list of jobs most vulnerable to AI. 10 jobs that could be replaced by AI are:Entry-level Admin RolesData Entry Clerks Software Engineers and CodersCustomer Service RepsParalegalsCopywriters and Content RolesGraphic DesignersBankers and AccountantsTradersFact-Checkers and Proofreaders1. Entry-Level admin rolesAdministrative roles are perhaps most at risk of being replaced by AI tools currently available, such as ChatGPT. Admin roles consist of tasks like note-taking, proofreading, writing summaries, and managing spreadsheets, jobs that can already be performed competently by ChatGPT.In the same research note that revealed Goldman Sachs’ prediction that 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI back, “office and administrative support” is cited as the job with the highest percentage (46%) of “current work tasks” that could feasibly be automated and carried out by AI.In Microsoft Teams Premium, the CoPilot feature will summarize your video conferencing meetings into note form and then generate a list of action points by analyzing the content of the transcript. Twenty years ago, taking meeting notes would have been a core duty of a number of administrative and secretarial roles. Now, this task can be completely automated.2. Data entry clerks Data entry roles involve lots of tasks that follow pre-defined sets of rules. This means it’s a comparatively easy role to automate, due to the repetitiveness and logic-following nature.“Jobs that require decision-making based on data analysis, such as financial analysis and medical diagnosis” are most at risk according to Angelo Sorbello, CEO of AI writing and SEO tool Linkdelta. “In general, any job that involves performing a set of predefined steps or following a strict set of rules is vulnerable to automation,” he explained.“Manually entering data into a computer system is time-consuming” Ryan Faber, the founder of the AI content writing platform Copymatic, agrees.“While it’s an important part of many businesses,” he continued, “it’s also a task that’s ripe for automation. With the development of AI-powered tools such as OCR and NLP, it’s now possible to automate many aspects of data entry.”3. Software Engineers and CodersThe news that OpenAI is already trying to make basic coding obsolete with ChatGPT will have certainly spooked those in the software industry. AI can automate much of the repetitive testing that software engineers currently perform during development, as well as many responsibilities usually assigned to junior software engineers.AI could also help with hunting down bugs and patching vulnerabilities. Although it doesn’t seem to have the skill set to replace engineers building highly complicated software that requires human creativity, this isn’t necessarily necessary for every code-based task.OpenAI is already working on a program called Codex that can be applied to virtually any coding task, while Amazon and Samsung employees have also reportedly been using ChatGPT for coding purposes.4. Customer Service RepresentativesCompanies are now using AI to deal with customer service requests; a lot of small businesses can’t afford to employ humans in these roles, so it’s becoming commonplace. They join larger platforms like Amazon in turning to AI to deal with customer service queries, something which the ecommerce giant has been doing for nearly three years now.Jonathan Tian, CEO of CreditYelp, says that AI “has taken over the customer support response” at his company. “Most frequently queried responses are fed to the algorithm to assist our online clients with immediate replies” he added.5. Legal assistantsWhen Legal Cheek recently asked ChatGPT what jobs technology powered by GPT-4 could potentially replace, the paralegal profession was third on its list. The “human trait replaced”, as ChatGPT puts it, is “research and organization.”AI legal assistants are already commercially available – some even offer free trials. One of these programs – Casetexts – will review documents and legal research memos, and help lawyers prepare depositions. It can analyze contacts and revise them if they conflict with compliance laws, as well as identify potential risks your business might face.As you can probably imagine, this covers a lot of duties carried out at present by human paralegals.6. Copywriting and content productionAnyone who’s used ChatGPT knows it can produce competent paragraphs of useful, relevant content in seconds – just like a writer or editor can, but quicker. ChatGPT alternatives like Jasper and Writesonic are already well-established in this place and charge hefty subscription fees for access to their premium services.Although major websites have started to dabble in using artificial intelligence to create content and write articles, producing content en masse with AI hasn’t exactly gone smoothly for the companies testing the water. For instance, tech website CNET used AI to write 77 articles but was then forced to issue corrections on 41 of them while other news outlets identified examples of “extensive plagiarism.”Buzzfeed has recently begun publishing AI-generated content too, although it’s been accused of being quite repetitive. Although we’re a long way off from replacing writers, it’s an area being considered closely by a lot of publications – so watch this space.7. Graphic designers Already, AI tools like DALL-E can generate images at the drop of a hat that would give experienced graphic designers a run for their money. GPT-4, which is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus customers, now allows image inputs, and other competing AI chatbots can also generate impressive image content, such as Character.ai.DALL-E and similar tools aren’t going to kill the graphic design industry in their current iteration; rather, some artists are already using it to their advantage. But it’s more about what DALL-E – and similar tools – could become in a short amount of time. If we can easily access technology that can produce unique, original, high-quality images now, what will it be able to do in a year’s time?8. TradersWould a computer program be better at trading than a human? Well, considering the duties you have to perform in your early years on the job, the answer is probably “yes”.“I definitely think [it will impact] the trading side, but even [at] an investment bank, people [are] hired out of college and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling — you can get AI to do that,” Pengcheng Shi, Professor of Computing and Information Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology told the New York Post in January.Teams around the world are already using ChatGPT and Bard to generate Excel formulas for specific tasks, and saving valuable time hunting. When we recently tested ChatGPT and Bard, we found that they both served us responses to requests for Google Sheets formulas at lightning speed, which otherwise would have taken considerable time leafing through Google to find.9. Bankers and accountantsTrading isn’t the only role in the finance industry that is likely to be affected by the AI revolution.“I believe that roles in accounting and finance are most at risk of being taken by AI” argues Forbes 30 under 30 alumni Matt Ramirez, Founder of AI firm Rephrase Media.“Advanced algorithms are already being used to detect patterns in large sets of data, which can then be used to predict future outcomes and make better business decisions,” he continued. “Sectors such as finance, accounting, and insurance will certainly experience disruption from AI.”10. Fact-checkers and proofreadersRight now, neither Bard nor ChatGPT is capable of getting every single question they’re asked correct, every single time. But if they undergo significant fine-tuning and provide sources to every answer they serve to users, they could function as formidable, real-time fact-checkers. What a great addition to the US presidential debates they’d be.Whether people would initially be prepared to trust an AI fact-checker is another story. But roles that revolve around sourcing correct information quickly and efficiently would be transformed by a chatbot that can consistently pull accurate information from the web while citing its sources – and it doesn’t feel like we’re miles off from making this a reality.Proofreading huge texts – which requires a similar level of attention to detail and would take veteran proofreader hours to check – can be reviewed for mistakes by AI programs in seconds already, meaning this sort of role is vulnerable to automation too. Will AI Just Make Jobs Easier?ChatGPT has already proven itself competent at basic administrative jobs, as well as coding, content ideation, generating Excel formulas, and writing emails. The version built into Microsoft Teams can take meeting notes and create action points. Rather than replacing jobs, however, might it just make our existing ones easier?Real Fake Photos founder Jan-Oliver Seidenfass, who’s currently completing a postgraduate degree focused on signal processing and machine learning at ETH Zurich, thinks the jobs most at risk include roles that deal with “mass content creation and editing, related to text, images, and video.”However, he told Tech.co that “rather than eliminating these jobs, AI is likely to boost individual productivity significantly. For example, software engineers can now generate boilerplate code in seconds instead of hours.”Ryan Daniel, President of Finance Manager Training, thinks the sales industry won’t be heavily affected by an AI revolution – in fact, workers in the sector may benefit from AI programs.“Our team recently launched an AI product designed to train car dealership staff. However, we were surprised to hear from many people expressing concerns that our product might replace their job,” Daniels recalls.“Our product uses AI to help train salespeople and finance managers, therefore allowing these employees to be even better at their job. In this way, we use AI as an enhancement – rather than a replacement” – Ryan Daniels, Finance Manager Training.Out of all the industries witnessing AI-related changes, Daniels believes “sales will be the least affected over the course of what we now know as artificial intelligence” because people are “less likely to trust AI with purchasing decisions.”It’s also important to remember that this sort of paradigmatic shift is nothing new for a constantly evolving global economy.“Every great technological innovation in history has changed up the job market, and AI is no different,” explains Nick Gausling, Managing Director of Romy Group LLC and Author of Bots in Suits: Using Generative AI to Revolutionize Your Business.“Some skills and jobs will become obsolete and resources will be reallocated to fit the new economy,” Gausling continued. “The most successful people will be those who learn to leverage AI to augment their work.”Jobs That Won’t Be Taken by AIWe’re some years away from the AI-supported utopian dreamland that’s been described by sci-fi novelists and tech futurists for decades, where we’ll be free to indulge in whatever activities we want to while robots do all the work.A whole swathe of job roles will be occupied by humans for years to come. For instance, it’s hard to envisage how the roles of lawyers and public sector jobs in nursing and law enforcement can feasibly be replaced in the near future. It will be a long while before we trust AI to occupy roles that demand accountability, even if the technology is advanced enough to perform the relevant duties capably.Indeed, a general distrust of AI – as well as more nuanced ethical considerations – is likely to hold up the expansion of AI into specific sectors as much as actual technological development. Major names in the tech industry are already speaking out against its unchecked development, and this pushback is likely to exist in perpetuity.Interestingly, however, public service job shortages are common at present in developed countries like the United Kingdom, where there’s still a huge backlog of unheard court cases left over from Covid-19, as well as severe nursing shortages. This could lead governments to explore innovative ways to fix this – which may include incorporating AI into job roles and processes.In the private sector, a 2022 Gartner survey found that 80% of executives thought AI could be applied in “any direction” – which would suggest no stone will be left unturned when it comes to automation.Will AI Create More Jobs Than It Replaces?Conversations about how artificial intelligence and advanced robotics will impact the job market are usually focused on the jobs they’ll replace. But AI development has the capacity to create a whole new industry full of jobs, too. It’s anything but a zero-sum game.In the World Economic Forum report referenced earlier on in this article is the fact that while AI may make around 85 million jobs obsolete, at the same time, it’ll create 97 million new ones.Other studies, such as a University of Warwick investigation published in March of last year, found AI investments were 28.4% more likely to create jobs than investments in other types of similar technologies.Dr. Will Hunt said at the time that “discussions about AI’s potential impact on jobs have tended to focus on potential job losses as AI is increasingly capable of automating complex tasks. And while there does seem to be some evidence of that, our research shows that AI is as likely to lead to net job creation in companies introducing AI as it is to lead to net destruction.”Many of the businesses that Tech.co has spoken to for this piece seemed positive about the impact AI is having on their respective industries, and keen to incorporate it into their workers’ lives.How to Make Yourself AI-ProofThe AI revolution is here, and if companies don’t start upskilling their staff so they can keep up with these significant changes to their working lives, they risk their business being left behind.But what can individuals do to prepare themselves? Iu Ayala, the co-founder of AI-focused consultancy firm Gradient Insight, says prospective employees heading into the job market should “focus on developing skills that complement AI technology.”“For example,” he explains, “skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, emotional intelligence, and communication are likely to become increasingly valuable in a world where AI is prevalent.”As we’ve said before, major changes aren’t going to happen overnight. If you’re worried about your role being swallowed up by artificial intelligence in the next few years, there are things you can do to adapt. Expanding your soft skills – and getting comfortable using the latest AI chatbots and other tools – is a good way to start.

Atlassian is rolling out new generative AI capabilities that will be embedded in the company’s entire portfolio of workforce management cloud products and are designed to help both service-based and project-based work teams be more efficient.
The technology, dubbed Atlassian Intelligence, was announced Wednesday and is built on in-house AI models gained through the company’s acquisition of Perceptive.ai in 2022, and a collaboration with Microsoft-back OpenAI — the creator of ChatGPT, whose launch last year sparked a virtual AI arms race among top tech companies including Google and Meta.
Through the use of large language models, the foundation of generative AI, Atlassian Intelligence constructs custom teamwork graphs showing the types of work being done and the relationship among them, while the open approach of the Atlassian platform provides additional context and data from the third-party apps teams use, according to the company.











 
 
 
“This is really about accelerating teamwork across the different types of products that we have,” said Sherif Mansour, product manager at Atlassian.

“Atlassian intelligence is a set of capabilities that exists within all our cloud products to address different use cases and scenarios, whilst leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and large language models,” he said.
Using generative AI to support teams
Atlassian has outlined multiple ways for Atlassian Intelligence to help support teams, including accelerating work, getting instant help, and building a shared understanding of projects. Atlassian Intelligence can also translate natural language queries into Jira Query Language to find issues across all Jira Cloud products.











 
 
 
To help accelerate work, Atlassian Intelligence uses generative AI technology from OpenAI to create, summarize and extract information from content. For example, decisions and action items can be quickly summarized from meeting minutes, and tweets can be drafted based on information held in Confluence.
While ChatGPT’s technology will be used to help Atlassian Intelligence process natural language requests, Sherif stresses that the company has an agreement that no customer data will be stored by the software or OpenAI.
The technology can also provide employees and customers with immediate responses and fast resolutions via the new Jira Service Management virtual agent, which can automate support interactions from within Slack and Microsoft Teams. Atlassian Intelligence also takes on repetitive requests on behalf of support teams, allowing them to focus on more important work.











 
 
 
Virtual agents to resolve work requests
The virtual agent is designed to resolve help requests instantly based on its understanding of knowledge-base articles and can also ask follow-up questions to take any necessary actions. It can also summarize activity on help requests to get assigned agents up to speed, and help craft responses to customers which can also be edited for tone.
In addition, Atlassian Intelligence can surface previously resolved or related issues and recommend relevant articles and related pages to resolve requests and incidents faster.
Atlassian Intelligence also helps to build a shared internal library of knowledge and terms used to describe projects, acronyms, and internal systems. It can provide shared context with an on-demand dictionary specific to your company, your teams, and their work. You can highlight a term and ask Atlassian Intelligence to explain it with the definition, source of information, internal subject matter experts, and how it connects to related work based on the teamwork graph, Atlassian said.











 
 
 
Natural language instead of SQL queries
Atlassian Intelligence’s understanding of natural language questions also means that users can ask questions and have the technology generate insights using data from multiple sources in Atlassian Analytics — a hub to analyze and visualize data across Atlassian products and connected third-party tools — without needing to know how to write SQL.
Since launching to the public, large language models like ChatGPT have faced criticism for providing incorrect or sometimes even defamatory information in response to requests from users, an issue Mansour is sympathetic with but not one that he thinks will be a major issue for businesses looking to leverage the technology.
“In the enterprise, it’s less of a problem because there’s far less fake news,” he said. Referencing the internal library offering from Atlassian Intelligence, Mansour acknowledged that while it’s technically possible for someone to attribute false definitions to terms, it’s a highly unlikely scenario as there’s nothing to be gained from doing so.











 
 
 
Despite this, a key principle for with Atlassian Intelligence is that the user remains in control.  Mansour explained that while the technology might help an agent craft a response, that message will only be delivered if the user manually presses the send button.
Furthermore, Mansour said that although Atlassian Intelligence largely adheres to the company’s existing privacy policy, Atlassian users will also need to opt into the technology.
“The user always has to be in control,” he said. “The technology should never do anything without the user first confirming it.”











 
 
 
Atlassian customers can sign up to Atlassian Intelligence’s early access waiting list from April 19, although it cannot guarantee specific timing for when users will gain access.

But for many artists, and the businesses that own their work, generative A.I. is a double threat. These systems can produce copycats of human works that dilute the market, and they use artists’ production, without their permission, as training data.Some see that as stealing intellectual property: Universal Music Group recently told music streaming platforms, including Spotify and Apple, to block A.I. systems from scraping its music.

Genetika+ is also working with pharmaceutical firms to develop new precision drugs.The company hopes its work will be in strong demand in the future. There are more than 280 million people globally who suffer from depression, according to the World Health Organization.

How generative AI for business enhances collaboration


Generative AI has become a leading technology topic. Digital assistants and idea generation are two ways the technology could increase employee productivity.

ChatGPT has been a hot tech trend, and few innovations in any field have attracted as much attention in so little time. For those who view this as the ""Year of AI,"" ChatGPT has already provided all the validation needed, and we've barely scratched the surface.







That said, as with other new forms of technology, adoption starts in the consumer world. Many have experimented with ChatGPT, whereas commercial deployments in business environments have only started coming into play. Generative AI for business is starting to take shape for collaboration and contact center use cases but cautiously, given such a short track record.
Microsoft Teams has been an early adopter of ChatGPT, so it's important to watch the company's moves as a major investor in OpenAI. Unified communications-as-a-service players are following Microsoft's lead. However, it's important to note that ChatGPT is just one form of generative AI, and innovation can come from any vendor or platform provider. The possibilities are endless, and to provide a sense of what to expect, here are two emerging areas for generative AI in the collaboration space.

1. Digital assistants
This use case takes a few different forms, such as an intelligent personal assistant or virtual meeting assistant. In time, other variations will be added, but the underlying idea is for how generative AI can enhance applications built to manage and automate personal workloads. To a large extent, this is already being done using speech recognition, where workers interact with bots through voice to automate routine tasks, like calendaring, managing meetings, transcribing meeting notes and dictating emails.

The AI component means that these assistants learn more and more about the worker over time with machine learning, enabling AI to take on a greater range of tasks with more complexity. As trust builds, each worker can essentially have a personal virtual secretary, leaving more time to engage in work that calls for deep thinking, intense collaboration and creativity.
With an AI foundation in place to enable these digital assistants, generative AI can add new value for collaboration that goes beyond speech recognition. AI's ability to accurately handle voice communication is essential for building trust with end users, and once that develops, end users will be more comfortable relying on applications like ChatGPT.
These applications will be different, as they use AI and search not just to gather information from a wide range of sources, but also to generate new forms of content. The outputs need to be specified by the end user, and as would be done with a human secretary, the bot would be directed to generate whatever is needed, such as email replies, meeting summaries and reports.
What takes this beyond what you can do with conversational AI today is the ability to tailor each output for a specific audience or even individual. Not only can generative AI create these forms of content, but with enough guidance, the technology recognizes the characteristics of the reader well enough to create a more personal and relatable environment. However, ChatGPT can be wrong as much as it can be right, leaving room for refinement, but for now, the possibilities are clear.


2. Idea generation
This use case highlights how generative AI is different from the earlier forms of AI. Most AI use cases in the workplace, as well as in contact centers, are applied to either speech recognition or search, largely to automate workflows or manage large volumes of data. These applications clearly have business value, but their domain is drawn entirely from existing sources of information, either in speech or text forms. Being digital in nature, AI can only work with digitized inputs, which is why digital transformation is so crucial to AI's success and why most AI applications are still in an emerging state. A great deal of historical information will become part of the ocean of data that is the lifeblood of AI.
Generative AI represents an entirely different use case for AI -- namely, taking those existing digital inputs and generating new forms of content. Some might say that it's creating new forms of content, but that raises questions about AI that are not covered here.
While it's fair to say people shouldn't look to generative AI to do the thinking for the user, idea generation is indeed a valid use case. At some point, most collaboration scenarios require creative thinking and fresh ideas, such as developing new products, refreshing a brand or responding to a new competitor. The same can be applied to more mundane tasks that may not even be team-based, such as writing a business plan or a report.
The common thread to all of this is finding the initial inspiration or big idea to kick-start the process. Most people struggle to tap into creative instincts and can't get past staring at a blank page awaiting any input, especially when on a tight deadline. Enter generative AI, where users feed the bot with context and round up some ideas to help get started.
With some trial and error, whether you need a basic structure for a report, a visual for what a new product might look like or examples of great branding, this type of bot scans a far wider pool than any human possibly can and in much less time. These are the inherent strengths of AI, and with generative AI, users can improve work or projects when creative inspiration just isn't there.

Artificial Intelligence Makes Itself Seen (and Heard) in Radio 







NAB Show Daily 























Futuristic capabilities of this disruptive technology raise expectations and job fears
BY Paul mcLane, RadIo world

Radio industry talk has focused on the many ways artificial intelligence might make work more efficient — or take away jobs. AI already was used in radio, but generational platforms like ChatGPT have accelerated debate. Expect to hear a lot more here at NAB Show.
Futuri is here with RadioGPT, which creates “the world’s first 100 percent AI-driven radio hosts.” It combines GPT-3, voice tech and a story discovery/social content system. It scans social media and a quarter-million other sources of information to identify topics trending in a market. It uses AI to create a script for on-air use, and then puts AI voices to it.
U.S. company Alpha Media is intrigued; Executive Vice President of Content Phil Becker said the company is “conceptualizing use cases” but hasn’t deployed it. 
In Canada, Rogers Sports & Media is dabbling.
Futuri says stations can even create single-, duo- or trio-hosted shows, or train the software with voices of existing personalities, in any format.
Promises like this have a lot of radio people worried that AI will be a job-killer.
But CEO Daniel Anstandig calls it playing to radio’s strengths: “The ability for broadcasters to use RadioGPT to localize their on-air content in a turnkey fashion opens up resources for them to deepen their important home-field advantages in new and unique ways. …
With RadioGPT, there should never be a ‘liner card’ or ‘sweeper-only’ air shift again. Now everyone can be live and local.”
Exhibitor Veritone makes products to create avatars and synthetic voice models, deploying AI “to bring digital personas to life.” Clients include iHeartMedia, Audacy and ESPN. 
“Radio managers need to be thinking about which technologies to embrace and lean into,” said Sean King, Veritone senior vice president and general manager, Commercial Enterprise, “whether that’s synthetic media or automation tools to ensure their organizations are around for the next NAB Show.
“Everyone in this space needs to learn not only how to keep up with content demands and new platforms but how to reach new audiences while remaining authentic to their programs’ valuesand brand.”
What about a risk to jobs? “I think about farming,” King said. “Advances in equipment didn’t put farmers out of business, it made them more efficient. Now, many successful farms utilize AI to analyze weather patterns, make predictions and optimize their crop growth.
“AI provides great insight… Take attribution and proof of performance. Without real data, stations and advertisers are merely guessing at what’s working,” said King. “Without AI, it can take a long time to sift through content archives to find a needed clip. With AI, it can be done in mere seconds.” With synthetic voice, creators can use their voice “in two or more places at once.
Additionally, they can do this in multiple languages,” opening new markets. ENCO Systems already uses AI for automated captioning. At NAB Show, it’s showing two offerings that use ChatGPT. 
AITrack integrates with DAD automation to generate voice tracks between songs. “That might include identifying the song and artist of the previous song, introducing the next song and artist, or communicating station IDs, and news or weather updates,” President Ken Frommert said.
Meanwhile ENCO-GPT will automatically create ad copy and summarize news stories. “The application will summarize a written news article into a few sentences or inject breaking news updates into a body of a break. This technology can also be used to quickly write copy for both sponsorships and advertising and convert it to synthetic speech.” 
Frommert said AI is still emerging. “It will take time to reach the quality and accuracy levels that the broadcast industry requires and expects. One concern to alleviate is that AI will make everyone’s job obsolete. Like automation before it, AI will change operational models and perhaps disrupt some traditional structures, but AI cannot survive in broadcast alone. That human element will always be required for quality assurance.”
And not all AI applications are “generational.” Exhibitor WorldCast Systems deploys an AI system called SmartFM for Ecreso transmitters. It says the technology, sold via software license, enables reductions of energy consumption by up to 40%.
Director of Marketing Communications Chantal Fourgeaud said the AI qualifies the robustness of audio content; when the signal is robust enough, it adjusts transmitter power, with no impact on program coverage and audio quality. She said this dynamic RF power approach saves electricity, produces less carbon dioxide and improves service life. The system is in numerous markets, but the biggest is Germany, where approximately 800 transmitters are equipped with it.

The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, ushered in an explosion of interest by businesses seeking to incorporate large language model artificial intelligence applications into the workplace. To capitalize on efficiencies that this technology presents, many employers have implemented or are considering the use of chatbots to serve human resource functions. Such a program can meet a wide range of needs, from gathering job application information and conducting basic candidate screening to acting as an initial point of contact to answer employee questions related to topics such as employee benefits and company policies or direct users to other resources.
While few areas of the country have passed laws directly regulating artificial intelligence applications to date, introducing a human resources chatbot to the workplace still carries the potential risk of violating any number of established labor and employment laws. Over the course of 2022, federal labor and employment law stakeholders, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), published guidance addressing how artificial intelligence tools, including chatbots, can run afoul of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Thus, employers can expect conflicts between employee legal protections and artificial intelligence to draw strong interest from law enforcement agencies.
Some of the legal risks associated with chatbots may be more readily apparent than others. One issue applicable to chatbots highlighted by the EEOC’s May 12, 2022, publication, “The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees,” relates to health condition questions. The potential violations of law explained by the EEOC included that the ADA restricts an employer’s ability to conduct disability-related inquiries and medical examinations. If an employer’s chatbot directly questions a candidate or employee about his or her health condition or raises inquiries that are likely to elicit information about a health condition, such dialogue may infringe on the employee’s rights under the ADA.
Other legal risks presented through the introduction of chatbot applications may be less obvious. For example, a chatbot that is deployed as an initial point of contact to assist employees with human resources needs may be used by employees to attempt to report concerns or complaints related to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Many human resources professionals are well-familiar with the importance of a timely response to such issues to preserve invaluable defenses, among other worthy objectives.
Yet many employers have also experienced communication challenges that some employees have presented related to their unique use of emojis and slang, particularly in remote work settings that heavily rely on electronic communication. A chatbot that is not equipped to understand or redirect a potential report of misconduct using this distinct language may miss the need and opportunity to address problematic behavior. This issue highlights the importance of maintaining a human presence in human resources functions and avoiding the temptation of relying entirely on artificial intelligence for this important company department.
Additionally, risks may arise related to the information that employees communicate through a chatbot. The latest large language model chatbots utilize machine learning to improve performance over time and use. The machine learning process may rely on assimilating the information that employees submit to it and distributing it externally to expand the information available to the chatbot, thereby increasing the application’s accuracy. Companies may question what happens with that information once an employee uses it to interact with the chatbot. A business may risk losing confidentiality and trade secret protections if the information that employees communicate with the chatbot is disclosed to third parties through the machine learning process.
A chatbot application may raise other legal concerns related to the personal health information that employees may submit to it. An employee may voluntarily disclose to a chatbot the details of a health condition when seeking benefits-related information. Even assuming there is not an issue such as that discussed above with the employer soliciting information from the employee, the employer may maintain obligations to protect and retain the employee’s communication as confidential medical information. This hypothetical also presents the possibility that the employer received sufficient notice of a serious health condition supporting a need for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or a request for accommodation pursuant to the ADA. If the chatbot does not respond appropriately, the employer may face a claim of interference or denial of rights under these laws.
Employers may want to be mindful of how artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots are received by employees and communicate how and why a chatbot is being introduced. A failure to help a workforce understand the benefits of these applications and to address individual concerns may have a detrimental impact on efforts to maintain positive employee relations. Without a concerted investment in messaging strategy, an employer’s latest and greatest artificial intelligence tools may become a focus for employees to seek outside assistance to address their concerns.
These issues highlight the importance of proceeding carefully when implementing chatbot technology and understanding how the technology works to address foreseeable questions and issues that may arise. Additionally, contracts that cover the terms and conditions of third-party technology may be critical to establish the company’s rights to information and resources to defend against employee claims. Lastly, employers may want to have plans in place to closely monitor chatbot functionality to ensure compliance with labor and employment law requirements and avoid assumptions that the application works as intended when initially implemented.

<p>The <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&amp;GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search"" target=""_blank"">AI Law</a> makes it an unlawful employment practice for employers to use automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) to screen candidates and employees within New York City unless certain bias audit and notice requirements are met. </p>
<p>Following a lengthy notice and comment period and two rounds of proposed rules published in September 2022 and December 2022, on April 6, 2023 DCWP issued the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DCWP-NOA-for-Use-of-Automated-Employment-Decisionmaking-Tools-2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Final Rule</a>, which provides further guidance on the AI Law and establishes a new effective date when enforcement efforts will begin. </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The AI Law makes it unlawful for an employer or employment agency to use an AEDT to screen candidates and employees unless (1) the tool has undergone a bias audit no more than one year prior to its use, (2) a summary of the most recent bias audit is made publicly available, and (3) notice of the AEDT use and an opportunity to request an alternative selection process is provided to each candidate and employee who resides in New York City.</p>
<h3>Final Rule</h3>
<p>The Final Rule is largely similar to the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2023/01/nyc-postpones-enforcement-of-ai-bias-law-until-april-2023-and-revises-proposed-rules"" target=""_blank"">December 2022 proposed rule</a>, with some notable alterations. </p>
<p>First, the AI Law defines an &ldquo;AEDT&rdquo; as any process &ldquo;derived from <em>machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence</em>, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making&rdquo; (emphasis added). </p>
<p>Under the Final Rule, &ldquo;machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence&rdquo; is further defined as &ldquo;a group of mathematical, computer-based techniques: (i) that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an assessment of a candidate&rsquo;s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on skill sets or aptitude; and (ii) for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve the accuracy of the prediction or classification.&rdquo;   </p>
<p>This expanded definition could result in enforcement on additional, less sophisticated AEDTs used by employers, as the third requirement&mdash;&ldquo;(iii) for which the inputs and parameters are refined through cross validation or by using training and test data&rdquo;&mdash;was removed. </p>
<p>Second, under the AI Law, a &ldquo;bias audit&rdquo; is defined as an &ldquo;impartial evaluation by an independent auditor.&rdquo; The Final Rule largely maintains the minimum requirements for a bias audit first seen in the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/10/new-york-city-proposes-new-rules-to-clarify-law-on-employers-use-of-artificial-intelligence"" target=""_blank"">September 2022 </a>and December 2022 proposals, including (1) calculation of the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and a sex category and (2) comparison of such &ldquo;selection rates&rdquo; to the most selected category to determine an &ldquo;impact ratio&rdquo; using a defined formula. </p>
<p>However, the Final Rule adds a requirement that the bias audit also indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included because they fall within an unknown category and requires that the number be included in the summary of results. </p>
<p>Third, the Final Rule allows an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from calculations on impact ratio.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Final Rule clarifies that an employer or employment agency may only rely on a bias audit that uses historical data of other employers or employment agencies if (1) &ldquo;such employer or employment agency provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit&rdquo; or (2) &ldquo;such employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Historical data&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;data collected during an employer or employment agency&rsquo;s use of an AEDT to assess candidates for employment or employees for promotion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Fifth, the Final Rule states that the number of applicants in and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must be included in the published summary of results, in addition to the date of the most recent bias audit, source and explanation of the data used to conduct the audit, impact ratios for all categories, and distribution date of the AEDT.</p>
<p>Finally, DCWP announced that the Final Rule would be effective and enforcement would begin on July 5, 2023&mdash;six months after the AI Law was originally supposed to go into effect. </p>
<h3>Implications for Employers </h3>
<p>Employers should continue to monitor for DCWP updates as the enforcement date draws near. In the interim, employers should consider taking the following steps: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify whether the employer is currently using any AI tools in its hiring and promotion practices. Employment counsel should reach out to human resources and talent acquisition to identify what AI tools are currently being used in or considered for hiring and promotion processes. </li>
    <li>Determine whether use of such tools is covered by the AI Law and Final Rule&mdash;does the tool meet the statutory and regulatory definition of an AEDT, and is it being used to &ldquo;substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making&rdquo;?</li>
    <li>Assuming the tool is covered, determine whether the employer is going to engage an independent auditor to audit its data or rely on the vendor&rsquo;s independent audit. If the former, employers may wish to consider conducting the audit under privilege.</li>
    <li>If the employer will be relying on the vendor to conduct the audit, confirm with the vendor that it has engaged an independent auditor to evaluate their data and by when the audit will be completed.</li>
    <li>Develop a plan for posting the results of the bias audit, in conformance with the law&rsquo;s requirements. The plan should include the specific text that will be posted and where the audit results will be posted. </li>
    <li>Develop a compliant notice to applicants and employees that an AEDT is being used and identify where it will be posted. </li>
</ul>
<p>The AI Law may serve as a framework for other local and state legislatures across the United States, and, while the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued guidance in <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/05/eeoc-releases-guidance-on-algorithms-ai-and-disability-discrimination-in-hiring"" target=""_blank"">May 2022</a> related to the Americans with Disabilities Act and AI, more guidance from the EEOC is expected. Morgan Lewis will continue to monitor developments at the federal, state, and local levels and send out updates as appropriate.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) issued a Final Rule implementing New York City Local Law 144 (the AI Law) and announced July 5, 2023 as the new effective date for implementation and enforcement.",,,,,,,,,,

READOUT: Department of Labor gathered experts, stakeholders to ensure more inclusive hiring as automated technology affects decision-making
Assistant Secretary for Disability Employment Policy Williams offers opening remarks
WASHINGTON – The Department of Labor today hosted an online “think tank” on the use of artificial intelligence tools in hiring during which federal agencies, technology innovators, disability organizations and civil rights groups convened to explore strategies for ensuring that automated employment decision tools treat workers with disabilities and other underserved communities equally.
Many organizations now use artificial intelligence to screen job candidates, streamline the application process, monitor employee actions, and provide employee training. While its use offers employers efficiencies, AI tools must be designed with diverse users in mind to prevent workplace discrimination, including against people with disabilities. 
Hosted by the department’s Office of Disability Employment Policy’s Partnership on Employment & Accessible Technology(link is external), the four-hour event included opening remarks by Assistant Secretary for Disability Employment Policy Taryn Williams. 
“By collaborating with our cross-sector partners, we can harness the power of AI and create a robust risk management framework profile for automated employment decision tools,” said Assistant Secretary for Disability Employment Policy Taryn Williams. “Our vision includes creating a profile that guides inclusive hiring for all Americans, including people with disabilities and other underserved groups.” 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Charlotte A. Burrows and the Associate Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Info Technology Laboratory Elham Tabassi also delivered remarks.
Today’s event aligned with the commitment of the Biden-Harris administration to make certain AI-powered employment tools do not harm employment prospects for America’s workers. In October 2022, the Office of Science and Technology Policy(link is external) released its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights(link is external) to foster more equitable and inclusive digital hiring of workers with disabilities and other underserved communities. 
An ODEP-funded initiative to promote collaboration in technology and build inclusive workplaces, PEAT will issue a report on the event to promote its findings and identify action steps.

Initially, Epic is focused on using OpenAI's GPT-4 AI language model to help draft message responses from healthcare workers to patients and for use in analyzing medical records while looking for trends. Pictured is Epic's booth at the HIMSS 2023 conference. (Fierce Healthcare)
CHICAGO—Health IT giant Epic made a big splash Monday at the HIMSS 2023 conference when it announced plans to integrate generative AI into its electronic health record software.Epic is expanding its collaboration with Microsoft with a focus on combining the Azure OpenAI Service with Epic’s EHR software. The aim is to increase the productivity of physicians as well as back-office professionals.Initially, Epic is focused on using OpenAI's GPT-4 AI language model to help draft message responses from healthcare workers to patients and for use in analyzing medical records while looking for trends.""Those are just two of many use cases that we're looking at. There's a lot of general applicability to this,"" Phil Lindemann, Epic's vice president of data and analytics, said during an interview on the HIMSS23 exhibit hall floor. ""The area where we focused first was, 'How can we make physicians more efficient?'""During the COVID-19 pandemic, as the use of virtual care boomed, doctors also saw a spike in digital messages from patients ranging from requests for medication refills to more complicated medical questions, Lindemann noted.""Physicians and their teams have to be able to process those messages, and a lot of them are routine but some of them are more complex and physicians have to consume that. We are using generative AI within EHR 'in-basket' messaging to create draft responses,"" Lindemann said.The AI-enabled solution will help triage the severity of patient messages as well, he noted.RelatedHIMSS23: Epic taps Microsoft to integrate generative AI into EHRs with Stanford, UC San Diego as early adoptersUC San Diego Health and UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, are among the first organizations to begin using the solution, and Stanford Health Care is expected to add the functionality soon.The second use case for OpenAI's GPT-4 brings natural language queries and interactive data analysis to SlicerDicer, Epic's self-service reporting tool. That functionality enables clinical leaders to ""explore data in a conversational and intuitive way"" to find trends.

""Physicians might want to ask questions about the efficacy of a drug or they want to understand readmission rates. It's a way they can do on-demand reporting without having to call up IT. With GPT, we can talk like a normal conversation and it knows how to translate it into tech speak,"" he said. ""Those are the two use cases that we see as really valuable to make a physician's day more efficient by helping them with that high volume of patient messages and then the ability to analyze large sets of data.""Some researchers are concerned about how generative AI and GPT-4 will impact diagnosis and clinical decision-making. So far, most healthcare companies are focused on administrative functions and medical documentation.Lindemann said Epic's work with generative AI is guided by its principles of responsible AI. ""One aspect of that methodology is 'human in the loop.' As we roll this out, every message that's going to be generated, a human is going to review it. When we're looking through a query, where it's translating the language, someone is evaluating it against the actual code. So there has to be this transparency early on or someone is reviewing every use case, which is slow, but it's the right thing to do to be responsible with AI,"" he said.As large language models are used in healthcare, it's important to have guardrails and build trust and transparency.""We have to make sure that whenever there is an opportunity for transparency, we show that to the clinician, to the billing office, even to the scheduler. And there need to be metrics to measure success and to say AI got the answer right X percent of the time. We don't just say let it loose and let it figure it out. There has to be constant monitoring,"" Lindemann noted.He cautions that as healthcare organizations begin to pilot and test generative AI for different use cases, clinical leaders need to be diligent about how medical data are being used.""It's up to you to manage your patients' privacy and make sure your data doesn't go into someone else's hands where it's just being sold off. That's an important thing as we're in this gold rush of generative AI is to understand how the data will be used and how it's kept safe,"" he said.He noted that generative AI is at ""peak hype"" at the current moment.""I do think the way that generative AI is going to change how we all are working and interacting is substantial. When this dies down, we are going to see some enhancements that historically would have taken 10 years and now they're going to happen in a year. That's what I'm excited about. This is a significant change,"" he said.Epic is historically known for its work in electronic medical records software, but the company also has been expanding its efforts in genomics and life sciences.Last fall, the company rolled out a genomic test ordering tool within its EHR with New Orleans-based Ochsner Health as the first user.Often genetic results are received in PDF format and then scanned into the EHR. Many health systems are working with their EHR vendor partners to make ordering genetic tests and receiving results easier for clinicians. RelatedEpic launches program for clinical trial matchmaking in effort to expand access to marginalized participants""Genomics is really just the next evolution of what we think of as a medical record,"" Lindemann said. ""There are two things that we've enabled our clients to do. The first thing is, you need a place to store your genomic data so we had to build the database and the locations that store genetic material in the EHR right alongside their problems and their orders and their social determinants data. We had to make a genomically-enabled EHR first. And that's many years in the making, and that's something that our customers are implementing.""There are 40 health systems now live with that service and an additional 15 organizations are installing it, he said.Epic also developed a network to integrate with genomics labs and biotechs like Tempus to enable physicians to seamlessly order genomics tests and view results within the EHR. Physicians can now order tests and access discrete biomarkers within the patient’s electronic health record to offer personalized cancer treatment options, as one example.This gives physicians the ability to practice precision medicine directly in the EMR.Epic also launched a life sciences program last fall aimed at facilitating clinical trial matchmaking. ""We are working on integrating clinical care and research care into a single integrated experience. We've created software that allows clinical trials to run alongside clinical care in Epic,"" Lindemann said.Providers currently rely on Epic to oversee more than 100,000 studies with 4.7 million patients, according to the company. The company is stepping up its work to match participating providers with clinical trial opportunities, offer providers customized Cosmos data queries, make trials more accessible by mitigating staffing barriers, increase efficiency by minimizing repetitive tasks, connect stakeholders through one system and support clinicians with data on when patients might qualify for a trial, according to the company.""What the life sciences platform does is it helps to run clinical trials at scale. It allows someone to go in and build all of the elements for a clinical trial from an IT perspective once and pushed as a downloadable package to the sites that want to run the trial,"" he said. ""Our sites can run more trials with less of an IT footprint and quickly decide if they want to move forward with a trial. That also means that they can more quickly find opportunities for their own patients.""

They are called generative A.I. because they possess the ability to create new content, including text, images, video, audio, and many other formats.These tools, in the past three to six months, have captured the creative and marketing world’s zeitgeist. Hollywood actor Ryan Reynold’s Mint Mobile, a virtual mobile network, in January 2023, used ChatGPT to script a TV ad while AB InBev’s Beck recently used A.I. to produce a limited-edition beer and its full marketing campaign.Their rising indiscriminate use has fuelled an atmosphere of excitement as well as a fear of the machines taking over people’s jobs, and ultimately humanity like the movies.To look at it as a threat or as something that will improve your efficiency depends on the outlook of the receiver says John Paite, chief creative officer (Art &amp; Tech), Media.Monks, an international digital agency owned by Martin Sorrell's S4Capital. “I think right now no one is running out of jobs… it will create more jobs,” he says pointing to the new jobs for people skilled at doling out prompts to these generative A.I. tools.Generative A.I. has become a part of the proverbial water cooler discussions, and while there are people on both sides of the conversation, one point has taken centre stage: Everybody wants to use it once.&nbsp;“Curiosity” is what led Deepak Gopalakrishnan to try ChatGPT in the first place. He does not see it as a fad and thinks it is the start of a new era. “I wanted to get into it in the beginning and get my hands dirty just to see what it is,” he reveals. Gopalakrishnan is a freelancer who works in the digital marketing and content landscape.He uses ChatGPT4 (a paid version), and has used Midjourney, a tool which generates images from language description. He looks at them as “the starting point” which he then uses to refine and rework before presenting the outcome to clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, like him, are using these generative A.I. tools as a base on which they build their work. Media.Monk’s Paite tells us they use tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney as a kickstart for say a writer facing a mental block or when a client requests last-minute changes.Independent agency Schbang uses tools like ChatGPT; it takes the output and combines it with human expertise “to adapt the content so that it suits the brand personality and the tone of voice of the client we are catering to,” says Eva R Sachdeva, the agency’s content lead and manager.She cites the agency’s work for a skincare brand where the prompts ensured the tool generates content which is custom to the client. Here is what she fed to ChatGPT:Can you give me an outline for writing a blog on the topic '5 summer skincare tips'? It has to be from the perspective of a brand that sells skincare items in India and the point of view and tone of voice needs to be in the second person and you need to talk like a skincare expert giving these tips and selling your product to the consumer.The content which comes out is not used right away. Once the blog post — a mix of human and generative A.I. work — is ready, it is run through an A.I. detection tool like Copyleaks. “Once detected, we use Quillbot or Copy.AI, these tools will give us a paraphrased version of that particular A.I. generated content,” says Sachdeva. After all the rework, the final piece is run through a plagiarism checker before being published on the client’s website or blog.AI, ChatGPT and its ilk: boon or bane for agencies?On the other hand, Talented, a Bangalore-based creative agency is using many generative A.I. tools to, as per co-founder P.G. Aditya, “streamline a lot of processes internally while also creating new processes altogether that collaborate with A.I. as opposed to just utilising it.”Visualisers use visual A.I. models and the agency is seeing writers and strategists use it to their advantage to speed up processes. Aditya says A.I. that uses LLMs (Language learning models) have proven to be supremely useful - be it for research, bouncing ideas off of, or just using them to break down and describe visual work. “LLMs like ChatGPT and Compose.ai have proven themselves useful in cutting down work time and increasing creation time.”Talented uses GPT-powered applications like ChatGPT, Compose.ai, Tome, Gama, and Beautiful.ai. It uses visual generation AI tools, especially ones that take advantage of Stable Diffusion like Midjourney, Gen1 by Runway, Dall-E, Scribble Diffusion, and DeepAgency.An account winFor all the increased efficiency and time-saving generative A.I. offers, what is the end game for an agency – win new work? “We won two clients in the Middle East with retail store design we'd created using these A.I. tools,"" says Mahesh Murthy, founder, Pinstorm.He tells us the agency has subscriptions to several generative A.I. tools and uses them “to look into the product category and see what kind of conventional and unconventional strategies it suggests.”What is interesting, as per Murthy, is the agency’s internal rule that the employees’ strategy should be as good as the one generative A.I. suggests. “This is the starting point, and if your work doesn't come up to it…”He says ChatGPT is not good when it comes to writing advertising copy, it's good at writing body copy and content, but ""it doesn't know to write ads so I think a copywriter's job is still safe. We think it's pretty good at visualisation, you've to learn how to push it to do that. We're already using it across every single one of our clients.""When asked about Pinstorm’s clients’ response to knowing generative A.I. was being used and if it had affected revenue, says Murthy, “Clients don't pay us to use tools, they pay us for people and the hours we put in. We're still putting the same people and the number of hours.”The art of the promptLike a young pup which needs instruction to keep it and others from harm, a user needs to prompt generative A.I. to get it to do the right thing. “A lot of what A.I. promises to do is only realised when it’s prompted correctly. Much like any new piece of technology, trial and error comes is core to the process,” says Talented’s P.G. Aditya.Gopalakrishnan gave an example of how he and his wife, used ChatGPT for a presentation. “We'd given it a few situations saying this is the brand, this is the industry, this is the persona we're trying to define with the brand. it gave us a good enough starting point for us to improve on.”One may assume prompting is the next big thing to learn but it is not. It all boils down to knowing what you want and feeding it to the tool. You can keep giving it prompts and “it has the wisdom to adapt and learn from the prompts you give,” remarks Schbang’s Sachdeva.The new teacherAn interesting aspect of these tools is their ability to teach. “ChatGPT allows our junior writers to learn,” states Bonsy Mehta, Schbang’s head of content marketing, consumer centricity, and branding.She references ChatGPT and how young writers, who make errors while writing, do not have to depend only on an editor like in the old times but can use the tool to learn where they err.Where she feels ChatGPT helps the most is with the tone of voice. “It will give you the same article in the tone of a voice of a 15-year-old and a 45-year-old.” Allying fears like Pait, Mehta believes ChatGPT won't replace writers but will allow them to hone their skills more.A peek into the near futureMachines, unlike humans, can master data quicker, and therein lies their superpower. As time passes, generative A.I. tools will grow in sophistication and the first signs of this uplift come from plugins.Think of them as additions which let you customise apps, programs, and browsers. “Plugins will increase the power of ChatGPT by at least 5X,” says Jacob Joesph, vice president, Data Science at CleverTap, a customer engagement and retention platform.Companies such as Expedia, Instacart, Shopify, Slack, Wolfram, and Zapier have developed the first plugins for ChatGPT.He, for instance, tells a story about a user who wishes to cook palak paneer. Using Instacart, a grocery delivery and pick-up company, he prompts the dish he wishes to cook and the number of servings. Now, the company app/website will calculate which ingredients in what quantity are needed and will deliver them for you.&nbsp;Jacob believes every company will benefit from generative A.I. tools. Traditional mortar companies are developing online offerings and “with tools like GPT the cost of intelligence has come down.”He explains this using ChatGPT’s pricing models, “Six months back, for 1000 tokens, which is like 750 words, I had to pay four cents which three months back they brought it back to two cents, and now it is 1/10th of it with GPT 3.5.”Unlike the many flashy trends in the past eight to sixteen months, generative A.I. has fared better and is here to stay. “I feel missing this wave is like someone who's missing the digital wave that started about 10-15 years ago and this is arguably going to be even more powerful,” says Gopalakrishnan.The machines are here to stay and generate.&nbsp;Photo by Alex Knight ",,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-17T05:30:00+05:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), on 3 February, said it is “cognizant” of the emergence and proliferation of generative AI and noted that AI can be a “kinetic enabler” for growth in India.However, researchers at institutes underline a host of challenges for generative AI projects in academia, the biggest of which lie in sourcing ample data of Indic languages, the cost of such projects, and the scale of computing power needed. Indian researchers have been working on such projects for more than three years.“In academia, we’re using techniques from language models, namely the transformer architecture, for different tasks such as classification of data, answering questions, machine translation and building chatbots,” said Tapas Kumar Mishra, assistant professor of computer science engineering at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela.The transformer AI model is the underlying algorithm for generative AI tools. They can process conversational human language inputs and generative output after understanding context.While global platforms work mostly in English, Mishra said researchers under him are working on languages like Hindi, Bangla and Kannada, creating models that can take questions in these languages and generate output in English. They aren’t using OpenAI’s tools for this but have achieved “very good” scores according to the industry standard BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) test.He said NIT Rourkela has achieved scores of between 25 to 30 on Hindi to English, and 19 on Bangla to English. For reference, OpenAI’s GPT-4 model has scores of 22.9 in English to French outputs. The institute published a research paper on translations from Hindi to English last month with the Association for Computing Machinery—a US scientific educational community that publishes research work on natural language processing (NLP).NIT Rourkela isn’t the only one doing this either. Students from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras have also taken up such projects. Harish Guruprasad, assistant professor, computer science engineering at IIT Madras said that one such project includes “better translated YouTube videos in Tamil”.“Students mostly took this up to compare their own research language models with GPT-4, and eventually publish a paper on new approaches of translating videos into Indian languages,” he added. Generative AI projects have also been a part of research initiatives beyond Indic languages. For instance, Debanga Raj Neog, assistant professor, data science and AI at IIT Guwahati, said the institute is presently working on creating “affordable visual animation models that study eyes and facial movements from open-source visual databases, and use this to replicate the process.” IIT Guwahati, too, is working on a research paper on this.Professor Mausam, the founding head of Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Delhi, said that in 2022, he, along with Anoop Krishnan, associate professor, and a team of students, created a language model called ‘MatSciBert’ — specifically for the field of material science research.“The eventual goal is to discover new materials with the help of AI. A first step is to process scientific articles and extract from them knowledge about materials and their properties. We developed MatSciBert in 2022 — it is a language model skilled in reading material science papers more effectively than other generic language models like Bert. MatSciBert has been downloaded o almost 100,000 times in the last year and has been found useful for various material science tasks by numerous groups all over the world,” said Mausam, who goes by one name.The key problem for most researchers though is computing power. NIT Rourkela has 13 machines with 24GB graphic processing units (GPUs) each. Mausam noted that the scale of compute power required is “exorbitant and prohibitive”. “For instance, one training run of GPT-3 would cost $4.6 million, not accounting for any errors and re-trials during training. No academic institution or any Indian company, apart from the top tech firms, can afford training such large models regularly. Looking to train India-specific language models is therefore premature, unless we create massive compute infrastructure in the country,” IIT Delhi’s Mausam said.A senior executive, who was formerly working on government tech projects, said on condition of anonymity that there is “a lack of clarity in terms of enabling access to India’s supercomputer infrastructure owned by the Meity-backed Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC.” Mint reported in on July 6 last year, India’s supercomputing power is also well behind global systems.The executive added that while multiple top institutes, including IIT Delhi, have been consulted on using the infrastructure for their research initiatives, not much progress has taken place in this regard.Availability of data is another problem for India. For instance, NIT Rourkela uses various public datasets, such as the Samantaral database released by IIT Madras. “This consisted of low resource language pairs of Indic languages. We’re also using our own datasets by scraping newspapers and converting to various languages — and then working on that. We’re also using publicly available data, such as state government-backed local language data repositories,” said Mishra.To accelerate AI research in India, the Meity launched ‘Bhashini’ in May last year — an Indic language database that can be tapped by institutes. However, access to the scale of data needed for such projects continues to remain an issue. “When a language has a huge amount of data available, transformer architectures can produce great efficiency of translation. But, with small amounts of data, this is difficult to work with. For instance, translating from Odiya to Hindi, such models are not very efficient,” IIT Madras’ Guruprasad said.",,,Indian colleges accelerate work on Indic languages gen AI | Mint,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/', 'name': 'Business News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '4', 'item': {'name': 'Indian colleges accelerate work on Indic languages gen AI'}}]",,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept of equal pay for equal work is a cornerstone of Americans' sense of fairness in the workplace. But the rise of artificial intelligence allows some large companies to pay workers different amounts to do the same work, a new research report alleges.  The study finds that companies like Uber and Amazon, which rely on independent contractors for labor, use artificial intelligence to enact so-called ""algorithmic wage discrimination,"" similar to consumer price discrimination.  Retailers and advertisers charge consumers different prices for the same goods, based on how much they believe a person is willing to pay, which sellers glean from details like what web browser someone is using. In a similar vein, companies that use independent contractors collect detailed information on where they live, when and where they work, how much money they aim to make, and the types of jobs they're most inclined to accept or reject, according to the report's author, University of California Hastings law professor Veena Dubal.Uber drivers strike in New York City after company blocks pay increasesAmazon accused of stealing tips from delivery driversFrom rideshare drivers' perspectives, basing pay on these metrics  leads to unpredictable and variable pay, according to Dubal, who drew on  hundreds of interviews with gig workers themselves.  






Some  ride-hail drivers said the companies they work for are ""gamifying"" work,  manipulating them and forcing them to gamble just to make a living.  ""Algorithmic  wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages  for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that  the firm desires, perhaps [paying] as little as the system determines  that they may be willing to accept,"" the report reads, in part.  


Amazon spokeswoman Simeone Griffin told CBS MoneyWatch that its ""Flex"" program that lets drivers work only when they want to gives workers ""the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss."" She added that workers' earnings exceed $26 on average per hour worked.Uber did not reply to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. Workers have to ""guess"" their wages And while companies have reams of data on workers, they have little to no insight into how their pay is determined. 


""Given  the information asymmetry between workers and the firm, companies can  calculate the exact wage rates necessary to incentivize desired  behaviors, while workers can only guess as to why they make what they  do,"" the report reads. Dubal added that workers can't count on  their jobs for economic stability or security, and called companies' pay  practices ""deeply predatory."" ""It's like gambling! The house always wins,"" said Ben, one rideshare driver Dubal interviewed.

Another driver for Uber, Domingo, said he had completed 95 of the 96 trips he needed to secure a $100 bonus. Despite being located in a busy part of town, he had to wait 45 minutes to secure his final ride and earn the $100 he'd been counting on to pay for groceries. He believes Uber was baiting him to work longer.  ""It feels like the algorithm is turned against you. There was a night at the end of one of week, if felt like the algorithm was punishing me. I had 95 out of 96 rides for a $100 bonus… it was ten o'clock at night in a popular area. It took me 45 min in a popular area to get that last ride,"" he told Prof. Dubal. ""The algorithm was moving past me to get to people who weren't closer to their bonus. No way to verify that, but that's what it felt like was happening.""  Bringing your boss ""inside your head"" This close workplace monitoring effectively erases a worker's most powerful bargaining tool: The fact that, typically, only they know what wage or salary they're willing to accept for a job.  That's what is most scary about the practice, according to Dubal.  


""A source of power I have is that I know what I am willing to accept, and my employer doesn't know,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch. ""These practices remove that, because they can learn what a worker has been willing to accept in a certain context. They are getting inside your head."" She said that this kind of insight into how workers think, combined with the availability of other information like credit data, or how much a given worker might owe in rent, could lead to ""an extraordinarily controlled economy where the people in control are in the firms and no one else."" It could undo decades of social and labor movements advocating for equal pay for equal work, she added.  ""It's really scary, and this is how you get retrenchment — a rolling back of worker rights — through a new cultural sense of what's OK and what's not OK,"" she said.
