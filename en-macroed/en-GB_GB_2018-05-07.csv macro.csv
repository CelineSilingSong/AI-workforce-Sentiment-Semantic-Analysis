Fears that advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and robots will gut the labor force are overblown, according to the leader of a science and technology policy think tank.
Robert Atkinson, economist and founder of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, spoke at AAAS headquarters on May 2 about the future of AI and other technologies and their effects on the labor force. The presentation was co-hosted by the AAAS Colloquium Series, a monthly program that explores timely topics relevant to science and society, and the AAAS STEM Volunteer Program, which deploys scientists and engineers as volunteers in K-12 classrooms in the Washington, D.C., area.
Atkinson started by reassuring the audience and dismissing famous doomsayers. “You can ignore Elon Musk,” said Atkinson. “He certainly doesn’t understand AI when he says that we’re ‘summoning a demon,’” quoting the Tesla CEO’s 2014 remarks.
Even the predictions of academics – one widely cited 2013 study from Oxford University researchers estimated that 47% of jobs in the U.S. are at risk of being automated in the next 20 years – are wrong, Atkinson said.
Why are such studies off-base? Atkinson said their formulas take into account occupations with characteristics that might make automation promising without considering other practical factors. Take, for instance, an occupation that some studies predict may soon be obsolete: school bus driver. Despite the rise of self-driving vehicle technology, Atkinson argued that studies ignore a key factor. “Any of you who work with kids think that you would let your students or your kid ride on a school bus with no adults?” Atkinson asked, getting laughs from the audience.

Many occupations are hard to automate in an effective – and cost-efficient – manner, he said. Even a reasonably priced robotic grip hand, for example, is still more than 15 years away, he said. “The idea that fully intelligent machines are going to be here is like saying that just because we invented the internal combustion engine, warp drive is around the corner,” Atkinson said, paraphrasing roboticist Rodney Brooks.
We have been panicking about the effects of automation on people and the labor force for decades now, but technology-driven job change trends are nothing new, Atkinson said, citing the effects of technology on locomotive engineers – the fastest growing occupation in the United States in the 1850s, he noted – and auto mechanics. The effect of AI on the labor force is “not going to be as disruptive as some people think,” he said.
Atkinson predicts that the most important AI will have greater effects on quality of life than on the labor market. For instance, a doctor, rather than being replaced by a robot, might use AI tools for diagnostics or treatment to improve medical care, he said.
Atkinson’s predictions were not completely optimistic, however. Jobs will be eliminated, but “you won’t have a problem if you’re a lawyer,” he said. Instead, people in low-wage, low-skill jobs will be hardest hit. And even though AI technology will create new jobs, the numbers will be insufficient to replace all eliminated positions.
Some leaders in tech – including Elon Musk and Bill Gates – have suggested implementing “robot taxes” to stem the potential displacement of workers by automation, but Atkinson argued such taxes would simply slow the rate of innovation. Instead, we should have a “pro-technology” outlook that will enable us to improve productivity. “We’re going to need every ounce of productivity growth we can get out of the economy,” he said.
Atkinson offered several educational options for ensuring that workers are well-equipped to participate in a labor force that is enhanced, not replaced, by AI, including better on-the-job training for workers and exposing students early on to fields like statistics and computer science.
Reviewing the employment landscape, Atkinson noted that this era of innovation “will provide all sorts of new opportunities as we go forward.”

It’s long been the stuff of sci fi, but increasingly, the practical side of artificial intelligence (AI) is very real. On the consumer side, personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana help automate the simplest of tasks. Meanwhile, AI adoption is also accelerating within the workspace. 
According to a recent Spiceworks survey of more than 500 IT professionals, nearly a quarter of large companies have already implemented digital assistants and another 40% expect to follow suit by 2019. For small and medium businesses, that number is closer to 25%.
It’s virtually indisputable that AI (in the form of natural-language processing, machine learning, and deep learning) has tremendous potential to reduce  costs and increase productivity for the enterprise.But its true impact comes to life when combined with human ingenuity.
Just ask David Gutelius, partner and co-founder of the Data Guild, a San Francisco-based venture studio focused on AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Gutelius experienced an AI epiphany in 2006, while part of the DARPA Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes (CALO) at SRI International’s Artificial Intelligence Center in Menlo Park, CA.
DARPA’s goal was to help Army officers save time by automating some of the menial, work-related tasks that filled their day. What Gutelius and his colleagues discovered was the exponential power of AI and humans working together.
“The project really opened my eyes to what’s possible with the right mix of machines and humans,” Gutelius says. “You can do some pretty amazing things—and it’s not just about helping office workers get more done. It’s about helping individuals and teams be more effective.”
One CALO product that was especially formative used machine learning to monitor communications patterns within a community of officers. Called iLink, it “learned” who had expertise on a given subject, how that person’s expertise changed over time, and who trusted whom on a given topic. Using that information, iLink recommended who should be in a virtual room together when new issues or requests arose. It also improved the existing model of communications, which relied heavily on web-based search, redundant broadcast requests for help, and the happenstance of hallway conversations. 
That vision for the ultimate potential of AI has stuck with Gutelius and is still a key theme of much of his current work. But creating the perfect blend of human and machine power doesn’t happen by chance. Read on for a few examples of how some organizations are using AI for real benefit. 
Look for the Right Opportunities 
Healthcare IT start-up Evid Science developed a solution that uses machine learning and natural language processing to pore over hundreds of peer-reviewed articles about drugs in the trial phase. Then it pulls out the essential data points of a drug’s effectiveness, and generates “landscape” reports that compare the efficacy of different treatments. Doctors take it from there, using the AI outputs to inform care decisions. Since medical professionals are often hard pressed to read medical literature on their own time, reports like this provide critical knowledge and automatically serve up different treatment options for their patients.
Evid Science’s solution is particularly effective because it uses AI’s core strengths: performing repetitive tasks flawlessly and having a keen eye for the details. 
The real-life implications of applied AI are significant: It would take a doctor up to a year to finish reading a report that Evid Science can complete 500 times faster, without the interruptions. Having access to that intelligence could be revolutionary in providing patients with more effective, evidence-based care.
Solve, Measure, and Expand
AI has also proven useful in HR, as companies look for ways to streamline their screening and hiring, and develop more effective methods of attracting and retaining talent. 
For example, ADP DataCloud provides HR professionals with insights and predictive analytics about the performance of individual teams and their company overall. Using customer and third-party data, ADP generates and disseminates reports, and flags concerns such as a team experiencing particularly high turnover, or a star employee whose pay rate is lower than the market rate. ADP DataCloud also calls out reports that other HR professionals have found useful and, over time, learns each customer’s preferences and adjusts accordingly.
ADP DataCloud demonstrates AI’s ability to learn, adjust,and optimize, which is key in amplifying the intelligence and effectiveness of individuals and teams.   
In summing up the effectiveness of ADP DataCloud, ADP Chief Data Scientist Marc Rind says the “insights it generates can provide HR professionals with a better sense of what conversations need to take place, and with whom. It makes them better managers, and better humans.”
Accessible AI to Speed up Operations 
AI has clearly become more accessible to organizations: low-cost tools, for example, can help implement AI directly into workflows to speed up operations. Other tools can help automate business processes—taking orders, applying sales discounts, soliciting feedback, managing procurement, tracking content approvals, and more—without a single line of code, complex formulas, or help from IT.
Companies like Disney and Whole Foods, for example, are building and implementing intelligent chatbots into their workflows to streamline repetitive, manual tasks that can increase time savings and productivity. 
Whether you’re planning to go big, or just test the AI waters, Gutelius offers this parting advice:“Start with defining and deconstructing the problem, and develop a culture of experimentation and measurement so that you can learn what works and what doesn’t.“
For another example how businesses are using next-gen tools to speed up operations, read how Colliers International used automation to reduce a key business process from 6 months to a week.

There is no question some jobs will be lost. But others will be created, and still others will morph into something different — bot designer, bot supervisor, soother of the most irate customers. In some cases, AI will just take on extra work nobody wants to do.   In one example of the latter, First National Bank of Wynne in Arkansas has been using robotic process automation, the lowest-IQ form of AI, to help with acquisitions.“When you acquire a bank, one of the biggest cost expenses is the core conversion piece,” explained Bart Green, senior vice president.  All customer and account information, including for cards, internet banking and cash management, has to be migrated to the acquiring bank’s core system. It is time-consuming. A consultant told them about RPA software from EnableSoft called Foxtrot. Other providers of RPA software include Blue Prism, UiPath and WorkFusion.

   RPA software can be set up to perform tasks the way a human would — it can log into software by entering a username and password, it can click on a client record, then log into another piece of software, locate a data field and copy and paste that data into the first page. It can be set up so you can watch it on a desktop, and it looks as if a ghost were operating the computer. “You could teach it, just like you would teach an employee, how to input information into systems, and it can do it efficiently and quickly,” Green said. It’s better at reporting errors and validating data. Using the software has saved the bank 70% in conversion costs, he said.Now the bank is beginning to find other uses for the software. “It’s a matter of thinking of what kinds of manual, time-consuming processes do we have today and how can we automate them?” Green said. For instance, the bank recently had to mass reissue debit cards due to a breach. That could be done by bots. The RPA software has not affected jobs so far at the bank because it is being used for one-off, time-consuming projects like mergers, Green said. “I’ve yet to put it in place to replace a daily duty,” he said. “I can see that occurring. I’m just beginning to start peeling away the layers of that possibility.”He could also see hiring someone in IT who has experience with RPA software to help figure out new uses for it. “It may end up canceling out jobs — you’re creating a job that does this task to remove the task required by another employee,” Green noted. What jobs will be lost, gained?Some bankers and observers have suggested that only the boring parts of jobs, drudgery like data entry and filling out forms, will disappear so the humans will be able to focus on more interesting tasks, and that no actual jobs will be lost. Bank employees themselves seem to think this. In an Accenture survey released last week of 1,300 nonexecutive bank employees, 67% said they believe AI will improve their work-life balance, and 57% expect it will expand their career prospects.     But Autonomous Research also issued a report last week that estimated that in the U.S. alone, 2.5 million financial services employees will be “exposed” to AI technologies in the front, middle and back office — 1.2 million working in banking and lending, 460,000 in investment management, and 865,000 in insurance.“These functions will see 20-40% productivity gains, or unemployment, depending on your vantage point,” the report stated. About $1 trillion in costs will be exposed to AI transformation in financial services sectors by 2030, according to the report; $450 million of this would in banking.In banking, 70% of front-office jobs will be dislocated by AI, the researchers say: 485,000 tellers, 219,000 customer service representatives, and 174,000 loan interviewers and clerks. They will be replaced by chatbots, voice assistants and automated authentication and biometric technology. And 96,000 financial managers and 13,000 compliance officers will be laid off as AI-based anti-money-laundering, anti-fraud, compliance and monitoring software fills in. Another 250,000 loan officers will lose their jobs to AI-based credit underwriting and smart contracts technology.However, Accenture’s study last week of AI’s impact on jobs in financial services presented a rosier job picture. It concluded that there will be a net gain in jobs among companies that deploy AI wisely, of 14%; they will also increase revenues by 34% by 2022.One source of new revenue will be automated advice that helps people do things like save more or invest more lucratively, the way Netflix and Amazon recommend movies and products. This could lead to wallet consolidation and cross-sales.“There will be roles that AI will eliminate,” said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture and head of the company’s banking practice. “But we do think that deployed properly it will create opportunities as well.”For instance, banks that use AI software to generate suspicious activity reports will most likely create new jobs around explaining AI to regulators.“The regulators are not going to be big advocates of black box decision-making that is not easily explained,” McIntyre noted. Where will entry-level jobs exist?As teller, AML, and other jobs become automated by RPA and AI, where will people right out of school or people with disabilities find entry-level jobs?“It’s a difficult question,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous. “This is a question that has to go to the heart of every CEO of a large financial firm that hires AI software to replace human jobs, and it goes on the shoulders of the founders and developers that are building the software. If you have created real structural unemployment by building out successful software, you have to think about your employees as stakeholders in the project.” McIntyre suggested the entry-level jobs will now be in technology.“One can see the way digital-native companies are hiring people out of college with programming capability,” he said. “I do think the idea of starting as a teller and working your way to CEO is troubled.”What about people who are not good at math, science and programming? “There still will be roles where human empathy and the ability to connect are important,” McIntyre said. If someone has $100,000 to invest, for instance, an app might be able to suggest an asset allocation. But if it is an inheritance from a parent who just died, the interaction will take some sympathy.“Those types of conversations will require people to have a high [emotional quotient], to be able to read and react to people and guide the conversation,” McIntyre said. Which has a higher EQ — human or bot?Not everyone believes that humans are better at emotional work, like dealing with a sad or irate customer. Sokolin argued that AI systems are good at emotional labor. He pointed to the debt-collection fintech TrueAccord, whose AI engine handles collections work for banks and card issuers. “All they do is emotional labor, and they’re much better at it than people who call you during dinner,” he said. Ohad Samet, CEO of TrueAccord, said technology is good at avoiding tense situations in a way that humans are not.“People in the collections industry like to say that people collect from people, but the reality is that collectors are human and subject to human biases: they get angry, they get tired,"" he said. ""If the person in debt is abusive on the phone, which is not uncommon, they have an emotional response. The software is not subject to that,"" Samet said. ""It uses the best channel, the best content, the best offer at the right time, and it doesn’t get offended or misbehave if somebody yells at it or writes something nasty back, which happens.” And the software does have some empathy built in. Though using AI requires fewer human collectors, Samet pointed out that such jobs are little fun and pay badly. And customers do not want to talk to human collections agents anyway. “The world is changing,” he said. “We’re not the ones making that change. The preferences of consumers are changing the collections industry.”TrueAccord is an example of some of the new jobs being created by AI. It has a growing customer engagement team, who help people who call in or email. Some employees write the content the chatbots present. Others are data scientists who work to tune the experience to the needs of consumers.Chatbot backlashA few banks have introduced chatbots to do work that might otherwise be done by customer service people. Bank of America’s erica is one example. USAA’s Alexa skill is another.There has also been some chatbot controversy and backlash. There was Microsoft’s Tay, which spewed racist nonsense to customers. The fintech startup Digit, which offers automated saving and credit card debt paydown, no longer makes a chatbot the primary means of interacting with its app. For the simple tasks Digit customers do, it did not seem to be the right approach.Sokolin noted that different tools make sense for different purposes. To obtain an account balance, a simple login and tap is logical. Opening Facebook Messenger and asking it is not. Like many bankers, Green has hesitated to deploy a customer-facing chatbot, comparing this to replacing a front-desk receptionist with an electronic menu that has to be navigated.“You may still get the results you need, but the question will be, how well will AI differentiate the party on the other line’s emotional feelings on their problem?” he said. “If the customer is upset, happy, or excited, how will AI be able to accommodate that situation? It’s impressive to see Amazon Echo understand different dialects, but will it be able to understand emotional aspects of that conversation?”Green said there is also reputational risk. “If a person makes a mistake, you can fire them,” he said. “If the AI keeps making mistakes, you have a huge reputational risk that’s hard to overcome. Are you going to fire your AI?”Partly for these reasons, some banks are making chatbot technology available to their employees, to help them be more efficient. For instance, Morgan Stanley has equipped its financial advisers with AI software that sifts through client data and records to help suggest recommendations. Retraining the workforceAccenture’s survey of bankers found that only 3% are investing in retraining their workers to prepare them for the AI-riddled workplace. McIntyre said this is because the technology is still new and banks are just testing the use of AI in areas like trading, lending, and customer service; they are not yet looking at the bigger picture. Banks need to help employees make the transition to AI, Sokolin said. They might implement software that enables blue-collar workers to be programmers with the use of visual tools, for instance.Colleges may need to do more to prepare people for AI. Royal Bank of Canada has called for a national review of college programs to ensure they place more of a focus on “human skills” like active listening, critical thinking and social perceptiveness.The bank’s research has found these skills will help position future workers to complement increasingly pervasive technologies like robots and machines, rather than compete with them.Sokolin is less worried about the younger generation than the older generation that might have a harder time shifting to AI-assisted work and who have more at stake with high debt and low savings. “It becomes a fairly anxious picture,” he said. “That is the responsibility of the employer. People have to raise their hand and say we’ll do something to fix or soften it.” Executives safe for nowBank executives’ jobs appear to be safe from AI for now. Vendors are not suggesting their software can do C-suite work. And AI is bad at context switching, according to Sokolin. “Today AI is very narrow,” he said. “You pick a direction you want it to hammer. You teach it the outcome you want, and it can generally create that outcome.”An executive might use a spreadsheet for a little while, then manage a relationship, then run a business development meeting, then deal with an upset client whose LLC is going bankrupt.“All these things require a lot of different skill sets,” Sokolin said. “In today’s institutions at the senior management levels, there’s a lot of that type of context switching.”But as AI gets more broadly adopted, managing people will take different skill sets at the senior level. And an interesting question may become: If you’re managing fewer people and more bots, what does that do to your power base in an organization?Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback at penny.crosman@sourcemedia.com.

      Unfortunately for the intrepid astronauts in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001, a Space Odyssey, the HAL 9000 computer knows how to read lips.

Almost everyone knows the story of HAL 9000, the killer supercomputer in Stanley Kubrick’s landmark film 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose 50th anniversary will be celebrated on May 12, 2018 at the 71st Cannes Film Festival. In an intriguing scheduling coincidence, IBM, Kubrick’s partner during the filming of A Space Odyssey, and Airbus have just unveiled the CIMON (Crew Interactive Mobile Companion) project, an “intelligent, mobile and interactive astronaut assistance system” that will join the International Space Station.
These two events propel us into a debate over the risks created by the development of superintelligence that could eliminate jobs on a massive scale or, even worse, wipe the human species off the face of the planet – and raise the question of how to assess such a threat.
To date, we have no experience of accidents or disasters due to faulty or malicious AI. However, the imaginations of artists and scientists are a treasure trove of material that tells the story of superintelligence freed from any human control.



A story of AI going wrong
2001: A Space Odyssey is a forerunner of contemporary controversies. It tells the story of the struggle and eventual conquest of a human being, the only survivor of a methodical programme of extermination led by a sentient supercomputer.
Aboard the spaceship Discovery One, only the supercomputer HAL 9000 has been informed by its creators of the purpose of the mission: to reach Jupiter and search for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence. Although considered to be infallible, HAL makes an error. The machine refuses to admit this, and, caught out, it claims that the mistake is due to “human error”. In principle the humans are the computer’s designers but, if it is to be believed, could it in fact be the computer itself? Adopting this line of reasoning, the machine gives itself a status that crew members could not imagine – that of a living, sentient and thinking being.
For the crew, HAL’s error is unacceptable. There is no room for forgiveness or charity: error may be human, but it is not machine. There is no appeal: HAL must be taken out of service. The supercomputer, omnipresent and omniscient, immediately discovers the project designed to end its life. To survive and complete its mission, it decides to eliminate the crew. Only one human survives, Astronaut David Bowman, and he resumes, with even more determination, the digital homicide mission.
Bowman succeeds in penetrating the core of the unit and then mechanically, emotionlessly and almost ceremoniously disconnects, one by one, the machine’s memory circuits from their housing. Like a child caught with its hand in the cookie jar, the computer tries, by talking about itself, to derail the lobotomy. In a final attempt, it sings a song it learned in its first hours of “life”, but nothing works, and finally its voice fades away.



AI that can talk about itself
Much more than the story of a fight to the death, one of the treasures of the film is that is considers the narrative dimension of AI. It’s able not only to make up stories about itself, but also can fail due to circumstances and its own errors. Thus, the elimination of the crew is not the result of HAL 9000 becoming autonomous, but from a “bad story” that the machine tells itself, that of believing that the crew could compromise the mission.
Kubrick’s work thus makes it possible to conceive the risks caused by superintelligence not in terms of technical domination, but as the construction of an imperfect narrative identity. Although reality is still far from catching up with fiction, some initial findings in this area are worth thinking about.

In 2016, a novel titled The Day a Computer Writes a Novel… Almost won a Japanese literary prize, the Nikkei Hoshi Shinichi. It was prewritten by an AI research team from the University of Hakodate, whose work initially consisted of selecting words and sentences, then defining parameters that allowed a program to “write” the novel. Of more than 1,450 submissions for the prize, 11 had been written, at least in part, by a non-human. Of course, the jury knew nothing about the “authors”.
The following year, in the same spirit but without a digital co-author, Zack Thoutt, a fan of the TV series Game of Thrones, used a neural network fed with over 5,000 pages of text from the books on which it was based to predict what might happen next in the story. The result is far from equal to the work of author George R. Martin, but the text is, for the most part, understandable and the predictions are similar to some of the theories that are popular with fans of the series.
More recently, a program designed by MIT’s Media Lab – baptised “Shelley” after Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus – created terrifying tales, designed to scare. The first stage was to train the program with stories written by humans taken from a database of over 140,000 references. In the second stage, the computer generated its own works that it improved by collaborating with humans who responded to its messages via Twitter.
And in the domain of reading and understanding stories, Google has just launched its “Talk to book” service that allows users to converse in natural language with an automatic learning algorithm that is supposed to help them in their future reading choices.

Stories that evoke the risks of AI
If, like HAL 9000, AI computers try to write stories, they are still far from reaching the standards set by human authors. Although no one can predict with certainty what artificial superintelligence might look like, it remains possible to imagine it by producing stories that stimulate our thinking.
The historian Yuval Noah Harari undertook the task, imagining a future where the automation of machines would cause the disappearance of the majority of jobs. He argued that humans risk losing their economic value because intelligence will be decoupled from consciousness. While intelligence is necessary to drive a car or diagnose a disease, consciousness and subjective human experiences are not mandatory.
Even more alarmist, the philosopher Nick Bostrom puts forward the idea that humans will probably not have the opportunity to experience this disastrous revolution because it is likely they will be exterminated as soon as artificial superintelligence appears.



Both Harari and Bostrom base their conclusions on a reduction of action to its functional dimension, judged solely in terms of effectiveness. But such a vision neglects whole areas of human existence. To remedy this, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio argues that life represents a complex act in which feelings are the expression of a permanent struggle to achieve a balance that underpins human existence. For Damasio, without subjectivity there is no creativity, and without the emotions that are manifest in the relationships between the body and the brain to perceive reality, there is no humanity.
Accepting this relegates Kubrick to the rank of a genius whose prophecy, albeit poetic, is unrealistic. It also means admitting that an AI computer will never be able to redefine its own mission at the expense of its creators. And finally, we must take very seriously the idea that the main risk to humanity is a cyberwar initiated by humans themselves – a conflict populated by drones and killer robots supported by swarms of computer viruses that all smarter than the others…

H&M is good at making amazing frocks for the Met ball, but it’s less good at making money: The company’s profits for the first quarter of this year were down 69 percent, and it effectively ran out of cash in 2017. Cue the “pivot” headlines!
The latest pitch from the fast-fashion retailer, covered as a “pivot” in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, uses lots of trendy buzzwords like A.I. and big data. The general idea is that by “using algorithms to analyze store receipts, returns and loyalty-card data,” H&M will be able to “tailor merchandise in each store to local tastes, rather than take a cookie-cutter approach.”

What the algorithms need to do is curate a store, and that is something they are not good at.

Stripped of its techno buzzwords, this is the old idea of localization, as laid out in a 2006 Harvard Business Review article by Vijay Vishwanath and Darrell K. Rigby. “The era of standardization is ending,” they wrote. “Smart retailers and consumer goods companies are starting to customize their offerings,” as part of a broader move “from standardization to localization.”

This is a formula that can work. Look at Waterstones, in the U.K., a bookseller that faces just as much competition from Amazon as Barnes & Noble does in the U.S. But while B&N is struggling, Waterstones is thriving. The difference: B&N is trying to compete by offering wine and big windows; Waterstones, by contrast, brought in a dusty old-fashioned book guy, James Daunt, whose first order of business was to empower store managers and give them almost total freedom in terms of which books they displayed where. No two stores would look or feel the same; all of them would reflect local tastes and mores. In 2017, its profits soared 80 percent from the year before.

Unfortunately for H&M, this sort of localization is very, very hard to automate. Computers are good at maximizing things: They can order more of what your customers want and less of what they don’t want. But you don’t need sophisticated A.I. algorithms for that. Any old point-of-sale software can tell you what’s selling. What the algos need to do is curate a store, and that is something they are not good at.

Daphne Howland, a contributing editor at Retail Dive, uses the example of a shopper who buys two jars of imported French honey every year—honey almost no one else wants. If she’s an important customer, or if the fact you stock that honey makes her love your store and keeps her coming back even when she isn’t buying it, then it makes sense to keep on carrying that honey. That’s the kind of decision that humans can make easily but that A.I. still finds very difficult.

Localization is a real thing and has been for as long as there have been shops: Shopkeepers know their customers and stock what those customers want. The difficulty comes when it’s attempted by global chains like H&M that rely on huge economies of scale and the ability to distribute identical goods to thousands of stores around the world. The bigger that a chain becomes, the more its sales are going to be a function of its global brand, rather than its idiosyncratic local stock keeping decisions. A.I. is not going to change that.
In the long run, local retail, imbued with deep local knowledge, is actually very well placed to thrive in a connected digital economy. Despite the rise of Amazon, most shopping is local and always will be. And for all of big data’s power, there’s something deeply inefficient about companies like Amazon or Unilever shipping razor blades hundreds of miles to my door, when they’re easily available at the drugstore across the street. This is why I’m reasonably confident that in the not-too-distant future, we will all have apps to which we can just say “deliver me some ice,” or “shit, we’re out of toothpaste,” or even “there’s no way I’m walking out the door in my same clothes from last night”—and the nearest, most convenient source of whatever you’re looking for will be able to get it delivered to you quickly.
In other words, local retail has the ability to disrupt Amazon more than Amazon has the ability to disrupt local retail. The “retail apocalypse” is not a function of Amazon, it’s a function of America having built vastly more retail square footage per person than any other country in the world. In shopping malls, a lot of that retail is doomed. But in neighborhoods, retail will always be profitable at a reasonable rent. Which means that big chains like H&M—or Sears, or Best Buy—probably don’t have too many pivots left in them.

A portion of ""The Alchymist, In Search of the Philosopher’s Stone, Discovers Phosphorus, and prays for the successful Conclusion of his operation, as was the custom of the Ancient Chymical Astrologers,"" by Joseph Wright of Derby, now in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, U.K.

A prominent researcher of machine learning and artificial intelligence is arguing that his field has strayed out of the bounds of science and engineering and into ""alchemy."" And he's offering a route back.Ali Rahimi, who works on AI for Google, said he thinks his field has made amazing progress, but suggested there's something rotten in the way it's developed. In machine learning, a computer ""learns"" via a process of trial and error. The problem in a talk presented at an A.I. conference is that researchers who work in the field — when a computer ""learns"" due to a process of trial and error — not only don't understand exactly how their algorithms learn, but they don't understand how the techniques they're using to build those algorithms work either, Rahimi suggested in a talk presented at an AI conference covered recently by Matthew Hutson for Science magazine.Back in 2017, Rahimi sounded the alarm on the mystical side of artificial intelligence: ""We produce stunningly impressive results,"" he wrote in a blog. ""Self-driving cars seem to be around the corner; artificial intelligence tags faces in photos, transcribes voicemails, translates documents and feeds us ads. Billion-dollar companies are built on machine learning. In many ways, we're in a better spot than we were 10 years ago. In some ways, we're in a worse spot."" [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures]Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksApple Recommends Blinkist, The Best App For Intellectuals Around The WorldBlinkist MagazineUndoRahimi, as Hutson reported, showed that many machine-learning algorithms contain tacked-on features that are essentially useless, and that many algorithms work better when those features are stripped away. Other algorithms are fundamentally broken and work only because of a thick crust of ad-hoc fixes piled on top of the original program.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceThis is, at least in part, the result of a field that's gotten used to a kind of random, trial-and-error methodology, Rahimi argued in that blog. Under this process, researchers don't understand at all why one attempt at solving a problem worked and another failed. People implement and share techniques that they don't remotely understand.Here's the complete painting. (Image credit: Public Domain)Folks who follow AI might be reminded of the ""black box"" problem, Hutson noted in his article — the tendency of AI programs to solve problems in ways that their human creators don't understand. But the current issue is different: Researchers not only don't understand their AI programs' problem-solving techniques, Rahimi said, but they don't understand the techniques they used to build those programs in the first place either. In other words, the field is more like alchemy than a modern system of research, he said.""There's a place for alchemy. Alchemy worked,"" Rahimi wrote.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""Alchemists invented metallurgy, ways to make medication, dy[e]ing techniques for textiles, and our modern glass-making processes. Then again, alchemists also believed they could transmute base metals into gold and that leeches were a fine way to cure diseases.""In his more recent talk (and accompanying paper) at the International Conference on Learning Representations in Vancouver, Canada, Rahimi and several colleagues proposed a number of methods and protocols that could move machine learning beyond the world of alchemy. Among them: evaluating new algorithms in terms of their constituent parts, deleting parts of them one at a time and testing if the overall programs still work, and performing basic ""sanity tests"" on the results that the algorithms produce.That's all because AI, Rahimi argued in his 2017 blog, has become too important in society to be developed in such a slapdash fashion.""If you're building photo-sharing services, alchemy is fine,"" he wrote. ""But we're now building systems that govern health care and our participation in civil debate. I would like to live in a world whose systems are built on rigorous, reliable, verifiable knowledge and not on alchemy.""Originally published on Live Science.

								White House announces creation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence							

								The committee, made up of federal research and development leaders, will serve to ""improve the coordination of Federal efforts related to AI to ensure continued U.S. leadership in this field.""

Watch out China — the Trump administration has its own plans to dominate development of artificial intelligence.
As the latest indication of this, the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence during an organized AI summit of industry and academic partners Thursday.
“As artificial intelligence transforms everything from agriculture to manufacturing to transportation, the potential for AI remains breathtaking,” Michael Kratsios, deputy CTO at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in his remarks at the event. “But we cannot be passive. To realize the full potential of AI for the American people, it will require the combined efforts of industry, academia, and government.”
The new committee, likewise, holds a mission “to improve the coordination of Federal efforts related to AI to ensure continued U.S. leadership in this field.” It will operate within the technology committee at the National Science and Technology Council, and will be made up of “the most senior R&D officials” from across the federal government.

According to the charter of the committee, these include the undersecretary of commerce for standards and technology from the Department of Commerce, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering at the Department of Defense, the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the undersecretary of energy for science within the Department of Energy, the director of the National Science Foundation, and the director of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency. The committee will be chaired by OSTP and will also include representatives from the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council.
The select committee will work toward its mission of enabling U.S. leadership in the development of AI in a number of ways, including by helping to define interagency AI research and development goals, coordinate agency R&D plans and encourage further agency initiatives (including in partnership with industry and academia).
During his wide-ranging speech Thursday, Kratsios spoke about the administration’s commitment to investing in AI as a key component of Trump’s R&D budget request for 2019. He mentioned how the President’s Management Agenda calls for the increased use of automation software within the federal government. And he addressed the evergreen concern that accompanies conversations about AI — job loss.
“To a certain degree job displacement is inevitable,” Kratsios said. “But we can’t sit idle, hoping eventually the market will sort it out. We must do what Americans have always done: adapt.”
The Trump administration’s commitment to science and technology education, he said, is part of its plan to adapt. OSTP, Kratsios added, will release a five-year strategic plan on STEM education efforts later this year. The creation of that plan is being led by the office’s assistant
director for STEM education, Dr. Jeff Weld.

“Our continued leadership in the field that American researchers pioneered is not just a request; it is an imperative,” Kratsios said. “It is an imperative because of the potential benefits to American industry, to the American worker, and to the American people.”

2016 marked the year that the enterprise world began to wake up to the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Just two years ago, AI software programs were writing full movie screenplays, predicting the Kentucky Derby and beating video game world champions – and the technological breakthroughs did not stop there. Since then businesses, including many Fortune 500 companies, have started to grapple with what AI can do for their business and operations.
As they experiment, a clear pattern is emerging: anything which is a repeatable process can and will be taken over by AI and machine learning (ML). If you decide to extrapolate these technologies, then all normal processes will be automated, and the job of humans will be relegated to handling the complex exceptions. For example, a recent Harvard Business Review article highlighted how Stitch Fix, an online clothing subscription service, uses a machine learning engine to help make personalized recommendations for customers. Automating data collection and routine processes for employees increases productivity, helps to handle complex requests and allows greater focus on connecting with clients – which ultimately lets businesses better allocate their resources and boost profitability.
At this point neither the technology nor the details of its implementation are standing in the way of leveraging AI and ML. Instead, there are five factors that you should keep in mind while using new technology to scale the growth of an organization: the ability to imagine, the willingness to change, the rethinking of product design, the mastering of the art of partnering and, finally, the ability to view AI as a paradigm for business change.











 
 
 
1. Unleash the imagination of your workforce
The challenges of utilizing AI and ML do not lie within the technology, but rather in determining the most effective use cases. How do we enable each person in the organization to think big and imagine what the future will be like – and place him/herself in this picture? What is blocking this imagination? One of the culprits is hierarchical organizational structures that inadvertently shape the mindsets of employees and narrow their thinking. The creation and nurturing of communities within will enable talent and creativity to cross silos and break down barriers.

2. Overcome the willingness to change
It is counterproductive to push intelligent technologies upon an entire organization all at once. Instead, work with your employees to find the balance between investment in AI and ML technologies and maintaining the existing business. Employees are far more willing to master new technologies when they understand that these technologies won’t be taking their job. There is a misconception that AI and ML technologies will replace people. Rather, intelligent technologies are implemented to handle the routine processes with precision and allow employees to focus on the more complex, human aspects of their jobs.
Redesign business processes from end to end, instead of using a piecemeal approach. Doing this will highlight the importance of the human factor in context with AI/ML and will unleash a new set of human talents that machines are currently unable to match – creativity, interpersonal communication and empathy. In turn, this will lead to the creation of new value, new jobs and higher-level responsibilities.











 
 
 
3. Rethink existing product design and architecture patterns
Technologists have been designing deterministic systems for decades. Software products and systems are designed based on clarity of inputs and outputs, and systems can now ascertain how to deal with data through self-learning algorithms. The art no longer lies in how to build systems with clear rules and logic, rather new skills will be required to build systems that constantly learn as more data is thrown at them. This will fundamentally reboot software development paradigms – like requirement analysis design and testing – regardless if it’s done agile or waterfall.
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are also changing. Data architectures will come to the forefront, as customizing packaged software to model the processes of an organization will no longer be required. AI, combined with the rapid creation of apps, will relegate ERP systems into operating engines. Companies shifting their business processes to take advantage of new business models and emerging markets will seek out intelligent technologies to ensure a smooth ERP transition.
4. Master the art of scouting & partnering
Working with providers and technology platforms will undergo a significant change as we leave the realm of deterministic systems. Organizations will have to learn to rely on their providers now that part of the AI solutions are embedded in their offerings. The discussion will move away from which partner delivers the best quality to whether a partner can be trusted to run AI ethically and competently within a business process. AI startups have sprung up like mushrooms – each having a narrow focus, lack of real investment capital and access to the enterprise market. This is a huge matchmaking opportunity for procurement departments to sharpen their axes in the skill of creating partnerships. It will be important for enterprises to understand that partnering involves contracting for co-creation, joint success and sharing of the joint intellectual property created, so that they do not fall behind at the enterprise level.











 
 
 
5. View AI as a paradigm for business design
As the use cases of AI explode, organizations cannot afford to wait for the industry to show what is possible and the days of aiming to be the fast follower are over. Yet, the pressure to act will depend heavily on the competitiveness of the industry segment and the merging of industry segments. Manufacturing companies are tracking finance and retail companies using marketing AI tools and insurance companies are adopting manufacturing paradigms, like Digital Twins, to predict the risk of the assets they insure. AI should be seen not only as the means to improve operations, but rather to fundamentally change the way that an organization makes its revenue. AI and ML have the power to redefine value chains globally. Market leaders should look at AI as a means of defending their market position, while others should use AI to reposition themselves during the disintegration of the value chain. Employee talent, adoption of the technology, business design and potential partnerships will further drive the acceptance of AI. These factors, along with ultimately viewing AI as a core part of your business strategy will be a crucial in deciding when and how to implement intelligent technologies.
This will not be an easy task. Intelligent technology expectations and returns remain unclear and will require the extrapolation of data and algorithms to solidify product ideas and investments. The complexity of the technology and its implementation should not be considered a critical factor that stands in the way of leveraging AI and ML. Keep in mind the five tips detailed above, and you will better find success while using the new technologies to grow your organization.

And when scientists measured where a rat was located when grid cells fired, those spots — called ""firing fields"" — formed a hexagonal pattern.This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.They don't work alone; grid cells operate with other brain cells to help us keep our bearings.For instance, ""place cells"" activate when a mammal occupies a specific location, and ""head direction cells"" — unsurprisingly — fire when its head points in a specific direction.This internal navigation system evolved in mammals over tens of millions of years. Could an artificial system be trained to do the same?From mammal to machineTo find out, the DeepMind team started with a neural network: a series of algorithms inspired by the brain, said University of Queensland computational neuroscientist Geoffrey Goodhill, who was not involved in the study.What are neural networks?Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligenceThey comprise computing systems inspired by the way the brain processes informationInformation moves through a series of connected layers of algorithms called nodesThe more layers, the ""deeper"" the networkNeural networks are trained by feeding them many examples of the task we want them to learnThe network adjusts the strength of the connections between the nodes until it learns to extract important informationEventually, the neural network becomes adept at that particular task""We know the brain learns by changing strengths of connections between neurons,"" Professor Goodhill said.""These algorithms are based on the idea of changing connection strengths.""Over the past few years, DeepMind has unveiled headline-grabbing computer programs which rely on neural networks.AlphaGo played the board game Go so well it trounced professional players. It was blitzed by its successor, AlphaGo Zero, which won 100 games to zero.But even AlphaGo Zero was no match for what came next — AlphaZero. With less than a day of training, AlphaZero beat world-champion programs in chess, the Japanese game of shogi and Go.While DeepMind states that brain research can benefit from artificial intelligence, ""up to now, its work hasn't really fed back into helping understand neuroscience,"" Professor Goodhill said.""But that's what this paper starts to do.""The DeepMind team trained a neural network to navigate a virtual 2.2 by 2.2-metre environment with what's called ""path integration"", which adds distance and direction to track location.Mammals commonly use path integration. It doesn't rely on landmarks, so it's a great way to get around in the dark — like navigating the path from bed to the toilet in the middle of the night.After being trained, the DeepMind neural network developed ""grid units"", which fired in a hexagonal pattern — just like grid cells found in our brain.They weren't deliberately programmed to arise.The DeepMind team retrained their network 100 times. Grid cells emerged each time.Grid cells help calculate shortcutsSo, DeepMind had a network with grid cells. Could they use it to create a program that could navigate unfamiliar environments and calculate a direct route from A to B?To test this, they incorporated the grid-cell network into a larger system designed to navigate virtual environments.Their ""artificial agent"" received velocity information and images of its surrounds, like a real animal.When the artificial agent was let loose in a virtual environment, it was able to adjust its route to take a shortcut, even in unfamiliar regions.This skill is called ""vector-based navigation"".This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.Remove the grid cells from the neural network, and the artificial agent struggled to get around efficiently.The work supports the idea that grid cells in the brain are important to plan and calculate a path, even if you've not been there before.""We have found evidence that the function of grid cells may extend far beyond solely giving us a GPS-like localisation signal,"" said Dharshan Kumaran, DeepMind researcher and study co-author.""Grid cells might also constitute a core component of the navigational guidance system [like satnav] that the brain relies upon, to calculate the shortest path between A and B.""More AI insights to comeFinding brain-like features in a trained neural network isn't new, Professor Goodhill said.""You often find in these networks that there will be internal representations similar to the internal representations you find in the brain,"" he said.One example is neural networks that process and categorise images.""In the visual part of the brain, you have cells which respond to oriented edges,"" Professor Goodhill said.""You also find these in artificial networks trained in image processing.""What's new here is it's the first time people have done it with grid cells.""And according to Professor Goodhill, it's just the start of artificial intelligence providing new insights into the workings of the human brain.""More things will emerge about our own biology. I think there's a lot of potential there,"" he said.""It's exciting to see this integration between artificial [intelligence] and neuroscience.""Posted 9 May 20189 May 2018Wed 9 May 2018 at 3:29pm, updated 9 May 20189 May 2018Wed 9 May 2018 at 3:42pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesHow Google's new AI can teach itself to beat you at the most complex gamesGoogle buys AI company after big robotics, home devices acquisitionsWhat is artificial intelligence?More on:Academic ResearchBrain and Nervous SystemComputer ScienceEngineeringNeuroscienceRoboticsScience and TechnologyTop StoriesHow politics, engagement bait and money opened up a firehose of falsehoods after Trump's shootingJudge tosses Trump documents case, ruling prosecutor unlawfully appointedWe came for the spectacle of a Trump rally.
