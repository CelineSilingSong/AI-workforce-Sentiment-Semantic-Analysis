Although generative AI is not  new as a concept, it is only since late 2022 when ChatGPT launched, that the technology has hit the mainstream. The sophistication and accessibility of ChatGPT and its successor GPT-4, as well as that of DALL-E (which is for images) and Google’s Bard, have created both excitement and fear around its potential uses – and misuses.
Some commentators believe that generative AI will revolutionise work and society in ways that we’re unprepared for or cannot yet imagine; some predictions even verge on apocalyptic. Others recognise the enormous potential of generative AI but believe that its development and impact on business will follow a pattern similar to all other transformational technologies: there will be a period of hype during which the possibilities are thought to be endless, but the hype will subside and people will become more realistic about the potential and the limitations of the technology.
Generative AI in its current form – impressively sophisticated and accessible to all – is only in its infancy and its full potential is still not fully understood. But setting expectations for its impact and planning accordingly is something that all business leaders should be thinking about. Will generative AI fundamentally change business operations and workforce requirements? Two experts have their say.
Generative AI has great potential, but it is ultimately just another tool in the toolbox






                    Andy Sturrock 

                    Chief technology officer, Atom Bank 


Generative AI has been overhyped, but I’m not sure that it’s been more overhyped than any other technology. The Gartner hype cycle is revealing. You see so many technologies go through that hype curve: a piece of tech is introduced, there’s minimal interest at first, then it catches on and people start to think it’s going to solve all of their problems. But eventually the hype cools and the technology is regarded as just another useful tool.
In this way almost all technology with transformational potential will be overhyped. So is generative AI more overhyped than any other technology relative to its potential? I’m not sure. 
Generative AI won’t replace workforces en masse and it won’t be the final destination. There will be a ‘next thing’
I do think there’s a greater sense, especially among the less technical people in organisations, that generative AI will be some kind of ‘magic-bullet’ solution. By this I mean people have the tendency to think this is a tool that can solve all their problems relating to efficiency and they won’t need as many people. For generative AI, this thinking likely stems from the fact that the technology is accessible to almost everyone and that many of the analogies we use to talk about it – that computers are ‘thinking’ or ‘learning’ – create an element of science fiction.
In reality, generative AI has not been, and is unlikely to become, a magic-bullet solution. For another example of the hype cycle, consider how the market for cloud services developed: at one time people thought that storing all of your data in the cloud meant that you wouldn’t need to have backups and you wouldn’t have to employ infrastructure engineers. But it just hasn’t happened that way. You do still need backups and you do still need infrastructure engineers; it’s just that rather than doing cabling they’re now doing infrastructure as code.
With any major technological advance, stretching further back than even the cotton loom, there is often the worry that huge swathes of the workforce will be replaced, but they never are. People don’t become obsolete; skills become obsolete. With the cotton loom, with the internet, with the cloud, we have never needed fewer people. Instead, we need people with different skills to do jobs that didn’t exist before.
This is not to say that generative AI doesn’t have huge potential and that it won’t have a profound impact on businesses. The cloud was overhyped in its early days, but it has been incredibly beneficial. I would never go back to cabling and installing physical hardware. Similarly, generative AI will undoubtedly have major impacts on organisations and workforces. But it is not a magic bullet. It won’t replace workforces en masse and it won’t be the final destination in technological advancement. There will be a ‘next thing’ and generative AI will become just another tool in the toolbox.





In the long term, the impact of generative AI on business and society is understated






                    Amit Walia 

                    Chief executive, Informatica 


Although generative AI has been overhyped in the near term, the long-term potential of the technology within the business landscape and the impact it will have on organisations is massively understated. 
Every major industry will be faced with significant changes to both business operations and the workforce because of generative AI. And while the uses we’ve seen so far are primarily early examples of experimentation, firms in areas such as retail, financial services, oil and gas, consumer goods and healthcare are finding more sophisticated applications. 
It’s here that data quality, governance and effective AI guardrails will need to be further developed. Many organisations and tech leaders are unprepared for this challenge.
Most organisations are unprepared for the risks and will face massive challenges if they don’t act quickly
Leaders need guidance on how best to experiment, pilot and adopt generative AI ethically, and ensure the quality and privacy of data. Our annual global study of 600 data leaders found that two in five generative AI adopters cite data quality as the main obstacle to adoption, followed by data privacy and governance, and AI ethics.
Before unleashing AI-powered innovation and making it easily accessible to such a variety of public and private sector decision-makers (available to everyone, really), leaders need to tackle uncertainty around how to harness its power. This will include answering questions about how to structure input data, ensure processes are in place to protect the data being stored and processed, and avoid undesirable AI-generated outputs that could lead to disastrous consequences.
The first step of strong AI governance is to ensure you can trust the data powering the models. Put it another way, generative AI has brought data accuracy to a tipping point.
Take an example from the healthcare industry. To ensure the veracity of AI outputs in the context of patient treatment and monitoring, we need trustworthy and accurate patient information. Just one mistake in managing that data can have dangerous consequences. Data needs to be accurate, complete, consistent, timely, valid and unique long before it can be used to power a generative AI application.
Concerns around adapting processes are one thing, but the real risk is in using AI without the proper safeguards in place. Most organisations are unprepared for these risks and will face massive challenges if they don’t act quickly. The smartest companies will make sure their data is ready for generative AI before jumping in. They’ll double down on AI governance, ethics and data accuracy, embedding these into AI systems from the start.

No job is more important than educating young minds, and no AI will ever replace a great teacher. However, educators are already using generative AI to help with creative tasks or automate routine aspects of their work. This frees up more time for the really important jobs, like spending time with students.


With generative AI poised to transform every profession, understanding the impact it will have on our day-to-day working lives, the opportunities it creates for innovation and improvement, and, of course, the potential risks is critical for everyone.

So, I thought it would be a good idea to put together a series of quick guides to how different jobs and professions will likely change, starting with teaching.

Here, I‘ll overview some of how generative AI is already being used to augment the irreplaceable human skills needed in education. We’ll also take a peek into the future to think about how the fundamental role of the teacher will evolve thanks to the impact of this technology.

PROMOTED
Augmenting Teaching Skills
In late 2023, the UK government examined how generative AI is being used in education through a call for evidence.
After speaking to teachers, they found that most reported that they were already using generative AI tools in their jobs or had experimented with them. Those who used them said that benefits included saving time, improving the quality of their teaching, and improving engagement with students.

· Language learning and translating – Enabling teachers to communicate more effectively with multi-lingual classes.
Generative AI isn’t without risks, though. Inaccurate responses, inappropriate content, and bias can all clearly cause big problems when they occur in an educational setting. While I believe teachers and educators should be encouraged to experiment with the technology, these are risks that have to be kept in mind.
Personalized Learning 
This is one of the most exciting potential use cases for generative AI in education.
Children (and students of all ages) all learn differently, and with generative AI, it will be possible to create individualized lessons and learning plans. These could be tailor-made to fit the needs of specific students.
For example, students who show they are better at taking in information visually can be shown more pictures, charts, and graphs, while others may learn better from puzzles, tasks, and games.
Online course providers such as Coursera already use feedback algorithms to adjust course content and learning speed based on performance. In the near future, I expect to see this extended to traditional classroom-based learning, too.
Generative AI can also provide personalized feedback more frequently and in greater detail than a teacher can manually when dealing with a large class.
AI can be a particularly valuable resource for providing for learners with special educational needs. Teachers will use AI to augment their own ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different teaching and learning methods.
It also has huge potential to help “lifelong learners” – those members of the workforce who are consistently updating their knowledge and learning new skills to take on new challenges and responsibilities.
Learners in this group can come with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, so generative AI can be used to identify the best teaching strategies.
However, this is one education-related field where privacy and security will be particularly critical. Algorithms like those described here would require personal and very sensitive data, and great care will have to be taken to mitigate the risks of data breaches or loss.
Automating Routine Work
Most teachers prefer to spend more time working in direct contact with students and less time on tasks like grading papers or drafting routine communications.
Good news! These are exactly the type of tasks that generative AI can be very good at. There are already several platforms on the market offering specialized generative tools to help teachers with these jobs, including Teachermatic and Microsoft’s Education Copilot.
These can accelerate repetitive but vital tasks like writing letters and emails to pupils or their families, creating class newsletters, summarizing reports and producing documents like policy and risk assessment materials.
Grading papers might be a more controversial use case, particularly as we know that generative AI can sometimes have accuracy issues. At the moment, this is mostly in an experimental phase, with teachers testing its capabilities but not yet using it to assign final grades.
Other popular uses that are relevant in teaching include transcribing text from video-based learning materials or converting text into voice for audio-based learning, proofreading teaching materials, and creating compliance checklists for tasks such as safeguarding or data protection.
The Changing Role Of Teachers
As generative AI reshapes the world of education, teachers will find their role evolving further away from being providers of knowledge and towards becoming learning facilitators.
Perhaps the most significant shift in the role of educators will be an increased focus on nurturing skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. These skills will be paramount in a future where our worth is increasingly measured by our ability to perform tasks that machines cannot do or are not as proficient in. Beyond academic teaching, educators play a critical role in safeguarding the welfare of their students, a responsibility that extends far beyond the confines of traditional teaching. This involves not only protecting students from physical harm but also supporting their emotional and mental health, ensuring a safe and inclusive learning environment that fosters resilience and respect. The human touch provided by teachers becomes an indispensable pillar of education, emphasizing the irreplaceable value of empathy and understanding in nurturing well-rounded, emotionally secure individuals.
Teachers will, of course, also have a very important role to play in making sure their students are able to use generative AI itself. For decades, essential technology skills like coding, word processing, or computer-aided design have been an essential part of the curriculum. Very soon, a basic grasp of interacting with AI systems will be critical from a young age, too, and today’s teachers will have the job of passing on that knowledge.
This shift will require educators to become proficient not just in their subject matter or field of education but also in navigating the tools and technologies that are already rewriting the rules of teaching and learning.

                Generative AI may have a ‘high human cost,’ SHRM report says
            
As job roles change, reductions in force will likely be necessary, but so will learning and development opportunities, the report said.

In the decade ahead, CHROs and their colleagues will need to navigate several disruptions due to increasing adoption of generative AI in the workplace, according to a report from the Society for Human Resource Management and The Burning Glass Institute.
And those challenges will be most notable at companies in three industries, SHRM said: finance and insurance; professional services; and information systems.
These changes could come at a “a high human cost,” the report said, though such costs may be temporary. “If your company sits in a highly exposed industry or has functions composed of at-risk roles, generative AI will be especially disruptive,” the report authors wrote.

Because many roles will shift, reskilling will become increasingly important, especially as job roles and skill sets transform, according to the report. For instance, traditional customer service roles may pivot to focus on managing chatbots or overseeing automated processes. Data analysts may transition to become AI data specialists. In many of these cases, training may be necessary.
Additionally, “in light of the so-called digital divide in Americans’ access to technology, the potential exists for harmful effects to your organization’s inclusion, equity and diversity (IE&D) efforts,” they wrote; leaders will have to perform assessments to guide workforce planning.
Generative AI will also affect HR functions in a number of areas, according to the report:
Talent acquisition: In the short-term, recruiting AI talent will be difficult. In the long-term, though, leaders will face changing difficulty in filling various roles.
Labor force: Headcounts will shift away from tasks that have been automated and toward AI-augmented responsibilities. 
Learning and development: Leaders will need to invest in reskilling existing talent to fill AI roles, as well as train workers in eliminated positions to assume other roles.
Compensation: Salaries will need to adjust to changes in the labor market, particularly the roles that incorporate AI-related skills.
Diversity, equity and inclusion implications: CHROs will need to ensure that displacement doesn’t disproportionately affect underrepresented groups and that new opportunities are accessible to a diverse pool of talent. Although it may feel tempting to use AI for HR practices such as sourcing new hires, generative AI tools may replicate existing biases and work against diversity, equity and inclusion goals.

“Despite the best efforts of savvy HR leaders, workforce reductions will become increasingly pressing as generative AI transforms the macroeconomic landscape,” the report authors wrote. “HR leaders must remember that layoffs are not the only downsizing option available; more subtle strategies, such as implementing hiring freezes and leveraging natural attrition, can be deployed to minimize disruption to employees.”
By 2032, generative AI will significantly change half of all jobs, according to research by Cognizant and Oxford Economics. As a result, 9% of the current U.S. workforce may be displaced, and 1% of those workers may struggle to find new employment.
Between 2010-2019, AI usage — through tools such as language processing, image recognition and algorithm-based recommendations — spurred some job growth, according to a report by the European Central Bank. However, the jury is still out on whether the same will happen with new AI-related developments, the researchers wrote.
According to an Indeed report, all jobs posted on the site, ranging from truck drivers to software engineers, have skills that can be augmented or replaced by AI. At the same time, only 1 in 5 is considered “highly exposed” to the technology, where AI could perform 80% or more of the skills listed in the job posting.
In particular, mid-career professionals and managers appear to be most at risk for AI disruption, according to another Indeed report. Roughly 1 in 8 mid-career professionals work in management, which also faces high exposure, where AI could perform 68% of the required skills listed in job postings.

Across all disciplines norms are being established around the role of generative AI in research. Discussing a recent LSE Impact Blogpost on academic responses to AI, Eric A. Jensen suggests that clear, practical guidance needs to be developed by specific research associations and institutions.

Large language models (LLMs) have already altered the landscape of academic research. In a recent blogpost for Fast Track Impact alongside colleagues, I summarised a few of the practical ways we have started to use generative AI to boost our efficiency and effectiveness in tasks ranging from research communication, to funding applications, survey design and data analysis. There is now a nascent body of academic literature that highlights opportunities and critiques of using generative AI (GenAI) in contemporary research and the decisions being taken now will shape how this technology is used in the future.
Conducted in the summer of 2023, the survey found that 51.5% said ‘Yes’ to the question, ‘Do you use generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) for work-related purposes?’.
The initial public reaction to GenAI in academia has skewed negative. This is understandable. These tools come with the usual ethical baggage of Big Tech, connotations of plagiarism, highly questionable use of the intellectual property and many other legitimate concerns. In a recent blogpost for the LSE Impact Blog and research paper (Generative AI and the Automating of Academia) Richard Watermeyer, Donna Lanclos and Lawrie Phipps make a valuable contribution outlining potential sociological implications of GenAI’s integration into academic professional life. Reporting the results of an online survey of UK academics they express concern that GenAI tools will further embed the malignant neoliberal managerialism that has infected UK academia (and beyond). Conducted in the summer of 2023, the survey found that 51.5% said ‘Yes’ to the question, ‘Do you use generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) for work-related purposes?’. While there is no way to know if this is a representative finding given the convenience sampling used, it highlights the impact GenAI is now having on academic life.
The survey records positive and negative views from respondents, although the authors interpret this evidence in a largely negative way arguing GenAI:
“further contracts academics’ engagement with critical thinking and contemplative labour […]. In deluding academics of the merits of its productive efficiencies G[en]AI may become a weapon of some considerable self-harm”.
and
“In accelerating already hyper-stimulated work regimes in universities, generative AI may exacerbate an epidemic of burn out among academics and cause them to leave their roles in even greater numbers than are already reported”.
However, this evidence could just as easily run in the opposite direction and the claim could be made that GenAI can reduce academic burnout. The full dataset for this survey has not been made publicly available, but even selected quotations include a suggestion that GenAI tools can reduce workload pressure, for example, “It takes some of the pain out of admin”. Moreover, the finding that “83% of respondents stated that they anticipated using [GenAI] tools more in the future” suggests that UK academics feel these tools are useful.
These views of GenAI can be contrasted with optimistic accounts, such as those of Salah et al., who see potential for improving social science data collection and analysis. This viewpoint emphasises how GenAI can deliver superior research processes or outcomes in specific domains, such as textual analysis and developing analysis categories for qualitative data. In this instance because of the efficiency of GenAI tools, the expectation is that they will become ever more central to research. GenAI optimists tend to see the ethical, justice, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, methodological and theoretical issues raised by GenAI use as significant, but manageable, and they tend not to comment on the sociological implications beyond the potential for job losses. Among GenAI ‘cautious optimists’ there is a recognition that clear ethical guidelines must be established, along with institutional regulations, to limit the use of these tools in order to mitigate risks and potential harms.
Claims to moral purity based on avoiding GenAI tools are dubious at best.
Both optimistic and pessimistic accounts of GenAI’s evolving role in academic research acknowledge that the practical benefits of these tools are driving their use. I have seen these benefits in my own professional experience, including enabling me to rapidly re-size and re-shape my academic research outputs for different audiences and uses (e.g., shifting from a journal article to a conference presentation). With new tools, there is a tendency to only focus on risk. For some, this is a way of avoiding the need to learn new, unfamiliar ways of doing things. Change can be uncomfortable, and claiming to be resisting the adoption of new tools to maintain moral purity can be an effective short-term tactic to stave off the inevitable.
Claims to moral purity based on avoiding GenAI tools are dubious at best. Anybody who has ever accepted a suggested change from an automated spelling or grammar check in Microsoft Word already has some experience with using an AI tool to improve their work. Would it really make sense to invest the extra time or resources in further iterations of proofreading so that you could avoid using an automated spelling or grammar check?
Similarly, Watermeyer et al. introduce a somewhat paternalistic concern that “enthusiasm for generative AI as an efficiency aid, obfuscates the tasks that academics should remain focused on”. This seems to ignore the fact that academics will always have finite time available to distribute to varied responsibilities. Even in a utopian scenario, scarce attention and intellectual effort would still need to be allocated between competing needs. Drawing on tools to efficiently address basic tasks should be viewed as a positive, regardless of the level of neoliberal managerialism in an academic system.
Is it ethically justifiable to waste time doing that same work much more slowly when that may mean giving less attention to more important matters?
There are opportunity costs, ethical issues and risks that come with the decision to shun a new, useful tool that could improve productivity and research quality. Working slowly and inefficiently can be an indulgent luxury. While, we all wish to see more realistic workload models, there is nothing inherently praiseworthy about ‘slowing down’ academic work by disconnecting it from real-world developments. Working time is limited, so every decision about where to invest effort is a trade-off between competing needs and priorities. Readily available GenAI tools such as ChatGPT can speed up a task such as converting a research article into a draft slide deck or converting a reference list to the correct citation style. Is it ethically justifiable to waste time doing that same work much more slowly when that may mean giving less attention to more important matters? Such ethical issues are not discussed because the status quo is taken for granted. Professionals will have to weigh up the costs, risks and benefits for themselves when choosing to use or reject any platform or tool.
Waiting to engage with the practicalities of how best to use GenAI tools until all risks and concerns have been ironed out to everyone’s satisfaction is a poor solution. Let’s consider instead: What are these GenAI tools good for, and what are they not good for? Which GenAI research uses are ethically acceptable and unacceptable, and why? These are the kinds of questions that move us forward towards a balanced adoption of a useful set of tools. It is crucial for professional research associations to promptly address this issue and offer clear, public guidance. The sooner this is done, the better for the entire research community.

Problem is not speed of work, but for the social sciences, ChatGTP is good at writing passable text. So students using it learn far less, [including about how to write well] and instructors have to fail them for plagiarism if they are caught. This has been going on since late 2022, and is totally different to other less clever tools that have been used for ages. Universities are unsure what to do. As for articles and PhDs, a ‘no AI was used’ statement should be signed and appended or appear in a footnote. That could be considered in hiring and promotions, too, as a plus point. Who wants to hire a faculty member with a productive-looking cv if the papers were written in large measure by a computer? I am not sure many  STEM trained academics would be willing to sign such statements, looking around the disciplines and the bland literature reviews heavily assisted by AI that already appear at the beginning of some  papers. Its use in engineering seems particularly high.

PérezMadrid - FEB 09, 2024 - 10:46 ESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkThe labor market will be entering uncharted territory in the coming years. Although technological progress has traditionally been a double-edged sword for employment — while improving production, it forces transformations in the workforce — artificial intelligence and its immediate impact on all sectors of the economy will push things forward fast, prompting an accelerated rethinking of a paradigm shift that threatens to leave behind anyone unable to adapt in time. The responsibility for ensuring that this doesn’t happen lies with governments, which have several tasks ahead of them: to correctly analyze the current situation; to review, if necessary, the statistical sources from which they draw the reports that they use to make projections; and to demonstrate a willingness to collaborate with the private sector in pursuit of a common good. These are the main conclusions of a study by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman that seeks to address these future challenges.“In this technological revolution, workers will have less time to adapt than in previous ones. [It] will take hold more quickly and, therefore, the workforce will have less room to maneuver and adapt,” reads the report authored by Pablo Campos, Gonzalo Arana, Tomás Sánchez and Jaime Gervás.Along with this imminent labor transformation, there will be another transformation of the social sphere, which will go hand in hand with the progressive aging of the workforce. This will result, on the one hand, in an increase in the total payroll — workers with longer careers have better conditions and more experience — and, on the other, in an increase in the age of the customer base of businesses. “This will have an impact on the size of the sectors, as there will be less demand for products and services for young people (toys, nightlife) and more demand for products and services aimed at the elderly (elderly care, insurance),” the study claims.The pairing of demographics with labor is nothing new, but the progressive increase in the retirement age and the increasingly late entry of younger workers into the job market will further increase generational tensions. “The unemployment and wage gaps between sectors are unmistakable indicators of the labor market’s difficulties in adjusting. It is therefore essential to implement mechanisms that reduce friction within the domestic labor market,” the report states.All these currents of change are symptomatic of a general transformation that is yet to come, and whose final horizon will depend on the answer to the following question: what will the jobs of the future be like? According to the study’s various predictions, “work in the future will be more flexible, with more roles in human and care services… As a consequence of the evolution of new technologies, the demand for skills related to disruptive technologies will increase, the role of the employee as a ‘computer substitute’ (data collector and analyst) will be replaced by the role of the employee as ‘computer complement’ (team management, message transmission, emotion management), and will evolve toward a more human and assistive role.”At the same time, the report makes clear that some of the remote-work formulas implemented in recent years — mostly as a result of the pandemic — will become an essential base-line requirement for workers. “Society has become accustomed to more flexible ways of working, giving rise to telecommuting, greater adaptability of working hours and digital communication. These trends will become established in the coming years, and it is even foreseeable that support for shortening the week to four days to favor work conciliation will increase,” stresses the text.Financial stabilityGovernments will play the dominant role in managing this transition. And this management will have to be carried out on different time scales. To this end, the Oliver Wyman report suggests various actions be taken at different times. In the short term, the authors of the study suggest “simplifying and promoting the hiring of foreigners in sectors with low employment and a shortage of talent, eliminating obstacles in the processing of visas and residence permits”; in the short to medium term, “creating a body to coordinate between the private sector, educational institutions and the government in the promotion and identification of talent”; in the medium term, “support employee training or requalification for skills demanded by companies”; and in the long term, “revise existing educational opportunities (university and vocational training) in line with the demands of the domestic private sector to avoid brain drain.”The economic umbrella is essential for the implementation of all these actions, especially those focused on the long term. For this reason, the report emphasizes the importance of “financial stability” and the collaboration between political parties necessary to foster it. “One possible solution to the demands of ideological and financial stability is the promotion of independent institutions similar to an Institute for the Future of Work, managed by independent administrators and dependent on public-private partnerships,” the study concludes.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Although technological progress has traditionally been a double-edged sword for employment — while improving production, it forces transformations in the workforce — artificial intelligence and its immediate impact on all sectors of the economy will push things forward fast, prompting an accelerated rethinking of a paradigm shift that threatens to leave behind anyone unable to adapt in time. The responsibility for ensuring that this doesn’t happen lies with governments, which have several tasks ahead of them: to correctly analyze the current situation; to review, if necessary, the statistical sources from which they draw the reports that they use to make projections; and to demonstrate a willingness to collaborate with the private sector in pursuit of a common good. These are the main conclusions of a study by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman that seeks to address these future challenges. “In this technological revolution, workers will have less time to adapt than in previous ones. [It] will take hold more quickly and, therefore, the workforce will have less room to maneuver and adapt,” reads the report authored by Pablo Campos, Gonzalo Arana, Tomás Sánchez and Jaime Gervás. Along with this imminent labor transformation, there will be another transformation of the social sphere, which will go hand in hand with the progressive aging of the workforce. This will result, on the one hand, in an increase in the total payroll — workers with longer careers have better conditions and more experience — and, on the other, in an increase in the age of the customer base of businesses. “This will have an impact on the size of the sectors, as there will be less demand for products and services for young people (toys, nightlife) and more demand for products and services aimed at the elderly (elderly care, insurance),” the study claims. The pairing of demographics with labor is nothing new, but the progressive increase in the retirement age and the increasingly late entry of younger workers into the job market will further increase generational tensions. “The unemployment and wage gaps between sectors are unmistakable indicators of the labor market’s difficulties in adjusting. It is therefore essential to implement mechanisms that reduce friction within the domestic labor market,” the report states. All these currents of change are symptomatic of a general transformation that is yet to come, and whose final horizon will depend on the answer to the following question: what will the jobs of the future be like? According to the study’s various predictions, “work in the future will be more flexible, with more roles in human and care services… As a consequence of the evolution of new technologies, the demand for skills related to disruptive technologies will increase, the role of the employee as a ‘computer substitute’ (data collector and analyst) will be replaced by the role of the employee as ‘computer complement’ (team management, message transmission, emotion management), and will evolve toward a more human and assistive role.” At the same time, the report makes clear that some of the remote-work formulas implemented in recent years — mostly as a result of the pandemic — will become an essential base-line requirement for workers. “Society has become accustomed to more flexible ways of working, giving rise to telecommuting, greater adaptability of working hours and digital communication. These trends will become established in the coming years, and it is even foreseeable that support for shortening the week to four days to favor work conciliation will increase,” stresses the text. Governments will play the dominant role in managing this transition. And this management will have to be carried out on different time scales. To this end, the Oliver Wyman report suggests various actions be taken at different times. In the short term, the authors of the study suggest “simplifying and promoting the hiring of foreigners in sectors with low employment and a shortage of talent, eliminating obstacles in the processing of visas and residence permits”; in the short to medium term, “creating a body to coordinate between the private sector, educational institutions and the government in the promotion and identification of talent”; in the medium term, “support employee training or requalification for skills demanded by companies”; and in the long term, “revise existing educational opportunities (university and vocational training) in line with the demands of the domestic private sector to avoid brain drain.” The economic umbrella is essential for the implementation of all these actions, especially those focused on the long term. For this reason, the report emphasizes the importance of “financial stability” and the collaboration between political parties necessary to foster it. “One possible solution to the demands of ideological and financial stability is the promotion of independent institutions similar to an Institute for the Future of Work, managed by independent administrators and dependent on public-private partnerships,” the study concludes.

As technology has evolved, so too has the accounting profession. From paper-based processes to cloud-based software, accountants are no strangers to change. No previous advancement, however, has had the potential to alter accounting (and many other industries) quite like generative artificial intelligence. But for those who embrace AI, there is a strategic opportunity to capitalize on its many benefits while protecting and even uplifting the irreplaceable human connection.

  A successful human-AI partnership



 
Because the accounting profession is traditionally compliance-focused, it is particularly prone to AI disruption. Clearly, there are opportunities for AI to reduce the time accountants spend on mundane, repetitive tasks. This enables a shift toward higher-value activities that are built on meaningful interpersonal relationships – like advisory services.
While the integration of AI in accounting processes holds immense potential for efficiency and accuracy, it also raises ethical considerations that demand careful navigation. Let’s take a look at what we can expect from AI in the near future, and the precautions accounting firms should take to ensure accuracy, trust, and data security.
What is generative AI?
At a high level, AI combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, and audio.
Many industries are employing generative AI to handle tasks like drafting marketing copy, emails or blogs, as well as implementing chatbots for customer service and generating code for app development.
The transformative impact of AI in accounting
Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the accounting landscape by transforming traditional workflow processes. While this sweeping transformation can create uncertainty, understanding how it will change the accounting profession and the opportunities it presents can help accounting firms not only adapt, but thrive.
One of the most significant contributions of AI is in the automation of routine workflow activities like data entry, invoice processing, and reconciliation. These tasks can now be accomplished swiftly and accurately by AI systems.
Further, AI enhances the accuracy of financial reporting by reducing the risk of human error. Complex algorithms can analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and detect anomalies that might go unnoticed by the human eye. This not only ensures more precise financial statements but also improves decision-making as it is backed by real-time insights.
How can accounting firms leverage AI?
Here are a few ways accounting firms can leverage AI in their businesses:

Client communications. Use generative AI to create a first draft of client emails or newsletters which you can then modify for accuracy and personal insight.
Client support. Employ AI-powered chatbots to provide anytime client service and support.
Audit automation. Perform audits more efficiently and accurately by relying on AI to quickly process large amounts of data, gain insight from the wider audit community, and automatically detect discrepancies or other anomalies in financial records.
Compliance. With predictive analytics, AI can flag potential tax or non-compliance risks, provide recommendations to avoid legal ramifications, and predict violations before they occur.
Tax research and planning. Keep up with ever-changing tax laws and regulations and explore different tax planning scenarios for clients with AI-powered tools.
Training. Use AI for in-depth industry research, insight into the latest trends, and to help analyze the tax landscape.

Ethical considerations in the human-AI partnership
The human-AI partnership holds immense promise for efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. However, firms must prioritize ethical considerations to ensure they protect themselves and their clients.
While AI shines in processing large volumes of data, staff members should play a pivotal role in validating AI-generated outputs, cross-referencing information, and verifying the overall reliability of the results. Firms must ensure the information gleaned from AI systems is transparent, free from biases, and does not compromise the integrity of financial information.
Further, to protect sensitive financial information from unauthorized access and cyber threats, consider implementing advanced encryption techniques, security protocols, and invest in cybersecurity training. Because AI systems may inadvertently replicate content from external sources, firms should also consider implementing plagiarism detection tools to ensure that financial reports and analyses are original and comply with ethical standards.
By striking the right balance, firms can capitalize on AI’s benefits while upholding the integrity and ethical standards that define the accounting profession.
A successful human-AI partnership
The dynamics of the human-AI partnership in accounting are all about harnessing AI’s benefits while upholding ethical standards and leveraging the irreplaceable human expertise.
While AI systems can process vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, they lack the nuanced understanding, intuition, personal experience, and ethical judgment of the human mind. Recognizing this, firms must strike a balance between leveraging AI for its computational power and uplifting the all-important human connection to clients.
Integrating AI into your accounting firm is not about replacing human beings but rather unleashing their unique capabilities. By letting AI handle routine and repetitive tasks, you can free up your staff to focus on experience-based analysis, strategic decision-making, and client relationships.

Artificial intelligence helps predict whether antidepressants will work in patients

In patients with major depression disorder, it is now possible to predict within a week whether an antidepressant will work thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI). With the help of an AI algorithm, a brain scan and an individual's clinical information, researchers from Amsterdam UMC and Radboudumc could see up to 8 weeks faster whether or not the medication would work. The results of this study are published today in the American Journal of Psychiatry.




""This is important news for patients. Normally, it takes 6 to 8 weeks before it is known whether an antidepressant will work,"" says Professor of Neuroradiology at Amsterdam UMC, Liesbeth Reneman.
The research team analyzed whether they could predict the effect of the antidepressant sertraline, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States and Europe. In a previous study conducted in the United States, MRI scans and clinical data were administered to 229 patients with major depression before and after a week of treatment with sertraline or placebo. The Amsterdam researchers then developed and applied an algorithm to this data to investigate whether they could predict the treatment response to sertraline.
This analysis showed that 1/3 of patients would respond to the drug and in 2/3 not. ""With this method, we can already prevent 2/3 of the number of 'erroneous' prescriptions of sertraline and thus offer better quality of care for the patient. Because the drug also has side effects,"" says Reneman.
The right drug, much faster
""The algorithm suggested that blood flow in the anterior cingulate cortex, the area of brain involved in emotion regulation, would be predictive of the efficacy of the drug. And at the second measurement, a week after the start, the severity of their symptoms turned out to be additionally predictive"" says Eric Ruhé, psychiatrist at Radboudumc.




In the future, this new method may help to better tailor sertraline treatment to the individual patient. Currently, there is no exact prediction tool. The patient is given the medication and after 6 to 8 weeks—in practice often up to several months—it is checked whether the medication works.
If the symptoms do not subside, the patient is given another antidepressant, and this process can repeat itself several times. This standard method often takes weeks, if not months. It also saves society costs, because as long as the patient continues to suffer from serious depressive symptoms, he or she cannot fully participate in society.
In one in three depressed patients, there is still no improvement in the symptoms after several treatment steps. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a solution that allows a faster determination of the effectiveness of antidepressants in severe depression. In the coming period, the researchers will improve the algorithm by adding extra information.

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Feb 7, 2024, 2:00 PM ESTShare this story3 Comments / 3 NewHere’s how to opt-out where you can, and fight back where you can’t. Samar Haddad / The VergeAI-generated imagery feels inescapable. It’s in the video games you play, in the movies you watch, and has flooded social media platforms. It’s even been used to promote the physical hardware that real, human artists use to create digital paintings and illustrations, to the immense frustration of those who already feel displaced by the technology. The pervasive nature of it seems especially egregious to creators who are fighting to stop their works from being used, without consent or compensation, to improve the very thing that threatens to disrupt their careers and livelihoods. The data pools that go into training generative AI models often contain images that are indiscriminately scraped from the internet, and some AI image generator tools allow users to upload reference images they want to imitate. Many creative professionals need to advertise their work via social media and online portfolios, so simply taking everything offline isn’t a viable solution. And a lack of legal clarity around AI technology has created something of a Wild-West environment that’s difficult to resist. Difficult, but not impossible.While the tools are often complicated and time consuming, several AI companies provide creators with ways to opt their work out of training. And for visual artists who want broader protections there are tools like Glaze and Kin.Art, which make the works useless for training. Here’s how to navigate the best solutions we’ve found so far.Opting OutGenerative AI models depend on training datasets, and the companies behind them are motivated to avoid restricting those potential data pools. So while they often do allow artists to opt their work out, the process can be crude and labor intensive — especially if you have a sizable catalog of work. Opting out typically requires submitting a request to an AI provider, either via a dedicated form or directly via email, along with the copies and written descriptions of images you want to protect. Additionally, if you’ve agreed to let third parties license your images, the terms may include a license for AI training. It’s worth scanning the user agreements for any platforms hosting your work to check what rights they hold over it. But different AI tools’ policies vary — here’s how to opt out of some popular ones.OpenAI DALL-EOpenAI started allowing creators to remove their work from its training data alongside its DALL-E 3 generative AI model last September, and it’s one of the easier processes to follow. Content creators or owners just need to submit a form to OpenAI to request that the work be excluded from future training datasets, including a copy of the image, a description of it, and a ticked checkbox confirming that you have the rights for said image.Unfortunately, you’ll have to submit a separate form for every image you want excluded from OpenAI’s datasets, which could amount to thousands of works for some people; OpenAI hasn’t disclosed how many artists have undertaken this ordeal. You have to submit a single form for every artwork you want opting out of OpenAIs training, which simply isn’t realistic for creatives with vast portfolios. Image: OpenAIIf you only host your works on your own website, there might be a more efficient option. You can follow the instructions linked here to block the “GPTBot” web crawler used to scrape data from publicly available internet sources, which should protect all the content on it. A downside to this method, however, is that images posted anywhere outside of those walled protections, such as on social media, are still at risk of being scraped. Submitting a form at least ensures that your work is protected by a wider net, providing OpenAI hasn’t already obtained the images via a licensed third party.Both these processes only offer protection against being swept into future training datasets. OpenAI claims that its AI models don’t retain any information they’ve already been trained on, so if you believe your work was already consumed by DALL-E 3 or its previous iterations, it’s too late to have it removed.DALL-E 3 is also the model used by Image Creator from Designer, the Microsoft tool previously known as Bing Image Creator. As such, the process of opting out with OpenAI directly should also prevent Image Creator from being trained on your works.Adobe FireflyOf course, for every AI company that does allow artists to remove their works from training data, many others don’t openly advertise having such a service. And if they’re training models on a platform they own, users of that platform may not be allowed to opt out at all. That’s the case with creative software giant Adobe, which uses a model called Firefly across its Creative Cloud suite, including in Photoshop’s generative fill tool.Adobe proclaims that Firefly is commercially and legally safe because it’s entirely trained on the company’s own stock image platform, Adobe Stock. But there’s no means for Adobe Stock contributors to opt out of training Adobe’s AI models, which has resulted in some existing users criticizing the company for not seeking their permission. If you don’t want your work used to improve Firefly, you can’t put it on Adobe Stock, period.It doesn’t get much clearer than this line from Adobe’s FAQs. If you don’t want to train Firefly, avoid Adobe Stock. Image: AdobeIn principle, Adobe’s approach should mean that non-Stock users don’t have to worry about Firefly. But the reality is that there’s plenty of pirated work uploaded to the platform. If you find that someone has fraudulently uploaded your work to Adobe Stock, you can send Adobe an IP infringement notice to get it removed from the platform. Meta Creatives who want to avoid training Meta’s AI models will have to jump through similar hoops. Meta is using “information from its products and services” to train its generative AI models, so anything personal you upload, or have historically uploaded, to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads is fair game for AI training. If you don’t have an account on any of those services then you’ve potentially avoided feeding its AI machine, but deleting existing accounts and/or not uploading future works to them is the next best thing.You can submit a form to Meta to request the company correct or delete personal information that’s being used to train its generative AI models, but only if that information has been supplied by a third party. It won’t let you exclude, for instance, art you’ve been voluntarily showcasing on Instagram. Many artists have also found it to be a frustrating process, criticizing how often the tool is unable to process requests. Conceptual artist Bethany Berg told Wired that the removal form felt like “it was just a fake PR stunt to make it look like they were actually trying to do something.”Just remember that Meta will hold some rights over any content you upload to its platforms, so the most effective solution is to avoid them entirely. Image: MetaBeyond that, you can limit what personal information third parties are sharing with Meta by managing your Off-Facebook Activity. This tool will display which sites and services are giving your data to Meta and allow you to sever the connection that ties your identity with such data. This won’t clear the data that’s already been uploaded, but it should enable users to monitor if platforms they know are hosting their works are potentially feeding that information back to Meta directly.That said, Meta also uses “information that is publicly available online” to train its generative AI models, and it doesn’t disclose its datasets. So there’s no way of knowing precisely what’s already in that massive content pool — and no surefire way of staying out.What about Stability AI, Midjourney, and so on?Two of the most popular generative AI tools — Midjourney and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion — will remove copyright-infringing materials under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). But this information is buried in their respective Terms of Use policies, and the processes are crude. This also isn’t strictly an opt-out tool, and neither company provides a means to opt work out of being sucked into future training data pools.For both services, you’ll need to email the companies directly. Midjourney can be reached at takedown@midjourney.com. For Stability AI, email your requests to both mariya@stability.ai and legal@stability.ai. Stability’s user terms don’t specify what you’d need to provide, but the information required by Midjourney, and most DMCA copyright infringement notices generally, includes a description of the original works, where the image infringing on them is located, your contact information, and a copy of your signature. Other, smaller AI providers may also provide a similar approach to removing data that infringes on intellectual property rights thanks to regulations like DCMA, to varying success — if you’re unsure, try contacting the AI provider directly.How else can I protect my work against generative AI?With all that laid out, it’s clear that artists’ options when dealing directly with AI companies are pretty limited. Externally, however, several tools and services can grant creators better defenses — or even offenses — when fighting back. The various tools work differently, but in general, they run your visual art through processes that confuse or block effective training. That way, even if your work is scraped for an AI model, that model (ideally) won’t learn to reproduce it.GlazeWhen you launch Glaze, you’ll need to give it some time to download the resources it needs to protect your work. Image: Sand Lab, University of ChicagoOne of the most notable anti-training tools is Glaze, a project launched by a team out of the University of Chicago. The free-to-use tool works as a kind of cloak, making pixel-level changes to images that confuse AI software trying to read them. Real people can’t typically see these alterations on highly-detailed images so there’s little impact on the human viewing experience, but AI image generators that are fed the same materials will recognize it as something else entirely — meaning anyone who tries to replicate its specific art style will be unable to do so.Glaze is available for Windows or macOS. There are GPU and non-GPU versions available for Windows, but running the GPU variant specifically requires an Nvidia GPU from this list with at least 3.6GB of memory. (The developers say Glaze generally uses around 5GB of system memory to run.) Using it is straightforward: at first launch, the application will automatically download a number of machine learning libraries and other resources it needs to cloud your images. When that’s complete, head to the “Select” box at the top left and choose which images on your computer you’d like to Glaze. These can be uploaded in batches, so it’s much quicker than making individual opt-out requests.You may want to experiment with the strength of the Glaze application — on simple illustrations like this, Glazing at max intensity can distort the results. Image: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge and Image: Jess Weatherbed / The VergeYou can then adjust the intensity of the Glaze cloaking from “very low” to “very high,” with the latter offering greater protection against AI but increasing the possibility of changes being visible to humans. Render quality, another option, determines the overall quality of the finished image — higher-quality rendering looks better and offers greater protection but will also take much longer to process. Generally, the finished result should look virtually unchanged from your original. But a close inspection will reveal tiny differences, almost like a textured wash has been applied to it.NightshadeNightshade shares a very similar UI to Glaze, which is unsurprising considering it’s being developed by the same team. Image: Sand Lab, University of ChicagoNightshade, from the team behind Glaze, takes a similar but more extreme approach. Images passed through this cloaking tool are actually intended to “poison” generative AI models that train on them, sabotaging the outputs for text prompts. If you upload a batch of dog pictures, for instance, Nightshade is supposed to fool models into seeing some other object like cars — rather than just confusing the model like Glaze does. The idea is that if a model takes in enough confusing images, it will start building rules based on them, so any dog-related prompt might become distorted with wheels and windshields. You can’t specify what you’d like your poisoned images to masquerade as because Nightshade is built around algorithms that can’t accommodate that kind of personalization. If you want a better insight into how it works, check out this breakdown provided by data scientist Dorian Drost.Like Glaze, Nightshade applies a filter-like film over the image that shouldn’t massively impact the human viewing experience, depending on the intensity of the protection layer and how detailed the original art is. (You can apply both Glaze and Nightshade to images without them interfering with each other.) Nightshade is also available for Windows and macOS systems, though only machines running Apple’s own silicon are supported for the latter.At default intensity, Nightshade should produce similar-looking results to Glazed images. The poisoned results on the right are nearly identical to our Glaze tests. Image: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge and Image: Jess Weatherbed / The VergeMost of the overall process is the same as Glaze: you wait for the tool to download machine learning libraries, upload your work, and set the intensity and rendering options. But there’s one extra step. Nightshade will analyze the images and fill the “current tag” field with a single-word description identifying the content, like “dog” or “girl.” For the poisoning effect to work, this needs to be accurate — so you can change it if it’s wrong. Then, when you upload the images online, make sure that single-word tag is included in the metadata or alt text. Some generative AI advocates argue Nightshade won’t be much of a hindrance. AI systems are trained on truly vast amounts of data, so you’d need a lot of poisoning to affect any given prompt. And companies can develop workarounds that detect Nightshade. But most of these workarounds only filter out images that use it, rather than removing the protections — so the end result is just having art excluded from the training data, which is still a win. The Glaze project team is also continually working to update the applications to close any loopholes that are being exploited by workarounds.MistMist can be tricky to set up, but its another option to try if you’re unhappy with results from Glaze and Nightshade. Image: MistMist is a “preprocessing tool” developed by Psyker Group that, like Glaze and Nightshade, also prevents generative AI applications from effectively imitating a creator’s unique style and works. Mist’s approach is more akin to watermarking images. If an AI model is trained on “misted images,” any attempt to mimic them will see the output completely covered in visual distortions that render it unfit for most purposes and generally unpleasant to look at.Here’s an example of what’s produced by AI generation tools that reference Misted images. Image: Mist / Sang DelanElements of the original image can still be seen in some of these outputs, like similarities in photography or art styles, but the chaotic, noisy filter over the generated image isn’t something that can be easily corrected. Mist requires a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM, which isn’t a lot of computational resources, but it’s still greater than the 3.6GB Glaze requires. Mist has been open-sourced on GitHub to allow developers to build their own tools around it, and its creators have committed to offering long-term support and continuously improving its function.There are currently two ways for non-developers to use Mist. Windows PC users running an Nvidia GPU can download Mist for free via this Google Drive package. The software doesn’t require installation and can be used almost immediately after downloading — though it’s a little finicky to set up if you lack any coding or development experience.Misting images can also produce a faint, swirling filter over the results, but like Glaze, it's harder to spot on detailed art or photography. Image: Mist / Sang Delan and Image: Mist / Sang DelanA detailed handbook is available that will walk you through the entire process, along with a community Discord channel for troubleshooting. First, make sure you’ve installed the .NET desktop runtime. When that’s done, you just select the “ENG” file inside Google Drive and download the zipped Mist_V2 folder within it. Create a new folder called “IMG” in mist-v2 > src > data >. Drop any images that you plan on Misting into the new folder when completed. Then, go back to the main folder (which should be titled “mist-v2_gui_free_version”) and run the Mist GUI booter. Mist allows you to adjust the strength of protection applied to images and select between using your device’s GPU or CPU, which may prove useful if you’re running old or inefficient hardware.For anyone who’s using macOS or doesn’t possess an Nvidia GPU, you can also run Mist via Colab Notebook, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in your web browser. Detailed instructions for how to do this are available here, but it’s a much more complicated process to set up than its Windows equivalent. Glaze and Nightshade, generally, will be much easier to navigate for folks who aren't familiar with coding processes.Kin.ArtKin.Art isn’t so much an AI protection tool as it is an entire portfolio platform that artists can use to host and sell their work. It goes beyond just banning AI-generated works — though that’s appreciated, given the backlash against sites like DeviantArt and ArtStation — and actively makes AI scraping and training harder.Kin.Art uses two different techniques to thwart AI companies. The first is image segmentation, which is used to break apart images and muddle them into something unrecognizable. It’s undetectable to human eyes but disrupts generative AI models from being able to read the image. This visual scrambling will also be present if anyone attempts to save or download the image, though it doesn’t block manual screenshots. The second technique involves scrambling the metadata, like title and description, so any labels the AI model reads won’t accurately reflect the content.Kin.Art’s AI protections just require users to tick a box when uploading their works to the platform. Image: Kin.ArtThese protections are automatically applied on the Kin.Art platform, so you just need to create an account and upload your works to benefit from them, and that works like practically any social media platform. There are some neat creator-focused features included, like the ability to add a commission status to advertise your availability to accept requests, and you can link out to external platforms like social media pages directly on your user profile. You can toggle the protections on or off when uploading images, and the service is currently free to use. Instead, Kin.Art will start placing a 5 percent service fee on top of commissions made through the service in March.What about music, writing, and other media?Our guide covers what protections are available for image-based art largely because that format has more tools available than other mediums, and the opting-out processes tend to be clearer (when they are available). That said, creatives in other fields, like writing, voice acting, and music, are also fighting to protect their work. It’s much harder to disrupt how AI models are trained on this kind of data without noticeably affecting the original content, but there are still precautions you can take to reduce the risk of it being swept into AI training datasets.As with art, always check the user terms of the hosting platform to which you’re uploading your works. Services will generally disclose if they’re handing platform data over to third parties for AI training or using it to develop their own models — if there’s no explicit opt-out process, you may unknowingly be giving consent simply by signing up. Instead, look for platforms like Medium, which have committed to blocking attempts to use content hosted on the site to train AI models. If you’re hosting work on your own site, you can also do things like block GPTBot to avoid pages being scraped.Some rights distributors have made similar commitments, like the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music (SACEM) — a French association that announced it was exercising its right to opt out on behalf of its members last year. Another tip for writers, courtesy of the Authors Guild, is to place a short warning notice on your published works that clearly states you don’t consent to it being used to train AI. This is the example provided by the guild:“NO AI TRAINING: Without in any way limiting the author’s [and publisher’s] exclusive rights under copyright, any use of this publication to “train” generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to generate text is expressly prohibited. The author reserves all rights to license uses of this work for generative AI training and development of machine learning language models.”These warnings serve to clearly flag that the work isn’t freely available to use, which may be useful in any future lawsuits raised against companies that violate your ownership rights. If bots scraping web data are also intuitive enough to filter out results with such warnings then this could also potentially provide another layer of proactive protection, but there’s little evidence to show how many actually observe such information. Otherwise, performers and writers will need to submit copyright takedown notices to AI companies if they believe their works have been infringed.Comments3 Comments / 3 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: ring any bells?

It’s in the video games you play, in the movies you watch, and has flooded social media platforms. It’s even been used to promote the physical hardware that real, human artists use to create digital paintings and illustrations, to the immense frustration of those who already feel displaced by the technology. 

The pervasive nature of it seems especially egregious to creators who are fighting to stop their works from being used, without consent or compensation, to improve the very thing that threatens to disrupt their careers and livelihoods. The data pools that go into training generative AI models often contain images that are indiscriminately scraped from the internet, and some AI image generator tools allow users to upload reference images they want to imitate. Many creative professionals need to advertise their work via social media and online portfolios, so simply taking everything offline isn’t a viable solution. And a lack of legal clarity around AI technology has created something of a Wild-West environment that’s difficult to resist. Difficult, but not impossible.

While the tools are often complicated and time consuming, several AI companies provide creators with ways to opt their work out of training. And for visual artists who want broader protections there are tools like Glaze and Kin.Art, which make the works useless for training. Here’s how to navigate the best solutions we’ve found so far.

Opting Out

Generative AI models depend on training datasets, and the companies behind them are motivated to avoid restricting those potential data pools. So while they often do allow artists to opt their work out, the process can be crude and labor intensive — especially if you have a sizable catalog of work. 

Opting out typically requires submitting a request to an AI provider, either via a dedicated form or directly via email, along with the copies and written descriptions of images you want to protect. Additionally, if you’ve agreed to let third parties license your images, the terms may include a license for AI training. It’s worth scanning the user agreements for any platforms hosting your work to check what rights they hold over it. But different AI tools’ policies vary — here’s how to opt out of some popular ones.

OpenAI DALL-E

OpenAI started allowing creators to remove their work from its training data alongside its DALL-E 3 generative AI model last September, and it’s one of the easier processes to follow. Content creators or owners just need to submit a form to OpenAI to request that the work be excluded from future training datasets, including a copy of the image, a description of it, and a ticked checkbox confirming that you have the rights for said image.

Unfortunately, you’ll have to submit a separate form for every image you want excluded from OpenAI’s datasets, which could amount to thousands of works for some people; OpenAI hasn’t disclosed how many artists have undertaken this ordeal. 

[Image: You have to submit a single form for every artwork you want opting out of OpenAIs training, which simply isn’t realistic for creatives with vast portfolios. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZnMeuBMJ4NUwYQP5p55P5GXE2Ig=/0x0:1150x1693/1150x1693/filters:focal(575x847:576x848)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270057/OpenAI_opt_out_form.jpg]

If you only host your works on your own website, there might be a more efficient option. You can follow the instructions linked here to block the “GPTBot” web crawler used to scrape data from publicly available internet sources, which should protect all the content on it. A downside to this method, however, is that images posted anywhere outside of those walled protections, such as on social media, are still at risk of being scraped. Submitting a form at least ensures that your work is protected by a wider net, providing OpenAI hasn’t already obtained the images via a licensed third party.

Both these processes only offer protection against being swept into future training datasets. OpenAI claims that its AI models don’t retain any information they’ve already been trained on, so if you believe your work was already consumed by DALL-E 3 or its previous iterations, it’s too late to have it removed.

DALL-E 3 is also the model used by Image Creator from Designer, the Microsoft tool previously known as Bing Image Creator. As such, the process of opting out with OpenAI directly should also prevent Image Creator from being trained on your works.

Adobe Firefly

Of course, for every AI company that does allow artists to remove their works from training data, many others don’t openly advertise having such a service. And if they’re training models on a platform they own, users of that platform may not be allowed to opt out at all. That’s the case with creative software giant Adobe, which uses a model called Firefly across its Creative Cloud suite, including in Photoshop’s generative fill tool.

Adobe proclaims that Firefly is commercially and legally safe because it’s entirely trained on the company’s own stock image platform, Adobe Stock. But there’s no means for Adobe Stock contributors to opt out of training Adobe’s AI models, which has resulted in some existing users criticizing the company for not seeking their permission. If you don’t want your work used to improve Firefly, you can’t put it on Adobe Stock, period.

[Image: It doesn’t get much clearer than this line from Adobe’s FAQs. If you don’t want to train Firefly, avoid Adobe Stock. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YUqoxNIUWrtW2JUHz36t5zMLQA=/0x0:706x135/706x135/filters:focal(353x68:354x69)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270039/Adobe_ai_opt_out.jpg]

In principle, Adobe’s approach should mean that non-Stock users don’t have to worry about Firefly. But the reality is that there’s plenty of pirated work uploaded to the platform. If you find that someone has fraudulently uploaded your work to Adobe Stock, you can send Adobe an IP infringement notice to get it removed from the platform. 

Meta 

Creatives who want to avoid training Meta’s AI models will have to jump through similar hoops. Meta is using “information from its products and services” to train its generative AI models, so anything personal you upload, or have historically uploaded, to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads is fair game for AI training. If you don’t have an account on any of those services then you’ve potentially avoided feeding its AI machine, but deleting existing accounts and/or not uploading future works to them is the next best thing.

You can submit a form to Meta to request the company correct or delete personal information that’s being used to train its generative AI models, but only if that information has been supplied by a third party. It won’t let you exclude, for instance, art you’ve been voluntarily showcasing on Instagram. Many artists have also found it to be a frustrating process, criticizing how often the tool is unable to process requests. Conceptual artist Bethany Berg told Wired that the removal form felt like “it was just a fake PR stunt to make it look like they were actually trying to do something.”

[Image: Just remember that Meta will hold some rights over any content you upload to its platforms, so the most effective solution is to avoid them entirely. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivfJdF-MwlXfMg9DznEVCObGSrM=/0x0:979x969/979x969/filters:focal(490x485:491x486)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270042/meta_ai_opt_out.jpg]

Beyond that, you can limit what personal information third parties are sharing with Meta by managing your Off-Facebook Activity. This tool will display which sites and services are giving your data to Meta and allow you to sever the connection that ties your identity with such data. This won’t clear the data that’s already been uploaded, but it should enable users to monitor if platforms they know are hosting their works are potentially feeding that information back to Meta directly.

That said, Meta also uses “information that is publicly available online” to train its generative AI models, and it doesn’t disclose its datasets. So there’s no way of knowing precisely what’s already in that massive content pool — and no surefire way of staying out.

What about Stability AI, Midjourney, and so on?

Two of the most popular generative AI tools — Midjourney and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion — will remove copyright-infringing materials under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). But this information is buried in their respective Terms of Use policies, and the processes are crude. This also isn’t strictly an opt-out tool, and neither company provides a means to opt work out of being sucked into future training data pools.

For both services, you’ll need to email the companies directly. Midjourney can be reached at takedown@midjourney.com. For Stability AI, email your requests to both mariya@stability.ai and legal@stability.ai. Stability’s user terms don’t specify what you’d need to provide, but the information required by Midjourney, and most DMCA copyright infringement notices generally, includes a description of the original works, where the image infringing on them is located, your contact information, and a copy of your signature. 

Other, smaller AI providers may also provide a similar approach to removing data that infringes on intellectual property rights thanks to regulations like DCMA, to varying success — if you’re unsure, try contacting the AI provider directly.

How else can I protect my work against generative AI?

With all that laid out, it’s clear that artists’ options when dealing directly with AI companies are pretty limited. Externally, however, several tools and services can grant creators better defenses — or even offenses — when fighting back. The various tools work differently, but in general, they run your visual art through processes that confuse or block effective training. That way, even if your work is scraped for an AI model, that model (ideally) won’t learn to reproduce it.

Glaze

[Image: When you launch Glaze, you’ll need to give it some time to download the resources it needs to protect your work. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYVMl3IPUQ5a7QupLrJj1_F8rUg=/0x0:1282x1132/1282x1132/filters:focal(641x566:642x567)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25271972/Glaze_launcher.jpg]

One of the most notable anti-training tools is Glaze, a project launched by a team out of the University of Chicago. The free-to-use tool works as a kind of cloak, making pixel-level changes to images that confuse AI software trying to read them. Real people can’t typically see these alterations on highly-detailed images so there’s little impact on the human viewing experience, but AI image generators that are fed the same materials will recognize it as something else entirely — meaning anyone who tries to replicate its specific art style will be unable to do so.

Glaze is available for Windows or macOS. There are GPU and non-GPU versions available for Windows, but running the GPU variant specifically requires an Nvidia GPU from this list with at least 3.6GB of memory. (The developers say Glaze generally uses around 5GB of system memory to run.) Using it is straightforward: at first launch, the application will automatically download a number of machine learning libraries and other resources it needs to cloud your images. When that’s complete, head to the “Select” box at the top left and choose which images on your computer you’d like to Glaze. These can be uploaded in batches, so it’s much quicker than making individual opt-out requests.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUH7k6ah3Kh_VorufnSRqVAKxb8=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272552/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo_glazed_intensity_40_V1.jpg]
You may want to experiment with the strength of the Glaze application — on simple illustrations like this, Glazing at max intensity can distort the results.

You can then adjust the intensity of the Glaze cloaking from “very low” to “very high,” with the latter offering greater protection against AI but increasing the possibility of changes being visible to humans. Render quality, another option, determines the overall quality of the finished image — higher-quality rendering looks better and offers greater protection but will also take much longer to process. Generally, the finished result should look virtually unchanged from your original. But a close inspection will reveal tiny differences, almost like a textured wash has been applied to it.

Nightshade

[Image: Nightshade shares a very similar UI to Glaze, which is unsurprising considering it’s being developed by the same team. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQUoPhgyk0ildslgybihtqPE3qE=/0x0:1302x1100/1302x1100/filters:focal(651x550:652x551)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270255/Nightshade_launcher.jpg]

Nightshade, from the team behind Glaze, takes a similar but more extreme approach. Images passed through this cloaking tool are actually intended to “poison” generative AI models that train on them, sabotaging the outputs for text prompts. If you upload a batch of dog pictures, for instance, Nightshade is supposed to fool models into seeing some other object like cars — rather than just confusing the model like Glaze does. The idea is that if a model takes in enough confusing images, it will start building rules based on them, so any dog-related prompt might become distorted with wheels and windshields. 

You can’t specify what you’d like your poisoned images to masquerade as because Nightshade is built around algorithms that can’t accommodate that kind of personalization. If you want a better insight into how it works, check out this breakdown provided by data scientist Dorian Drost.

Like Glaze, Nightshade applies a filter-like film over the image that shouldn’t massively impact the human viewing experience, depending on the intensity of the protection layer and how detailed the original art is. (You can apply both Glaze and Nightshade to images without them interfering with each other.) Nightshade is also available for Windows and macOS systems, though only machines running Apple’s own silicon are supported for the latter.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQJPufnIxBA2F7zxDPxW2-8qhac=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272553/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo.jpg]
[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzaQ2O2SO_tDyzxCo5YXIUE_Qcw=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272592/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo_nightshade_intensity_LOW_V1.jpg]
At default intensity, Nightshade should produce similar-looking results to Glazed images. The poisoned results on the right are nearly identical to our Glaze tests.

Most of the overall process is the same as Glaze: you wait for the tool to download machine learning libraries, upload your work, and set the intensity and rendering options. But there’s one extra step. Nightshade will analyze the images and fill the “current tag” field with a single-word description identifying the content, like “dog” or “girl.” For the poisoning effect to work, this needs to be accurate — so you can change it if it’s wrong. Then, when you upload the images online, make sure that single-word tag is included in the metadata or alt text. 

Some generative AI advocates argue Nightshade won’t be much of a hindrance. AI systems are trained on truly vast amounts of data, so you’d need a lot of poisoning to affect any given prompt. And companies can develop workarounds that detect Nightshade. But most of these workarounds only filter out images that use it, rather than removing the protections — so the end result is just having art excluded from the training data, which is still a win. The Glaze project team is also continually working to update the applications to close any loopholes that are being exploited by workarounds.

Mist

[Image: Mist can be tricky to set up, but its another option to try if you’re unhappy with results from Glaze and Nightshade. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/428XwtgEkMHMNdrbsfn-yaw5xiE=/0x0:1767x831/1767x831/filters:focal(884x416:885x417)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270243/Mist_launcher.jpg]

Mist is a “preprocessing tool” developed by Psyker Group that, like Glaze and Nightshade, also prevents generative AI applications from effectively imitating a creator’s unique style and works. Mist’s approach is more akin to watermarking images. If an AI model is trained on “misted images,” any attempt to mimic them will see the output completely covered in visual distortions that render it unfit for most purposes and generally unpleasant to look at.

[Image: Here’s an example of what’s produced by AI generation tools that reference Misted images. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epkM8JALgo4JWPCrDQpt3RKsEOA=/0x0:512x512/512x512/filters:focal(256x256:257x257)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272426/misted_t2i.jpg]

Elements of the original image can still be seen in some of these outputs, like similarities in photography or art styles, but the chaotic, noisy filter over the generated image isn’t something that can be easily corrected. Mist requires a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM, which isn’t a lot of computational resources, but it’s still greater than the 3.6GB Glaze requires. Mist has been open-sourced on GitHub to allow developers to build their own tools around it, and its creators have committed to offering long-term support and continuously improving its function.

There are currently two ways for non-developers to use Mist. Windows PC users running an Nvidia GPU can download Mist for free via this Google Drive package. The software doesn’t require installation and can be used almost immediately after downloading — though it’s a little finicky to set up if you lack any coding or development experience.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5eU328CU5OnDFEK7ITjLgu7SWOM=/0x0:600x600/600x600/filters:focal(300x300:301x301)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272436/ori_sample.png]
[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eOisXUU_lbyl4nxNMhLi1K17QWM=/0x0:600x600/600x600/filters:focal(300x300:301x301)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272437/mist_4.png]
Misting images can also produce a faint, swirling filter over the results, but like Glaze, it's harder to spot on detailed art or photography.

A detailed handbook is available that will walk you through the entire process, along with a community Discord channel for troubleshooting. First, make sure you’ve installed the .NET desktop runtime. When that’s done, you just select the “ENG” file inside Google Drive and download the zipped Mist_V2 folder within it. Create a new folder called “IMG” in mist-v2 > src > data >. Drop any images that you plan on Misting into the new folder when completed. Then, go back to the main folder (which should be titled “mist-v2_gui_free_version”) and run the Mist GUI booter. Mist allows you to adjust the strength of protection applied to images and select between using your device’s GPU or CPU, which may prove useful if you’re running old or inefficient hardware.

For anyone who’s using macOS or doesn’t possess an Nvidia GPU, you can also run Mist via Colab Notebook, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in your web browser. Detailed instructions for how to do this are available here, but it’s a much more complicated process to set up than its Windows equivalent. Glaze and Nightshade, generally, will be much easier to navigate for folks who aren't familiar with coding processes.

Kin.Art

Kin.Art isn’t so much an AI protection tool as it is an entire portfolio platform that artists can use to host and sell their work. It goes beyond just banning AI-generated works — though that’s appreciated, given the backlash against sites like DeviantArt and ArtStation — and actively makes AI scraping and training harder.

Kin.Art uses two different techniques to thwart AI companies. The first is image segmentation, which is used to break apart images and muddle them into something unrecognizable. It’s undetectable to human eyes but disrupts generative AI models from being able to read the image. This visual scrambling will also be present if anyone attempts to save or download the image, though it doesn’t block manual screenshots. The second technique involves scrambling the metadata, like title and description, so any labels the AI model reads won’t accurately reflect the content.

[Image: Kin.Art’s AI protections just require users to tick a box when uploading their works to the platform. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SO1ehnIJaxSF_oGgKdTgDKfq7k0=/0x0:915x410/915x410/filters:focal(458x205:459x206)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270112/Kin_art_anti_ai_upload.jpg]

These protections are automatically applied on the Kin.Art platform, so you just need to create an account and upload your works to benefit from them, and that works like practically any social media platform. There are some neat creator-focused features included, like the ability to add a commission status to advertise your availability to accept requests, and you can link out to external platforms like social media pages directly on your user profile. You can toggle the protections on or off when uploading images, and the service is currently free to use. Instead, Kin.Art will start placing a 5 percent service fee on top of commissions made through the service in March.

What about music, writing, and other media?

Our guide covers what protections are available for image-based art largely because that format has more tools available than other mediums, and the opting-out processes tend to be clearer (when they are available). That said, creatives in other fields, like writing, voice acting, and music, are also fighting to protect their work. It’s much harder to disrupt how AI models are trained on this kind of data without noticeably affecting the original content, but there are still precautions you can take to reduce the risk of it being swept into AI training datasets.

As with art, always check the user terms of the hosting platform to which you’re uploading your works. Services will generally disclose if they’re handing platform data over to third parties for AI training or using it to develop their own models — if there’s no explicit opt-out process, you may unknowingly be giving consent simply by signing up. Instead, look for platforms like Medium, which have committed to blocking attempts to use content hosted on the site to train AI models. If you’re hosting work on your own site, you can also do things like block GPTBot to avoid pages being scraped.

Some rights distributors have made similar commitments, like the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music (SACEM) — a French association that announced it was exercising its right to opt out on behalf of its members last year. Another tip for writers, courtesy of the Authors Guild, is to place a short warning notice on your published works that clearly states you don’t consent to it being used to train AI. This is the example provided by the guild:

> “NO AI TRAINING: Without in any way limiting the author’s [and publisher’s] exclusive rights under copyright, any use of this publication to “train” generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to generate text is expressly prohibited. The author reserves all rights to license uses of this work for generative AI training and development of machine learning language models.”

These warnings serve to clearly flag that the work isn’t freely available to use, which may be useful in any future lawsuits raised against companies that violate your ownership rights. If bots scraping web data are also intuitive enough to filter out results with such warnings then this could also potentially provide another layer of proactive protection, but there’s little evidence to show how many actually observe such information. Otherwise, performers and writers will need to submit copyright takedown notices to AI companies if they believe their works have been infringed.

Ikea released a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) shopping tool, the retailer announced Feb. 5. The tool is available in the OpenAI GPT store with the $20 per month Plus membership in the U.S. Ikea says it will expand the tool to other markets in 2024.
“The new IKEA AI Assistant on GPT Stores is an ongoing initiative, and the continuation of a journey that looks to enrich the retail experience and explore additional avenues to interact with our customers and coworkers, as they help us improve and develop further,” Parag Parekh, global chief digital officer for Ikea Retail, said in a statement.
Ikea is No. 7 in the Europe Database, Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of the largest online retailers in the region.
How does Ikea’s generative AI assistant work?
Consumers can access the Ikea AI assistant through ChatGPT. Users can ask questions about Ikea’s catalog and product availability at a specific store. A customer can tell the tool that he is looking for a dining table that seats eight, and ChatGPT will respond with images of products that fit the description, along with prices and a look at average customer ratings, according to an example video Ikea shared. It can also provide a link directly to checkout with the item on Ikea’s website.

Users can also ask for design tips, or ask the tool to show them furnishings within specific parameters. For example, ‘’Show me a cozy living room layout for a small apartment with the use of sustainable materials.’’ Requests can be more specific, too, asking how certain Ikea products would look together in a kitchen, for example.
“We are taking a pragmatic, execution-focused approach, learning by doing and capitalizing on our early efforts of a Responsible AI framework. We activated a broad ecosystem of partners to bring to life several experiments, so that we can take part in the AI evolution as we shape our company strategy,” Francesco Marzoni, chief data and analytics officer at Ikea Retail, said in a statement.
Consumer-facing generative AI
Ikea joins other major retailers in releasing generative AI tools consumers can use to find and purchase goods online. Amazon.com Inc. recently debuted Rufus, a new generative AI shopping assistant trained on Amazon’s product catalog. So far, the assistant is available to a small subset of U.S. customers to answer shopping questions and make recommendations, Amazon said. It will roll out to all U.S. customers in a few weeks.
Walmart is also rolling out ways consumers can use generative AI as they shop. Walmart released a new generative AI-powered search capability in its app at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.

The search function uses Microsoft’s large language model (LLM) alongside Walmart’s data to give consumers relevant results across product categories. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon gave the example of a shopper hosting a Super Bowl watch party. Rather than searching for a new TV, chicken wings, chips, and other essentials, one search would generate all of these items, he said, without the user manually inputting the specifics of each type of product.
The generative AI search will also take into account factors about the specific app user. A consumer’s location, search history, and other relevant information will be used to further refine their results, McMillon said.

  NVIDIA has joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s new U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium as part of the company’s effort to advance safe, secure and trustworthy AI.
AISIC will work to create tools, methodologies and standards to promote the safe and trustworthy development and deployment of AI. As a member, NVIDIA will work with NIST — an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce — and fellow consortium members to advance the consortium’s mandate.
NVIDIA’s participation builds on a record of working with governments, researchers and industries of all sizes to help ensure AI is developed and deployed safely and responsibly.
Through a broad range of development initiatives, including NeMo Guardrails, open-source software for ensuring large language model responses are accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure, NVIDIA actively works to make AI safety a reality.
In 2023, NVIDIA endorsed the Biden Administration’s voluntary AI safety commitments. Last month, the company announced a $30 million contribution to the U.S. National Science Foundation’s National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource pilot program, which aims to broaden access to the tools needed to power responsible AI discovery and innovation.
AISIC Research Focus
Through the consortium, NIST aims to facilitate knowledge sharing and advance applied research and evaluation activities to accelerate innovation in trustworthy AI. AISIC members, which include more than 200 of the nation’s leading AI creators, academics, government and industry researchers, as well as civil society organizations, bring technical expertise in areas such as AI governance, systems and development, psychometrics and more.
In addition to participating in working groups, NVIDIA plans to leverage a range of computing resources and best practices for implementing AI risk-management frameworks and AI model transparency, as well as several NVIDIA-developed, open-source AI safety, red-teaming and security tools.

            Futurists are consistent in their appraisals that AI isn’t going away and won’t just assist humans, but that it will serve as a collaborator — necessitating that students be fully prepared for that reality.

To Richard Culatta, students need to learn about artificial intelligence and its inner workings now. But even more critical, says the CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, is that educators teach pupils not just about the technology, but how to partner with AI in their own work.
“Every kid that graduates today is going to work on a team where not every member of their team is human,” Culatta says. “How do you work on a team where not all members are human? How do you know what tasks to hand off to non-human counterparts?”
As AI populates our everyday lives — from being woven into search engines to suggesting which social media accounts to follow — so too is the technology working its way into classrooms.

Whether AI appears in student work, in assessment and lesson design, or in building a lunchroom schedule, futurists are fairly universal in their opinion that AI isn’t going away. Instead, this is a technology that won’t just assist us but will serve as a collaborator.
Culatta says that’s something everyone — especially today’s students — will need to learn to expect. “What type of human do we need to be preparing for the world they’re going to be walking into?”
So how can educators prepare today’s learners for a future working alongside AI? Education and science experts say there are several steps that can be taken within curriculum today to help students prepare for tomorrow.
Help students understand best uses
Schools should think about how to help prepare students to be good humans within an AI-driven world, says Culatta. Aside from knowing how to use AI, students also need to be ready for a world where that technology dominates some skills humans control now.
That may mean focusing on helping them understand the skills AI can handle best versus those that are uniquely human, such as creativity and empathy.
Culatta says rather than teaching students skills that will likely be handed over to AI, they should focus on how to be comfortable handing those tasks over and strengthening the abilities that the technology can’t substitute.
Ultimately, Culatta asks, can students know when it’s better to hand something to AI or know when a human would be better-suited to the task, and understand how to know that?
Rethink assessments
To teach students how to work with and trust AI, schools also need to look at their assessments. Culatta says ISTE gets calls that schools are worried AI is contributing to increases in cheating.
“There’s no evidence that cheating has increased in schools,” he says.
Instead, he says, more attention should go to rethinking tests that were designed to ask students to cut and paste answers, popping in a definition or deriving a numeric solution to a formula.
Better options include asking students to use AI to come up with six possible solutions to a problem, and then assess the flaws and benefits of each.
“That’s a skill we need for the future,” Culatta says. “It’s critical thinking. They have to know something about the solutions, whether they are good or bad.”

Pete Just, executive director of the Indiana CTO Council, concurs that schools need to shift their thinking away from whether students will or won’t use AI — or even if that’s called cheating — and instead teach them how to use the technology with “academic integrity.”
“It’s acknowledging that you may use it, and if you do, here’s what we expect of you,” Just says.
Provide teachers PD for AI
Knowing how to use AI effectively and to teach that thought process requires educators to have some comfort level with the technology.
While there are always early adopters within any field, using AI through Bing’s search engine or even through an Open AI subscription is not the same as knowing how to weave the tool into curriculum.
The Consortium for School Networking’s AI Exploration for Educators has been working with New York City Public Schools and thousands of educators to help teachers think differently about AI, says Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN. That includes the development of the K-12 Generative Artificial Intelligence Readiness Checklist. One of the first starting points Krueger notes is for educators to start using AI with tasks they need to handle in their classrooms.
“One of the themes is to play with it,” Krueger says.
Support around AI is critical, adds Just, who notes that teachers are not getting much professional development yet around the tech. While 5% to 10% of educators are using the tool on their own, he says, the rest need some assistance to get comfortable with how and where to use AI.
“Teachers and administrators should be using it to handle administrative tasks,” Just says. “That’s an easy way to dip into the waters, then move forward on how to import this into classrooms.”

But Just says not everything should be handed over to AI right now. For example, educators may eventually want to be able to chart how students are doing academically or design realistic projections for student growth in subject areas. But putting student data into open AI spaces, like Open AI today, can run into privacy issues with student data.
For educators to understand these nuances, they first need to learn how to get comfortable with using AI and how it works before knowing what they can currently do and what needs to wait.
“We start with teacher professional development and staff professional development, helping them understand the issues around ethics and student privacy and even practical pedagogical uses of AI,” Just says.
Install guardrails
According to Just, paid services or software license agreements will begin to appear in schools and districts to ensure AI has more guardrails around student data. He says that if schools and districts aren’t paying for K12-specific tools for AI yet, they eventually will.
Krueger agrees. He expects to see more “walled-garden” or district-specific AI solutions soon to allow educators to use the technology to design more student-focused lessons — even those tailored to a specific pupil. Until then, as educators start using AI, they should continue to be mindful of the student information they enter.
“We encourage teachers and administrators to use AI to solve problems they are trying to solve, but with the understanding that if you’re putting something into AI, be careful not to load IEPs [individualized education programs] into AI,” Krueger says.

While caution is important, experts agree that educators do need to start using AI — mainly because their students already are. Even more keenly, learners will use AI in ways we have yet to imagine. To Culatta, educators who focus on how to not use AI hold students back from developing skills around a technology that will be critical to their future.
“We can say what not to do all day long, but you can’t practice not doing something. And if you want good skills, you have to practice doing something,” Culatta says. “The skills we’re teaching in schools are not aligned with the skills needed to thrive in the digital world. And that’s a huge mess we have to fix in schools.”

The expanding use of artificial intelligence in business today has many people experiencing greater fear and anxiety over their futures. Recent research has shown that mental health of employees has been impacted, with the American Psychological Association’s 2023 Work in America Survey revealing that close to 2 out of every 5 workers (38%) worry that AI might make some or all of their job duties obsolete in the future.


To learn more about this topic, I caught up this month with Dan Diasio, EY’s Global Artificial Intelligence (AI) Consulting Leader. In this role, he supports clients with AI-enabled business transformation by supporting the strategic direction, identification, design, deployment of Trusted-AI and modern data platforms. He works across industries to narrow the divide of between digital immigrants and digital natives to transform weaknesses into competitive advantage.

EY’s recent AI Anxiety in Business Survey is based on findings from 1,000 employed US workers at least somewhat familiar AI about their perception of and experience with AI-backed technologies.

Here’s what Diasio shared:
Kathy Caprino: Dan, what prompted EY to move forward to conduct the “AI Anxiety in Business” Survey?

Dan Diasio: Generative AI (GenAI) was one of the hottest topics in 2023 with major breakthroughs throughout the business world. However, we’ve seen that as leaders move to adopt, there was a disconnect of excitement between the leaders and the users of AI systems. Most technology projects fail, and this is with user adoption. AI is not immune from this challenge.

It's important for us to understand the full picture when it comes to AI integration, from regulation and tactical implementation to attitudes and feelings employees have about the perceived threat technology poses. Understanding this, we felt there was a real need to dig deeper into what aspects of AI and related technologies are keeping leaders and employees up at night.

Our survey uncovers the effects of AI and its current usage in the workplace, as well as how its rapid adoption is fueling anxieties across the workforce. It offers business leaders crucial insights on potential barriers and how to help employers overcome them. This information is not only valuable to us at EY for our own usage, but can help us provide better counsel to our clients on how they should be approaching AI adoption with humans at the center.

Caprino: From the findings, what surprised you the most as a leader in AI?
Diasio: AI anxiety hasn’t derailed excitement about technology’s potential, but workers want regulation with integration. Based on our research, 78% of employees say the government needs to play a bigger role in regulating AI. Given how polarizing politics are today, the fact that employees want to see more AI regulation– by AI developers and the government–was surprising.
Interestingly, employees who trust AI (80%) are more likely than those who don’t (71%) to say the government needs to play a bigger role in regulating AI technology.
Caprino: Were there any key differences based on age of respondent, in the types of responses received?
Diasio: Yes - the apparent lack of trust Gen Z workers have relative to their Millennial and Gen X counterparts was very interesting. Despite being the first true digital natives to enter the workforce, Gen Z employees are not the most likely to be using AI at work and significantly less convinced of its benefits. For example, just 72% of Gen Z believe AI will make them more efficient compared to 85% of Millennials and 89% of Gen X. We’re finding that Gen Z are the most likely generation to treat AI capabilities with a healthy dose of skepticism. However, the youngest generation represents the future of the workforce, and it is crucial for business leaders to engage Gen Z amid AI integration.
Caprino: What steps can leaders take to overcome employee AI anxiety and concerns amid adoption?
Diasio: While most employees trust AI technologies, almost as many have concerns. AI is a new tool for most employees, and with headlines swirling around its potential for negative consequences such as job displacement, workers can understandably be anxious about fully embracing the technology. According to our research, ‘FOBO’ - the fear of becoming obsolete - is plaguing the workforce, with a staggering 75% of employees concerned AI will make certain jobs obsolete. Potentially more alarmingly, about two-thirds (65%) say they are anxious about AI replacing their job.
However, human-centered design is crucial to unlocking AI throughout organizations, so for business leaders, communication, transparency and education are vital to decreasing worker AI anxiety and fully unlocking the potential of AI.
Key steps and initiatives include:
Education
Workers indicated that they not only expect training programs but are actively concerned that the current programs offered are not adequate enough. Our survey saw that 80% of respondents said more training/upskilling would make them more comfortable using AI at work, suggesting that these educational workshops are a key to lowering anxiety levels. However, nearly as many (73%) have concerns that there won’t be sufficient training or upskilling opportunities, meaning that leaders can’t just go through the motions with AI training, and the training instead needs to be strategic.
Transparency
To make employees more comfortable using AI, leaders need to share more information about responsible/ethical AI best practices, as well as receive more communication promoting the responsible/ethical use of AI. Employees said if senior leadership promoted using AI responsibly and ethically (77%), they would be more comfortable using AI at work.
Communication
At the end of the day, employees want to be informed about the process and have their opinions heard. 77% of employees felt they would be more comfortable with AI adoption at work if all levels of an organization were involved in the adoption process.
Caprino: How do you anticipate AI will continue to evolve over the next year? What trends do you anticipate for 2024?
Diasio: This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a surge of excitement around an emerging technology’s potential, but businesses shouldn’t dismiss the hype around AI - this is a revolutionary tool and harnessing its potential should be a top priority in 2024 and beyond.
What’s unique about the GenAI (generative AI) hype cycle is the constant and rapid increase of maturity and usage that has followed its explosive introduction into the market, and there’s no sign of this rapid evolution slowing down.
2023 marked a year of discovery for most organizations and understanding AI, with businesses experimenting with AI-backed solutions across a variety of functions. In 2024, we anticipate the theme to be all about scale.
GenAI will be deployed and integrated more strategically and with a focus on transforming the flow of work (rather than adding a new tool). Additionally, we anticipate that organizations will move beyond out-of-the-box capabilities and seek to implement AI that is right sized (and priced) for their needs, integrating other types of AI (like causal AI) that are specifically fit for performing actions.
In today’s challenging macroeconomic environment amid ongoing economic uncertainty, leaders will also likely feel pressure to showcase the ROI on AI investments, which we expect to further drive the focus from experimentation to scaling a proven concept.
Caprino: We are now just over a year since ChatGPT’s explosive introduction into the market. How can businesses shift from experimentation to execution while keeping in mind the risks associated with new technologies?
Diasio: GenAI is a fundamentally different technology than those that preceded it. It is probabilistic, which means that it often does not consistently give the same answers, which makes it difficult to test. Furthermore, just as abilities emerged as companies added more data to models, so do new risks emerge.
Every company embarking on the AI journey should have a strong AI Governance and Risk Management Program. These should be run by a combination of Business Leaders and Risk Management professions that are trained in how AI works. Business leaders should think of themselves as trustees and custodians of their organization’s technological ecosystem and embed responsible practices in AI – including data protection, compliance with evolving regulatory obligations, and appropriate principles and codes of practice – to maintain trust and mitigate risks.
If well-designed and implemented, regulatory mechanisms can help promote safe and trusted AI systems. For emerging technologies like AI, this will involve designing regulatory mechanisms with a capacity to evolve over time.
Ethical implications of AI are also paramount and a top concern from workers today. Our survey revealed 71% of employees are concerned about the ethical/moral considerations of using AI. Businesses can embrace transparency to mitigate the human risk surrounding ethical concerns.
In our research, the majority of employees say they would view an organization more positively if it:


Offered AI responsibility/ethics training for employees (80%)
Created an AI responsibility/ethical task force (77%)
Had a trusted third-party review of AI built by that organization (76%)


Caprino: Finally, how can businesses help prepare their employees for what’s to come on the AI front and build the workforce of the future? And with the current proliferation of new generative AI tools, how can organizations and employees manage the learning curve?
Diasio: Ultimately, GenAI is here to stay. We’re telling our clients to think about the impact of AI the same way that the internet changed all industries. New innovations are inevitable and empowering individuals by putting humans and technology together will be the key to success. Companies do not need more tools, they need to reimagine their workflows – and it's only the people conducting these workflows that can make this happen.
Employees are crucial in the successful integration of new technologies, so leaders must prioritize alleviating the fears that employees have.
Successful implementation will require thoughtful communication and meaningful upskilling programs that allow employees to feel seen and heard, while also ensuring they’re more comfortable with how and when to use the technology.

With the swift ascendancy of artificial intelligence, there is a looming fear that AI will replace jobs. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted in a 2023 report that the workforce in the United States and Europe would be upended, with 300 million jobs lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.


In a recent survey conducted by ResumeBuilder, 37% of business leaders revealed they have already begun to replace staff with AI. Nearly half (44%) of the executive respondents stated they anticipate further jobs cuts in 2024 due to AI efficiency.

This year, a number of top companies have already enacted workforce reductions, while announcing plans to redirect their investments into generative AI and automation. The reallocation of resources to AI investments is a major way in which this emerging technology is impacting job security for white-collar professionals.

CEO Andy Jassy said last week in Amazon’s earnings call, “Gen AI is and will continue to be an area [of] pervasive focus and investment across Amazon primarily because there are few initiatives that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes.” Jassy projected that this technology will “drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.”

Google
Google recently laid off hundreds of employees across various functions, including its advertising, sales, engineering, hardware and Google Assistant teams. These job cuts were about “removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas,” according to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.
In January, Pichai warned his employees in an internal memo about the possibility of more “role eliminations” at the company in the coming months. “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” he wrote in a message to Google staff that was obtained by the Verge. “The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.” Pichai told employees that “some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted.”
In an earnings call last week, the chief executive said, “We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures.”
He added, “Across different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas.”
Echoing Pichai’s sentiments, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company is moderating expense growth by exhibiting a “slower pace of hiring,” as she points to the “headcount down year-on-year.”
Microsoft
Last month, Microsoft eliminated 1,900 gaming roles, impacting about 8% of Activision Blizzard, Xbox and ZeniMax employees. In an internal memo to staff, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote, “As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business.”
In addition to the company’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has a substantial $13 billion investment and 49% stake in OpenAI, the company behind chatbot ChatGPT.
In his earnings call last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told investors, “We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains.”
In talking about the future of work, Nadella said, “A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as a 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks.”
In scaling Microsoft’s AI and cloud investments, the company remains “focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team.”
When discussing how the organization is able to make margin improvements, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told investors the company is “re-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce.”

As AI-driven fakery spreads—from election-related robocalls and celebrity deepfake videos to doctored images and students abusing the powers of ChatGPT—a tech arms race is ramping up to detect these falsehoods.
But in higher ed, many are choosing to stand back and wait, worried that new tools for detecting AI-generated plagiarism may do more harm than good.
“Twenty-five years ago, you were grabbing at your student’s text saying, ‘I know this isn’t theirs,’” said Emily Isaacs, director of Montclair State University’s Office for Faculty Excellence. “You couldn’t find it [online], but you knew in your heart it wasn’t theirs.”

Montclair announced in November—a year after the launch of ChatGPT—that academics should not use the AI-detector feature in a tool from Turnitin. That followed similar moves from institutions including Vanderbilt University, the University of Texas at Austin and Northwestern University.
A big question driving these decisions is: Do AI-detection tools even work?
“It’s really an issue of, we don’t want to say you cheated when you didn’t cheat,” Isaacs said. Instead, she said, “Our emphasis has been raising awareness, mitigation strategies.”

Awareness of AI-driven falsehoods and the perils of plagiarism has skyrocketed. This week, Meta—parent company of Facebook and Instagram—announced it would label AI-generated images. That followed an uproar caused by fake, AI-generated pornographic images of singer Taylor Swift circulating online and AI-powered robocalls impersonating President Joe Biden that sought to suppress votes in the New Hampshire primary. The Federal Communications Commission outlawed such AI robocalls on Thursday.
Meanwhile, discussions of plagiarism and its detection have surged since Harvard’s now former president Claudine Gay was accused of plagiarizing portions of two previously published articles. Gay resigned in the wake of that and after a congressional hearing on antisemitism in higher education.
With faculty spending more than a year fretting about the potential abuse of AI tools like ChatGPT, technology companies such as Turnitin have touted the benefits of AI detectors. The tools, typically integrated into other grammar and writing software, scan text like a spell-checker or antiplagiarism program.

Turnitin says its AI-detection tool, in an attempt to avoid false positives, can miss roughly 15 percent of AI-generated text in a document. 
“We’re comfortable with that since we do not want to highlight human-written text as AI text,” the company’s website says, pointing toward its 1 percent false-positive rate.
The detection tools have raised their own questions, and for many institutions there are no clear-cut answers.
“The idea of being all for it or entirely against it, I don’t know if it breaks down like that,” said Holly Hassel, director of the composition program at Michigan Technological University. “You imagine it as a tool that could be beneficial while recognizing it’s flawed and may penalize some students.”
The Effectiveness of AI Detectors
In June last year, an international team of academics found a dozen AI-detection tools were “neither accurate nor reliable.”
That same month, a team of University of Maryland students found the tools would flag work not produced by AI or could be entirely circumvented by paraphrasing AI-generated text. Their research found “these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios.”
“There are a lot of companies raising a lot of funding and claiming they have detectors to be reliably used, but the issue is none of them explain what the evaluation is and how it’s done—it’s just snapshots,” said Soheil Feizi, the director of the university’s Reliable AI Lab who oversaw the Maryland team.
In November, two professors from Australia’s University of Adelaide conducted AI-detection experiments for Times Higher Education (Inside Higher Ed’s parent company).
Some tools, including Copyleaks, fared better than others, but the professors summed up their findings with a singular warning: “The real takeaway is that we should assume students will be able to break any AI-detection tools, regardless of their sophistication.”
The investigations themselves raised concerns about feeding students’ work to the generative AI tools, where it’s “not clear what’s done with it,” Isaacs said.
Isaacs and Feizi noted other problems, including that there is no evidence trail when the tools flag suspected AI writing.
“With the AI detection, it’s just a score and there’s nothing to click,” Isaacs said. “You can’t replicate or analyze the methodology the detection system used, so it’s a black box.”


Turnitin's AI detector
Turnitin 

Annie Chechitelli, chief product officer at Turnitin, emphasized the importance of teacher-student relationships, rather than relying solely on technology tools.
“Detection is only one small piece of the puzzle in how educators can address with AI writing in the classroom,” Chechitelli said in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. “The largest piece of that puzzle is the student-to-teacher relationship. Our guidance is, and has always been, that there is no substitute for knowing a student, knowing their writing style and background.”
Despite their skepticism of the detection tools, Feizi and other researchers support the use of AI technology over all.
“A more comprehensive solution is to embrace the AI models in education,” Feizi said. “It’s a little bit of a hard job, but it’s the right way to think of it. The wrong way is to police it and, worse than that, is to rely on unreliable detectors in order to enforce that.”
Beginnings of an Approach on AI Detection
The Modern Language Association and the Conference on College Composition and Communication have been careful in giving guidance about AI detectors. The two groups formed a joint task force on writing and AI in November 2022, publishing their first working paper in July.
“We don’t take a formal stance, but we have a principle that tools for accountability should be used with caution and discernment or not at all,” said Hassel, co-chair of the task force and professor at Michigan Technological University. She added that among the task force members, there’s a range of approaches to the tools, with some banning them entirely.
The group’s second working paper, delving further into AI detection and the usage of tools, is slated for completion this spring.
Elizabeth Steere, a lecturer in English at the University of North Georgia, has written about the efficacy of AI detectors. She and other UNG faculty members use the AI detector iThenticate from Turnitin. Students’ work is automatically checked when they turn in assignments to their Dropbox.
Several journals also use the iThenticate tool, although the value of the costly software has been debated. Turnitin, the company behind iThenticate, offers customized pricing based on organizations’ size and needs. Otherwise, it’s generally $100 for each manuscript of fewer than 25,000 words.
Steere said the AI detector is just one tool in preventing plagiarism.
“It is a fraught issue, and each institution really does need to weigh the pros and cons and come to their own decisions, because it’s complex—it’s thorny,” she said.
The issue is further complicated by the inclusion of AI in common writing tools, like Grammarly, Google Docs and various spell-checkers.
“A lot of times it was [students saying], ‘No, I didn’t use AI,’ then it comes out they were using an overall rephrasing tool, not thinking it’s an AI tool,” Steere said. “The boundaries are much blurrier now; I really feel for the students, because we didn’t have that when we were in school.”
Steere uses those instances as teachable moments to explain the various degrees of plagiarism.
“If every student said, ‘I didn’t use AI,’ and I say, ‘Yes, you did,’ it’s not helping anyone,” she said. “But you can speak with them directly and figure out their writing process—have they used tools or augmenting, and do they consider that to be AI?”

What comes to mind when you hear the word “robot”? Do you picture a metallic humanoid in a spaceship in the distant future? Perhaps you imagine a dystopian future where humanity is enslaved by its robot overlords. Or maybe you think of an automobile assembly line with robot-like machines putting cars together.
Whatever you think, one thing is sure: robots are here to stay. Fortunately, it seems likely that robots will be more about doing repetitive or dangerous tasks than seizing supreme executive power. Let’s look at robotics, defining and classifying the term, figuring out the role of Artificial Intelligence in the field, the future of robotics, and how robotics will change our lives.
What Is Robotics?
Robotics is the engineering branch that deals with the conception, design, construction, operation, application, and usage of robots. Digging a little deeper, we see that robots are defined as an automatically operated machine that carries out a series of actions independently and does the work usually accomplished by a human.
Incidentally, robots don’t have to resemble humans, although some do. Look at images of automobile assembly lines for proof. Robots that appear human are typically referred to as “androids.” Although robot designers make their creations appear human so that people feel more at ease around them, it’s not always the case. Some people find robots, especially ones that resemble people, creepy.
Types of Robots
Robots are versatile machines, evidenced by their wide variety of forms and functions. Here's a list of a few kinds of robots we see today:

Healthcare: Robots in the healthcare industry do everything from assisting in surgery to physical therapy to help people walk to moving through hospitals and delivering essential supplies such as meds or linens. Healthcare robots have even contributed to the ongoing fight against the pandemic, filling and sealing testing swabs and producing respirators.
Homelife: You need look no further than a Roomba to find a robot in someone's house. But they do more now than vacuuming floors; home-based robots can mow lawns or augment tools like Alexa.
Manufacturing: The field of manufacturing was the first to adopt robots, such as the automobile assembly line machines we previously mentioned. Industrial robots handle a various tasks like arc welding, material handling, steel cutting, and food packaging.
Logistics: Everybody wants their online orders delivered on time, if not sooner. So companies employ robots to stack warehouse shelves, retrieve goods, and even conduct short-range deliveries.
Space Exploration: Mars explorers such as Sojourner and Perseverance are robots. The Hubble telescope is classified as a robot, as are deep space probes like Voyager and Cassini.
Military: Robots handle dangerous tasks, and it doesn't get any more difficult than modern warfare. Consequently, the military enjoys a diverse selection of robots equipped to address many of the riskier jobs associated with war. For example, there's the Centaur, an explosive detection/disposal robot that looks for mines and IEDs, the MUTT, which follows soldiers around and totes their gear, and SAFFiR, which fights fires that break out on naval vessels.
Entertainment: We already have toy robots, robot statues, and robot restaurants. As robots become more sophisticated, expect their entertainment value to rise accordingly.
Travel: We only need to say three words: self-driving vehicles.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Robots
Like any innovation today, robots have their plusses and negatives. Here’s a breakdown of the good and bad about robots and the future of robotics.
Advantages

They work in hazardous environments: Why risk human lives when you can send a robot in to do the job? Consider how preferable it is to have a robot fighting a fire or working on a nuclear reactor core.
They’re cost-effective: Robots don’t take sick days or coffee breaks, nor need perks like life insurance, paid time off, or healthcare offerings like dental and vision.
They increase productivity: Robots are wired to perform repetitive tasks ad infinitum; the human brain is not. Industries use robots to accomplish the tedious, redundant work, freeing employees to tackle more challenging tasks and even learn new skills.
They offer better quality assurance: Vigilance decrement is a lapse in concentration that hits workers who repeatedly perform the same functions. As the human’s concentration level drops, the likelihood of errors, poor results, or even accidents increases. Robots perform repetitive tasks flawlessly without having their performance slip due to boredom.

Disadvantages

They incur deep startup costs: Robot implementation is an investment risk, and it costs a lot. Although most manufacturers eventually see a recoup of their investment over the long run, it's expensive in the short term. However, this is a common obstacle in new technological implementation, like setting up a wireless network or performing cloud migration.
They might take away jobs: Yes, some people have been replaced by robots in certain situations, like assembly lines, for instance. Whenever the business sector incorporates game-changing technology, some jobs become casualties. However, this disadvantage might be overstated because robot implementation typically creates a greater demand for people to support the technology, which brings up the final disadvantage.
They require companies to hire skilled support staff: This drawback is good news for potential employees, but bad news for thrifty-minded companies. Robots require programmers, operators, and repair personnel. While job seekers may rejoice, the prospect of having to recruit professionals (and pay professional-level salaries!) may serve as an impediment to implementing robots.
The Future of Robotics: What’s the Use of AI in Robotics?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) increases human-robot interaction, collaboration opportunities, and quality. The industrial sector already has co-bots, which are robots that work alongside humans to perform testing and assembly.
Advances in AI help robots mimic human behavior more closely, which is why they were created in the first place. Robots that act and think more like people can integrate better into the workforce and bring a level of efficiency unmatched by human employees.
Robot designers use Artificial Intelligence to give their creations enhanced capabilities like:

Computer Vision: Robots can identify and recognize objects they meet, discern details, and learn how to navigate or avoid specific items.
Manipulation: AI helps robots gain the fine motor skills needed to grasp objects without destroying the item.
Motion Control and Navigation: Robots no longer need humans to guide them along paths and process flows. AI enables robots to analyze their environment and self-navigate. This capability even applies to the virtual world of software. AI helps robot software processes avoid flow bottlenecks or process exceptions.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Real-World Perception: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) help robots better understand their surroundings, recognize and identify patterns, and comprehend data. These improvements increase the robot’s autonomy and decrease reliance on human agents.


A Word About Robot Software
Software robots are computer programs that perform tasks without human intervention, such as web crawlers or chatbots. These robots are entirely virtual and not considered actual robots since they have no physical characteristics.
This technology shouldn't be confused with robotic software loaded into a robot and determines its programming. However, it's normal to experience overlap between the two entities since, in both cases, the software is helping the entity (robot or computer program) perform its functions independent of human interaction.
The Future of Robotics and Robots
Thanks to improved sensor technology and more remarkable advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, robots will keep moving from mere rote machines to collaborators with cognitive functions. These advances, and other associated fields, are enjoying an upwards trajectory, and robotics will significantly benefit from these strides.
We can expect to see more significant numbers of increasingly sophisticated robots incorporated into more areas of life, working with humans. Contrary to dystopian-minded prophets of doom, these improved robots will not replace workers. Industries rise and fall, and some become obsolete in the face of new technologies, bringing new opportunities for employment and education.
That’s the case with robots. Perhaps there will be fewer human workers welding automobile frames, but there will be a greater need for skilled technicians to program, maintain, and repair the machines. In many cases, this means that employees could receive valuable in-house training and upskilling, giving them a set of skills that could apply to robot programming and maintenance and other fields and industries.
The Future of Robotics: How Robots Will Change the World
Robots will increase economic growth and productivity and create new career opportunities for many people worldwide. However, there are still warnings out there about massive job losses, forecasting losses of 20 million manufacturing jobs by 2030, or how 30% of all jobs could be automated by 2030.
But thanks to the consistent levels of precision that robots offer, we can look forward to robots handling more of the burdensome, redundant manual labor tasks, making transportation work more efficiently, improving healthcare, and freeing people to improve themselves. But, of course, time will tell how this all works out.

The hands-on projects were also perfect for practice; we could use the knowledge we acquired while doing the projects and apply it in real life. prevNextNot sure what you’re looking for?View all Related Programs",BreadcrumbList,https://www.simplilearn.com/future-of-robotics-article,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/The_Future_of_Robotics.jpg', 'height': '506', 'width': '900'}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'John Terra', 'url': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/authors/john-terra'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Simplilearn', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/logo.png', 'width': '200', 'height': '200'}}",The Future of Robotics: How Robots Will Transform Our Lives,2022-04-18T11:33:56+05:30,2024-02-08T14:00:01+05:30,,The Future of Robotics: How Robots Will Transform Our Lives,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.simplilearn.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/resources', 'name': 'Resources'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/resources/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning', 'name': 'AI & Machine Learning'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/future-of-robotics-article', 'name': 'The Future of Robotics: How Robots Will Transform Our Lives'}}]",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.simplilearn.com/future-of-robotics-article'}",,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

								AI needs outpacing new job creation in higher ed, report finds							

								A new report from the nonprofit Educause found that the demand for AI is rising as many educators consider leaving the field.

An Educause report released Monday found higher education jobs related to artificial intelligence have seen the largest increase in time demands since the COVID-19 pandemic and that digital literacy skills are important for future careers in teaching and learning spaces. 
The report surveyed more than 1,000 professionals in positions related to teaching and learning, including top-level administrators to faculty members — most of whom have been in their positions for more than five years. However, many respondents indicated that they are considering leaving higher education due to heavy workloads and burnout. 
“The teaching and learning field is evolving, yet at many institutions, teaching and learning professionals are struggling to keep up because they are currently working in an environment of constraint, having to do much more with much less and only having time to focus only on the most urgent needs,” the report reads.
Workloads have increased across the board in higher education teaching and learning roles — 65% of respondents said they have excessive workloads. Roles related to AI ranked highest in increased in time demands, however there was fairly minimal growth in terms of budgeting to expand those roles. Researchers said this suggests “the demand for AI functions is outpacing the growth in AI staff.”

Most of those who responded to the survey have multiple areas of responsibility, such as added duties related to faculty training and development, distance learning and evaluating new technologies.
A majority of respondents indicated that skills in adaptability, agility and change management are important for sustaining current and future teaching careers, especially AI disrupts education.
Educause recommends in the report that higher education institutions prioritize employee well-being and morale, professional development opportunities and collaboration across campus. One of the top areas higher education institutions can begin to address these concerns is by offering remote or hybrid work options. Sixty-one percent of respondents called job flexibility “very important.” While more universities are offering employees that flexibility, about one-third of the survey’s respondents reported working from “unpreferred locations.”
“Moving forward, institutions will need to find ways to offer support for continuous professional development and training so that their teaching and learning professionals can not only adapt but also thrive,” the report reads.

As generative AI tools become more common, faculty can engage the technology in various ways.
urbazon/E+/Getty Images


Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, educators, administrators and other higher education stakeholders have grappled with the implications of generative artificial intelligence on intellectual property, academic integrity and ethical use, among other topics. 
While the majority of U.S. students have yet to latch on to the trend, they’re still outpacing their instructors, with a Tyton Partners report in October 2023 finding only 22 percent of faculty members utilize AI. 
Among faculty who do use AI, 43 percent are running prompts to understand what their students might be using the tools for, 35 percent are using it to teach and 29 percent are using it for in-class activities, according to the report.

Survey Says 
A November 2023 report from Anthology found 38 percent of students in the U.S. are using generative AI tools at least monthly. A November 2023 study from Chegg found only 20 percent of U.S. students have used generative AI for their coursework. 
In the workforce, only 35 percent of U.S. adults say they are comfortable integrating these tools into work and school, with worries about the accuracy of information also a top concern, according to a University of Phoenix survey from September 2023. 
Across higher education, the main barriers to AI adoption are security concerns, a need for AI training programs and ethical implications, according to a Ellucian survey of administrators in the U.S. from summer 2023. 

Here are four ways faculty members can employ artificial intelligence: 
To improve student writing. Pamela Bourjaily, a business communication professor at the University of Iowa, created an assignment that requires students to experiment with ChatGPT and learn how to create the best prompts. Students learned to edit and revise prompts to produce more accurate and helpful outputs.  To prepare slide decks. Rodney B. Murray, host of the Pulse podcast, used AI-powered tools to put together a presentation for his podcasting course. Murray compares working with MagicSlides and SlidesGPT in design, images and prices.

To provide students with feedback. Harvard University’s Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science course uses an AI tool to highlight areas of code that could be improved, as well as provide solutions. The tool is designed to make the work of TAs and professors more efficient as well as provide students with a personalized learning experience. To provide workforce tools. Following their time in college, today’s learners will encounter AI in the workplace, and it is the responsibility of the institution to prepare them for this experience, Ray Schroeder wrote in a September 2023 blog post for Inside Higher Ed. Learning modules in senior capstone courses or certificates could credential students for their future jobs. Anand Rao, professor of communication at the University of Mary Washington, introduces students to low- and no-code options to build their own generative AI tools in his special topics course on digital studies. 
Food for thought: For educators considering implementing AI into their classrooms, experts in the field share some considerations.

Create guidelines. A September 2023 report from Cornell University’s Center for Teaching and Learning encourages faculty to explicitly set expectations for when and how students can employ generative AI into their work with proper attribution. Ohio University’s Center for Teaching and Learning offers example AI policies and assignments from faculty members at the university to provide a reference point. Teach ethical use. While some institutions are teaching about AI, many lack requirements around teaching students ethics and how they can be ethical users of the technology, particularly in the U.S. Understand limitations. AI is not free from bias and sometimes hallucinates, so teaching students the shortcomings of tools such as ChatGPT can promote better learning and make them more prepared to engage with the resources.

								Oklahoma AI task force recommends government workforce reduction in final report							

								Oklahoma state officials said they partially modeled their AI recommendations off a Japanese economic strategy dating back the 1980s.

Oklahoma’s artificial intelligence task force this week submitted its final recommendations in a report to Gov. Kevin Stitt for how the state can implement artificial intelligence to make government more efficient, including reducing the number of “redundant” government positions throughout the state.
According to the report, 21% of the workforce in Oklahoma is a federal, state or local government employee, which combined with the state’s low unemployment rate, the report argues, creates a challenge for the state’s private sector to find staff. For instance, the report estimates there are 100,000 job vacancies but only 65,000 unemployed Oklahomans to fill them.
However, the task force argues that using AI to perform administrative tasks and other digital services will return some of the available workforce to the private sector and reduce the number of government workers to 13%, calling it “an ideal percentage.”
“AI also has the potential to help us steward taxpayer dollars in a more responsible way by cutting redundant positions and replacing some positions with AI technology. Artificial intelligence creates possibilities for more efficient employment and government services,” Stitt said in a press release announcing the report.

The task force said it based its recommendations on Japan’s economic model, which began incorporating automation into its workforce in the 1980s, when it was able to do the work of three human employees with each robot. The report argues that if Oklahoma were to adopt a similar model using artificial intelligence, the state would reduce public sector human employees by 40% in favor of a more efficient workforce of “digital employees.”
Like many states racing to get ahead of the rapidly advancing technology, Stitt established a task force last September to develop policy and administrative recommendations for implementing artificial intelligence and generative AI throughout state government.
To accomplish a workforce reduction, the task force recommends automating repetitive tasks such as managing public inquiries on government websites and replacing human-staffed call centers with digital employees.
“By automating routine inquiries and responses, AI allows for a more consistent, round-the-clock service, reducing wait times and improving the overall customer experience. This dual advantage of cost reduction and enhanced service quality positions AI as a transformative tool in the customer service industry, offering a compelling case for its widespread adoption.” the report states.
In addition to business and administrative strategies using AI, the task force recommends hiring chief artificial intelligence officers within state agencies to promote the use of AI and manage its risks, following President Biden’s executive order for federal agencies to create such roles.

The task force also emphasized the need for Oklahoma to create ethical guidelines for AI implementation, such as ensuring human oversight and proper data-storage practices.

At the time, the minister had dismissed all talk of AI taking away jobs in India as “nonsense, bakwas”.&nbsp;He had also said that the “advent of Artificial Intelligence is not leading to any job losses,” and that it is only being ""used as a tool for augmenting capability.""&nbsp; New RolesIn his new statement, the minister seemed to hint that these job-losses can be offset by the new ones created by this technological revolution.But ""this will require reskilling and upskilling,” he said.He said his ministry has initiated “FutureSkills PRIME” program giving training in 10 new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence.&nbsp;The program has trained 2.9 lakh youth out of the 16.52 lakh who have signed up, he added. In addition, 2,258 trainers and 10,986 government officials have been trained on these technologies, he added..&nbsp;He also pointed to another program -- YUVAi: Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI -- for familiarizing school students from classes 8th to 12th with AI tech and social skills. It explores the application of AI in eight areas - agriculture, health, education, transportation, environment, rural development, smart cities and law and justice.New Industrial RevolutionMeanwhile, experts believe that the rise of AI is likely to lead to massive unemployment among white-collar workers, such as those who work in finance, law, medicine and technology. In its scale and pain, it is expected to be similar to what was faced by blue-collar workers (artisans) during the time of the first industrial revolution 300 years ago.The jobs most likely to see declines are ones that involve highly repeatable tasks and pattern recognition and those that involve&nbsp; analyzing or processing large volumes of structured data.Algorithms are increasingly able to handle jobs that involve gathering data, processing paperwork, tracking inventories, or interacting with customers.As a result, they can affect jobs such as data entry clerks, administrative assistants and secretaries, accountants &amp; bookkeepers, financial analysts, manufacturing &amp; warehouse workers, retail salespeople, customer service representatives and drivers.Even some blue-collar jobs, such as driving, sales and warehouse management, are also under threat as a combination of advanced robotics and AI enable machines to do physical tasks that they were not able to earlier.The disruption will favor people who are better able to adapt to changes.For example, a customer service rep may have their more routine tasks automated, but transition into more complex complaint and dispute resolution that requires human judgement. Similarly, a financial analyst may spend less time crunching numbers in excel and more time interpreting data patterns identified algorithmically.As for the new jobs that are emerging, they often require very different skill sets compared to those possessed by people who are facing job losses. Among the roles in high demand are AI and robotics engineers, data analysts and automation specialists..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2024/Feb/08/govt-admits-ai-can-lead-to-job-losses-in-india'}",,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2024/Feb/08/govt-admits-ai-can-lead-to-job-losses-in-india', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress/2024-02/ff5e78b3-14c3-4c3a-a5d4-fb50a5e8267f/jobloss.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress/2024-02/ff5e78b3-14c3-4c3a-a5d4-fb50a5e8267f/jobloss.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true,,,2024-02-08T09:23:41Z,,,,,,,,,,
