(This article is part of a series on Artificial Intelligence for Board Members and Senior Executives.)


“We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.” So wrote Anais Nin, rather succinctly describing the unfortunate melange of biases that accompany these otherwise perfectly well-functioning human brains of ours.

In a business context, affinity bias, confirmation bias, attribution bias, and the halo effect, some of the better known of these errors of reasoning, really just scratch the surface. In aggregate, they leave a trail of offenses and errors in their wake.

PROMOTED
Of course, the most pernicious of our human biases are those that prejudice us for or against our fellow humans on the basis of age, race, gender, religion, or physical appearance. Try as we do to purify ourselves, our work environments, and our society from these distortions, they still worm their way into—well, just about everything that we think and do—even modern technologies, like AI. (See If Microsoft Can Be Hacked, What About Your Company? How AI is Transforming Cybersecurity.)

Critics say that AI makes bias worse
Since AI was first deployed in hiring, loan approvals, insurance premium modeling, facial recognition, law enforcement, and a constellation of other applications, critics have—with considerable justification—pointed out the technology’s propensity for bias.

Google’s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), for example, is a leading Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that developers can use to build their own AI. BERT was originally built using Wikipedia text as its principle source. What’s wrong with that? The overwhelming majority of Wikipedia's contributors are white males from Europe and North America. As a result, one of the most important sources of language-based AI began its life with a biased perspective baked-in.

A similar problem was found in Computer Vision, another key area of AI development. Facial recognition datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of annotated faces are critical to the development of facial recognition applications used for cybersecurity, law enforcement, and even customer service. It turned out, however, that the (presumably mostly white, middle-aged male) developers unconsciously did a better job achieving accuracy for people like themselves. Error rates for women, children, the elderly, and people of color were much higher than those for middle-aged white men. As a result, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft were forced to cease sales of their facial recognition technology to law enforcement in 2020, for fear that these biases would result in wrongful identification of suspects.

For more on all of this, I encourage you to watch the important and sometimes-chilling documentary Coded Bias.
What if AI is actually part of the solution to bias? 
A better understanding of the phenomenon of bias in AI reveals, however, that AI merely exposes and amplifies implicit biases that already existed, but were overlooked or misunderstood. AI itself is agnostic to color, gender, age, and other biases. It is not vulnerable to the logical fallacies and cognitive biases that trouble humans. The only reason we see bias in AI at all is because of heuristical errors and biased data that humans sometimes train it with.
Since the discovery of the biases stated above (a PR disaster, I assure you), all of the major technology companies have been working to improve datasets and eliminate bias. One way to eliminate bias in AI?—by using AI! If that seems unlikely, read on.
Using AI to Eliminate Bias in Hiring
The classic example can be found in job opportunities. Across the spectrum of the most-coveted employment opportunities, women and people of color are notoriously under-represented. The phenomenon is self-perpetuating, as new hires become senior leaders, and they become responsible for hiring. Affinity bias ensures that “people like me” continue to get hired, while attribution bias justifies those choices on the basis of past hires’ performance.
But when AI is given a bigger role in recruiting, this can change. Tools like Textio, Gender Decoder, and Ongig use AI to scrutinize job descriptions for hidden biases around gender and other characteristics. Knockri, Ceridian, and Gapjumpers use AI to remove or ignore characteristics that identify gender, national origin, skin color, and age, so that hiring managers can focus purely on candidates’ qualifications and experience. Some of these solutions also reduce recency bias, affinity bias, and gender bias from the interview process by evaluating candidates’ soft skills on an objective basis or altering a candidate’s phone voice to mask their gender.
Removing Bias in Venture Capital Decision Making with AI
A similar approach can be taken in the world of venture capital, where men comprise 80% of partners and women, receive just 2.2% of all investment, despite being founders of 40% of new startups. The UK accelerator Founders Factory, for instance, wrote software that short-lists program candidates on the basis of identifiable entrepreneurial success characteristics. Likewise, the female-run non-profit F4capital developed a “FICO score for Startups,” which profiles startups’ maturity, opportunity, and risk as a means to eliminate bias in the venture decision-making process. This approach should be adopted widely not just because it is the ethical thing to do, but because it delivers better returns— as much as 184% higher than investments made without the help of AI.
Reducing Cognitive Bias with AI in the Medical Field
AI can also help make better decisions in healthcare. Medical diagnostic company Flow Health, for instance, is committed to the use of AI to overcome the cognitive biases that it says doctors often use to diagnose patients. The “availability heuristic,” for instance, encourages physicians to make a diagnosis that is common, but sometimes incorrect, while the “anchoring heuristic” leads them to stick to incorrect initial diagnoses, even when new information contradicts them. I believe that AI will become an essential part of the fast-approaching world of data-driven, personalized medicine.
Other Areas where AI Can Reduce Common Biases
AI can even help reduce less malignant, but still very powerful biases that too often cloud our business judgment. Consider the bias (in English-speaking countries) towards information published in English versus other languages, the bias in the startup world against older people, despite their greater knowledge and experience, and the bias in manufacturing to use the same vendors and methods, rather than trying new, and potentially better ways. Don’t forget the biases that lead executives in supply chain management and investors on Wall Street to make emotional, short-term decisions during hard economic times.
Giving AI a role to play in all of these areas is a useful check against unrecognized biases in your decision-making process.
AI can even be used to reduce bias in AI
If to err is human, AI may be the solution we need to avoid the costly and unethical outcomes of our hidden biases. But what about the intrusion of those biases into the AI itself? If AI misinterprets biased data and amplifies biased human heuristics, how can it ever be a useful solution?
There are now tools designed to weed out implicit human and data biases that surreptitiously make their way into Artificial Intelligence. The What-If tool, developed by Google’s People and AI Research team (PAIR), allows developers to probe the performance of AI using a broad library of “fairness indicators” while PWC’s Bias Analyzer tool, IBM Research’s AI Fairness 360 tool and O’Reilly’s LIME tool each helps you identify the existence of bias in your AI code.
If you are a senior executive or a board member thinking about ways that AI might be able to reduce bias in your organization (this is, after all, why I write this column), I urge you to think about AI as a promising new weapon in your arsenal, not as a silver bullet that will solve the problem in its entirety. Holistically and practically speaking, you still need to create bias reduction benchmarks, train your staff to recognize and avoid hidden biases, and collect outside feedback from customers, vendors, or consultants. Not only are bias audits a good idea, in some instances, they are the law.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, and how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, I encourage you to stay tuned. I write (almost) exclusively about how senior executives, board members, and other business leaders can use AI effectively.

In 2019, the drug discovery process took ~15 yearsOpens a new window  and cost several billion dollars.
Today, it takes four to five years, on average, to search for a new drug candidate.
Innovative companies produce first-in-class drug compounds within seven months.
Artificial intelligence solves drug-discovery problems in much less time and at a much lower cost.
While some of the world’s brightest minds work in this industry, it doesn’t take a PhD in quantum science and engineering to predict that AI would make a fine lab partner. That’s a no-brainer. But even the most intelligent people have limitations, so they invented AI to to handle abundant data efficiently and extract information pertinent to projects and pipelines.
Why AI for Drug Discovery?
In short, AI produces better results faster. The technology allows researchers to discover new drug candidates, advance treatment of diseases from cancer to Crohn’s, and reap the advantage of scale without the false-start drawbacks associated with traditional research and development methods.
AI can provide new answers in biology and chemistry that humans have not yet considered. Standigm, for example, has novel target identification (biology) and lead generation (chemistry) AI – proprietary platforms that generate commercially valuable drug pipelines. By contrast, humans cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing scientific literature. Manual information gathering and expert-only knowledge can only take biotech so far. AI can overcome many more constraints and challenges in the drug discovery industry.
Molecule Modeling and Prediction
Target identification is a big challenge in therapeutics. Although most AI-based drug discovery companies focus on creating new compounds and re-creating new drugs, only a few companies have the technology to discover new targets.  AI streamlines target research. Modeling provides evidence for prediction and significantly improves the success rate.
Based on the vast biomedical information known to date, deep-learning knowledge graph analysis can align specific diseases with the proteins capable of targeting them. AI drug discovery companies are developing methodologies for scoring and ranking protein candidates and disease candidates expected to target specific proteins. Random-walk models apply RNA profile data. Metabolic models incorporate genetic information. Meta-learning-based drug-target binding predictors produce higher prediction accuracy and outperform baseline models.
Modern novel-compound lead design outshines traditional methods by applying advanced algorithms – Monet, NoSH, ChemMap, and IDEA-STAR for deep-learning-based structure/substructure optimization, scaffold hopping, and active learning – to generate patentable lead compounds for given targets.
Molecule modeling, including efficient models to encode graphs, is a key challenge of molecular representation learning. Transformer is a natural choice for graph processing but requires explicit incorporation of positional information. Existing approaches either linearize a graph to encode absolution position in the sequence of nodes – which loses the precision of relative position from linearization – or use bias terms to encode a relative position with another node – which loses the tight integration of node-edge and node-spatial information. Relative positional encoding, however, lacks these weaknesses. Methods to encode a graph without linearization, considering both node-spatial relation and node-edge relation, are more successful.
More sophisticated modeling and simulation methods are making more accurate predictions, including receiver conformer generation, ligand pose prediction, enviable docking, and free energy permission. Scientists then work to optimize the structure of lead compounds concerning the desired chemical properties, such as biological activities and ADME/Tox properties. Researchers can use this information to select the best molecule for further investigation. Down the line, they can determine whether making a compound would be easy or difficult.
Performing this advanced modeling first will eliminate a lot of trial-and-error experimentation later. Rather than doubling down on the time-consuming, people-intensive, physical experiments, biotech companies are pouring efforts into improving AI/machine learning (ML) approaches.
Automated Molecular Design Workflow AI
Other AI drug discovery trends include platforms that generate new drug candidates for a given target, and platforms that mine data from already-approved drugs for drug repurposing. What sets modern, innovative drug discovery endeavors above and apart from competitors is a more advanced iteration of artificial intelligence called Workflow AI, an automated molecular design workflow that can cover the entire drug discovery process.
Workflow AI will one day complete a closed-loop system of interconnected AI platforms whereby any data produced in any project is fed back for continuous improvement. This type of machine learning will reduce the resources necessary to secure patentable lead compounds inhibiting a novel drug target.

Competition vs. Shared Experience
Competition for drug and AI algorithm patents may be fierce, and production of platforms may be proprietary, yet still some of the best resources out there are free and readily available to researchers anywhere. A public user interface that essentially hands anyone the keys to one of the core functions of modern drug discovery. Scientists can enter the interactive environment – an AI-based target-identification platform with natural language processing technology combined with a pharmaceutical research platform – to explore, experiment, and discover new targets. The interface offers to prioritize protein targets for a given disease, then provides results on a graph with evidence of key paths among the disease-target connections.
The open interface offers a simple search bar to collect information from thousands of pages of scientific literature as well as numerous biomedical databases. It extracts the latest updates on gene-disease association from textual data, like scientific publication abstracts. Users can also check out a customized database where scientists and developers in the research ecosystem (pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, and academic institutions) can add their data to potentially uncover new targets. The interface has encouraged drug discovery research in specialized fields, including rare-disease areas.
The Ultimate Goal in AI Drug Discovery
AI drug discovery companies are quickly partnering, both publicly and privately, with pharmaceutical giants, biopharma companies, universities, and research institutes. Together, their pipelines are producing strong opportunities for treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Crohn’s disease, mitochondrial disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic liver disease (NASH), conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, and the list goes on. The collaborations will change the medical world and the world at large.

A major step forward in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for scientific discovery in the field of stem cell research was recently reported1, reflecting the continued growth of the technology and stressing the need for clarification on patents for AI-generated work.  
Kanda et al. created a humanoid robotic AI system that can plan and execute experiments to develop optimized protocols for differentiation of stem cells into desired therapeutically relevant cell types. In particular, the system tested cell culture conditions for differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into retinal pigment epithelial cells (iPSC-RPE cells) based on a pre-optimized protocol, evaluated the results of particular cell culture conditions by image analysis of pigment producing cells, and planned the next experiments based on the results to develop an improved protocol for producing iPSC-RPE cells. The AI system tested 143 different conditions from 200 million possible parameter combinations in 111 days to achieve 88% better iPSC-RPE generation compared to the preexisting protocol. Accordingly, Kanda et al. concluded that the robotic AI system could drastically accelerate “systematic and unbiased exploration of experimental search space, suggesting immense use in medicine and research.” 
It should be noted that the tests relied on using a pre-optimized protocol that narrowed down the search space, and the chosen cellular system is particularly conducive for AI systems to handle because pigment producing cells can be easily evaluated by image processing to score the tested protocol. Optimizing protocols for producing cells when the initial protocol is not as well established as for iPSC-RPE cells, and when the evaluation score is a more complex cellular function than pigment production, may still be challenging for AI systems without any human intervention. Nevertheless, the progress reported by Kanda et al. marks a notable benchmark in using AI to boost scientific discovery in stem cell research, as a very large experimental search space could be explored over relatively short time without human intervention.
With AI and machine learning increasingly used for scientific discovery and innovation as reflected by Kanda et al., it is important to note that AI systems and AI-generated work pose a challenge for the patent system. For example, an AI system itself cannot be a patent inventor because, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the inventor must be a “natural person.”2 Accordingly, if an invention is based on experiments proposed and executed by an AI system without any human intervention, disputes concerning inventorship could arise. Stakeholders should take great care to identify inventions generated by AI systems and human counterparts to ensure that the intellectual property is protected.

(Gabby Jones/Bloomberg News)By  Naomi NixJuly 19, 2022 at 5:00 a.m. EDTFacebook was one of an array of companies to dramatically restructure remote work during the coronavirus pandemic, allowing employees to continue working from home while they avoided the spread of covid-19.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeNow, Facebook Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams said there was an unexpected benefit to that workplace overhaul: it helped the company recruit and retain workers from underrepresented groups.In the United States, remote job offers were more likely to be filled by people of color, people with disabilities and veterans, according to the company’s annual diversity report. Around the world, candidates who accepted remote job offers were also more likely to be women, the company found.Story continues below advertisementAmong existing employees, people from underrepresented groups were more likely to opt to work remotely, according to Williams. She said the company is still studying why people from underrepresented groups are choosing remote work, but speculated some workers are seeking to locate where they feel more at home.Advertisement“Silicon Valley was never a place where Black people were predominant,” Williams said in an interview with The Post. “So you are seeing people choose places like Atlanta, New York.”For some workers, office mandates aren’t just a pain. They’re harmful.The report illuminates how the workforce at Facebook, which last year renamed itself Meta, is evolving as the company continues to expand its remote work options after pandemic-induced lockdowns subside. After more than two years of letting employees work from home, Facebook, like many companies, is evaluating the impact of these changes.Story continues below advertisementFacebook gradually made some remote options more permanent last year. Any Facebook worker can now ask to work remotely, and nearly 90 percent of such requests are granted, according to the company. Employees who opt to work remotely may receive an adjustment in their pay if they move to a location with a different cost of living.AdvertisementWorkers can also choose to work at home, under rules determined by their individual teams. Roughly 75 percent of Facebook teams have employees working together from different geographic locations, according to the company.💻Follow TechnologyFollowBetween 2021 and 2022, Facebook saw slight jumps in the share of Black, Hispanic, multiracial and Asian employees in its U.S. workforce, while White workers dropped by 1.5 percentage points, according to the report. Leaders at the company also became more diverse, with the share of Black and Hispanic managers increasing by less than half a percentage point, it said. The share of women leaders increased from 35.5 percent in 2021 to 36.7 percent in 2022.Story continues below advertisementOverall, the share of women in the workforce increased to 37.1 percent in 2022 from 36.7 percent in 2021, according to the report.AdvertisementRemote work might be particularly attractive to people of color who are more likely to experience subtle — and often unintended — expressions of bias, known as microaggressions, in the workplace. They might, for instance, be mistaken for another colleague of the same race or be pressured to discuss a traumatizing news event related to their community. Working from home is a layer of protection against these situations.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextAppeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment planSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.The Persian Gulf is enduring life-threatening heat indexes above 140 degreesSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Paul Hollywood is right: Don’t refrigerate breadSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Bob Newhart, who went from standup comedy to sitcom star, dies at 94SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Social anxiety can be limiting.

Meanwhile, 52 percent of women around the world reported that they wanted work location flexibility at least three days a week, compared with just 46 percent of men.AdvertisementBut Facebook’s continued push to diversify its workforce is likely to face some challenges, especially as tech companies slow their hiring amid concerns of a looming recession sparked by rising interest rates.Silicon Valley braces for tech pullback after a decade of decadenceThe social media giant’s stock has declined more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year as it faces a barrage of marketplace pressures, including competition from upstarts such as TikTok. Facebook executives have already indicated that they are reevaluating their current workforce makeup to address the mounting pressures.Williams, the company’s chief diversity officer, said Facebook has strategies to continue diversifying its workforce despite the company’s mounting economic challenges.“Look it’s been a challenge from the jump. That’s the truth,” she said. “We are very hyper focused on how are we going to do this given the current environment.”Share12 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Monarch Tractors, maker of a fully-electric, driver-optional, smart tractor, has entered a partnership with Einsite, an India-based start-up specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine vision analytics.



Einsite uses machine-mounted and camera sensors to capture site activity, and in-cab edge computers to form insights to help managers make better decisions. The company has already deployed its tech on several construction sites and mines across the United States and India. In its partnership with Monarch, the Einsite engineering team will be working on the development of edge applications, autonomy models, and algorithms.

""Edge AI"" is the deployment of AI applications in devices used in the physical world, according to Nvidia Corporation. It's named ""edge"" because the computation is done near the user at the edge of the network, close to where the data is located, rather than being relayed to a central cloud computing facility or data center. This reduces latency in computing and can mean accelerated data analysis and faster decision-making by the AI.







For Monarch, edge AI means the tractor can filter, analyze, and make decisions locally on the tractor itself, instead of sending the sensory data over the cloud for processing. In agriculture, where limited data connectivity is often a challenge for farmers, Monarch's tractors can't rely on data availability to function. The edge AI, along with Monarch's other technology, allows the tractor to operate without internet connection.

""We have found strong synergy with Einsite in both our missions and areas of work,"" says Praveen Penmetsa, co-founder and CEO of Monarch Tractor. ""Einsite's mission of making dynamic, outdoor industries more productive aligns with our goal of modernizing the farm.""

This partnership is part of Monarch's plan to expand its footprint in India, with the opening of its first office in the city of Hyderabad. Penmetsa says Monarch and Einsite are in the same technology space using vision AI technology to increase the efficiency of operations, namely in farming and construction, making them a natural partner for the new office.



""We're proud to partner with the Monarch team and share our joint expertise to maximize autonomous solutions that enable farmers to achieve new levels of productivity,"" says Anirudh Reddy, founder of Einsite.

These biases result in biased machine learning models since data from tech platforms is later utilized to train them..Facebook started allowing advertisers to specifically target ads based on race, gender, and religion in 2019. For example, women were given preference in employment advertisements for nursing or secretarial positions, whereas job advertisements for janitors and taxi drivers were mostly displayed to men, particularly those from minority backgrounds..As a result, Facebook will no longer permit businesses to tailor their ads based on age, gender, or race..Amazon's biased recruiting tool.In 2014, Amazon started working on an AI technology to streamline the hiring procedure. Their research focused primarily on screening resumes and assessing candidates using AI-powered algorithms, saving recruiters' time from manual resume screening activities. Amazon, however, noticed in 2015 that its new AI hiring algorithm was biased against women and was not objectively grading candidates..Amazon had trained their AI model using historical data going back ten years. Since men predominated in the IT field and made up 60% of Amazon's workforce, historical data held biases against women. As a result, Amazon's hiring software mistakenly discovered that male candidates were preferred. The term &quot;women's,&quot; as in &quot;women's chess club captain,&quot; was penalized on resumes. As a result, Amazon ceased applying the algorithm to hiring..Racial bias in healthcare risk algorithm.More than 200 million Americans use a health risk-prediction system, but it showed racial bias because it employed a flawed criterion to assess need..The algorithm was created to identify patients who would probably benefit from additional medical attention; however, it was later discovered that the program was giving incorrect findings that favored white patients over black patients..The algorithm's creators substituted prior patients' medical expenses for actual medical needs. Since wealth and race are strongly associated metrics, this was a poor interpretation of the historical information because the algorithm produced false findings when assumptions were based on only one component of the linked metrics..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — The U.S. Department of Defense has selected George Karniadakis, a Brown University professor of applied math and engineering, as a 2022 Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellow.
Karniadakis is one of nine scientists and engineers from across the nation to receive the fellowship — the most prestigious research grant award from the Department of Defense, named for Vannevar Bush, who directed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development after World War II. In line with Bush’s vision, the fellowship aims to advance transformative, university-based fundamental research. Each fellow receives up to $3 million over a five-year term to pursue cutting-edge fundamental research.
Karniadakis was at a scientific conference in Oslo, Norway, when he learned that he had been selected for the fellowship.
“The director of basic research at the U.S. Department of Defense, Dr. Bindu Nair, called me via Zoom and asked me if I had enough bandwidth to take on this project,” Karniadakis said. “I told her that of course, this is a major priority for me. Dr. Nair responded, ‘Well then, congratulations!’ I was very happy.”
A focus of Karniadakis’ research is machine learning for scientific computing, and his team at Brown has been developing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that can be used in artificial intelligence applications. He said that all mobile platforms, including robots, airplanes and self-driving cars, have sensors that accumulate data. The processing of this data by supercomputers based on the current class of artificial neurons, or artificial neural networks, is not only wildly expensive in terms of financial cost but also in terms of energy.
His new objective is to accelerate PINNs by a factor of 1,000 using spiking neural networks, which function more like human neurons and consume much less energy. Large companies like Intel and IBM have recently built computers that can be used for this new generation of neural networks.

It has become urgent to speed up efforts to restructure Singapore's workforce in order to promote sustained future and growth as the country navigates its post-pandemic course. In order to achieve this, businesses must improve their capacity to generate new, in-demand positions, alter existing job roles, and upskill employees to acquire skills that will be essential to their success in the future.With new technologies, artificial intelligence and automation emerging in workplaces at a rapid pace, the future of work is likely to look vastly different from how it does today. So, how is Singapore future-proofing in such an environment? Let&rsquo;s take a look.Future proofing employees through re-skilling and upskillingThe workplace of the future is already here, and employees' current abilities will either need to be updated or will become obsolete far faster than in the past. It has never been more important for businesses to retrain and upskill their workforce. By 2025, more than half of all employees will need to reskill or upskill in order to remain competitive, according to World Economic Forum research.Since 2008, upskilling and reskilling the workforce has been a national priority for Singapore. In his speech introducing the Singapore Budget 2022 this year, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated the importance of empowering and preparing Singaporeans for their lifelong journey to learn new skills and hone existing ones.There has never been a clearer need for firms to retrain and upskill their workforce. Employees are less inclined to look for jobs at other organisations when they feel their employer is investing in their growth and development.To help local enterprises and workers adapt to changing economic conditions and continuously update their skills, Singapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has launched several initiatives including SkillsFuture for Enterprises (SFE) and Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) among others that aim to invest in and future proof employees through re-skilling and digitising employment services.Forging ahead with the most favourable hiring outlook in almost 11 years For the second quarter of this year, employers in Singapore have voiced the most optimistic recruiting outlook in over 11 years.From a peak of 3.6% to 2.2%, unemployment rates continued to move downward to pre-pandemic levels.In recent years, MOM has assisted many job searchers in moving into new opportunities by helping firms hire and invest in the abilities of a larger pool of job seekers. It also secured local-foreign complementarity and encouraged corporate transformation through revised work pass criteria. Aside from these unusual measures, the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package and the Jobs Growth Incentive were also implemented with the intention of preserving human capital and increasing local hiring.Singapore&rsquo;s digital economy to reach USD22 billion by 2025The Singaporean government stated in Budget 2022 that it will allocate an additional $200 million over the following few years to programmes that improve the digital capabilities of firms and employees. Among these is the TechSkills Accelerator, which aims to train a workforce with knowledge of information and communication technologies for Singapore's digital economy.Singapore's Internet economy had a value of $9 billion in 2020, according to recent research by Google and Temasek, but it may increase by another 19 percent a year to reach a value of USD22 billion by 2025.Ageing gracefully: Leveraging Singapore&rsquo;s silver workforceThe workforce in Singapore is coping with the dual problems of an ageing population and technological job displacement. Singapore's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung claims that for the past 20 years, the government has been preparing for the challenge of an ageing workforce. Between 2016 and 2030, employees aged over 50 will be the fastest growing demographic and their number is projected to increase by 55 percent, representing 40 percent of the workforce.The new policy brings the most awaited change with the raising of Singapore&rsquo;s retirement age from 62 to 65, as well as the re-employment age from 67 to 70, by 2030.Refresh Singapore&rsquo;s retirement, re-employment framework and strengthening older workers&rsquo; retirement adequacy in order to promote inclusive and progressive workplaces that value silver workers has been proven as a great step towards creating a progressive workplaces for its ageing population.Upgrading, uplifting, and upholding the workforceSingapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Manpower (MOM)is aiming to support businesses in hiring and investing in the skills of a wider pool of jobseekers, and helping job seekers move into new opportunities. Through regularised work pass needs, it is also trying to ensure local-foreign complementarity and spurred business transformation.MOM&rsquo;s priorities are focusing on three UPs: Upgrade, Uplift, and Uphold. The focus is to upgrade the capabilities of locals and the complementarity of foreigners. As the nature of employment changes for an increasing proportion of the workforce, one thing is clear - the new normal requires a new approach to ensure a sustained future, especially during a time of rising uncertainty. In conclusion, an openness to adopting flexible workforce strategies, relooking at job design and considering remote talents is crucial to becoming a future-ready nation.",,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com,,

Today, Israel National Digital Agency CEO, Shira Lev Ami, spoke at the plan launch conference on the relation between the government Data revolution and the promotion of AI in the public sector.  Lev-Ami: ""Our challenge is to create smart solutions to the core challenges of Israeli society and to improve public service. You can look at AI as the luxury penthouse built over a multistory building of Data & Digital infrastructure. I wish I could say that our current main challenge is on the AI floor. However, the reality is that on the way to building this penthouse floor, we still have a lot of work to do. You have to build the foundations of this building, and step up gradually, through Data collection, Data processing, making Data accessible to researchers, digital transformation of the government. This building does not have an elevator that takes you straight to the roof floor. Therefore, Israel National Digital Agency currently being established, has set itself the goal of making a leap forward in the government's ability to use Data & Digital in order to work smartly for the citizens. Investing in government Data and making it accessible to the industry, academy and the government itself, will lead to Data-driven decision-making, improved service to the public, and a leap forward in the effectiveness of government activity, for the benefit of health, welfare, education, and economy in Israel.

The riders with these kinds of helmets will automatically be booked for not wearing a helmet. The public should wear the ISI-marked helmet not to avoid fines but for their safety.""According to the department, traffic cops currently depend on enforcement cameras installed at junctions to identify violators. Staff at the Traffic Management Centre can zoom and pan the camera and click photos of vehicles which jump traffic signals or cross stoplines and book cases.The department has already completed a pilot to test the efficiency of RLVD cameras. As part of this, the department had installed RLVD cameras at Kodigehalli (near Hebbal), MG Road, and Hosur Road for a short period.During trial period, jurisdictional traffic police rode two-wheelers and drove four-wheelers at those junctions in violation of traffic rules to check if the RLVD could detect the same. The results were positive, the department said, prompting it to take a decision of installing the cameras initially at 50 junctions.""We operated two-wheelers and cars violating one-way, using mobile, jumping signals, riding without helmets and driving without a seatbelt. We noted down the timings and the type of violation we had committed intentionally to check the authenticity of the camera. Later, we checked the data recorded and stored by the camera.

In this post-pandemic era, it has become a prerequisite for SaaS organizations to realign their business processes with Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI brings several capabilities, such as complexity, scalability, adaptability, and product customization. Not just these, the adoption of AI also helps businesses make data-driven decisions.
While all business aspects have benefited from the adoption of AI, Customer Success has been among the top. AI has significantly impacted how businesses deliver a customer experience, leading to customer success.
Several factors leading to customer success – easy onboarding, quick support, and engagement activities – have become more efficient with the adoption of AI.
Global CSMs have already identified this, and according to them, AI is here to stay and do more for customer success. In this article, we will see how AI is helping Customer Success today and how it will impact the future.
We have carried out a comprehensive customer success survey for 2022 that has helped us provide invaluable insights to you. So, without further ado, let us dig deep into the world of artificial intelligence and the future of customer success.
AI and Customer Success: In the Present
System intelligence is one of the biggest strengths of Artificial Intelligence. “AI collects and analyzes customer data, provides in-depth insights, and thus builds intelligent systems,” says Boris Jabes, CEO of Census. CSMs can personalize their offerings and communication by making these intelligent systems the source. This way, organizations can achieve greater customer success and improve service revenues.
AI applications also ensure that used customer data is not siloed and is distributed easily via a knowledge base among CSM, customer service, financials, and selling systems. Thus, there is very little chance for data-blind spots; with a real-time flow of customer and financial data, it is much more efficient for CSM platforms to have a 360-degree view of the customers.
Further, these knowledge bases also help teams to –

Use the insights to come up with new and innovative solutions.
Navigate the relevant customer data.
Help identify the data/ areas that are no longer relevant.
Giving recommendations to solve current and future issues.

Customer success automation has been yet another interesting benefit brought forward by AI. “For any business to succeed, it is important that the organization as a whole work towards making all possible efforts to keep its customers happy and satisfied throughout their journey,” says Joey Sasson, Vice President of Sales & Logistics at Moving APT.
A key resource for taking up the responsibility is the CSM. They play an intermediary between the organization and the customer, ensuring that the customers face no issues with the product or the brand. They keep monitoring customer actions at different touchpoints, from customer onboarding to post-purchase feedback and renewal of the product.
Additionally, CSMs are also responsible for crafting and engaging customer experiences that will foster positive and long-term customer relationships. This is a time extensive and also demands a lot of effort and dedication. The CSMs need access to data from almost all organization departments, including marketing and sales, product departments, finance, etc.
Artificial intelligence walks in to make this job much easier while also enhancing its productivity. For instance, it derives proper patterns from customer data and helps understand what exactly a customer needs and desires. It also shows potential data gaps and provides options for how to fill them.
So far, we have discussed AI’s ability to collect and analyze data. However, its abilities to predict future actions is also worthy of mentioning. Along with data collection and generation of valuable customer insights, AI can predict the customers’ future actions based on its predictive analytics capabilities. Now, this ability is quite futuristic and can help CSMs develop better customer nurturing and gain new customers.
AI and Customer Success: In the Future
When discussing the future of customer success, AI will cast a lasting impression on how services are delivered. As we are already seeing, AI increases the precision with which organizations get in touch with customers. At the same time, it also helps create greater levels of engagement with potential customers.
One of the biggest examples of this is using artificial customer service agents. AI-powered intelligent agents leverage automation to deliver next-level responsiveness. This may not be possible with humans.

Today, we can see that Al agents are already replacing human customer service agents at some levels. However, after a certain point, customers show more confidence in engaging with human executives to solve their issues and resolve queries. This, too, is facilitated by AI – the machine listens to and records discussions in real time and then feeds this information to the human representative. Based on this, the human executive provides appropriate resolution.
This can be a very valuable asset for the future because the scale at which the AI assistants deliver their services is quite fast, something that is not achievable for humans. Therefore, AI assistants and human representatives’ support can make a huge difference in how customer service is delivered.
Self-service is yet another AI capability set to change the future of customer success. AI has made self-service interfaces a reality. We have already seen them, and they will become commonplace shortly. With self-service, customers are empowered to decide their course of action without any intervention. It is also much more convenient and time-saving. Additionally, using the customer data gathered earlier, AI can offer predictions and insights so the services can be personalized for individual customers. CSMs say they have seen a significant increase in customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
Cost efficiency is another benefit of AI. While this is often overlooked owing to other impressive benefits of AI, the cost-effectiveness of AI adoption makes it invaluable for the future.
AI will certainly make self-service interfaces a reality shortly. However, AI can also capture and analyze data to achieve an excellent customer service experience. Al can help identify customer issues, determine preferences based on past choices, and respond with a most-suited solution. Studies hint that personalization will be the key in the future, and AI is a perfect solution to offer personalized offers, solutions, suggestions, and even resolve queries before they arrive.
Here are some of the benefits of AI that although may look superficial may overpower the end results. AI-powered assistants are available 24/7, and at the same time, they automate most of the tasks performed by human representatives. Thus, they save on the expenditure of most intermediatory resources.
Wrapping it up
All organizations, especially the ones offering SaaS products, need to amplify their efforts to satisfy their customers and ensure customer success. AI is a way to do this, especially as the business scenarios become more and more customer-centric.
PS: While AI is definitely an asset to Customer Success, and it is already replacing the need for human agents at certain points, human interferences are still required to operate the tools.
