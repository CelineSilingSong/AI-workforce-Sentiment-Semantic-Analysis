Lessons learned from recent academic progress and industry adoption of AI


Introduction

A few years ago, it was hard to find anyone to have a serious discussion about Artificial Intelligence (AI) outside academic institutions. Today, nearly everyone talks about AI. Like any new major technology trend, the new wave of making AI and intelligent systems a reality is creating curiosity and enthusiasm. People are jumping on its bandwagon adding not only great ideas but also in many cases a lot of false promises and sometimes misleading opinions.
PROMOTED
Built by giant thinkers and academic researchers, AI adoption by industries and further development in academia around the globe is progressing at a faster rate than anyone had excepted. Accelerated by the strong belief that our biological limitations are increasingly becoming a major obstacle towards creating smart systems and machines that work with us to better use our biological cognitive capabilities to achieve higher goals. This is driving an overwhelming wave of demands and investments across industries to apply AI technologies to solve real-world problems and create smarter machines and new businesses.
AI overcame many obstacles over the last decades mainly on the academic side. However, it is facing now one of its major challenges so far, that is the adoption in real-world industry scenarios and the myths and misunderstanding surrounding it. Unfortunately, with confusing and conflicting messages about what AI can and can’t do, it is challenging for industry leaders to distinguish between facts and fiction in the rapidly crowded and noisy ecosystem of enthusiasts, platform vendors, and service providers. However, once the dust settles down and things get clear, the truth of AI will endure, eventually losers and winners will be declared.
The challenge is how industry leaders would have a realistic opinion about what AI can and can’t do for their business and continuously update it so that they can lead their organizations to apply AI in the right way in solving real-world problems and transform their businesses. Also, academics and AI practitioners have the responsibility to get out of their bubble and engage with industry experts to be able to further develop the academic foundations of AI in a way that would make its real-world adoption faster, more rewarding and responsible.

The current “messy” state of AI adoption in industries

Over the last few years, business leaders from nearly every industry have been trying to understand the new magical technology called Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how their businesses can benefit from it. Unfortunately, until now most of the implementations of AI-powered solutions haven’t gone beyond Proof of Concepts (PoCs) in the form of scattered Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with a limited scope. While this level and approach of AI adoption is wasting many opportunities and resources for companies, it has helped to convince business and IT leaders that Artificial Intelligence can drive transformative and relevant innovation.
Many PoC projects today are using basically simple statistical methods to add some simple prediction or classification capabilities to their analytics solutions and call it AI solutions. This is still defined as analytics or possibly advanced analytics which still needs extensive human intervention in understanding the outcome and make a decision or take an action.
As the business processes and operational conditions continuously change, the newly generated data and the continual changes in different business factors are reducing the level of precision and the value such algorithms can offer rendering them over time to be useless or even lead to dangerous decisions.
Such an approach and its outcome are just another part of the frustrating reality that is confusing business leaders and hindering the right adoption of sophisticated AI technologies in the appropriate way to gain valuable results.
The current approach of trying to squeeze in few Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in some business areas for quick gains is alone a risk and might cause a setback to AI adoption across industries triggering another “AI winter” this time on the industry side not on the academic side. Applying even mature AI technologies in such a way might add some values but could add new dangerous “artificial stupidity” to the organization with catastrophic consequences.

Over the next years, companies can’t afford to continue accepting a status of confusion and hesitation around what AI can and can't do, how it can be integrated with other technologies to create intelligent solutions or machines and where to apply it appropriately.

Over the next few sections, I’ll highlight some of the current myths and misunderstanding overshadowing the reality of AI and hindering its right adoption. I’ll also share some ideas on how to overcome them to accelerate the real-world adoption of AI and reduce the risks to business and societies.

The curse of scattered ML algorithms

Over the last few years, some motivated business leaders started AI initiatives on their own and within their business areas using open source ML libraries focusing on a few key decisions to optimize. Those efforts were usually not part of an organized company-wide plan. While such efforts added some values and helped different teams to have the first experience in using AI capabilities to solve some business problems, it resulted in scattered ML algorithms on the loose across organizations. Unfortunately, such scattered ML algorithms don’t fully unlock the values hidden in the data nor tap into valuable business knowledge organizations have. Furthermore, they add potential risks to companies.
Some of the main risks that scattered ML algorithms bring are:

Algorithms might be trained using a limited set of features and data resulting in the wrong or sometimes dangerous business decisions either inside or outside the business area.
While optimizing local operational decisions, such algorithms might unintentionally negatively affect other business areas or even global operations.
Such individual algorithms can be easily manipulated and mislead in making wrong decisions by internal or external actors adding a major new category of cybersecurity risks.
Training some machine learning algorithms might require expensive computing power adding high costs to small business units. In many cases this caused business units to abandon AI completely based on the false impression of high costs of adoption.

Usually, most if not all business functional and operational units are directly connected. The data they generate, the knowledge they create and the roles they adhere to are shared and are interdependent. AI can see some interdependencies and relationships in huge amounts of data and features which humans usually can't see. This could be used to create a strong data and knowledge platform enabling cross-organization distributed AI systems converting the scattered nature of data, knowledge, and decision making from weakness to a major strength.

Organizations must act quickly to consolidate all AI initiatives and the ML algorithms on the loose and move them to a standard enterprise-grade secure AI platform within an overall AI adoption strategy.

This would enable distributed yet interconnected AI solutions offering intelligence where the decision needs to be made with maximum benefits and transformational power to the business. This move would also accelerate the successful adoption of AI, reduce costs of adoption, increase the ROI as well as reduce the internal and external risks to the company.

Artificial Intelligence adoption or Intelligent Enterprise creation?

Until AI systems can take such decisions for us, companies must decide whether they want to just adopt AI or ultimately create an intelligent enterprise which will take more than AI adoption to achieve. The current discussions around Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and whether they’re part of AI are taking the discussions about AI adoption off track. Yes, RPA is not part of AI at least based on the academic definition of AI and can’t be despite all the misleading loud marketing voices. The current RPA technology is nothing but simple scripts that unfortunately in many cases just automate the current business processes accumulated over the years and was designed mainly with only the human in mind.

If done right, RPA and Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) would be an opportunity to redesign and automate the underlying processes for the new workforce where humans and machines collaborating intelligently and closer together.

Business leaders should have plans to create the intelligent enterprise that offers intelligent products and services wrapped with intelligent processes designed to leverage biological intelligence of humans and artificial intelligence capabilities of machines together not just to automate repetitive processes to reduce costs and affirm some decisions which they could do alone without new technologies.

Some of the basic capabilities of intelligent enterprise would be that, it’s products, solutions and services can to intelligently use the collective knowledge they and humans created, be able to continuously learn to do things better and do new things as well as to intelligently react to ever-changing environments and demands.

Given the artifacts of an intelligent enterprise and the fast-growing complexity of the internal and external business environment, having too much of the traditional human intervention would be increasingly a major bottleneck in achieving the goal of an intelligent enterprise. This is due to our limited biological capabilities such as even simple tasks like finger and eyes movement.
Therefore, organizations need to stop wasting time discussing RPA and have a strategy and roadmap towards the intelligent enterprise which should include among others:

The overall vision, and a definition and roadmap for their intelligent enterprise including products, solutions, and services that in a dynamic way address the why, what, how and when.
A roadmap for new Intelligent Processes designed for Man + Machines working closer together.
A strategy that goes beyond AI and ML algorithms to identify other technologies which are essential to have an end to end intelligent solutions and products such as new sensing technologies, intelligent IoT gateways, edge computing hardware as well as HPC including quantum computing.
A plan to create the required culture and organizational operational shift in the way we build, use, operate and maintain such intelligent systems and solutions.
A plan to create an innovation ecosystem which should be an integral part of the new business to envision and deliver new intelligent services to the new businesses and the joint clients.
A new definition of Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) given the new UI/UX enabled by AI technologies such as Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU) and advanced computer vision accelerated by Augmented Reality/Extended Reality technologies.


AI technologies are not yet ready for industrial adoption. Is it a Myth?

The current AI benefited from decades of serious high-quality academic research. However, it’s clear that one of the major weaknesses of current AI systems is the lack of real-life experience, which is needed to make it reliably useful for all of us. When AI systems fail to give the right answer at the beginning of using it, this doesn’t usually mean that the underlying AI algorithms or mathematical models are not mature enough.

Like humans, AI algorithms need more real-world experience that might include more data created through algorithms’ own trials and errors in the real world.

Therefore, it would be unfair and technically wrong to judge AI solutions in the early stages while they still have no or little experience. This is one of the most common mistakes done today and usually lead to frustration and misunderstanding around the maturity of AI underlying models. We’ve to give AI-powered solutions time to learn and be carefully evaluated before deploying them in the enterprise.
For instance, machine learning capabilities which gained enough real-world experience such as computer vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the most mature and widely adopted parts of AI today. They’re the cognitive engines behind many industrial and consumer applications and products with the most positive impact on business and our personal life so far.
This is a key difference between traditional analytics and AI solutions. In analytics, software vendors build software solutions without having the actual data. On the contrary, in AI solutions, we use the problem description, actual data, domain knowledge and a set of specific goals to be able to create, train and verify ML algorithms. No Data, No Algorithms! in AI, there is no turnkey solution. This is a key mindset shift which must happen immediately to avoid this misunderstanding.
Such shift in mindset combined with new principles of designing distributed intelligent systems such as multi-agent distributed and interconnected cognitive systems would play a major role in deciding whether the organization’s efforts to leverage AI capabilities would succeed or just add more frustration, wasted opportunities and new risks.
Additionally, one of the key capabilities AI systems must have per design is that it should have the ability to continuously learn as well as dynamically leverage effective learning approach(es) over time. Selecting the right initial architecture as well as continuous learning approaches such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning or a mix of them is very important in a successful AI adoption. Lifelong Continues Learning (LLCL) is one of the main and most promising AI research areas today. However, it continues to be a challenge for the current machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of new information from non-stationary data sources generally lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge or abrupt decrease in the precision.
While there is a lot to be done to enable AI systems to continuously learn and evolve with their environments, most of the current AI platforms from startups and established vendors provide powerful tools to make this happen.

What makes or breaks AI adoption in business is not the AI academic methods and algorithms or the technology platforms built around them but the way we adopt, architect and integrate them in business solutions and industrial products.


The overhyped promise of Data

As of today, it is a challenge to train, test and verify the current machine learning algorithms, especially deep machine learning, as they require a lot of good data. Moreover, the last few years have shown that in many cases businesses don’t have enough historical data in the required quality and quantity needed for current ML approaches. Also, the data we have today was generated and collected with humans and their biological strengths and weaknesses in mind.
Even in cases where we have enough data, we must invest a massive amount of effort in different areas such as data engineering, data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, predictive modeling, model selection, and verification before having the initial algorithms. Additionally, manually adapting the design and continuous refining of the internal architecture of the first-generation algorithms takes a lot of tedious and repetitive work and requires massive computing power especially if we want to solve serious problems with constant or increasing precision.
The current “predictive analytics” solutions use simple statistical models to predict something based on the available historical data. It assumes that the future will follow the past in a simple and straightforward way. An assumption which in many cases has been proven to be wrong. For example, the failure history of industrial equipment in terms of causes, nature, and consequences is varying as workers are better trained, have access to more information and even have better tools to test, repair and maintain the same. This makes parts of “expensive” historical data misleading.

Our limited or occasional biased understanding and interpretations of the past events and the context in which those events have happened reduce the precision of AI solutions to accurately predict complex events which usually happen in a reality that we can't fully understand.

Additionally, there is increased warning among scientists against the statistical inference and misuse of statistical significance and “P values - probability value” which in some cases might lead to catastrophic consequences. Some scientists even call for the concept of statistical significance to be abandoned especially in the case where high precision prediction is required. In the end, as seen in many cases, we find the outcome is not more than the reaffirmation of predetermined decisions.

The human brain was initially trained with less data but extended, verified and continuously taught with large amounts of data gathered over years of life experience.

Today, ML algorithms are trained with large amounts of data and tested with less data (~70 % to 30%). Therefore, instead of just collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data, AI systems should start with simple tasks and be able to continuously learn, add more capabilities, expand its knowledge, increase its reasoning capability and adapt to its new environment through data they collected or synthetically generated.
One of the key lessons from using AI to solve complex problems over the last years is that we need new AI systems architecture which relies on fewer data and less supervision by humans. Therefore, AI practitioners as well as academic researchers, are going beyond traditional machine learning architectures and trying to create new ML algorithms which can create and comprehend its self-created or acquired data.
We see a lot of progress in some AI/ML areas such as new biologically inspired mathematical approaches, more efficient neural networks architectures, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) and genetic & evolutionary algorithms. One common goal is to reduce AI dependency on massive amounts of data and knowledge created by humans. Also, the tremendous advances in developing AI specialized hardware such as GPU, TPU and FPGA are making such new approaches possible.
Also, incorporating more efficient knowledge representation techniques such as evolutionary and co-evolutionary modular multi-tasking knowledge representation techniques even with the current ML algorithms will help organizations uncover more knowledge from the same or fewer data. Human brain-inspired new reasoning approaches are emerging fast to enable us to build systems that over time can reason like humans but without our biological limitations enhancing the precision and speed of decisions taken by machines and avoiding catastrophic decisions which with the absence of machine reasoning is highly possible.
While human-generated data will continue to be important especially in this early stage of adopting AI in industries, using the right mix of AI techniques and architectures would, over time, require fewer data and leverage more of the collective knowledge of companies to save time and efforts while creating safer and more efficient AI-powered business systems.

AI solutions are secure by design, really?

We all hoped that intelligent solutions would be able to defend themselves in different ways other than traditional software solutions. Technically it is possible that AI-powered systems can detect hostile behavior and, in some cases, proactively take preemptive measures to defend themselves. Today, AI is being used effectively to enhance the traditional cybersecurity solutions enabling them to be able to early identify or predict attacks and recommend primitive strikes on adversarial systems.

Given the strong reliance on human-generated data, ML algorithms with even deep neural networks architecture also can be easily misled to take wrong or even dangerous decisions.

Usually, hackers access traditional software systems to steal data. They hack industrial control systems and misguide them to do the wrong action(s). However, the core of AI systems has mainly algorithms and not much data. This created the illusion of absolute security by nature among some people, as nothing inside to steal. However, instead of stealing data, cyber attackers can feed AI systems with wrong data to manipulate their ability to take the right decisions. For example, attackers could access Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to add or remove medical conditions in MRI scans which will lead to the wrong diagnosis by ML algorithms. Same could happen to financial data or the operational data of critical equipment in a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) or a smart grid.
One of the most advanced and promising features of some AI-powered solutions is the ability of continuous learning from their own behavior, the way we use them to solve problems or make decisions as well as the external data sources we grant them access to. Even this unique feature makes AI solutions more vulnerable to new types of cyber-attacks such as influencing their behavior that they generate the wrong learning data (experience) which will lead to wrong or biased decisions in the future. This is like exposing humans to specific experience with the goal to misguide their behavior in a certain direction.
The so-called “adversarial examples” are sets of data given to AI systems with the intention to mislead them and cause misclassification and wrong decisions. Such a new type of hacking of intelligent digital systems is creating a major security vulnerability of even state-of-the-art deep learning systems. It is all about misleading the brain or disabling the backbone of an organization’s collective intelligence and even its critical physical assets. This can be more catastrophic and might cause irreparable damage and threaten even the existence of companies in some cases.

Organizations should be aware of this new cyber threat and consider new approaches and tools for designing, implementing and securing AI-powered digital and physical systems as well as the systems they interact with internally and externally.


AI systems can’t be biased. A huge misunderstanding!

One of the most frequently discussed topics nowadays is AI ethics and biases. As we use data generated by humans based on rules we created to train the machine learning algorithms today, this data will directly reflect the way we think and approach things. This data will decide the behavior of each algorithm.
In many cases such as diagnosing medical images, predicting failure of equipment or optimizing production throughput, ethics and social bias might not be a part of the problem to be solved. This creates another misunderstanding that the problem of AI bias is irrelevant in such cases leaving many to believe wrongly that the algorithms are not biased. In such cases, many companies are not aware that ML algorithms might represent a high risk and even legal burden on organizations.

While it is very important to eliminate social bias from the data we use to train ML algorithms and verify their behavior, companies must understand that there’re different types of AI biases and be aware of them.

For instance, we usually use technical data of specific equipment combined with other operational and environmental data to train ML algorithms that can proactively predict equipment failure or guide us on how to increase its performance. In some situations, because of many known and unknown variables, algorithms are biased toward predicting more failures or fewer failures causing major disruption to the business.

AI bias should be defined and identified based on the problems we’re trying to solve or decisions we’re trying to make.

We should develop new methods and tools that will enable us to expose biases using adequate humans and machines reasoning based on relevant business and technical knowledge. Ethics, accountability, and governance of AI systems are one of the most important roles of leadership in the era of AI and they’ve to proactively engage to inform themselves, provide guidance and increase awareness across the organization.
Until we’ve AI regulations or government appointed regulatory bodies, companies must ensure their AI systems operate at least using the same standards and regulations they use to run their business every day. This is especially crucial in serious AI applications which span digital and physical systems.

Conclusion

Companies must carefully create a comprehensive and dynamic AI strategy and immediately start adequate execution initiatives to get ready for the new era of many intelligent things powered by AI. This strategy towards intelligent enterprise will help in creating the new Man + Machine workforce of the future and reimagine their overall business. This is urgently required before new intelligent products, solutions or services from far smaller new disruptors will become a real threat to not only their businesses but also to their very existence.
This will require the business and IT leadership to have a realistic and accurate view about what AI can and can’t do now and in the near future. Also, having someone with robust academic and practical experience in AI leading such initiatives would help organizations cut through the hype and avoid costly misunderstandings and misleading myths.
Intelligence can’t be centralized, it should be distributed and not limited to a few functional areas. A hybrid and balanced approach of embedded, edge and centralized intelligence should be considered upfront to guarantee a well-orchestrated growth of the collective intelligence of the organization across all teams, functional areas, products, and services.
Most importantly, the adoption of AI and other related technologies towards the intelligent enterprise will bring the more productive and augmented Human and intelligent Machines closer creating a powerful workforce of the future. Companies should understand that humans and machines will continue to be the two pillars of the new workforce and wisely plan to leverage their combined strengths and understand their limitations of biological and artificial nature.

The artificial intelligence system at work. (Courtesy: ScreenPoint Medical)

A commercial artificial intelligence (AI) system matched the accuracy of over 28,000 interpretations of breast cancer screening mammograms by 101 radiologists. Although the most accurate mammographers outperformed the AI system, it achieved a higher performance than the majority of radiologists (JNCI: J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 10.1093/jnci/djy222).
With the addition of deep-learning convolutional neural networks, new AI systems for breast cancer screening improve upon the computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that radiologists have used since the 1990s. The AI system evaluated in this study — conducted by radiologists and medical physicists at Radboud University Medical Centre — has a feature classifier and image analysis algorithms to detect soft-tissue lesions and calcifications, and generates a “cancer suspicion” ranking of 1 to 10.
The researchers examined unrelated datasets of images from nine previous clinical studies. The images were acquired from women living in seven countries using four different vendors’ digital mammography systems. Every dataset included diagnostic images, radiologists’ scores of each exam and the actual patient diagnosis.
The 2652 cases, of which 653 were malignant, incorporated a total of 28,296 individual single reading interpretations by 101 radiologists participating in previous multi-reader, multi-case observer studies. The readers included 53 radiologists from the United States, who represented an equal mix of breast imagers and general radiologists, plus 48 European radiologists who were all breast specialists.
Principal investigator Ioannis Sechopoulos and colleagues reported that the performance of the AI tool (ScreenPoint Medical’s Transpara) was statistically non-inferior to that of the radiologists, with an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.840, compared with 0.814 for the radiologists. The AI system had a higher AUC than 62 of the radiologists and higher sensitivity than 55 radiologists.


The performance of the AI system was, however, consistently lower than the best performing radiologists in all datasets. The authors suggested that this may be because the radiologists had more information available for assessment, such as prior mammograms, for the majority of cases. However, the team did not have access to the experience levels of the 101 radiologists, and therefore could not determine whether the radiologists who outperformed the AI system also were the most experienced.
The researchers suggest that there may be several ways that an AI system designed to detect breast cancer could be used. One possibility is its use as an independent first or second reader in regions with a shortage of radiologists to interpret screening mammograms. It also could be employed in the same manner as CAD systems, as a clinical decision support tool to aid an interpreting radiologist.
Sechopoulos also thinks that AI will be useful for identifying normal mammograms that do not need to be read by a screening radiologist. “With the right developments, it could also be used to identify cases that can be read by only one radiologist to confirm that recalling the patient is necessary,” he tells Physics World. “These strategies could give radiologists more time to focus on more complex cases, and eventually could be part of the solution needed to implement digital tomosynthesis in screening programs. This is important because tomosynthesis takes considerably longer to read than mammography.”
When asked about future research, Sechopoulos suggests that a really interesting next step will be to compare the performance of AI against human performance in real screening conditions with the actual prevalence, or percentage of cases that are positive. “We need to gather that data first, and then do the comparison overall and also broken down by case characteristics, including lesion type, lesion location, and tumour characteristics,” he says.

Google, as one of the biggest corporations on Earth, is very interested in the use of AI and health care. Sundry Photography / Shutterstock Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly seen as a tool in biopharma and life sciences to improve drug development. There is a bit of a resource lag because AI is expensive. For example, Google/Alphabet owns an AI laboratory called DeepMind. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for a reported $650 million. Google, as one of the biggest corporations on Earth, is very interested in the use of AI and health care. “The fundamental underlying technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applicable to all manner of tasks,” Greg Corrado, a neuroscientist at Google, told NPR. And that’s true, “whether those are tasks in your daily life, like getting directions or sorting through emailing, or the kinds of tasks that doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients face every day.” It's probably not altruism that has brought Google and other tech companies to look at the life sciences and health care. John Moore, an industry analyst at Chilmark Research, told NPR, “It’s pretty hard to ignore a market that represents about 20 percent of [U.S.] GDP. So whether it’s Google or it’s Microsoft or it’s IBM or it’s Apple, everyone is taking a look at what they can do in the health care space.” Alphabet’s Verily focuses on health. One project the company is working on is software that can diagnose diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness. It is being used in India. It is also working to develop contact lenses that can monitor blood sugar in diabetes patients. Verily’s chief medical and scientific officer, cardiologist Jessica Mega, told NPR, “In each of these cases, you can use new technologies and new tools to solve a problem that’s right in front of you. In the case of surgical robotics, this idea of learning from one surgery to another becomes really important, because we should be constantly getting better.” Earlier this year, Google’s DeepMind won a worldwide contest called the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), which is hosted by the Protein Structure Prediction Center, which is sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH/NIGMS). It’s a global contest or experiment that has taken place every two years since 1994. Create-a-profile.jpg Proteins have three-dimensional structures and those structures are an important element in how they function. For example, it’s common for a mutation in the gene for a protein to result in the protein having a different shape, causing it to behave abnormally or not at all. Proteins shapes are also dynamic, transitioning between different states. In CASP, the participants attempt to predict the 3-D shape of a specific human protein. Researched who do this type of work use a variety of methods to solve the problem. DeepMind didn’t just beat out the other scientists in the competition but gave a prediction that was almost twice as accurate as experts expected. Derek Lowe, who writes the In The Pipeline blog for Science Translational Medicine, told The New York Times, “It is not that machines are going to replace chemists. It’s that the chemists who use machines will replace those that don’t.” Other companies than Google are focused on AI and machine learning. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. In January, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications. New therapeutic candidates were identified in more than six diseases. San Francisco-based Atomwise uses AI based on convolutional neural networks, the same tech used in facial recognition and self-driving cars, to search for drugs. In January Atomwise signed a strategic alliance with contract research organization (CRO) Charles River Laboratories International, to support CRL’s hit discovery, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization efforts. And those are just two examples out of many. But Google, as probably the biggest data company in the world and certainly the best known, brings a huge amount of resources to the space. At least part of its focus is directly on patient diagnoses. NPR notes that hospitals have enormous amounts of patient data in electronic health records, scans, test results. “That’s fodder for algorithms to ingest and crunch. And Mega says there’s a potential to wring a lot more useful information out of it.” Verily partnered with Duke University and Stanford University in what is called Project Baseline. Baseline is looking to recruit 10,000 volunteers to provide additional data to the company. In addition to taking a variety of heart scans, blood tests, stress tests, and skin swabs, participants fill out quarterly questionnaires, a device under the mattress tracks sleep patterns, and they wear heart and exercise monitors. If this seems to violate your privacy—after all, this is a company that has access to everything you search for and probably buy online, as well as other data—that’s one aspect of the project that might raise concerns. But so far, computer users have been willing to give up a certain amount of privacy for the convenience of what Google offers. That may apply to their health as well.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Artificial intelligence can work wonders, but often it works in mysterious ways.
Machine learning is based on the principle that a software program can analyze a huge set of data and fine-tune its algorithms to detect patterns and come up with solutions that humans may miss. That’s how Google DeepMind’s Alpha Go AI agent learned to play the ancient game of Go (and other games) well enough to beat expert players.
But if programmers and users can’t figure out how AI algorithms came up with their results, that black-box behavior can be a cause for concern. It may become impossible to judge whether AI agents have picked up unjustified biases or racial profiling from their data sets.
That’s why terms such as transparency, explainability and interpretability are playing an increasing role in the AI ethics debate.
The European Commission includes transparency and traceability among its requirements for AI systems, in line with the “right to explanation” laid out in data-protection laws. The French government already has committed to publishing the code that powers the algorithms it uses. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Technology Research and Investigation has been charged with providing guidance on algorithmic transparency.
Transparency figures in Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s “10 Laws of AI” as well — and Erez Barak, senior director of product for Microsoft’s AI Division, addressed the issue head-on today at the Global Artificial Intelligence Conference in Seattle.
“We believe that transparency is a key,” he said. “How many features did we consider? Did we consider just these five? Or did we consider 5,000 and choose these five?”

Barak noted that a software developer’s kit for explainability and interpretability is built right into Microsoft’s Azure Machine Learning service. “What it does is that it takes the model as an input and starts breaking it down,” he said.
The model explanation can show which factors went into the computer model, and how they were weighted by the AI system’s algorithms. As a result, customers can better understand why, for instance, they were turned down for a mortgage, passed over for a job opening, or denied parole.
AI developers can also use the model explanations to make their algorithms more “human.” For instance, it may be preferable to go with an algorithm that doesn’t fit a training set of data quite as well, but is more likely to promote fairness and avoid gender or racial bias.
As AI applications become more pervasive, calls for transparency — perhaps enforced through government regulation — could well become stronger. And that runs the risk of exposing trade secrets hidden within a company’s intricately formulated algorithms, said Elvira Castillo, a partner at Seattle’s Perkins Coie law firm who specializes in trade regulations.
“Algorithms tend to be things that are closely guarded. … That’s not something that you necessarily want to be transparent with the public or with your competitors about, so there is that fundamental tension,” Castillo said. “That’s more at issue in Europe than in the U.S., which has much, much, much stronger and aggressive enforcement.”
Microsoft has already taken a strong stance on responsible AI — to the point that the company has turned down prospective customers who sought to use AI applications such as facial recognition in ethically problematic ways.
After his talk, Barak told GeekWire that Azure Machine Learning’s explainability feature could be used as an open-source tool to look inside the black box and verify that an AI algorithm doesn’t perpetuate all-too-human injustices.
Over time, will the software industry or other stakeholders develop a set of standards or a “seal of approval” for AI algorithms?
“We’ve seen that in things like security. Those are the kinds of thresholds that have been set. I’m pretty sure we’re heading in that direction as well,” Barak said. “The idea is to give everyone the visibility and capability to do that, and those standards will develop, absolutely.”

Nils J. Nilsson, the Kumagai Professor of Engineering, Emeritus, in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, died April 23 at his home in Medford, Oregon, after a brief stay in hospice. He was 86.

Nilsson is best known for his foundational work in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning dating to the earliest days of the fields.Nilsson earned his PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford in 1958 and immediately began serving in the U.S. Air Force. After his discharge in 1961, he took a position at Stanford Research Institute, which was then still affiliated with the university. Nilsson was employed for the next 23 years at SRI, working on neural networks and statistical approaches to robotic problem-solving. He would eventually rise to lead SRI from 1980 to 1984.In 1985, Nilsson joined the Stanford faculty as chair of the Department of Computer Science, a role in which he served until 1990. It was unusual that an outsider would be brought in as chair of a department, but Nilsson was well known as a lecturer and intellectual force in artificial intelligence.The year he joined the Computer Science Department, Nilsson was charged with overseeing its historic transition from the School of Humanities and Sciences to the School of Engineering. His time at Stanford was marked by his continued leadership in the field and a burgeoning international profile. He also mentored many top names in the field during his time on the faculty.“In the mid-70s, Nils invited me to SRI to work on my PhD,” said Professor Emeritus Jean-Claude Latombe, former department chair and head of the Artificial Intelligence group at Stanford. “He became my de facto adviser and traveled to Grenoble just to sit on my defense committee. No one had such a great impact on my professional life.”Robotics leaderBetween 1966 and 1972, Nilsson co-directed the creation of an autonomous robot known affectionately as SHAKEY, after the way the top-heavy robot would shudder as made its way about in stops and starts.

Directed by a human operator typing in instructions, SHAKEY could negotiate its way around a room filled with large objects using various electrical sensors, a sonar range-finder and an integrated video camera, all the while communicating wirelessly with a state-of-the-art mainframe computer. In 1969-70, SHAKEY garnered a certain media celebrity after profiles appeared in the New York Times, National Geographic and Life, which referred to SHAKEY as the “first electronic person.”Nilsson was noted for helping to design and write the algorithms that helped SHAKEY make decisions and plan the most efficient course, Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) and A*. The intellectual progeny of those algorithms are still in use today.Nilsson authored or co-authored at least nine books, including The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements (Cambridge University Press, 2010) and Principles of Artificial Intelligence from Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, a publishing house he co-founded. Nilsson also contributed chapters to numerous other books and published frequently in the scientific press.He served on the editorial boards of the journal Artificial Intelligence and of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research and as an editor of the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was also a president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Nilsson was also elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.He was honored with a number of industry awards, including a Neural-Network Pioneer Award from the IEEE, the Research Excellence Award from the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Distinguished Service Award for lifetime achievement from the AAAI.Colleague and mentorAs respected as he was as an engineer, Nilsson was equally beloved as a colleague and mentor to many. As news spread across campus of his death, notes of remembrance flowed in.“Nils was a kind, thoughtful, inspiring person who helped shape the department in a formative era,” remembers John Mitchell, a fellow professor of computer science and current department chair. “He was unusually supportive of young faculty and always put our collective success ahead of any personal recognition or reward. All of us who knew him will sorely miss him.”Nils John Nilsson, the oldest of five sons to Walter and Pauline Nilsson, was born Feb. 6, 1933, in Saginaw, Michigan, where he lived until age 11 when his family relocated to Southern California. He attended high school in Glendale, where he was valedictorian. He then entered Stanford University, where he earned his master’s degree in 1956 and doctorate in 1958. A program at the time allowed him to forgo his bachelor’s degree to work directly to his master’s. He retired in 1995.He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Grace Abbott, of Medford, Oregon; daughter Kristen Farley of Pasadena, California; son Lars Nilsson of Piedmont, California; Grace’s four sons from a previous marriage and their spouses; as well as 12 grandchildren. He was predeceased by first wife, Karen (Braucht) Nilsson, in 1991.Memorial donations are requested in his name to Stanford School of Engineering.

“The best definition of artificial intelligence is that it is set of methods or algorithms that use a large amount of data to learn rules or patterns, and continuously improves with additional data,” shares Rob Budny, Chief Reliability Officer at Ensemble Energy. He says most AI solutions are cloud-based, directing notifications to a dashboard or email, and many can work with a work-flow management system.
The sources from which AI can pull information may include:

SCADA data (mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviations),
Maintenance data (component replacement dates, lubrication events, etc.),
Failure histories
Firmware updates
CMS data (if available)

These data sources are then used to create models of normal turbine behavior, which serve to quickly identify abnormalities and notify the wind-farm operator.
“The models monitor a turbine 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and relieve human operators of the tedious task of sifting through extremely large data sets in search of relevant insights,” explains Budny.
He says one of the best examples of AI use cases is automated detection of yaw misalignment, which, if left undetected leads to lost energy production and increased loads on the turbine. Other examples include pitch-bearing, generator stator insulation, and transformer failure prediction, as well as detection of poor bearing lubrication conditions.
“Our AI platform continually monitors wind-turbine operation in the background, so it needs no operator input,” he says. “Be sure to look for a system that is supported by wind industry domain experts, as the combination of data science expertise and wind industry expertise leads to the best outcomes.”
Forecasting is another feature of certain AI systems, adds Budny. “Many types of forecasts are possible, including power production, availability, component over-temperature events, spare parts needs, and other such use cases. Having such increased visibility provides tremendous benefits to wind-turbine operators.”

Hemphill: Artificial intelligence and automation - a manufacturing challengeStaff WriterThe Daily TelegramA January 2019 report, “Automation and Artificial Intelligence: How Machines are Affecting People and Places” written by Mark Murro, Robert Maxim and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings Institution, offers insights into how automation and artificial intelligence will be affecting job prospects in the United States through 2030.Utilizing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor market analysis firm Emsi and theMcKinsey Global Institute, this study reports that 25% of U.S. employment, or 36 million jobs in 2016, will be susceptible to high exposure — that is, greater than 70% of current task content at risk of substitution — to automation and artificial intelligence in the coming decade.Among the most vulnerable occupations are those in office administration, production, transportation and food preparation. Specifically, the automation and AI potential for production occupations is at 79%, second only to food preparation and serving related occupations (at 81%).In November 2018, Deloitte LLP and The Manufacturing Institute, the social impact arm of the National Association of Manufacturers, released the 2018 Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute Skills Gap and Future of Work Study. This study found that the widening manufacturing skills gap is expected to grow in the United States from 488,000 jobs left open in late 2018 to as many as 2.4 million manufacturing jobs going unfilled between 2018 and 2028.“With nearly 2 million vacant new jobs expected in 2028, compounded by 2.69 million vacancies from retiring workers, the number of open positions could be greater than ever and might pose not only a major challenge for manufacturers but may threaten the vitality of the industry and our economy,” said Paul Wellener, vice chairman at Deloitte.According to Deloitte, the manufacturing sector has been consistently contributing to more than 10 percent of total U.S. gross domestic product, and the National Association of Manufacturers calculates that every dollar in output from manufacturing generates an additional $1.89 of value and every direct job creates 2.5 additional jobs.In the U.S. manufacturing sector, there are “production-focused” positions that are low skilled and “skilled production” positions that require specific training to develop complex skill-sets. As to the future of production-focused positions, the manufacturing sector is choosing to eliminate them through increased automation.However, for skilled production positions, more than half of manufacturing executives in the skills gap study cite technology/computer skills, digital skills, programming skills for robots/automation, working with tools and technology, and critical-thinking skills to be in demand over the next three years. This survey result echoes findings from a recent World Economic Forum study (“The Future of Jobs Report 2018”), which identified critical thinking, creativity and originality, attention to detail, problem solving and people management — all uniquely human skills — of increasing importance as automation in the form of robots and cobots is added to manufacturers’ production lines.So what is the U.S. manufacturing sector doing beyond turning more to automation and AI to address the skills shortage and reduce this troubling employment gap?“To address the skills shortage, companies are trying new ways to fill the gap and appeal to candidates,” said Chad Moutray, director at the Center for Manufacturing Research, The Manufacturing Institute and chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.To this end, 39 percent of manufacturers report that they are implementing new learning and development programs internally and externally. Moreover, 77 percent of manufacturers are prioritizing competencies and potential in job candidates over strict adherence to factors such as years of experience, and 65 percent acknowledge they are willing to train employees on the job. In addition, many manufacturers are developing knowledge transfer programs and short-term project opportunities for retirees, and 83 percent of manufacturers are reportedly prepared to pay more to attract and retain skilled talent, with 8 percent offering signing bonuses.U.S. manufacturers are now responding to labor market conditions with flexible employment policies while incorporating new technologies designed to enhance employee productivity. However, the need for expensive labor to fill monotonous, routine jobs will become an artifact of the 20th-century factory floor.Thomas A.

Vogue explores the designers who are using Artificial Intelligence to create their worksBy Shweta Gandhi23 April 2019Vogue ImagesYou know change is in the air when virtual—that is, non-human—Instagram influencers are posing with traditional front row bigwigs at fashion weeks. The world of fashion as we know it has clearly gone through a sea change, with technology-driven innovations reinventing our interactions with garments, our online and offline shopping experiences, and ultimately, our understanding of the industry as a whole.

Miquela Souza, better known as Lil Miquela to her 1.5 million Instagram followers, claims to live in Los Angeles and quite convincingly mimics the life of a social media It-girl. In a similar way, Noonoouri—a self-proclaimed feminist living in Paris, who supports global concerns like climate change and animal rights—collaborates with leading fashion brands like Dior and Stuart Weitzman, posts sponsored content on her account, and ‘wears' luxury labels like Burberry and Valentino. And supermodel Shudu was the face of Balmain's autumn/winter 2018 campaign, along with two other virtual friends. She was even featured by Rihanna's makeup brand, Fenty Beauty. Imma is the latest name to join the bandwagon, with interests in Japanese culture and films. With virtual Instagram personalities who are playing the part as well as the real ones, there is a subtle yet evident shift in how brands and designers are perceiving influencers, which brings us to the question—will the social media stars of tomorrow be real people at all?How Indian designers are applying AI to their workIn India, fashion designers like Gaurav Gupta and Falguni and Shane Peacock are some of the few names who are getting on board with AI. “My first encounter with AI in fashion began when I was asked to create an Indian sari gown in association with IBM's cognitive tool, Watson,” says Gupta. “To create the first-of-its kind cognitive dress, we used white fabric with integrated lighting that covered the entire dress. The lighting used AI technology to allow the colours change depending on the mood of the person who is interacting with the wearer of the gown. This was made possible through IBM Watson's tone and emotion gaging software.”Most PopularCulture & LivingLatest OTT releases this week: 12 new movies and TV shows to watch on Netflix, Prime Video and moreBy Prabal Sharma, Vogue IndiaWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s final wedding celebration in MumbaiBy Elise Taylor, Vogue IndiaFashionThe most spectacular jewellery from Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's weddingBy Vogue Staff, Vogue IndiaFalguni and Shane Peacock too used IBM's tool Watson, but for a different purpose—to create a software that maps the future of Indian fashion. “When we worked with Watson, we asked it to develop a software for us that helped us browse through the history of fashion weeks within seconds. For example, if we were working on a purple dress, we would scan through all possible dresses in purple showcased earlier so that ours doesn't have any similarity to them,” the pair explain on an email.Trending VideoOff Duty with Isha Ambani Piramal | Vogue India“Apart from that, if we had a concept or a sketch and added it on the software, Watson found relevant themes and sketches that helped us correct and improvise our work. It aided in keeping our work unique and authentic,” they add. In today's times where designers and brands constantly toe the line of plagiarism, a tool like IBM's Watson can not only prevent sartorial copies, but also bring about transparency in the design process.How brands are using AI to improve a consumer's shopping experienceFor a brand, one of the main areas of focus is always going to be improving a consumer's shopping experience, offline or online. It is directly proportional to improvement in retail productivity. Take luxury brands like Burberry and Tommy Hilfiger for example—they have chatbots to help users with their queries 24/7.Farfetch's Store of the Future, an augmented retail vision that aims to use data to improve the experience of a shopper, is another instance. “Consumers enjoy the experience of being in-store, building a relationship with the sales associate and experiencing merchandise in the luxury store setting, yet technology has meant that consumers now expect ultra-personalised experiences both in their real and digital lives, and expect those worlds to be seamlessly connected,” Farfetch explains on its website. “Farfetch Store of the Future aims to improve retail productivity by capturing consumer data and enhancing interactions between consumers and sales associates, both in store and when the consumer interacts with the retailer or brand online.”Most PopularCulture & LivingLatest OTT releases this week: 12 new movies and TV shows to watch on Netflix, Prime Video and moreBy Prabal Sharma, Vogue IndiaWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s final wedding celebration in MumbaiBy Elise Taylor, Vogue IndiaFashionThe most spectacular jewellery from Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's weddingBy Vogue Staff, Vogue IndiaAccording to Falguni and Shane Peacock, there are two types of buyers. “The first type is the one who knows what they want to buy and are sure of the product. The second type is who browses through products and purchases on the basis on their visuals. AI helps a brand in making those visuals more pleasing, and more interactive with the audience,” they say. The designer duo are also among the first in India to launch an interactive online shoppable video where the consumer gets to take a closer look at a product worn by a celebrity, and also help put together a look specifically for them. Needless to say, all the products can be purchased online. “The video features Kartik Aryan and lets the watcher choose from the options presented. So in a way, the watcher is creating his look.”Gupta's approach is also geared into making it simpler for the consumer. “User experience is a vital element in the world of digital media. Today, a website can make you fill a simple questionnaire and a virtual stylist can pick out outfit options for you based on your answers. This is an algorithm of AI that can tabulate a person's interest using relevant data. It works to make the shopping experience as smooth and efficient as possible,” he says. Visual recognition, purchasing recommendations and customised options are other benefits of AI in online fashion retail.Most PopularCulture & LivingLatest OTT releases this week: 12 new movies and TV shows to watch on Netflix, Prime Video and moreBy Prabal Sharma, Vogue IndiaWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s final wedding celebration in MumbaiBy Elise Taylor, Vogue IndiaFashionThe most spectacular jewellery from Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's weddingBy Vogue Staff, Vogue IndiaFindow, founded by Zarine Bajaj, is an online platform that uses advanced AI to help buyers discover fashion designers, retail stores, brands and boutiques nearest to them. Short for “fashion window”, the website and app also lets buyers stay updated with the latest trends and keep track of events and sales happening around them.Meanwhile, Amazon is on the verge of developing an AI fashion designer who will create clothes by analysing multiple images and picking the latest fashion trends. Does this mean that AI will one day replace manual fashion design? Or will it help a designer in infusing their work with increased creativity and faster processes?What's the future of AI and fashion?“We're all living in a world where technology moves in tandem with fashion. AI is an open space that allows you to construct, de-construct ideas and create something new altogether. This space is encouraging creativity and is aiding the fashion industry in a huge way,” Gupta thinks. “AI opens out a lot of ideas as to what technology can do and how can you incorporate it in your work. It is of great help if a brand knows how to utilise it,” say Shane and Falguni.AI's mathematical computing power promises speed, which can be beneficial across the fashion supply chain. The advancement in algorithms also points towards AI bring used for predictive trend forecasting. Its ability to store and read a large size of data can help retail brands and fashion houses in recognising a consumer's wants and needs. Lastly, AI is sure to create new jobs, but its automated processes will also mean that a lot of jobs that are done by human hands will become redundant. If brands keep this in consideration and take the first mover's advantage, the future of AI in fashion could definitely be bright.Also read:Get a closer look at Gaurav Gupta and IBM Watson's cognitive sari gownIs Artificial Intelligence the new artist we need to watch out for?",BreadcrumbList,https://www.vogue.in/content/what-is-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-in-fashion,"['https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5ce3eff34a30b3e5bd12a1fd/16:9/w_1920,h_1080,c_limit/ashish-shah.jpg', 'https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5ce3eff34a30b3e5bd12a1fd/4:3/w_1440,h_1080,c_limit/ashish-shah.jpg', 'https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5ce3eff34a30b3e5bd12a1fd/1:1/w_1080,h_1080,c_limit/ashish-shah.jpg']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shweta Gandhi', 'sameAs': 'https://www.vogue.in/author/Shweta-Gandhi'}]","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Vogue India', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.vogue.in/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-seo.png', 'width': '500px', 'height': '152px'}, 'url': 'https://www.vogue.in'}",What is the future of Artificial Intelligence in fashion? | VOGUE India,2019-04-23T23:24:22.000+05:30,2019-04-23T23:24:22.000+05:30,fashion,,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Fashion', 'item': 'https://www.vogue.in/fashion'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'BALMAIN', 'item': 'https://www.vogue.in/topics/balmain'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'What is the future of Artificial Intelligence in fashion?'}]","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.vogue.in/content/what-is-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-in-fashion'}",,,"You know change is in the air when virtual—that is, non-human—Instagram influencers are posing with traditional front row bigwigs at fashion weeks.

Gupta's approach is also geared into making it simpler for the consumer. “User experience is a vital element in the world of digital media. Today, a website can make you fill a simple questionnaire and a virtual stylist can pick out outfit options for you based on your answers. This is an algorithm of AI that can tabulate a person's interest using relevant data. It works to make the shopping experience as smooth and efficient as possible,” he says. Visual recognition, purchasing recommendations and customised options are other benefits of AI in online fashion retail.
Findow, founded by Zarine Bajaj, is an online platform that uses advanced AI to help buyers discover fashion designers, retail stores, brands and boutiques nearest to them. Short for “fashion window”, the website and app also lets buyers stay updated with the latest trends and keep track of events and sales happening around them.
Meanwhile, Amazon is on the verge of developing an AI fashion designer who will create clothes by analysing multiple images and picking the latest fashion trends. Does this mean that AI will one day replace manual fashion design? Or will it help a designer in infusing their work with increased creativity and faster processes?
What's the future of AI and fashion?
“We're all living in a world where technology moves in tandem with fashion. AI is an open space that allows you to construct, de-construct ideas and create something new altogether. This space is encouraging creativity and is aiding the fashion industry in a huge way,” Gupta thinks. “AI opens out a lot of ideas as to what technology can do and how can you incorporate it in your work. It is of great help if a brand knows how to utilise it,” say Shane and Falguni.
AI's mathematical computing power promises speed, which can be beneficial across the fashion supply chain. The advancement in algorithms also points towards AI bring used for predictive trend forecasting. Its ability to store and read a large size of data can help retail brands and fashion houses in recognising a consumer's wants and needs. Lastly, AI is sure to create new jobs, but its automated processes will also mean that a lot of jobs that are done by human hands will become redundant. If brands keep this in consideration and take the first mover's advantage, the future of AI in fashion could definitely be bright.
