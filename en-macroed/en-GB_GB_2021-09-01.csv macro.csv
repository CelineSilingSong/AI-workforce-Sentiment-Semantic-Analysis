With fossil fuels still supplying more than 80% of global energy, the energy sector needs to be at the heart of this action. Fortunately, the energy system is already in transition: renewable energy generation is growing rapidly, driven by falling costs and growing investor interest. But the scale and cost of decarbonizing the global energy system remain gigantic, and time is running out. To-date, most of the energy sector’s transition efforts have focused on hardware: new low-carbon infrastructure that will replace legacy carbon-intensive systems. Relatively little effort and investment has focused on another critical tool for the transition: next-generation digital technologies, in particular artificial intelligence (AI). These powerful technologies can be adopted more quickly at larger scales than new hardware solutions, and can become an essential enabler for the energy transition. Have you read?4 charts that show how technology is enabling the energy transitionWhy artificial intelligence is key to renewable energy grid resilienceHow 'active efficiency' can help electricity grids weather the storms to comeThree key trends are driving AI’s potential to accelerate energy transition: 1. Energy-intensive sectors including power, transport, heavy industry and buildings are at the beginning of historic decarbonization processes, driven by growing government and consumer demand for rapid reductions in CO2 emissions. The scale of these transitions is huge: BloombergNEF estimates that in the energy sector alone, achieving net-zero emissions will require between $92 trillion and $173 trillion of infrastructure investments by 2050. Even small gains in flexibility, efficiency or capacity in clean energy and low-carbon industry can therefore lead to trillions in value and savings.2. As electricity supplies more sectors and applications, the power sector is becoming the core pillar of the global energy supply. Ramping up renewable energy deployment to decarbonize the globally expanding power sector will mean more power is supplied by intermittent sources (such as solar and wind), creating new demand for forecasting, coordination, and flexible consumption to ensure that power grids can be operated safely and reliably.3. The transition to low-carbon energy systems is driving the rapid growth of distributed power generation, distributed storage and advanced demand-response capabilities, which need to be orchestrated and integrated through more networked, transactional power grids. Navigating these trends presents huge strategic and operational challenges to the energy system and to energy-intensive industries. This is where AI comes in: by creating an intelligent coordination layer across the generation, transmission and use of energy, AI can help energy-system stakeholders identify patterns and insights in data, learn from experience and improve system performance over time, and predict and model possible outcomes of complex, multivariate situations. AI is already proving its value to the energy transition in multiple domains, driving measurable improvements in renewable energy forecasting, grid operations and optimization, coordination of distributed energy assets and demand-side management, and materials innovation and discovery. But while AI’s application in the energy sector has proven promising so far, innovation and adoption remain limited. That presents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate transition towards the zero-emission, highly efficient and interconnected energy system we need tomorrow. AI holds far greater potential to accelerate the global energy transition, but it will only be realized if there is greater AI innovation, adoption and collaboration across the industry. That is why the World Economic Forum has today released Harnessing AI to Accelerate the Energy Transition, a new report aimed at defining and catalysing the actions that are needed. The report, written in collaboration with BloombergNEF and Dena, establishes nine 'AI for the energy transition principles' aimed at the energy industry, technology developers and policy-makers. If adopted, these principles would accelerate the uptake of AI solutions that serve the energy transition by creating a common understanding of what is needed to unlock AI’s potential and how to safely and responsibly adopt AI in the energy sector. Image: World Economic ForumThe principles define the actions that are needed to unlock AI’s potential in the energy sector across three critical domains:1. Governing the use of AI:Standards – implement compatible software standards and interoperable interfaces.Risk management – agree upon a common technology and education approach to managing the risks presented by AI.Responsibility – ensure that AI ethics and responsible use are at the core of AI development and deployment.2. Designing AI that’s fit for purpose:Automation – design generation equipment and grid operations for automation and increased autonomy of AI.Sustainability – adopt the most energy-efficient infrastructure as well as best practices around sustainable computing to limit the carbon footprint of AI.Design – focus AI development on usability and interpretability.3. Enabling the deployment of AI at scale:Data – establish data standards, data-sharing mechanisms and platforms to increase the availability and quality of data.Education – empower consumers and the energy workforce with a human-centred AI approach and invest in education to match technology and skill development.Incentives – create market designs and regulatory frameworks that allow AI use cases to capture the value that they create.AI is not a silver bullet, and no technology can replace aggressive political and corporate commitments to reducing emissions. But given the urgency, scale, and complexity of the global energy transition, we can’t afford to leave any tools in the toolbox. Used well, AI will accelerate the energy transition while expanding access to energy services, encouraging innovation, and ensuring a safe, resilient, and affordable clean energy system. It is time for industry players and policy makers to lay the foundations for this AI-enabled energy future, and to build a trusted and collaborative ecosystem around AI for the energy transition.Don't miss any update on Decarbonizing EnergySign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesEnergy TransitionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

As it prepares to launch the first cross-disciplinary institute for artificial intelligence (AI) at a liberal arts college, Colby today announced that Amanda Stent has been named the inaugural director of its Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Stent, who most recently served as the natural language processing (NLP) architect at Bloomberg L.P. and led the company’s People and Language AI Team, will assume her role in October.
Stent is considered one of the leading authorities on NLP, the branch of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to understand human text and spoken words. With an exceptional range of NLP experience at some of the country’s top companies, she has authored or co-authored more than 100 papers on natural language processing, regularly speaks or presents on the topic, and is co-inventor on more than 30 NLP-related patents. Her strong background in academia includes acting as co-principal investigator on a large National Science Foundation information technology research grant that graduated interdisciplinary students across psychology, linguistics, and computer science. Additionally, she was involved in the famous CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes) project that directly led to a wide range of AI and NLP applications, most notably the virtual assistant Siri.
“Amanda is the ideal person to build and lead the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence,” said President David A. Greene. “She is in the midst of a distinguished career overseeing large, complex teams of scientists, developing new technologies, and addressing algorithmic bias in machine learning. But she is a teacher and researcher at heart. Our students, faculty, and visitors to the Davis Institute will benefit from the clarity of her thinking, the depth of her knowledge, and the generosity of her spirit. She will establish the Davis Institute as a global model for how liberal arts colleges can shape the future of AI for the common good.” 
Colby announced earlier in the year that it had received a $30-million gift from the Davis family and trustee of its charitable foundation Andrew Davis ’85, LL.D. ’15, to establish the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The institute will provide new pathways for talented students and faculty to research, create, and apply AI and machine learning (ML) in a manner that is informed and driven by a broad liberal arts perspective.
“The mission of Colby’s Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence is to use AI creatively, while also preparing future leaders to predict and understand its impact, so negative impacts are mitigated and positive impacts are reinforced, and that’s exactly aligned with where I want to be in my career right now,” commented Stent. “Being at Colby will give me the opportunity to work with students and faculty across disciplines to not only use AI to inform those disciplines but ensure that all of those disciplines inform AI.”
Stent added that she also feels very strongly about undergraduate education and that it must include some component of studying AI. “AI will continue to have broad and profound societal impact, which means that the whole of society should have a say in what we do with it. For that to happen, each of us needs to have a foundational understanding of the nature of this technology.”
Inimitable Combination of Corporate and Academic Experience 
While at Bloomberg L.P., Stent was responsible for developing and overseeing the company’s strategy for using AI to understand and produce human language. This included product managing the engineering teams responsible for the NLP infrastructure that permitted the conversion of unstructured data (i.e. written and verbal content) into structured, actionable data quickly and at a consistently high level. For example, using AI to extract data from earnings calls or reports. She also developed new NLP-driven enterprise products and created and taught natural language processing courses for the company’s engineers and data scientists.
As principal research scientist and research director at Yahoo Labs, Stent managed a group of researchers who worked on various aspects of NLP as well as image and video processing. At AT&T Labs–Research she conducted pure and applied research on dialog systems, interactive data exploration, and assistive technology.
Before joining the private sector, Stent was a tenured associate professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, where she created an interdisciplinary computational linguistics graduate program and designed and taught new graduate courses in speech processing, natural language processing, and information retrieval. She also developed new undergraduate courses for the university, including a software engineering ethics class, and taught across the curriculum—from theory of computation to software engineering.
Stent is a member of the National Academy of Sciences’ working group on responsible computing research and co-author of The Princess at the Keyboard: Why Girls Should Become Computer Scientists. One of the research projects she plans to work on at Colby involves using computers and NLP to understand the scientific literature in different disciplines to help inform future scientific initiatives that can lead to new discoveries. She holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Rochester and a B.A. in mathematics from Houghton College.
AI Across Disciplines
The Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence will launch this fall with more than 20 courses and classes that have been retooled to include significant AI components. Extending across a wide range of departments, they will focus on everything from economic forecasting and linguistics to art and mathematics.
“Amanda brings a remarkable range of experiences in both academia and industry that make her exceptionally well-qualified to lead the Davis Institute,” said Margaret McFadden, provost and dean of faculty at Colby. “Our faculty colleagues are delighted to work with her on the project of integrating AI into the curriculum and their research programs, and their enthusiasm is clear from the number of AI-themed courses and projects that they have created for students this fall. Colby has a long and fruitful tradition of interdisciplinary collaboration, and I am confident that under Amanda’s leadership, the Davis Institute will enable faculty to work together in transformative and generative new ways.”
A key priority for Stent will involve working with departments in the hiring of new faculty experts in AI who will join a larger community of scholars at Colby currently using artificial intelligence in their research and teaching. She and the Institute will also support Colby faculty interested in exploring new ways to incorporate AI tools and methodologies into their teaching and research as well as design new courses to include meaningful learning opportunities with AI.
“While there’s certainly lots to do, I’m currently working on setting up a series of lectures and discussions with various leaders in the AI space, and I’m also thinking about incorporating AI into Colby’s Jan Plan term that will involve different areas, including art and the College’s wonderful museum,” said Stent. “On a parallel track, I hope to quickly create some fantastic undergraduate collaborative projects with faculty that we can showcase and use to begin to build a thriving and dynamic community that wants to learn about and speak critically, as well as creatively, to the development of AI.”
The Davis Institute will build upon existing partnerships and develop new relationships with leading organizations and institutions to facilitate significant faculty and student research using rich datasets with real-world consequences and to provide students with broad-ranging opportunities for internships. It will also create a summer program for visiting faculty and students to work on AI projects and to develop courses and research projects that can be shared at their home institutions. In these ways, the Davis Institute will become a national center for training faculty and students in the use of AI and the creation of new systems and capabilities.

Machine learning is the process of using computers to detect patterns in massive datasets and then make predictions based on what the computer learns from those patterns. This makes machine learning a specific and narrow type of artificial intelligence. Full artificial intelligence involves machines that can perform abilities we associate with the minds of human beings and intelligent animals, such as perceiving, learning, and problem solving.All machine learning is based on algorithms. In general, algorithms are sets of specific instructions that a computer uses to solve problems. In machine learning, algorithms are rules for how to analyze data using statistics. Machine learning systems use these rules to identify relationships between data inputs and desired outputs–usually  predictions. To get started, scientists give machine learning systems a set of training data. The systems apply their algorithms to this data to train themselves how to analyze similar inputs they receive in the future.One area where machine learning shows huge promise is detecting cancer in computer tomography (CT) imaging. First, researchers assemble as many CT images as possible to use as training data. Some of these images show tissue with cancerous cells, and some show healthy tissues. Researchers also assemble information on what to look for in an image to identify cancer. For example, this might include what the boundaries of cancerous tumors look like. Next, they create rules on the relationship between data in the images and what doctors know about identifying cancer. Then they give these rules and the training data to the machine learning system. The system uses the rules and the training data to teach itself how to recognize cancerous tissue. Finally, the system gets a new patient’s CT images. Using what it has learned, the system decides which images show signs of cancer, faster than any human could. Doctors could use the system’s predictions to aid in the decision about whether a patient has cancer and how to treat it.The way training data is set up divides machine learning systems into two broad types: supervised and unsupervised. If the training data is labeled, the system is supervised. Labeled data tells the system what the data is. For example, CT images could be labeled to indicate cancerous lesions or tumors next to tissues that are healthy. Basically, this means the machine learning system learns by example. Labeling data can be very time consuming for the large amounts of data required for training datasets.If the training data is not labeled, the machine learning system is unsupervised. In the cancer scan example, an unsupervised machine learning system would be given a huge number of CT scans and information on tumor types, then left to teach itself what to look for to recognize cancer. This frees human beings from needing to label the data used in the training process. The disadvantage of unsupervised learning is that the results may not be as accurate because of the lack of explicit labels.Some machine learning systems can improve their abilities based on feedback received on the predictions. These are called reinforcement machine learning systems. For example, the system could be told the results of doctors’ other tests of whether patients have cancer or not. The system could then tweak its algorithms to produce more accurate predictions in the future.DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Machine LearningThe Department of Energy Office of Science supports research on machine learning through its Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. ASCR has a portfolio of data management, data analysis, computer technology, and related research that all contribute to machine learning and artificial intelligence. As part of this portfolio, DOE owns some of the world’s most capable supercomputers.The DOE Office of Science as a whole is committed to the use of machine learning to support scientific research. Science depends on big data, and Office of Science user facilities such as particle accelerators and X-ray light sources generate mountains of it. Using machine learning, researchers are identifying patterns or designs in data from these facilities that are difficult or impossible for humans to detect, at speeds that are hundreds to thousands of times faster than traditional data analysis techniques.Fast FactsThe newest of DOE’s supercomputers—Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory—has an architecture especially well-suited for artificial intelligence applications.Machine learning allows scientists to analyze quantities of data that were previously inaccessible.DOE-funded researchers have used machine learning to develop new cancer screening, better understand the properties of water, and autonomously steer experiments.Physics-informed machine learning uses deep neural networks that can be trained to incorporate specific laws of physics to solve supervised learning tasks and scientific problems.Machine learning algorithms are not a silver bullet. The development of machine learning systems is susceptible to human error and biases and requires the same careful design as software engineering.ResourcesDOE Office of Science Advanced Scientific Computing Research programDOE Office of Science Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning InitiativeDOE’s Executive Guide to Artificial Intelligence(link is external)Report to Congress(link is external) on DOE support for artificial intelligence and machine learningScience highlight: Machine Learning Accelerates Metamaterial DesignScience highlight: Machine Learning Speeds Molecular Motion ModelingScience highlight: Machine Learning System Improves Accelerator DiagnosticsScience highlight: Breakthrough Reported in Machine Learning-Enhanced Quantum ChemistryFeature: Stargazing with Computers: What Machine Learning Can Teach Us About the CosmosFeature: What Can Science Gain from Computers that Learn?Learn how machine learning helps advance fusion power research(link is external). Scientific terms can be confusing. DOE Explains offers straightforward explanations of key words and concepts in fundamental science.
