Image recognition and artificial intelligence make production at Volkswagen even more efficient. The key term: Industrial Computer Vision. A visit to the experts at the Smart.Production:Lab who helped develop the technology.

The blue boxes are positioned. A small camera records the contents – all ready for the test. A tense Reda Jaber and Nicolas Hummel turn their heads towards the monitor. A green check appears: All in place – the boxes are filled exactly as they should be. Smiles on their faces. What seems unspectacular at first glance is technologically highly sophisticated: In Volkswagen’s Smart.Production:Lab in Wolfsburg, IT specialists Jaber and Hummel are watching artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The experiment shows: AI can independently check whether delivery boxes are packed correctly – in the laboratory or in genuine logistics scenarios.Industrial Computer Vision is the name of the system that Reda Jaber and Nicolas Hummel have developed together with a seven-member team and in collaboration with other labs and Volkswagen’s Software Development Center in Dresden. The basic idea: people train artificial intelligence to evaluate optical data and detect errors – extremely reliably and in fractions of a second. The AI can check boxes for completeness, for example – but many other applications are conceivable. “The user interface is so simple that anyone can operate it and train the AI independently. You don’t have to be a computer scientist,” says Nicolas Hummel. Over the next few years, Volkswagen expects Computer Vision applications to generate savings in the double-digit million-euro range. The focus is on production and logistics.Industrial Computer Vision offers a toolbox for the implementation of AI use cases: All you need is a person who prepares enough training material – for example, photos with correctly and incorrectly packed boxes – and marks them accordingly. “The AI then learns independently to distinguish faultless from faulty results. After just a few hundred training images, you can achieve good results,” says Hummel. A few days are often enough to make a neural network ready for use. Artificial intelligence – not so difficult after all with Computer Vision.
































The Data Lab in Munich is a partner in the development of many new applications.




 The experts at the Wolfsburg Smart.Production:Lab do not usually develop promising new applications on their own, but in cooperation with other competence centers in the large Volkswagen Group. Take Computer Vision, for example: while the software is written in Wolfsburg, the Data Lab in Munich is concerned with improving neural networks. The Software Development Center in Dresden tests the system in practice and provides feedback. With success: In a logistics hall in Wolfsburg the automatic container control system is already in use. People in the images are automatically pixelated to comply with data protection regulations – a solution that will be standard in all Computer Vision applications.

“Our preferred solution is an online offering from which each department can download the appropriate applications.”Reda Jaber



Another possible application is currently being tested at Porsche in Leipzig: Here, AI checks labels that are attached to every car during production. The labels contain vehicle information or instructions for airbags, for example, and are written in various languages. AI checks the images in real time and provides feedback as to whether everything is in order. From next year, the application is to be used at other locations – rolled out via the Industrial Cloud, which links Volkswagen Group’s plants together. In the Smart.Production:Lab, Reda Jaber and Nicolas Hummel are also continuing to work on making the advantages of Computer Vision available throughout the entire company. “Our preferred solution is an online offering from which each department can download the appropriate applications as if they were in a library,” says Reda Jaber. A pilot test is already underway.

And when everything is ready? Jaber and Hummel know they won’t run out of ideas. In addition to Computer Vision, the experts at the Smart.Production:Lab have also been working on driverless transport systems, data analysis, robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT) – all major topics for the future. 



“It’s fun to be able to help shape all this. I learn an incredible amount because we develop almost everything ourselves.”Nicolas Hummel

 Reda Jaber takes a similar view of the work in the Smart.Production:Lab: “What I like best is the freedom to try out new technology.” Flat hierarchies allow the individual teams to organize themselves independently and also have a say in selecting the most appropriate projects. “Anyone can contribute ideas, all employees are heard,” says Reda Jaber. This was also the case with the work on Computer Vision – the success proves the developers are right.

When Yann LeCun founded the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) lab in 2013, artificial intelligence was entering a boom period that his research helped trigger.  
Facebook’s chief AI scientist had been among a group of computer scientists who retained faith in deep neural networks during an “AI winter” of reduced funding and interest in the field. In 2019, his efforts earned him a share of the Turing Award, together with his friends Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton. 
Today, AI is now an essential component of Facebook’s vast array of applications, touching everything from Messenger to content moderation.
“You take AI out of Facebook, and basically the services crumble,” LeCun tells TNW.
TNW Conference 2025 - Back to NDSM on June 19-20, 2025 - Save the date!As we wrapped up our incredible 2024 edition, we're pleased to announce our return to Amsterdam NDSM in 2025. Registration now!
Early Booking = Best rates
But fears are now emerging that another winter will soon arrive if AI can’t live up to its current hype, particularly around the promise of artificial general intelligence (AGI): the idea that a machine can perform any intellectual task a human can — and many that they can’t. 
LeCun is not a fan of the term. He’s previously argued that “there is no such thing as AGI” because “human intelligence is nowhere near general.” However, he is keenly pursuing “human-level AI.” His chosen technique for reaching it is self-supervised learning.
In supervised learning, people painstakingly label data and then feed it to an algorithm to teach it what to look for when solving a problem. But in self-supervised learning — often confused with unsupervised learning — there’s no need for human annotation. Instead, the system generates signals from the data and uses them to train itself.
It’s already become an integral part of Facebook’s work on hate speech detection, language translation, and forecasting the spread of COVID-19. LeCun compares the method to how babies learn by interacting with their surroundings. If machines can better replicate their technique, he believes they could gain the common sense they need to reach human-level intelligence:

Once we have a working methodology for that, we’ll have a tool that enables a machine to learn enormous amounts of knowledge about how the world works from physical reality — just by observing the world. They’d be able to learn world models that are predictive, which is essential to intelligence.

FAIR origins
FAIR began life after Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook CTO Michael Schroepfer identified AI as critical to the company’s long-term future.
“They were 100% right about this,” says LeCun, now Facebook’s chief AI scientist.
They decided to create a new research lab from scratch — and handpicked LeCun to lead it.
“What attracted me was there was a lot of opportunity.  But also, I had somewhat of a carte blanche to organize the lab in the way I thought would be the most successful.”
LeCun immediately made open research the cornerstone of his plans. FAIR now publishes almost all of its work, and open sources the majority of its code, datasets, and tools — such as PyTorch, a toolkit for quickly creating new machine learning models.
The motivation behind this approach isn’t purely altruistic. It allows Facebook to influence what researchers work on, foster collaborations with academia and industry, and attract talent to FAIR.
“The currency for a scientist is his or her intellectual impact on the community,” says LeCun. “So if you want to hire the best scientists in the world, and you tell them you can come here but you can’t talk about what you do — they’re not going to join.”
But isn’t he worried that Facebook’s rivals could steal the lab’s secrets?
“That’s fine. Why would it be bad? The value of a lot of the technology we produce is multiplied by a coefficient that is basically Facebook’s ability to deploy them in its services. It’s much more difficult — even if it’s open source — for another company to deploy it in ways that would compete directly with us.”
On the contrary, sharing the research helps Facebook improve its own products:

The main problem we need to solve is not whether we are a few months ahead of Google in a particular piece of technology — because it’s never more than a few months — it’s more that we don’t have the science or the technology that we need for the stuff that we want to build. So we need to help the community advance as much as possible to open research. The fact that other people use it is irrelevant.

AI advances and challenges
Much of the fundamental research behind the AI in Facebook products now takes place at FAIR. Among its most impactful creations are Memory Networks, which improve how machines talk to people by helping them retain enough data to answer general knowledge questions. An influential 2014 paper showed how the approach could answer questions about the plot of the Lord of the Rings.
“DeepMind was working on a very similar idea exactly simultaneously,” LeCun recalls. “We posted a paper on arXiv, and then three days later DeepMind posted their paper, because they didn’t want to be completely scooped. ”

At that time, DeepMind was one of the driving forces behind London’s emergence as a global AI hotbed. FAIR had initially planned to join them by launching its first European lab in the city. But after studying the availability of talent, the company pivoted to Paris.
“It was a more difficult turf to enter, whereas continental Europe was completely open,” says LeCun. “There was essentially no ambitious fundamental research lab in AI or even in information technology in continental Europe really.”
The lab has since become one of FAIR’s largest AI research centers and the birthplace of many of its computer science breakthroughs. Its recent innovations include Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS), a tool for quickly finding videos, text, or images that are similar to each other. The system can be used to recommend Instagram posts or to detect extremist propaganda videos that have been tweaked and then reposted to evade removal.
FAIR has also helped Facebook use AI to find hate speech on the platform. But these systems have received criticism for not detecting every language.
However, self-supervised learning is expanding the linguistic range of the tools. But LeCun believes the technique will only reach its potential once it can reason like a human.
I think that once we’ve broken through that brick wall, we’ll make a significant advance in the capabilities of AI systems. But the thing is, there’s probably going to be a brick wall right behind it that we don’t know about right now — because it’s hidden from us. So we don’t know how many brick walls we have to go through to get to rat-level intelligence, cat-level intelligence, human-level intelligence.
We don’t know how long it’s going to take up to break through this first wall. It could be next year, it could be five years from now, it could be 10 years, it could be 20 years. There’s good hope it’s going to happen soon, but how do we know? And then we’ll most likely encounter other obstacles that we don’t realize exist.

Spectrum OffshoreWind farm operators are important customers for Jess HanhamWith that information project managers can decide whether to place turbines and other equipment a safe distance from the suspected bombs, or have them blown up by a specialist firm.At the moment marine surveying is done by teams who go out on boats, collect the data and bring it back for analysis.Sometimes that will involve a relatively small vessel with two crew members, a surveyor and his kit. But bigger inspection projects further out to sea can involve much larger boats, with dozens of crew members, costing in the region of £100,000 per day.The sensor equipment varies according to the job. Sometimes it might be a sonar array towed behind the boat, for other jobs it might be an underwater unmanned vehicle, which can be controlled by surveyors on the surface.Bad weather can disrupt the work and make life uncomfortable. ""I've been at sea in force nine and force 10 gales and they're not nice places to work,"" says Brian Allen, chief executive of Rovco.More Technology of BusinessThe headphones even a DJ can't breakThe coldest computers in the worldVirtual house hunting gets a pandemic boostWhat you need to become an internet streaming starTraining your brain to relax on a virtual islandHis company is one of several looking to disrupt that market using artificial intelligence (AI) systems. They see a future where underwater robots, known as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), will be able to do the surveying work without much human oversight, and send the data back to surveyors in the office.Bristol-based Rovco is working on key pieces of the technology. It has trained an AI system to recognise objects on the seabed from data collected at sea, a process which took four years.Adding AI means the data does not have to be analysed by a human on the ship, or taken back to shore for assessment. That work is actually being done there and then by the AI, which can operate on the ship, or soon on the underwater robot itself.""Without AI autonomous underwater robots are pretty dumb - only being able to follow pipelines and cables in pre-programmed lines,"" says Mr Allen.""Enabling the AUV to analyse data in real time means you can actually instruct the robot to do other things. If you come across a problem, the survey can be stopped, and more data collected, with the robot making decisions for itself,"" he says.So, for example, if the AI flagged up something that looked like an unexploded bomb it could stop, go back, and do further analysis.RovcoThe goal is for robots to survey underwater structures with minimal human oversightFor some jobs, like dismantling underwater oil and gas infrastructure, engineers need to know the exact dimensions and locations of the equipment.To help with this Rovco has also developed a vision system that produces accurate maps of underwater infrastructure.The system generates a 3D cloud of individual data points, a format used in modelling software like CAD. It combines those points with camera images to generate a realistic 3D reconstruction.Rovco is currently bringing together the vision system, the AI and the underwater vehicle into one package. Other companies are also racing to introduce AI into the industry.ModusCompanies are racing to introduce AI into their underwater vehiclesJake Tompkins is the chief executive of UK-based Modus, which owns a fleet of 12 unmanned underwater vehicles. It is about to start a two-year programme with Durham University to develop an artificial intelligence control system that would allow some of its underwater vehicles to recognise their location, objects and anomalies during a survey.He says that combining with Durham is a very efficient way to develop the technology, because they already have proven AI systems for the car and aerospace industries. Using autonomous subsea robots to survey the seabed and inspect underwater structures would be a ""game changer"", according to Mr Tompkins and should ""significantly"" cut costs.He thinks it won't be long before underwater robots will be stationed out at sea, perhaps at an offshore wind farm, or at an oil or gas facility.When needed, they will be woken up and sent to harvest data, which will be sent back to an onshore control centre for processing.ModusIn the coming years underwater vehicles will be based offshore""I think we're probably two or so years away from the first commercial deployment of field-resident autonomous vehicles, but that is certainly where we are heading,"" says Mr Tompkins.His company is currently working on ways to keep the AUVs charged while they are out at sea and on technology that allows them to send back data.There is a juicy prize for the firms that can make such intelligent underwater robots work. Over the next decade the offshore wind market is expected to see ""quite extraordinary"" growth, according to Søren Lassen, head of offshore wind research at the consultancy Wood Mackenzie.At the moment only six countries have a commercial-scale offshore wind power industry. In 10 years' time, he forecasts that 20 countries will have joined that club. RovcoRapid installation of wind farms is likely to drive demand for autonomous underwater vehiclesLast year 29 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity was connected to electricity grids around the world. In 2029 Wood Mackenzie forecasts that number will hit 180 gigawatts.That will involve building thousands of wind turbines and laying thousands of kilometres of cable to connect up those wind farms and all of that will need the services of underwater surveyors.By 2029, much of that work at sea might be done by autonomous systems, with humans back at the office.Jess Hanham will keep his business up to date with the latest technology, but fears the work will become less rewarding.""I love the variety. For me being stuck in the office - I'd hate that. Going out and doing survey work, coming back and seeing the whole thing from start to finish - it gives you ownership of the work.

The leading solution is also dramatically transforming the logistics field. According to the research, the global AI in the logistics and supply chain market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 45.5% by 2027. In this article, we’re going to overlook the AI trends in logistics to look for in 2020.How Artificial Intelligence is transforming the logistics industryToday more and more AI-based logistics applications appear on the market to optimize the transportation companies’ and business performance. Each solution can help organizations to do certain tasks. So, let’s see 8 ways AI is transforming the logistics industry and how technology can improve your business.Automated warehousesIntegration of the AI solutions can decrease the costs by automating warehouses. The technology can do a lot of everyday routine tasks and change many processes like data collection, inventory, and so on. AI has the ability to analyze the data gathered, predict demand, re-route in-transit goods, modify orders, and communicate with each other for optimizing transportation between warehouses. Such agility and planning in logistics mean lower costs, better service, faster work.Jobs in MLAI-powered big dataIt’s not news that big data has great potential in various fields, including transportation and supply chain. There is tons of information gathered daily when dealing with logistics. It’s a true challenge to process and exploit all the data fast and accurately for planning. AI can do that. Besides that, the system considers such factors as political landscape, weather, and others. Today thanks to the AI solutions integrated, logistics companies can:Refine the data gathered from each touchpoint;Analyze all the data accurately;Come up with the patterns for better strategic decision making;Increase automation of repetitive tasks;Make clear and accurate predictions.Autonomous vehiclesWatching movies such as Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Demolition Man with Sylvester Stallone, the autonomous vehicles seemed to be just a fantasy. However, it’s a reality nowadays. Currently, such companies as Tesla and Google have already developed self-driving cars with AI implemented.Autonomous vehicles promise to reduce the costs, save time, decrease accident rates. Currently, human supervision is a must to drive autonomous vehicles on roads, yet in the future it’s expected that cars will be fully automated.Trending Bot Articles:1.

Automating WhatsApp with NLP: Complete guideComputer visionAI-based computer vision can help logistics companies with a wide range of tasks and optimize performance. For instance, the AI computer vision used for automating warehouses can identify the needs and help with organization of the inventory. Another use-case is from logistics giant DHL — visual inspection powered by AI. The technology helps:Scan and identify the damage;Classify it by the type;Determine the appropriate remedial measures.The key feature of the computer vision in this case is speed. The AI solution does all listed tasks much faster than ever before.There is one more great example from the retail giant Amazon. The system helps unload a trailer of inventory in only 30 minutes when doing the same without the computer vision takes several hours.Smart roadsAI used for roads can improve transportation and make it more effective, in-time, and safe. Thus, the great example of the technology used for the purpose are highways with solar panels and LED lights. Thus, the panels provide electricity and LED lights alert about various road conditions. What’s more, solar panels prevent the appearance of the slippery surface on the road in winter.Drivers, using the roads with AI-based fiber optic sensors, can get the information about the traffic volumes, alerts about road conditions, accidents, etc. In the event that the vehicle or truck gets in an accident on such a road, the AI technology will immediately report appropriate emergency services.Artificial Intelligence of the back office operationsThe AI solutions integrated can automate the repetitive back-office tasks and operations. Combining AI with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the logistics organizations can improve the accuracy, speed, productivity of the employees, and reduce the costs. The technology is helpful with the everyday data-related tasks that can be done by robotic assistance. This will free your workers and let them focus on other crucial aspects. That leads to a rise in their quality of work.Predictive capabilitiesAccurate predictions can save money and customers. The AI technology integrated provides various algorithms for forecasting the trends, goods, and/or supplies needed for your company in the future. As Deloitte reports, such algorithms forecast outcomes precisely and better than human experts. The technology tracks and measures all inputs and variables for creating contingency plans. That can reduce the costs of your company, navigating you successfully through any emergencies.Customer experienceIt’s no matter if your company is B2B or B2C, it’s crucial to keep your customers engaged. The fastest way to do it is to improve their experience. AI technology can increase customer loyalty and retention. The solution can personalize the service, suggest products according to the previous purchases, page views, and customizations based on the buying preferences, habits. In such a way the AI integration can turn users into consumers, increase revenue, build a brand.Final thoughtsAI technology dramatically reshapes the logistics field. The integration of the solution can improve inventory, transportation, accuracy, management, and power the employees to make their job more efficient. The key feature of the solution is the automation of the routine tasks, speed, and efficiency of the back office, big data analytics, and on and on. Artificial Intelligence can also eliminate the risks and reduce the accidents associated with the transportation of the cargos. In this article, we provide you with 8 ways the AI transforms the industry and show you the use-cases on how your business can benefit from the integration of the solution.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://becominghuman.ai/artificial-intelligence-in-the-logistics-industry-d9fbed9c0172,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",https://becominghuman.ai/artificial-intelligence-in-the-logistics-industry-d9fbed9c0172,2020-08-13T14:16:15.246Z,2020-08-13T14:16:15.246Z,2021-12-15T13:50:43.701Z,,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/1*6md5JO_LeZYtvB3BGqj4xw.gif'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bogdan Ivanov', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@bodgan.ivanov'}",,,Artificial Intelligence in the logistics industry - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,Artificial Intelligence in the logistics industry - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,d9fbed9c0172,['Bogdan Ivanov'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just like any other profession, medicine is also having a taste of Artificial intelligence. According to various medical researches, about 50 percent of activities carried out by workers can be automated..How medical practitioners respond to the use of AI is important to its success. For instance, 25 years ago, certain medical innovations were almost impossible. .As a matter of fact, AI has contributed immensely to medicine but what does the future hold for medicine..What is artificial intelligence in medicine?.Artificial intelligence is the use of AI technology, also known as 'automated processes' in the diagnosis and treatment of patients that require medical attention..Although diagnosis and treatment could seem much like basic processes, nevertheless several other background procedures must be carried out for a patient to go through proper recovery. Below are some of the processes;.Garnering patient's data through tests and interviewsProcessing and analyzing test resultsUtilization of different data sources to come up with an accurate diagnosis. Resolving on a proper treatment processPreparing and administering the preferred method of treatmentMonitoring patientPost – care, follow-ups and appointments.The reason for the increasing use of AI in healthcare is because quite a number of the above may be automated. Don't forget, these processes mentioned above form part of the 50 percent of workers activities that can be automated..Besides, automation of these processes will ensure that tasks are completed more efficiently. It gives the medical professional more time to handle other activities. .According to a 2016 research, doctors spend a lot of time on data analysis and administrative work than talking to patients. According to AMA past President Steven Stack &quot;This Research expressed, what many doctors feel — data entry and administrative activities are reducing the doctor-patient time which is fundamental to medicine, and the major reason many of us became physicians,&quot; .However, excessively-automation of the medical and health care sectors will not produce the expected result. Meanwhile, the focus ought to be intentionally and rationally defining areas where automation could free up time and energy. The objective is to strike a balance between the successful use of AI and the human capabilities and judgment of qualified healthcare experts..How technology impacts on patient health care.No doubt, modern technology has made a huge impact on every aspect of our lives. Moreover, healthcare is one sector that has significantly benefited the most from the technology advancement experienced in the last 50 years..Technological advancements accomplished in recent years have saved millions of lives and improved the quality of human life..Let us look at some of the most notable developments in healthcare driven by the new technological advancements;.Facilitates Communication Between Clinicians.A variety of healthcare practitioners are also interested in a patient's healing journey. It can significantly increase the risk of miscommunication or mistake. Poor communication is one of the most common factors contributing to the occurrence of potential complications. .Reduction of Medical Error.Prescribing errors can lead to complications. Electronic prescriptions would significantly minimize prescription errors by allowing doctors to send prescriptions automatically to an online pharmacy..Provides access to information.With just a simple click, a physician can access all information needed to treat a patient. This will obviously rule out any room for mistakes. Information technology has dramatically increased access to reference materials.  .Increases patient-centred care.It encourages patients to become more involved in their treatment is essential for a variety of reasons. Some include increased compliance and patient satisfaction. Technology continues to contribute to patient-centred treatment by facilitating contact between clinicians and patients through online apps, text messages and email.  .Presence of artificial intelligence in health care.There are several levels of Artificial intelligence in healthcare. Often, Artificial intelligence uses web databases, which makes it easy for health experts to gain access to tons of diagnostic resources..The healthcare profession is actively engaged in conducting research; therefore the use of Artificial Intelligence will significantly improve the physician's work. Also, it will provide a better result that can be tailored to their medical knowledge. .AI's ability to &quot;think&quot; from data creates an opportunity for increased precision based on feedback. This feedback includes several back-end database sources, reviews from clinicians, health care professionals, and research organizations. .Interestingly, healthcare AI systems are always functioning in real-time. This ensures that the data is still up-to-date, thereby increasing quality and relevance. Besides, the data obtained is a collection of specific patient records, electronic recordings of medical instruments, laboratory results, medical tests and various demographics..Future of AI in healthcare.AI's future in health care may include activities that vary from basic to advance. In the nearest future, it may include answering calls, analyzing medical records, trending population health and analytics. .Also, developing medicinal drugs and devices, reading radiological images, making medical diagnostic and treatment plans, and even communicating with patients is part of AI's improvement..On the other hand, some physicians have argued that AI in medicine will do the following to the profession;.Dismantle medicineCreate room for non-experts to infuriate the professionLikely send the role of a doctor into extinctionIncrease inefficiency.Although these concerns are ideal, it will be almost impossible to reduce the use of Ai in medicine now. Effective monitoring and proper regulations remain the only solution..Artificial intelligence in pharmacy.In the pharmaceutical field, Artificial Intelligence works with researchers to help decision-making processes for approved drugs and to develop therapies for other diseases. .Also, it will expedite the process of clinical trials by selecting the right patients from a range of data sources. .The Pharmacy sector is also working on forecasting with some precision when and where infectious outbreaks can occur. Similarly, pharmaceutical Artificial Intelligence will also focus database to prescribe drugs for patients. .More so the history of previous outbreaks and some other mainstream outlets will form part of the database. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

From enhancing human capabilities to automating repetitive tasks and streamlining customer services to improving business efficiency, AI is already making its way into everyday business processes. According to PwC research, AI is likely to add US$15.7 trillion to global economic growth by 2030. While the technology's acceptance in mainstream society is becoming a new phenomenon, it has been around decades ago..The recent advances in AI significantly have augmented human cognition and decisions, taking every aspect of people's lives and business by storm. The rapid deployment of AI across industries is majorly driven by the growing investment in technology. In a recent IDC report, spending on AI systems is expected to reach US$97.9 billion in 2023, over two and one-half times the US$37.5 billion in 2019, growing at CAGR of 28.9 percent throughout the forecast period of 2018-2023..Business Opportunities Influenced by AI.AI typically delivers an incredible opportunity for automation and digital transformation. It has the potential to upgrade businesses' workforce, rather than eliminating them if implemented effectively. It can have a considerable impact on an organizational workflow as it confiscates repetitive, tedious tasks, offering more autonomy to apply creativity and human decision on other valuable tasks..Persistent AI innovations has given the rise to a horde of smart devices that are able to detect and react to sights, sounds, and other patterns, and do not require a constant connection to the cloud. From autonomous robots to vision cameras and medical devices, these smart devices are well set to unlock greater efficiency at an organizational level..As the current AI capability augments human decisions on everything, researchers and developers globally are attempting autonomous AI that will not require any human intervention, even in making highly complex decisions. However, many are also concerned about this and raise questions if things will go wrong how will be accountable?.Meanwhile, organizations that have already started the business transformation using AI now are looking for ways to reap repeatable value. In its survey, Deloitte Insights sees increasing levels of AI implementation and financial investment. The survey found that respondents are realizing competitive advantage and expecting AI-powered transformation to happen for their organization and industry alike. The survey report also noted that AI-driven businesses must work harder to maintain an edge over their peers..Artificial intelligence has also the potential to improve user experience. It can offer insights by decrypting spoken or written communications and inferring actions based on patterns of past behavior. Enterprises can derive the biggest ROI over their resources using this tech. Additionally, in order to drive automation and optimize business processes, leveraging AI can provide substantial benefits..Comprehensively, business leaders need to pilot high-return AI initiatives that can them help stay competitive in AI supremacy. They also must build AI capability at an organization level, bring technology implementation strategy to business strategy, and lay the foundation of appropriate AI governance..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Even before the COVID 19 outbreak affected the working of IT infrastructure, the organizations were looking out for recruiting good data analytics team. With the advancement of AI, it becomes imperative for organizations to not only harness good data analytics but also to reach out to skills that can be insightful towards data analytics..A data analytics team usually consists of data scientist, data engineers, data designers, statisticians, research analysts, and business analysts..For LinkedIn's emerging job reports for the year 2020, Data Scientists and Data Engineers gained the top positions. Both skills are flooded with young talent, new ideas, and a yearning to collaborate and advance data analytics. However, often due to the absence of coordination, communication, and focus, data scientists and data engineers can fail to deliver the required results, leading to instability within the infrastructure..Both Data Scientists and Data Engineers form the core of the data analytics team. .Data Engineers collect, manage, and store the data. They are responsible for data infrastructure, scale and quality to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They design, build, create, and integrate data from various sources, and write queries of the easily accessible data.  The Data Engineers are more focused on designing data, thus preparing a large amount of big data to be used in making Business Decisions..Data Scientists work on the usage of the data. They turn big data into legible insights with the application of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, to solve critical business problems..Creating the Hub.A Hub represents a cross-functional team, including Data engineers and Data Scientists, which display a mixture of skills and perspectives. It is operated by Chief Data Officers. Building a strong data ecosystem, one that is agile and responsible, data scientists and data engineers must be assigned responsibilities according to the skills exhibited by both. As they work in the same neighborhood in the IT infrastructure, it will embed a sense of accountability, which will help them in setting up priorities and achieving goals..A Hub also helps in nurturing the AI talent and creating communities, where the employees display their methods and ideas that works best for an organization. It also amplifies space for addressing multiple issues, along with the isolated business one..The Hub organizes different AI models and interprets various data insights by deploying new AI capabilities..Building Diverse Teams.Building a diverse team would consolidate a variety of opinions and ideas. It will allow data engineers and data scientists to apply different permutations and combinations of the existing algorithm to derive into a conclusion..A diverse team enables Data Scientists and Data Engineers to apply AI tools, address the new challenges, and acknowledge the loophole in the existing algorithm. As mistakes tend to learn, it will facilitate the employees to correct minor issues that were difficult to notice earlier..The diverse team can also include assigning executive projects that will enable the employees for incorporating a broader perspective, deploying and monitoring new AI capabilities by inputs from the frontline staff..Explaining the importance of the Project.For any organization to work smoothly, it becomes necessary that the employees and the team must understand the necessity and importance of a new or existing project..Making them understand, the aim, procedure, strategical process, and reason behind taking up a new or existing project would enhance their performance, thus rendering them to work towards a common goal..Providing Space to Learn and Grow.Data Scientists and Data engineers are young talents that thrive in learning and applying the knowledge for building new products. Redundant work can make them unenthusiastic towards their skills, hence organizations must focus on a broader overview for implementing growth and learning..This will also enhance in sharpening their AI tools, mature their AI capabilities, and make them more accountable, enthusiastic, and responsible towards the data ecosystem..Managing Relationships to Learn.Managing Relationship between employees helps in reviewing past barriers. Developing a portfolio of initiatives by managing relationships would enhance the prioritization of projects, provide a long term view, and would help in taking decisions for combined projects..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
