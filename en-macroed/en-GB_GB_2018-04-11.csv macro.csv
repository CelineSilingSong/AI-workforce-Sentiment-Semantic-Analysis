In 2013, we published a paper entitled “The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?”, estimating that 47% of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation.
Since then, numerous studies have emerged, arriving at very different conclusions. In particular, one study published by a group of researchers at the University of Mannheim suggests that only 9% of jobs are exposed to automation. And more recently, a study by the OECD suggests that it is actually 14%, with a further “32% of jobs have a risk of between 50 and 70% pointing to the possibility of significant change in the way these jobs are carried out as a result of automation.”
Many policymakers naturally find it hard to make sense of these results. Which study is right? And why do they arrive at very different conclusions? In this article, we shall seek to explain why these estimates diverge.
For all their differences, these studies build on the same intuition. This is that the future of work can be inferred by observing what computers do. And there are good reasons to believe that this view is right. Back in 2003, David Autor, Frank Levy, and Richard Murnane, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), showed that jobs which were intensive in routine tasks had disappeared since 1980. Their findings were entirely predictable.
In his 1960 essay, “The Corporation: Will It Be Managed by Machines?”, Herbert Simon predicted the decline of routine jobs, arguing that computers hold the comparative advantage in “routine” rule-based activities which are easy to specify in computer code. Through a series of case studies in 1960, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also arrived at a similar conclusion, suggesting that:

A little over 80% of the employees affected by the change were in routine jobs involving posting, checking, and maintaining records; filing; computing; or tabulating, keypunch, and related machine operations.

Despite their accurate insights, Simon and the BLS were careful enough not to provide a timeline for how long it would take before routine jobs would disappear in large numbers. And neither did we back in 2013.
Our study wasn’t even a prediction. It was an estimate of how exposed existing jobs are to recent developments in artificial intelligence and mobile robotics. It said nothing about the pace at which jobs will be automated away. What it did suggest is that 47% of jobs are automatable from a technological capabilities point of view. As we pointed out back then:

we focus on estimating the share of employment that can potentially be substituted by computer capital, from a technological capabilities point of view, over some unspeciﬁed number of years. We make no attempt to estimate how many jobs will actually be automated. The actual extent and pace of computerisation will depend on several additional factors which were left unaccounted for.

Our estimates have often been taken to imply an employment apocalypse. Yet that is not what we intended or suggested. All we showed is that the potential scope of automation is vast, just as it was at the eve of the Second Industrial Revolution, before electricity and the internal combustion engine rendered many of the jobs that existed in 1900 redundant. Had our great grandfathers tried to make a similar assessment by the turn of the twentieth century, they would probably have arrived at a similar figure. Back in 1900, over 40% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Now it is less than 2%.
Seen through the lens of the twentieth century, our estimate, that 47% of jobs are exposed to future automation, does not seem extraordinarily high. On the contrary, the University of Mannheim and the OECD estimates seem extremely low.
Both of these studies take their starting point from our methodology, so let’s begin with a non-technical description of it.
 In 2013, we gathered a group of machine learning experts to assess the automatability of 70 occupations using detailed task descriptions. Specifically, we asked the experts to assess whether each task for these occupations was automatable, given the availability of state-of-the-art computer equipment and conditional upon the availability of relevant big data for the algorithm to draw upon. Data were derived from O*Net which, through surveys of the working population, has collected some 20,000 unique task descriptions along with data on the skills, knowledge and abilities possessed by different occupations. Such “big data” comes with one non-negligible problem: the human brain struggles to process it. But mercifully we live in the age of AI. And AI performed most of our analysis.
The role of the experts was to provide us with what machine learning researchers call a “training dataset”, allowing our algorithm to learn about the features of automatable vs. non-automatable jobs. While the task descriptions provided for each occupation in O*Net are unique, O*Net also provides a set of common features for all occupations, which also stems from surveys, during which workers are asked how often they engage in particular activities, such as taking care of customers, negotiating, developing novel ideas and artefacts. These features allowed our algorithm to learn about the characteristics of automatable as well as non-automatable occupations, which in turn allowed us to predict the automatability of another 632 occupations.
Thus, we were able to examine a total of 702 occupations, which in 2013 made up 97% of the U.S. workforce.
Using AI for our analysis had benefits beyond saving time and labour. Among the occupations the experts deemed non-automatable were waiters and waitresses. Our AI algorithm however gave us another answer. By examining the similarities between the tasks performed by waiters and those of other occupations, it suggested that the jobs of waiters are in fact automatable. And it was proven right: in 2016 the completely waiter-less restaurant chain Eatsa opened.
Of course, algorithms are only as good as the data we feed them, and our approach did have one drawback. As we pointed out in the paper, while “our probability estimates describe the likelihood of an occupation being fully automated, we do not capture any within-occupation variation […].” What we mean by this is that underlying our analysis was a set of occupation specific features. But every occupation employs thousands of individuals, of which some potentially perform slightly different tasks. This was also the point that the authors of the Mannheim as well as the OECD study picked up on, although within-occupation variation probably plays a minor role: the job of a taxi driver or a cashier, for example, is essentially the same across companies and locations. Still, by using individual instead of occupational level data, allowing them to also capture within-occupation variation, this approach has its merits.
However, we do have a number of other queries regarding these studies.
What all previous studies have in common, including our study, is that they infer the automatability of jobs by analysing their tasks. While the Mannheim study appears to take a task-based approach, a closer look at the variables being used shows that this is not the case.
Instead of relying primarily on tasks, the Mannheim study uses worker and firm characteristics, as well as demographic variables such as sex, education, age, and income. According to this approach, the more an accountant earns, the less automatable his job is. If he or she happens to have a PhD in sociology, the job is safer from automation. Similarly, a female taxi driver with a PhD is less likely to be displaced by a self-driving car than a man who has been driving a taxi for decades. Yet why should automation discriminate on the basis of worker characteristics? 
Back in 2013, we observed that workers who were employed in jobs that are exposed to automation tend to have lower levels of education and (typically) lower incomes. And we also noted that a disproportionate number of women work in occupations that are less exposed to automation relative to men. The Mannheim study, however, uses these outcomes as inputs into their analysis. In fact, jobs are not more or less exposed because of the sex of the worker, though some more male-dominated jobs are more exposed to automation.
The OECD study does not make the same mistake: it does not include demographic variables, which might explain why it finds a larger share of jobs to be exposed to automation. It suggests that between 6% (in Norway) and 33% (in Slovakia) of jobs are automatable across the OECD countries. While their headline figure suggests that only 14% of jobs across these countries are automatable, using our definition, their median automatability estimate is quite high: the median job is estimated to have 48% probability of being automated.
Like the Mannheim study, the OECD uses individual level data from the PIAAC survey, which they argue explains why they find a lower percentage of jobs to be automatable, relative to our estimate. However, they do not provide any evidence to actually show that this is the case. To take the example of the truck driver, our approach treats all truck drivers as equal: when autonomous vehicles arrive, all of them will become exposed to automation. The OECD study argues that their estimates are lower than ours because a large share of drivers will not find themselves exposed but without providing any data to show that this is the case. We would welcome the OECD’s publication of the distribution of workers that are exposed to automation by occupation.
We find it hard to believe that the tasks performed by different truck drivers (or workers within any other occupation) vary that greatly. We find it even harder to believe that this would explain a staggering difference between 14% and 47% being exposed to automation. More fundamentally, even if there is variation in the tasks being performed within occupations, would one not expect companies to simplify the tasks in production to be able to take advantage of the new technology? For example, depending on the soil and weather conditions, farm labourers in 1900 will have performed slightly different tasks. But in the developed world, nearly all of them eventually adopted the tractor after it arrived.
Given that the only source data that both studies consider on automatability is our training set, the only reasonable way to check which of their model and our model is preferable is how well it performs on that training set. A common way of evaluating such performance is “holding out” (hiding) elements of the training set provided to the model: later, the model’s predictions for these unseen occupations can be compared against their actual values. A frequently used metric to assess this is the AUC, which is the only comparable metric computed for both studies. By this measure, the non-linear model in our study is substantively more accurate (in predicting held-out members of the training set) than the linear model used in the OECD study. The bi-modal distribution of automatability scores in our study is the result of the confidence of our model (most occupations are confidently predicted to be either automatable or not): the fact that the model mostly correctly predicts held-out elements of the training set lends weight to this confidence. It is, unfortunately, not clear from the evidence in the OECD study that its model is (nor that the results that follow from it are) more reliable.
Furthermore, while our analysis examines 702 occupations, the OECD study results are broken down by broad occupational categories. And as the OECD study accurately notes, “valuable information is lost when the risk of automation is calculated based on the skill requirements of broad occupational categories.” As the OECD study finds that 14% of jobs are exposed to automation, it is possible that 2 to 3 occupations drive their results entirely.
We appreciate the attempt of the OECD to add to our work. The reason why we made our data publicly available is to allow others to build upon it. This is also the reason that the OECD and the University of Mannheim were able to adjust our methodology. We would welcome similar transparency from these studies.
Policymakers need to understand the thinking behind the disparate numbers in these studies to draw their own conclusions about the scale of the changes facing us, and so to be able to craft appropriate responses.

The technology has already yielded great success in streamlining work processes in the healthcare industry, reducing man-hours spent in administrative tasks in the education sector and reducing overhead costs in the manufacturing world. It seems as if a new AI startup pops up every day with the purpose of changing the way we think, interact and work on a day to day basis.In honor of this technology, we have compiled a plethora of stats that relate to AI in order to give you an idea of how prevalent the technology is nowadays. These stats cover the state of the technology as of 2018, which has seen companies such as WorkFusion emerge as leaders in the industry. The software company offers a wide variety of intelligent automation solutions for businesses looking to boost their ROI.Here are 15 AI stats you need to know in 2018:Only 15% of enterprises are using AI as of today, but 31% are expected to add it over the coming 12 months, according to Adobe.The number of active startups has increased by 1400% since 2000, per Stanford University.Investment into AI startups by venture capitalists has soared sixfold since 2000, per Adobe.The share of jobs requiring AI has increased by 450% since 2013, per Adobe.For enterprises using AI, top-performing companies said they are more than twice as likely as their industry counterparts to use the technology for marketing, 28% vs. 12%, per Stanford.According to BridghtEdge, the next big marketing trend is seen as being consumer personalization (29%), followed by AI (26%).The three most in-demand skills on Monster.com are machine learning (ML), deep learning and natural language processing (NLP).International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that the compound annual growth rate for global sending on AI will be 50.1%, reaching $57.6 billion by 2021. This is thanks to investments in retail, banking, healthcare and manufacturing, which will make up over half of the worldwide spending on AI.Adobe also discovered that 47% of digitally mature organizations, which are those with advanced digital practices, have a defined AI strategy.Juniper Research discovered in a study that, in retail, global spending on AI will grow to $7.3 billion a year by 2022, up from $2 billion in 2018. This is because companies will invest heavily in AI tools that will help them differentiate and improve the services they offer customers.About 61% of companies with an innovation strategy are using AI to identify opportunities in data that they would have otherwise missed, according to Narrative Science. This figure is only 22% for companies without this strategy.About 38% of consumers believe that AI will improve customer service, according to Page.A PointSource study found that when AI is deployed tactically, 34% of shoppers will spend more money online. About 49% said they are willing to shop more frequently online when AI is present.The AI healthcare market is expected to hit $6.6 billion by 2021, according to Accenture data. The study added that clinical health AI applications can create $150 billion in annual savings for the U.S. healthcare economy by 2026.Around the globe, robot imports have increased from around 100,000 in 2000 to roughly 250,000 in 2015, according to IDC.",NewsArticle,https://towardsdatascience.com/15-artificial-intelligence-ai-stats-you-need-to-know-in-2018-b6c5eac958e5,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",2018-04-13T19:02:00.874Z,2018-07-05T20:01:00.829Z,15 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stats You Need to Know in 2018,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*JJBMmg71i3thP_5yBI_uJg.png'],,https://towardsdatascience.com/15-artificial-intelligence-ai-stats-you-need-to-know-in-2018-b6c5eac958e5,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Karl Utermohlen', 'url': 'https://towardsdatascience.com/@karl.utermohlen'}",2018-04-13T19:02:00.874Z,15 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stats You Need to Know in 2018,b6c5eac958e5,['Karl Utermohlen'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“I’m fascinated with this,” he told Observer.
A fashion week wunderkind who made his meteoric rise at the age of 20, Posen is better known for designing handcrafted, red carpet-ready dresses than researching how algorithms imitate the human thinking process.
Nevertheless, he is deeply curious and optimistic about the potential impact of cutting-edge technology on the fashion industry. Posen is an avid follower of leading tech shows from Japan, and has even worked with engineers and the creative staff of Microsoft to develop software that could virtually synthesize his hands-on draping process.
“Artificial intelligence and bots are part of the evolutional story of life on earth,” he said. “AI is going to touch every part of our life—communication, medical fields and even trading commodities. They are living, functioning minds.”
“From a fashion sense, I think the curation of an algorithm is a really fascinating and interesting game… [for algorithms] to be able to compile personal data to tell people what they like,” he added.
AI-powered fashion is a concept both tech companies and traditional fashion retailers are aggressively experimenting with.
Stitch Fix, a seven-year-old startup, attracted millions of users to its fashion subscription service that can accurately predict what clothing items a user will like, thanks to a machine learning algorithm, based on “keep-and-return” records on Stitch Fix and other social media activities.
Amazon (AMZN) recently introduced a new device called Echo Look. Between any two outfit photos, the device (through it’s Style Check feature) can judge which one is more “stylish,” based on standards devised from a trove of fashion photos and fashion styles on the internet. The e-commerce giant is also exploring a fashion line entirely designed by robots.
Even more traditional fashion brands are jumping onto the AI bandwagon.
Earlier this year, Tommy Hilfiger partnered with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York on a project that utilizes IBM’s 3D design tool to speed up the retailer’s trend forecasting, design and supply chain overall.
Consumers seem to be welcoming these advancements with open arms. A January study by IBM showed that 52 percent of Generation Z women would like to see tools that allow them to customize products for themselves.
While all these initiatives are great strides toward digitalized fashion, most of them take place in the retail space and feel somewhat distant from the haute couture world where Posen lives.
“I find it hard to imagine that AI algorithms can produce anything avant-garde or creative on purpose,” Natalie Nudell, a fashion historian who teaches at the FIT, recently told Observer.
Few people in fashion value creativity more than Posen.
As Neiman Marcus’ fashion director Ken Downing said in 2017 documentary House of Z, “[Posen] wanted to be a creature, as opposed to just a fashion designer.”
In that sense, Posen is acutely aware of the possible weakness of robots overtaking a designer’s job.
“AI will not be able to synthesize the irrational surprises that only humans have. On a daily basis, a human brain processes so much experiences and influences that can lead to changes in taste and choices immediately and irrationally. That’s something I don’t believe AI or algorithms can be as quick or reactive yet,” he explained.
“For example, when I’m creating draping, there are mistakes and unexpected things that happen. A fan in my office can be blowing. It can blow a fabric in a certain direction that captures the moment that I want to capture. That kind of situational, spontaneous moments of beauty is disappearing when things are formulated and automated,” Posen continued.
In House of Z, supermodel Crystal Renn said, if she could only have one word to describe Posen, it would be “the builder.”
“He takes this fabric, which is ultimately a dead piece of fabric, and he builds it and manipulates it into this piece that, even standing alone, is alive,” she said.
That’s exactly what makes Posen’s work irreplaceable by robots.
“Technology can’t systemize something that’s emotional. And fashion is emotional. After all, AI is not wearing the clothes,” he said.
Another problem Posen sees in AI-assisted fashion is the boundary it sets for trend forecasting, an area where many retailers and scientists believe AI will make a real difference.
“I respect trend forecasting. That’s important if you are running a business. But I find it kind of irrelevant for the creative mind,” Posen said. “You can go on Pinterest and study a topic. But, at a certain point, the image stream you see is going to repeat itself. 
“My point is, basically any imagery that wasn’t inputted into a computer before the internet existed becomes irrelevant,” he added. “That unfortunately kills creativity.”
That said, in the vast landscape of fashion, there will likely be a space dominated by androids, sooner or later.
“The design process will become virtual. You will have brands that are designed by AI in the future,” Posen said. “As scary as it is, it’s exciting to be living in a time when we can see how tech becomes part of our evolutionary journey.”

A Brief Explanation for laymanReza Chu·FollowPublished inDataDrivenInvestor·4 min read·Apr 15, 2018741ListenShareIn the past two years, Artificial Intelligence has become one of the hottest topics. Thanks to AlphaGo, the general public believes A.I. is a monster that had beaten human and sooner it is going to take their jobs away. As a machine learning engineer, I see the necessity to explain what is A.I. to the layman which could clear the illustration forged by the media. Here we go.“AI is all about figuring what to do when you don’t know what to do.”, Peter Norvig.Artificial Intelligence is not a magical program that can think like a human. The mechanism behind it is to utilise different mathematic algorithms to learn from a tremendous amount of structured data to solve dedicated cognitive problems that originally can be only solved by human intelligence. And the robust part of A.I. is it can acquire a pattern from the provided data to solve a problem in high accuracy. Meanwhile, we don’t even know what is actually happening inside the program but the algorithm would take care of it. In a simple word, A.I. learns from the data feed by human to solve dedicated problem. Let’s take a look to these six major subfields in A.I.1. Computer Vision:e.g. Recognizing object from real world images or video, just like the iPhone X’s Face ID.2. Planning:e.g. Searching for the shortest path between your home and the nearest shopping mall.3. Natural Language Processing:e.g. Interpreting what are you saying, writing, etc.4. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:e.g. Chatbot that answer customer questions.5. Robotics:e.g. The self driving car that take care of your travel.6. Machine Learning:e.g Predicting the housing price by learning from the historical data.How does Artificial Intelligence Agent solve problems?So, how does A.I. learn? Typically, there are three learning methods, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In supervised learning, we would label the correct answer inside the data and the agent would learn the pattern by comparing the result with the target label in order to achieve accurate prediction.; In unsupervised learning, we would not tell what we are looking for but let the learning algorithm to help us divide the data into category as many as we desired.; Lastly, reinforcement learning is more like learning by doing. At the beginning, we do not have any labeled data, however, we would set up different policies with corresponding reward or penalty. The A.I. would learn the optimal by trying different actions in each condition to achieve the highest reward under the specified environment and policies.Can Artificial Intelligence Agent replace human?To develop an A.I. agent to solve a task, there are four basic criteria.1. We need to clearly define the problem domain and the learning objective.2. We have to provide structured data for the agent or we are able to design a good environment, policies and reward system for reinforcement learning.3. The data provided must contain useful information for the agent to learn from it. If the data fed in have no value, the agent would never be able to solve the task.4. Decide an evaluation method to measure the performance of the agent. Otherwise, we won’t know the model is accurate or not.Rule no.1: Garbage In, Garbage Out.From my experience, the hardest part of building a prediction model is to decide what sample data should I use and how to gather those data. Luckily, there are many open-sourced data and algorithm library that could let us to train our model much easier than few year before. However, you could also gather the desired data by yourselves.Conclusion ~ Will it take our job?Undoubtedly, A.I. would disrupt our world in the soon future, however, we should firstly understand it and think of the opportunities created by A.I. instead of blindly worrying the fourth industrial revolution would replace all of the jobs. A.I. technology required a large amount of training data to look for a specific pattern in order to resolve the problem. And it has its own bottleneck such as: Do we have the data? Does the specific problem has a pattern? Can we structure the information into computer interpretable data? Is the computer powerful enough to handle a huge amount of data. Moreover, A.I. would soon replaces jobs that are highly repeatable, however, it would also create many job posts, for instance: data scientist, data security engineer, etc. On top of it, applying the new technology to the real world needs to solve many political, legislative and humane problems which might take years. Let’s say the self driving car application, lots of researches and experiments proved that self driving car is safer than human driving. However, once it killed people in an accident (which happened lately in U.S.), who is going to take the responsibility? In addition, do we need a driver sitting in the driver seat in case of any malfunction, so he can switch it to manual mode to save lives? If a driver is compulsory for self driving car after legislation, it ain’t gonna bring a big impact on the driver job.It is very likely a large amount of traditional labor force, especially the grassroots class would be replaced by Robots and AI, however, the replacing process might take years and the society would have time to digest it gradually. The most important thing is we should learn about what is AI and think about how is it going to change our job instead of blindly panic. Hopefully this read could give you a brief glance of the A.I. world and motivated you to learn more about A.I.",NewsArticle,https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/what-is-ai-a-brief-explanation-for-layman-f79f368702ea,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'DataDrivenInvestor', 'url': 'medium.datadriveninvestor.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 308, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:616/1*OMF3fSqH8t4xBJ9-6oZDZw.png'}}",2018-04-15T14:54:41.484Z,2018-05-29T02:29:53.688Z,What is AI?

In their very provocative paper, Peter Battaglia and his colleagues, posit that in order for artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve the capabilities of human intelligence, it must be able to compute with highly structured data types, such as the ones humans deal with. This means that AI must be able to work with information about relationships between objects, which are effectively encoded as graphs, i.e. collections of nodes and edges between these nodes, and also attributes attached to the nodes and edges.
A simple example would be images, where one considers graphs which are shaped like a square grid, with the pixel values being the attribute attached to a particular node in the grid. The authors go on to describe the framework they have developed for computing with graph structured data, in particular describing how neural networks for this kind of computation can be built.  
Embedded in this work is the following question:
Where do the graphs come from?
The question recognizes the fact that most data is “sensory” in character, i.e. it is obtained by measuring numerical quantities and recording their values as coordinates of vectors in a high dimensional space, and consequently do not come equipped with any explicit underlying graph structure.
It follows that in order to achieve human like intelligence in studying such data, it is necessary to construct graph or relational structures from sensory data, and also that performing such constructions is a critical ingredient in human intelligence.  
The goal of this post is to describe a method for performing exactly this task, and to describe how neural networks can be constructed directly from the output of such methods. We can summarize the approach as follows.

A key ingredient is a geometry or metric on the set of features or sensors that are capturing the sensory data.
The second key ingredient is that of a covering of the set of features by subsets. The coverings typically are chosen to be well related to the geometry in a suitable sense.
The geometry and related coverings are used in conjunction to construct graph structures from the features defining the data.
They are also used to construct analogues of the pooling constructions used in convolutional neural networks, which permit the learning to be based on various levels of resolution.  

The interested reader should consult the Topological Data Analysis Based Approaches to Deep Learning and Topological Approaches to Deep Learning where the constructions are discussed in detail.
We strongly agree with the point of view expressed in the DeepMind/Google paper that their work rejects the false choice between “hand-engineering” and “end-to end” approaches to learning, and instead argues for the recognition that the approaches are complementary and should be treated as such. What follows is that we should be developing a wide variety of tools and methods that enable hand-engineering of neural networks. The methods described in the DeepMind/Google paper are a step in that direction, as are papers on TDA-based Approaches to Deep Learning and Topological Approaches to Deep Learning. 
We also observe that the benefits of such an approach go beyond improving the accuracy and speed of neural net computations. Once the point of view of the DeepMind/Google paper is adopted, one will be able to create algorithms which realize the idea of machine-human interaction.  In particular, they will be more transparent, so that one can understand their internal functioning, and also provide more complex “human-readable” outputs, with which humans can interact. This paper on the Exposition and Interpretation of the Topology of Neural Networks constitutes a step in that direction.
Finally, we observe that in order to fully realize this vision, it is important not only to make the computation scheme human readable, but also the input data. Without a better understanding of what is in the data, the improvements described by Battaglia and his colleagues will only get us part of the way to fully actualizing artificial intelligence. Topological methods provide tools for understanding the qualitative and relational aspects of data sets, and should be used in the understanding of the algorithms which analyze them.
Graphs from geometry
In the case of images, the graph structure on the set of attributes (pixels) is that of a square grid, with some diagonal connections included.  
  
Our first observation is that the grid is actually contained in a continuous geometric object, namely the plane. The importance of the plane is that it is equipped with a notion of distance, i.e. a metric in the mathematical sense (see Reisel’s work here).  The set of vertices are chosen so as to be well distributed through a square in the plane, so that every point in the square is close to one of the vertices.  In addition, the connections in the graph can be inferred from the distance. This is so because if we let r denote the distance from a vertex to its nearest neighbor (this is independent of what vertex we choose because of the regularity of the layout), then two vertices are connected if their distance is < √2r.  
So, the graph is determined by:
(a) a choice of subset of the plane and
(b) a notion of distance in the plane
The value of this observation is that we often have sets of attributes or features that are equipped with metrics. Some interesting examples were studied in this paper, where a study of the statistical behavior of patches in natural images was performed. One of the findings was that there is an important feature that measures the “angular preference” of a patch in the direction of a particular angle θ.  As we vary θ, we get a set of features which is geometrically laid out on a circle, which can be discretized and turned into the graph on the left below. A more detailed analysis showed a two-parameter set of features that are laid out in the form of a geometric object called a Klein bottle, shown with associated graph structure on the right below.

Analogous geometries can be found for 3D imaging and video imaging. The work in the Exposition paper has suggested larger spaces containing the Klein bottle which will apply to larger scale features and more abstract objects.
Purely data driven graph constructions
The constructions in the previous section rely on a prior knowledge concerning the features or a detailed data analytic study of particular sensing technologies. To have a method that is more generally applicable, without complicated data analysis, it is necessary to have methods that can quickly produce a useful graph structure on the set of features. Such a method exists, and is described in both the TDA paper as well as the Topology paper.  
Suppose that we have a data matrix, where the rows are the samples or observations, and the columns are features or attributes. Then the columns are vectors, and there are various notions of distance one might equip them with, including high-dimensional Euclidean distance (perhaps applied to mean centered and normalized columns), correlation, angle, or Hamming distance if the values are Boolean. There are typically many options. By choosing a distance threshold, we can build a graph whose nodes are the individual features. If the threshold is small, the graph will be sparser than if we choose a larger threshold. So, at this point we have a method for constructing a graph from sensory data. Further, the graph describes a similarity relation between the features, in the sense that if two features are connected by an edge, we know that their distance (regarded as a dissimilarity measure) is less than some fixed threshold, and therefore that they are similar to each other.
This construction certainly makes sense and generalizes the construction that is done for images. However, it produces graphs which are large in the sense that they have the same number of nodes as we have features.  They may also be dense in the sense that some nodes may have a very large number of connections, which is not ideal from the point of view of computation. We will address this problem via a form of compression of the graph structure.
To understand this construction, we will discuss another aspect of the deep learning pipeline for images, namely the pooling layers. We describe it as follows.
The “pooling” refers to pooling values of subsets of pixels, specifically smaller squares. The picture below describes the situation, where we have covered the pixel grid by nine smaller subgrids, each one two by two.

The idea of pooling is to create a new graph, this time three by three, with one node for each of the subgrids. The interesting point is that the creation of the new graph can be described in terms of the intersections of the subgrids only. Specifically, the nodes corresponding to two subgrids are connected by an edge if and only if the subgrids have at least one pixel in common.  The value of this observation is that this criterion generalizes to the general situation of a geometry on the space of features, provided that we can produce a covering analogous to the covering of this square by subgrids. We refer to the collection of subgrids as a covering of the set of pixels, where by a covering of a set X we mean a family of subsets U of X so that every element of X is contained in some member of the U covering.
Topological data analysis provides a systematic way of producing such coverings, using a method referred to as Mapper, which is described in the TDA and Topology papers.  
The output of this construction will be a family of graphs , ⌈1…,⌈r with the following properties.

Each vertex in each graph corresponds to a family of features.
The collections corresponding to vertices are small or localized in the assigned metric on the set of features.
Each graph is low-dimensional in the sense that the number of vertices that lie in a clique is bounded above.
The size of the sets of features corresponding to vertices grow as we move from ⌈1 to ⌈r. In other words, the graphs become coarser and coarser representations of the set of features.

The construction yields a systematic way of producing graph representations of the sensory data available from the data matrix.  It turns out that one can go directly from this representation to neural network architectures.
In fact, one could even imagine incrementally producing coverings using Mapper on the activation-values of the layers following the input layer. Occasionally recomputing the coverings and therefore the graph structure would allow the network to adapt its graph structure during training.
Constructing neural networks
The circular constructions given above can give some very simple geometric constructions of neural network architectures adapted to them.  For example, in the case of the circular networks described above, a picture of such a construction would look as follows.

Similar constructions are available for the Klein bottle geometries and others.
The construction of neural networks from the purely data driven constructions above is also quite simple.  Since each node of each graph corresponds to a set of features from the data matrix, we can declare that a node ν in ⌈r  is connected by a directed edge to a node w in ⌈r+1 if and only if the collection corresponding to ν and the collection corresponding to w contain at least one feature in common. This will describe a connection pattern for a simple feed-forward network with the nodes of ⌈r as the set of neurons in the r-th layer. A picture of a simple version of this construction is given below.

Summary
We have given an approach to assigning graph theoretic information to sensory or continuous data.  It depends on the assignment of geometric information in the form of a distance function on the set of features of a data set.  There are many constructions based on the mathematical discipline of topology (the study of shape) that should be useful for this task.  The methodology should yield the following:

Improvement of the transparency of the algorithms, since the sets of neurons are now organized in understandable geometric patterns.  In particular, coloring the geometric structures by activation values of neurons will make clearer the functioning of the network.
Improvement  in the explainability of the outputs, based also on the coloring of the topological models of the feature sets.  What such colorings often yield is a simplified understanding of the behavior of data based on groups of features rather than individual features, as is shown in the Ayasdi blog “Machine Intelligence for Statistical Inference and Human Interpreta….”
Because the topological model constructions have nodes that deal with groups of features, it is to be expected that using such models will help reduce the overfitting often occurring in such models.  Preliminary experiments suggest that this does in fact occur.
Structures that lend themselves to topological data analysis may be classified and their topological properties might have interesting and useful interpretations. For example, it has been shown that the spatial filters of CNN’s arrange themselves in simple circles and that these are indicative of a network’s ability to generalize to unseen data. In addition, the persistent homology of the activation maps of CNN’s can be used to detect adversarial examples.

Betterhalf.AI is looking to change the way traditional matchmaking sites offer matches in India by taking into account six relationship dimensions including emotional, intellectual, relationship, moral values. It will use these and more to offer matches driven by machine learning (ML) algorithm. Yeah, this means you will not have to sift through hundreds of matches to find relevant ones. Betterhalf.AI, launched by Pawan Gupta and Rahul Namdev in 2016, has created a grid of verified working professionals at companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, Adobe and Accenture and applied a six-level verification system adding Facebook profiles, personal email, phone number, work email and government ID. “Our mission is to build world’s largest partner prediction engine. We live in a tech world today where we have prediction for self-driving cars — on Waymo/ Tesla, recommendations for e-commerce products — on Amazon, music — on Pandora/ Spotify and even friends — on Facebook. But we don’t have one for partners. Isn’t that surprising? We think building one is possible,” said CEO Gupta in an email interaction with indianexpress.com. ALSO READ: Google Home Mini review: Big things come in small packages The idea was conceived by the duo in 2015 while they were searching for their life partners on different matrimonial and dating sites. “Our friends were in the same boat and so we all had one issues or the other. We kept observing their partner search journeys for a year. Everyone around us complained.and at some point, we were not okay with this,” he said. Pawan, who is CEO of the company, claims the platform currently is used by more than a thousand users on a daily basis and is growing at 100 per cent week on week, with majority from the age group of 25-35 years. “Currently, we have done more than 300 matches on the platform and that is expected to cross 1000 in the next few weeks,” he added. Betterhalf’s AI engine uses the technology at five different stage - during registration, pre-chat stage, product gamification, post-chat stage and removal of any biased data using ML. Users can sign-up for the service by giving answers to 16 personality questions, which are used to find suitable matches. “We use the user’s basic partner preferences (Age range, height, caste, religion, location, education, salary etc.) to filter and rank those matches. This is how users receive matches and as they interact with more number of users, their matches improve over time, thereby leading them to find a compatible partner sooner with whom they are likely to be happier,” Pawan explained. The machine learning algorithm also improves with time and as users spend more time on Betterhalf.AI. “For example, if a user has visited 10 matches and five have mentioned that they like to travel, now if the user spends more time with these profiles then the system learns that this particular user is interested in matches who actually like travelling,” he pointed out. Betterhalf.AI also has a private ratings and feedback option that the company says helps it to “filter out the non-serious and creepy daters off the platform.” Currently available for desktop, the 10-member team of Betterhalf.AI is working on mobile app for Android and iOS, expected to become available in May 2018. “At Betterhalf, we take data security and privacy of user data very seriously. Firstly, we have stated clearly in our privacy policy that Betterhalf does not share, rent or sell any of personal or sensitive information with any third-party,” insisted Pawan. Once the matches are done, the company plans to tap their post marriage relationship happiness to offer users an even better AI-based partner prediction service.",2024,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/04/betterhalf_matches-page-with-focus-on-compatability-759.jpg', 'caption': '', 'description': 'Betterhalf, Betterhalf.

As time passed, they started opting for computer training. This summer, there are new trends. As you enter a training centre here, a robot welcomes you with folded hands, saying ‘Welcome to Smart Robotics’. And when you come to know they were made by Class IX students Ebel M Roy and Adhil S, you just realise how much the children as well as parents are hooked to the new technology in the state.Robotics, artificial intelligence and internet of things (IoT) are in demand now..The camps provide awareness and hands-on training also in machine learning and mobile app development.The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) research officer Narayanan Kutty said the trend shows how children and parents are adapting to the changing education and job market..“The scope for conventional jobs is dwindling rapidly. At the same time, opportunities in future technology are growing. The parents, who have identified this change, are sending their kids to the summer classes dealing with robotics, artificial intelligence and IoT,” said Kutty..At the camps, the organisers teach electronics, mechanics and basic robotics. In addition, they impart training in the functioning of wired and wireless robots, 3D printing and unmanned aeriel vehicles. The projects are done by using Arduino, an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software and Raspberry Pi, a tiny and affordable computer that can be used to learn programming through fun, practical projects..Children are very much interested in robotics and coding of apps, according to Sajeesh Krishna, chief robotics engineer at Smart Robotics summer camp.“One advantage of the classes is it deviates the children from negative trends to the positive use of technology,” said Krishna. Students from Class V to engineering are attending the camps..While private institutions and a group of engineers are conducting these camps, co-operative players like UL Education are also joining hands with Kerala Startup Mission, UL Cyberpark, Tinker Hub and Fox Maker Labs to arrange summer camps.UL Education Director T P Sethumadhavan said career trends are fast changing..“Advanced IT and automation are acquiring momentum across the globe. It has been forecast by 2022, nine per cent of the jobs will be unknown to us. Internet will create lots of opportunities in the services sector. Digitalisation, e-commerce and advanced IT facilitate spectacular job opportunities. Innovation and technologies propel startups, which in turn will provide sustainable employment opportunities. Forty crore people in India are using internet. Smartphone users crossed 25 crore in the country. Mobile apps started replacing web portals,” he said..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest",,,,
