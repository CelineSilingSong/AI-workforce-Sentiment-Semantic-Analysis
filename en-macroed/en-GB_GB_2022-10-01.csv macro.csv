Washington’s new ‘blueprint’ for government action highlights the growing gap with Brussels over the best way to regulate the emerging technology

The US government published a detailed plan for policing misuses of artificial intelligence sector by sector, rather than across all applications of the technology at once. The approach highlights a growing disagreement with the EU over AI regulation.
In what it called a “Blueprint for an ‘AI Bill of Rights’”, the White House on 4 October laid out in more detail than before how it proposes to protect people from misuse, fraud or errors as AI systems roll out across the economy. Rather than ban any particular AI technology such as facial recognition across the country, each government agency will work to prevent abuses of any AI technology in its own domain – whether housing, healthcare, transport, education, procurement or other fields.
In a background briefing with journalists the day before the report’s release, senior administration officials called it a “whole of government” policy involving 30 or more agencies, because each agency is best-placed to watch for and deal with possible abuses of the technology in its own area. 
“There is no one centralised bureau to deal with this,” said one official. “Instead, we’re identifying harm in each of those sectors, and having the agency responsible […] leading the enforcement action.”
The announcement comes amid growing international concern about abuses of AI – with some stark differences of opinion emerging between the US and EU, in particular, on how to deal with them.  In AI legislation now under debate in Brussels, the European Commission is looking to regulate not just abuses in particular sectors but has also zeroed in on particular AI technologies that it thinks problematic across all sectors – most notably, facial recognition.

Artificial intelligence in the workplace


When AI systems are used, there is an obligation to consider how they might affect fairness, accountability and transparency in the workplace

Far from being a futuristic concept relegated to the realms of science fiction, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is becoming more common. The benefits of using AI are often cited by reference to time and productivity savings. However, the challenges of implementing AI into HR practice and procedures should not be underestimated.







AI technologies are already being used across a broad range of industries, at every stage in the employment cycle. From recruitment to dismissal, their use has significant implications. In recent months, incidents at Meta, Estee Lauder and payment service company Xsolla have hit the headlines for utilising AI when dismissing employees.  
All three companies used algorithms as part of their selection process. For Meta and Xsolla, the algorithms used analysed employee performance against key metrics to identify those who were “unengaged and unproductive”. These employees were subsequently dismissed.
Similarly, Estee Lauder used an algorithm when making three makeup artists redundant, which assessed employees during a video interview. The software measured the content of the women’s answers and expressions during interview and evaluated the results against other data about their job performance. It led to their dismissal. 
Where algorithms are used in place of human decision-making, they risk replicating and reflecting existing biases and inequalities in society. 
An AI system is created by a variety of participants, from those writing the code, inputting the instructions, those supplying the dataset on which the AI system is trained and those managing the process. There is significant scope for bias to be introduced at each stage. 
If, for example, a bias towards recruiting men is included in the dataset, or women are under-represented, this is likely to be replicated in the AI decision. The result is an AI system making decisions that reproduces inherent bias. If unaddressed, those biases can become exaggerated as the AI “learns” becoming more adept at differentiating using those biases.
To mitigate this risk, HR teams should test the technology with comparison between AI and human decisions looking for bias. This is only going to be effective in combating unconscious bias if the reviewers comprise a diverse group  themselves. If bias is discovered, the algorithm can and should be changed.
AI systems are increasingly being viewed by employers as an efficient way of measuring staff performance. While AI may identify top performers based on key business metrics, they lack personal experience, emotional intelligence and the ability to form an opinion to shape decisions. There is a danger that “low-performing” staff could be disregarded solely on an assessment of metrics. Smart employees are likely to find ways to manipulate AI to their advantage in a way that might not be so easy without technology.
It is tempting to trust AI to limit legal risks by using it for decision-making. Superficially, this may be right, but the potential unintended consequences of any AI system could easily create a lack of transparency and bias equivalent to that of its human creators. 
When AI systems are used, there is an obligation to consider how these might impact on fairness, accountability and transparency in the workplace. There is also a risk of employers exposing themselves to costly discrimination claims, particularly where the policy of using AI disadvantages an employee because of a protected characteristic (such as sex or race) and discriminatory decisions are made as a result.
Until AI develops to outperform humans in learning from mistakes or understanding the law, its use is unlikely to materially mitigate risk in the meantime.

“We can view happiness in at least three ways—as a hedonic state, as a cognitive state, or as a general life philosophy. Happiness, then, can refer to a way of thinking, such as being optimistic; a way of feeling joy, pleasure, relief, or gratitude; or simply a way of being.”— Dr. Nancy Etcoff, Professor of Psychology, Harvard Medical School

Last week, a paper I co-authored with the scientists from Deep Longevity, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Stanford, went viral and was covered in Fortune, Fox News, The Hill, New York Post, The Guardian and many other top-tier international media. In this study, the team used AI to analyze the psychological and biological changes during aging. This was the fourth peer-reviewed paper that tried to use AI to understand the changes in human psychology that transpire during aging but the first one to link biology with psychology. One day I will tell the personal story why a group of hardcore scientists studying biology and chemistry using AI decided to venture into psychology but these studies convinced me that human psychological aging is much more important than most scientists in biological sciences tend to believe. I firmly believe that the psychological age defines us much more than the biological age even though these ages, as this recent study showed, are closely connected. And as Laura Carstensen showed in her pioneering work on the Socio-Emotional Selectivity Theory (SST), psychological aging is plastic - we have the toolkit to modify it. And the recent study on aging and happiness demonstrated that it may be possible to get psychologically younger and happier at the same time. The results were so convincing that I started using some of these tools myself. Let’s take a deeper dive into how research in the psychology of aging and AI tools can help us adjust our psychological age and improve our well-being.

Longevity Mindfulness: How Can Artificial Intelligence Help You Better Understand Yourself?

Age is much more than the number of times you saw Earth’s orbit around the sun. As the body grows old, our minds are often instigated by mental decline and progressive, natural psychological aging. People’s bodies age at different rates, and both mindset and environment shape and defy their aging dynamics. Importantly, our psychological state influences our perception of time and health status. Also known as subjective age, an individual's psychological age is based on how young or old one perceives themselves to be in comparison to their chronological age, depending on an individual’s self-assessment of the degree of aging, and how this perception influences their well-being in general.

Years of research on well-being and longevity have shown that psychological well-being is tightly linked to physical health, mood variations, and supportive social networks. As we grow older, our mental state starts stabilizing, with negative emotions being more easily managed, and our social networks becoming smaller, as we search for deeper connections with a small group of friends. In parallel, our sense of psychological well-being and life satisfaction becomes greater, given an accumulated lifetime of experiences dealing with adversity and daily hassles.

One theory that fairly explains this changing time perspective was proposed by Stanford’s Dr. Carstensen, the socio-emotional selectivity theory, whereby motivation and goal pursuit by younger people, that have a lifetime ahead of themselves, is related to the acquisition of knowledge (for example, taking a university degree). In contrast, in older adults, when time is perceived as limited, emotional-based goals take priority.

Most typically addressed as the answer to “How old do you feel?”, we constantly find ourselves at internal crossroads striving to better understand ourselves and our inner states and to manage our and others’ expectations in terms of natural, “healthy” aging. But… can we anticipate how long we’ll live? Can we develop a longevity-oriented mindset rather than a failure one and prepare for a longer, more enjoyable, and more productive lifespan? Are there any tools to help us figure out better prospects and sharpen our perception of life?
While much progress has been made during the last decades regarding the identification of markers used to assess biological aging, including those based on biochemical, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and microbiome-related signatures, these do not accurately translate one’s state of psychological aging. Although the discovery of such markers has given great promise regarding the development of therapeutic intervention strategies, knowledge about the factors that modulate one’s subjective age is still missing as well as potential therapeutic avenues. As subjective age, itself can be influenced by various parameters, including personal experiences, social relationships, and cultural values, identifying biomarkers and designing tools that can measure changes in one’s psychological age is much needed.
Over the last couple of decades, the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, namely in machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques, has allowed the identification of meaningful patterns in human behavior and psyche. Its crossover with the fields of psychology and longevity granted the opportunity to envision neural networks capable of creating digital models of aging — aging clocks — that can capture the influence of multiple aging processes (e.g., DNA methylation) and possible outcomes (e.g., mortality risk) to predict human chronological age.
Exciting research on AI-based engines sheds light on novel tools that can estimate one’s psychological age and future well-being based on a constructed psychological survey. Basically, these AI tools can be used to determine ways of improving and maximizing well-being long-term based on inferred information from available datasets. Using data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset, two models have been previously designed, PsychoAge and SubjAge, to project chronological and subjective age, respectively, in a robust, validated and predictive manner across different age groups and taking into consideration 50 psychosocial features. Both clocks contained actionable features that could be modified using social and behavioral interventions and, importantly, that may prove to be useful in shifting personal perception of aging towards a mindset that promotes productive and healthy behaviors.
More recently, using the same dataset, the Deep Longevity team proposed a new model that works as a recommendation engine that advises a person seeking self-improvement based on its neuropsychological characteristics. In technical terms, it is an unsupervised learning algorithm that integrates the information from a respondent, places it on a 2D map of all possible psychological profiles (i.e., psychotypes), and then derives suitable ways to improve current and future psychological well-being based on self-organizing maps (SOMs). Although we have previously released Young.AI App, an AI platform to keep track of the aging process, Deep Longevity has now elevated its findings and released a web service FuturSelf, a free online application that provides a report with insights aimed at improving users’ long-term mental well-being based on their responses to the psychological test described in the original publication. Participants can actually enroll in a program that provides guidance based on AI-chosen recommendations, which I find really exhilarating. This novel tool shows great promise because it provides unparalleled personalization supported by scientifically sound data while offering an exciting perspective on psychological aging, long-term well-being, and risk of age-related disorders. It further demonstrates the application of machine learning approaches to the issues of psychological health. Right now, the team is working on a follow-up study on the effects of happiness on physiological measures of aging.Tired of Life, after 1892.

""Older"" Psychological Age May Signal Problems
As life expectancy in developed countries has been steadily increasing during the last century, several studies have also suggested that a lower (or younger) subjective age is associated with better mental and physical health, cognitive and emotional processing, and overall increased well-being and life satisfaction. In other words, feeling mentally younger than one’s chronological age is considered a protective factor to buffer against the negative impact of aging and all its associated perks. Perceiving oneself as subjectively younger than one’s chronological age may influence several age-related biological changes. Conversely, a higher (or older) subjective age is significantly associated with increased frailty and decline in healthy behaviors, mental health, and survival rate. Interestingly, people with an older subjective age have been shown to have higher levels of systemic inflammation, higher risk of obesity, pulmonary and muscular dysfunctions as well as increased incidence of certain diseases. Biological correlates of this phenomenon have also shown that subjective aging is associated with health-related problems. Indeed, previous studies have found an association between older subjective age and higher levels of albumin, systemic inflammation and obesity. In line with this, perceived older age has been associated with certain diseases such as diabetes and, more importantly, psychiatric disorders. This links well with the fact that people with mental disorders have been found to be at greater risk of aging faster and developing age-related diseases, showing that mental state and perception may accelerate aging effects. Stress is a well-known triggering factor for mood swings and a key modulator of the pace of aging. Accordingly, chronic stress is a key source of psychiatric manifestations, namely depression, and unhappiness and may as well greatly impact the way one perceives aging effects.
The rise in life expectancy has led to substantial variability in one’s assessment of psychological age, with individuals perceiving themselves and others as substantially younger or older than their actual chronological age. This shift in the perception of subjective age has profound effects on behavior and well-being, and is linked to an individual’s mindset and lifespan progression. Subjective age is by itself a significant predictor of many psychological factors among older adults. Indeed, as I previously stated, research shows that individuals with younger subjective age display a tendency to have better mental health. Thus, tools that measure, analyze, and predict psychological aging as well as methodological approaches that modulate longevity expectations and psychological aging states are important to improve perceived health status and general well-being.A woman moves to comfort a co-worker who is slumped over her desk in despair, circa 1940.

Can Psychological Age Reversal Make You Unhappy?
One important aspect about predictive digital tools (the aging clocks abovementioned) is that they can be ""reversed"" using social and behavioral interventions. But, although I have previously given 10 tips to reverse your psychological age (from forming meaningful social connections to learning a new foreign language), this may not be ideal in every scenario. While there is a consensus among longevity researchers that preventing some biological features from entering senescence may revert some aspects of physiological aging, things are much different on the realm of psychological aging. As we age at different rhythms, both physically and mentally, it may be difficult to find the correct way to rejuvenate your psychological age. Moreover, since we get “happier” as we grow old, to better cope with the prospect of imminent decline and death, employing strategies to reverse or rejuvenate your psychological age in an uncontrollable fashion may actually lead to reduced well-being. In fact, new experiments are now being designed to employ different strategies to rejuvenate older adults and change their mindset and perceptions using counterclockwise psychological interventions.
Feeling a ‘young spirit’ in an older body may not be that great. In my opinion, a tight balance between your chronological and biological age with your psychological age needs to happen. On one hand, there is a demand for tools that determine an individual’s exact biological age — which are already available in the market — and, on the other hand, mechanisms in place to infer one’s psychological age and match it accordingly. Installing AI-based models and tools capable of finetuning that balance is crucial to improve the future of mental health.
Indeed, recent AI technology has given a glimpse of this possibility. It has provided a means to find the optimal path to emotional stability. As mentioned before, this new deep learning model can predict one’s current psychological age and guide future well-being, providing personalized recommendations for optimizing one’s mental resilience. The SOM built within the model offers a set of non-trivial, personalized paths towards improved well-being that can be utilized as a reference for purposes of cognitive behavioral therapy and online mental health approaches. Perhaps, this tool can be used as a complement or even as a standalone approach to adjust one’s psychological age and provide emotional improvement and mental steadiness. Not only is it transversal to different areas of research, including psychology, psychiatry, longevity, and gerontology, but it may also be used in several applications in both medical and biotechnology industries.A group of happy people generated using Midjourney AIAlex Zhavoronkov, PhD, Midjourney AI
Recovering Psychological Youthfulness After the COVID-19 Pandemic
Several recent reports show that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mental health situation worldwide. Growing psychological distress, boredom, and feelings of isolation and loneliness have led to a decrease on individual well-being that is hampering society’s productivity and ability to endure these challenging times. Most likely, during COVID-19 outbreak's initial stages, people became less optimistic and psychologically older. While in the US life expectancy in 2021 dropped by 1.6 years due to COVID-19, suggesting its toll on both physical and psychological health, China’s zero-COVID policies have substantially averted surges in mortality, surpassing the life expectancy rates in the US, despite Chinese data for 2021 not being yet available. Overall, many people became less optimistic due to constant lockdowns and the inability to travel and meet new people. The lack of freedom and closedness most likely worsened subjective aging in several groups of people, especially those more susceptible to the effects of environmental factors or with a greater socio-emotional burden. Surprisingly, indicators of relative biological and psychological aging of certain individuals were found to affect the frequency and severity of the disease, with the combination of high indicators of biological age and underestimated psychological age dangerously increasing the likelihood of developing severe forms of the disease.
But, as I’ve addressed before, older adults may be more resilient to the influence of stress and aging, thus, less likely to suffer from psychological aging effects. In line with this, studies suggest that older age may indeed buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health, although the long-term consequences may vary across countries and cultures. Findings highlight the link between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms, yet to be uncovered, to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why it is important continuous research into psychological aging, measures of happiness and the development of new tools that may help reverse psychological aging and improve well-being.
Hence, it is for current research on AI, psychological aging and longevity to harness the potential of machine learning and digital tools for a safe and modern future that relies on models and approaches such as the ones previously mentioned to improve psychological health and well-being on a self-guided level or in a therapeutical/interventional context. The emergence of tools that can precisely estimate psychological aging, predict disorder trajectory, identify changes in an individual’s behavior, and provide data that informs personalized medical care is ever more promising and will revolutionize the future of human performance and digital health.

Artificial intelligence finds faster algorithms for multiplying matrices


                    An artificial-intelligence approach known as AlphaTensor found exact matrix-multiplication algorithms that are more efficient than those previously known for many matrix sizes. The technique advances understanding of this fundamental operation and opens up the potential to accelerate ubiquitous computations that involve matrix multiplications.

<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold the promise of streamlining employment and hiring processes across all industries. </p>
<p>Historically, the courts and regulatory enforcement agencies have analyzed these tools under local, state, and federal anti-discrimination laws and treated them the same as other employment selection procedures used in hiring. However, in December 2021, the New York City Council enacted <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&amp;GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search"" target=""_blank"">Local Law 144</a> (the AI Law), which prohibits employers from using automated employment selection tools unless specific bias audit and notice requirements are met. </p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2023, it will be unlawful for an employer or employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) to screen a candidate or employee unless: (1) the tool has undergone a bias audit no more than one year prior to its use, (2) a summary of the most recent bias audit is made publicly available, and (3) notice of use of the AEDT and an opportunity to request an alternative selection process is provided to each employee or candidate who resides in New York City. In doing so, New York City joined <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2557&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101"" target=""_blank"">Illinois</a>, <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://legiscan.com/MD/text/HB1202/2020"" target=""_blank"">Maryland</a>, and several other jurisdictions in efforts to regulate AI in the workplace to decrease hiring and promotion bias. </p>
<p>Now, New York City has finally issued proposed rules providing more guidance on the AI Law before it takes effect.</p>
<h3>PROPOSED RULES</h3>
<p>On September 23, 2022, the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) published <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DCWP-NOH-AEDTs-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">proposed rules</a> related to the implementation of the AI Law (the Proposed Rules). The Proposed Rules provide additional clarity on the AI Law&rsquo;s requirements and answer some key employer questions.</p>
<p>For instance, the Proposed Rules seem to clarify that an employer <strong>can</strong> use a bias audit commissioned by a vendor and based on historic vendor data to meet the AI Law&rsquo;s requirements. Employers are apparently not obligated to commission their own independent review of a tool&rsquo;s impact on their particular applicant pool. However, the Proposed Rules do not account for a scenario where the vendor is also the developer, which is the case with many AEDT companies.</p>
<p>The Proposed Rules also define the term &ldquo;independent auditor&rdquo; to mean any &ldquo;person or group that is not involved in using or developing an AEDT.&rdquo; This broad definition seems to allow employers to partner with a range of entities to conduct an audit, including those it may use for other evaluations or services.  </p>
<p>Additionally, the Proposed Rules do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clarify that the AI Law applies only when AEDT simplified output (such as a score, tag, classification, or ranking) is (1) the sole criteria relied upon, without considering other factors, (2) given more weight than any other criteria, or (3) used to overrule or modify conclusions derived from other factors, such as human decisionmaking. </li>
    <li>Set forth minimum required elements for a bias audit, including (1) calculation of the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and a sex category; and (2) comparison of such &ldquo;selection rates&rdquo; to the most selected category to determine an &ldquo;impact ratio&rdquo; using a defined formula.</li>
    <li>Confirm that the prospective notice requirement to candidates and employees residing in New York City regarding the use of AEDTs can be met by clear and conspicuous writing on the employer website, job posting, or via US mail or email at least 10 business days prior to the use of the AEDT. </li>
    <li>Confirm that employers can meet the requirement to publish the distribution date of the AEDT, the date of the most recent bias audit and a summary of the results if they include a clear and conspicuous link to a website containing this information on the careers or job sections of their website. Employers must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for at least six months after last using the audit tool.</li>
    <li>Define the following key terms that were not defined in the statute:
    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;Screen&rdquo; means &ldquo;to make a determination about whether someone should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion process.&rdquo; </li>
        <li>&ldquo;Selection rate&rdquo; means &ldquo;the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Impact ratio&rdquo; means &ldquo;either (i) the selection rate for a category divided by the &ldquo;selection rate of the most selected category or (ii) the average score of all individuals in a category divided by the average score of individuals in the highest scoring category.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Proposed Rules do not address other vital compliance issues, such as the precise requirements of an alternative selection process or accommodation that must be offered to employees who opt-out of an AEDT. The Proposed Rules only state that the notice must include instructions on how to seek the alternative process or an accommodation. </p>
<p>The Proposed Rules also do not clarify whether the AI Law requires that employers update bias audits annually or if one audit conducted prior to the initial use of the tool is sufficient, provided the tool does not change. Employers will hope for further guidance from the city on these issues prior to the effective date of the AI Law. </p>
<h3>PUBLIC HEARING</h3>
<p>The DCWP will hold a public hearing on the Proposed Rules on October 24 at 11:00 am. Prior to the hearing, any individual or group may submit comments on the Proposed Rules. Written comments can be submitted in advance by email to <a href=""mailto:Rulecomments@dcwp.nyc.gov"">Rulecomments@dcwp.nyc.gov</a>&nbsp;or <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/rule/automated-employment-decision-tools-2/"" target=""_blank"">online</a>, where there is also a link to join the public hearing by videoconference or phone. Comments can also be raised at the public hearing, but those wishing to speak at the hearing will be allotted three minutes of speaking time and must sign up in advance by calling (212) 436-0396. </p>
<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
<p>Now that New York City has issued these Proposed Rules, employers should consider taking various steps to evaluate their use of AI employment tools, including the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Review existing use of AEDTs in their hiring and promotion practices to determine whether they are covered by the AI Law.</li>
    <li>Review data retention policies applicable to data collected through the use of AEDTs. </li>
    <li>Train supervisors and managers, as well as compliance, human resources, and legal professionals on the implications of the new law, including notice requirements and proper responses to employee communications. </li>
    <li>Communicate with any vendors who operate AEDTs for the business to confirm they are in compliance with the AI Law.</li>
    <li>Determine how the company will meet the independent audit and notice requirements of the AI Law and any final rules.</li>
    <li>Continue to monitor for any changes to the Proposed Rules after the October 24 hearing date and DCWP responses to public comments.</li>

The creative thief: AI tools creating generated art


AI systems such as OpenAI's Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are used to create striking images. But it can be unclear if the images are inspired by others or stolen.

Listen to this article

AI-generated art is painting a new path for both experienced artists and consumers. But critics say AI art systems are stealing real people's intellectual property.







Large AI models like GPT and art-generating tools such as Midjourney and OpenAI's Dall-E have enabled art amateurs to easily create striking, original-looking images, sparking a highly charged conversation about the nature of art itself and whether AI will eradicate artists' and illustrators' jobs.
Acclaimed supernatural fiction author Stephen King even joined the debate when he posted an image of ""Pennywise on a bike"" on his Twitter page, noting that it was ""done by an AI bot.""
The image of King's novelistic shape-shifting monster created by an AI system -- it's unclear which system created King's image -- looks like a masterpiece, but for one small detail. At the bottom-right corner is a signature, signaling that at least part of the artwork the AI system generated came from the million pieces of artwork that are online.
The uproar over the issue has become so intense that some photography agencies have begun scrubbing their work from the internet. Moreover, a new website, Have I Been Trained?, enables artists and consumers to check if their images are in the LAION-5B training data set -- a library of images used to train Stable Diffusion and Google Imagen, another AI-powered text-to-image system.
Also, the speed and scope of the AI text-to-image technology could lead to concerns about AI-generated art spilling over into the video editing field.
Meta, Facebook's parent company, on Sept. 29 announced its Make-A-Video text-to-video tool, which enables users to create a video by typing what they want to see.

Large AI text-to-image models might be misappropriating some real artworks.






AI fires the artist
One artist caught up in the debate about AI-generated art tools and systems is Grzegorz Rutkowski, a gaming illustrator from Poland. He has been an illustrator for games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Sony's Horizon Forbidden West.
Fans of Rutkowski told him that his pieces were being used to create new images generated by Stable Diffusion. In fact, his name has been used about 93,000 times, according to Lexica, a website that tracks images generated by Stable Diffusion from user prompts.



It was a future threat for my online portfolio.


Grzegorz RutkowskiGaming illustrator




""I realized that after a while, I can have trouble looking for my images on Google because it will be flooded with AI,"" Rutkowski said. ""It was a future threat for my online portfolio.""
AI systems like these could remove the need for mentorship between experienced artists and younger artists, Rutkowski said. Younger artists might decide to use the systems instead of gaining tutelage from those who are more experienced.
Also, the system can prompt organizations to do away with hiring junior artists and illustrators to create visuals that stimulate moods, such as landscape images, he added.
""Right now, we can see that at least part of the industry will be losing their jobs,"" Rutkowski said.


The role of the artist
While AI-generated art tools might cause the role of the artist to change, it's not going to erase the artist and their art, argued Cansu Canca, founder and director of the AI Ethics Lab.
""It could even become more valuable,"" Canca said. ""You could imagine human art being this artifact that is hard to find and even highly priced, whereas computer-generated art would be not so highly valued.""
The controversy over AI systems stealing work from others to create an artwork raises questions about plagiarism. But the changing forms of art from generation to generation and the custom of young artists using the works of older artists as inspiration blur the lines of traditional ideas about art, said Ricardo Baeza-Yates, director of research at the Institute for Experiential AI at Northeastern University.
""Let's say you use pieces of 1,000 images to create a new image. Is 1,000 pieces of other images plagiarism? I'm not sure,"" Baeza-Yates said. ""If you say 10, I would say yes. If you say 1,000, I don't know.""
Moreover, AI-generated art could help artists create their artwork faster, saving them time by relying on the engineers who created Dall-E and other AI art systems who took years to create their systems, Baeza-Yates continued.


'Theatre D'Opera Spatial'
Faster doesn't necessarily mean the artwork didn't require time to generate creativity.
Jason M. Allen, an artist and president of Incarnate Games whose Theatre D'Opera Spatial won first place at the Colorado State Fair on Aug. 29, said he spent 80 hours working on his piece.
The artwork was generated by Midjourney and submitted under the digital arts and digitally manipulated photography category.
Allen started using Midjourney earlier this year after being invited to participate in the beta-testing group. He said he was drawn to the program because the artwork he was seeing online felt like something that had never been created before.
""It's avant-garde,"" he said. ""It's a new art movement.""
He didn't start his award-winning project until he learned how to use the software to generate the images he wanted to see, he said.
""You have to learn how to manipulate the software because you might not get the results that you want to see,"" Allen said. ""You constantly have to try different phrases and words and creative inputs that give you the results that you're looking for. And that's a skill.""
The backlash over his winning artwork was unexpected, but understandable, Allen said.
""It comes from a place of denial,"" he said. Up until now, many were convinced that AI could never be as good as humans when creating art pieces, and now they've been proven wrong, he said.
""It would be better if they [didn't] deny the power available to them,"" Allen added.


Enterprises and AI-generated art
Meanwhile, enterprises in addition to artists and consumers are using AI technology that creates art.
Omneky is an AI marketing vendor that uses its own machine learning algorithms, GPT-3 and Dall-E to generate ads for its customers. The vendor also offers personalized prompts for image generation.
""AI is creating a freeing and flexible design process that inspires creativity and ultimately boosts performance,"" said Hikari Senju, founder and CEO of Omneky. AI is helping creators boost creativity and productivity, he added.
Virtuous AI, an AI ethics company that helps developers create explainable and unbiased AI systems, uses Omneky to generate ads and as a marketing tool.
While aware of the controversy of AI-generated art, Virtuous AI CEO Rory Donovan said certain applications of the tools can be useful.
""If you're, for example, displacing a person by creating the same content in the same style as them, that's definitely, in my opinion, immoral,"" Donovan said. ""But I don't think that is really the case in these sorts of applications. We're not trying to generate Picasso paintings or anything like that. It's more of, you know, ad content.""


Fighting back
However, for Rutkowski, the problem is the consequences of using AI-generated art tools and the vendors behind them.
""AI is affecting lots of fields -- science, technology, healthcare -- it's unstoppable and inevitable,"" he said. ""We will learn to adapt to this world, but right now, as much as we can, we should treat artists and different people with respect.""
For this reason, Rutkowski and other artists are pushing for regulation to protect the type of data that AI-generated art tools can access.
Artists like Rutkowski, who can show a strong similarity between their artwork and ones generated by AI systems, have a strong claim for copyright infringement, according to Michael Bennett, director of education curriculum and business lead for responsible AI at the Institute for Experiential AI.
""It would depend on how similar that generative art is,"" said Bennett, who has more than 15 years of experience as an intellectual property lawyer.
However, if the AI system created a piece of work that does not show a strong similarity, ""there's not anything that living human artists can do,"" he continued.
Using existing images to inspire and help artists create art with AI tools is analogous to a young artist gaining inspiration from older works, so there isn't much harm, Bennett said.
As for the creators of the AI tools and systems, many artists including Rutkowski think they have a responsibility to other artists. In practice, this could mean removing the artwork of living artists from AI training data sets and banning it from being used, in the same way that some systems ban nude photos or images of celebrities or well-known individuals.
However, generative AI art is already proliferating quickly and spurring more creativity, with popular tools like Dall-E offering free introductory credits and affordable fees to use the system. The technology and people's use of it is sure to keep growing.
""If this technology is going to increase the rate of introduction of new works of art, increase the ability of more humans to produce art, then I think, in the end, it is a good thing,"" Bennett said.

Astronaut Danny Olivas joins ISI’s Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Analytics Laboratory (VIMAL) to look for ways to use AI in space.



Danny Olivas
John Daniel “Danny” Olivas, former NASA astronaut and current member of the NASA Advisory Council, has joined the staff of the Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Analytics Laboratory (VIMAL) of USC’s Information Sciences Institute (ISI) as Co-Director for AI Initiatives in Space.
Olivas brings considerable experience to VIMAL, ISI and USC. A veteran of space shuttle missions in 2007 and 2009, he is the recipient of two NASA Space Flight Medals and the NASA Exceptional Service and Exceptional Achievement Medals. Olivas completed five space walks totaling over 34 hours outside of the International Space Station. His expertise in space is rivaled only by his passion for it, and he brings both to his new role.
Olivas said, “I am excited about the opportunity to help expand USC’s footprint in space, for researchers and students alike.”
The Birth of a Partnership
VIMAL – which is led by Wael AbdAlmageed, research director at ISI and research associate professor of electrical and computer engineering – has a noble and straight-forward mission: “to empower students to use artificial intelligence to make the world a better place, one day at a time.” With Olivas on the team, VIMAL is now able to look beyond Earth to do this.
Olivas and AbdAlmageed met in July 2022, when they were both invited to Renaissance Weekend, a prestigious, non-partisan, invite-only retreat for innovative thinkers across disciplines held this year in Banff,Canada. They quickly realized they had a lot in common. AbdAlmageed said, “Danny [Olivas] and I come from very similar mindsets and backgrounds. We believe in working hard on hard problems, without giving up, for a long period of time. We believe that is enough to make things happen.”
Interested in each others’ area of expertise, the two discussed how to harness their collective grit and work together. A month later, Olivas visited ISI for the day to learn about VIMAL and ISI, and present his thoughts on opportunities for AI in space.  
Out of This World Climate Data
Olivas’ astronaut background and exposure to space provides a valuable new perspective on new areas for data analysis. “Since the beginning of the [NASA] program, NASA has produced more data than has been analyzed,” he noted. He added that this data is ripe for analysis through artificial intelligence and machine learning.
One application is climate, which AbdAlmageed called an “area of growth for VIMAL.”
“NASA has instruments that can see things like water vapor in the upper atmosphere,” Olivas said. “All these kinds of things can not only be analyzed in their individual silos of monitoring, but you can now start to integrate data across the different instruments to build a much more robust picture of how climate changes are affecting a certain region.”
Ozone and CO2 in the atmosphere, temperature trends across the planet, drought prediction, sea level detection, deforestation, planet population changes — these are just some of the areas where NASA has useful historical data, according to Olivas.
“This data has been available by NASA for many, many years,” he added, “and (they) provide an opportunity to take pieces of this information and start to integrate them together and allow computational technologies to take over where human beings have had to digest this information in the past, to try to make sense of it.”
Robotics and Rovers
As NASA prepares for a future in which humans will travel to Mars, new and exciting AI applications will emerge. “There are some specific robotic applications that are very unique to NASA’s space program,” Olivas said. For example, a robot that can check the mood of an astronaut based on their facial expressions or voice intonations — something that will be increasingly important for mental health as missions extend from months to years with Mars exploration. 
Exploration rovers are another area where Olivas sees room for more AI, again, with Mars as the example: “It takes about twenty minutes to be able to send a command from Earth to Mars. By the time you get the photograph that your rover is marching over a cliff, it’s probably the wrong time to send the command to stop moving. So you want to have more intelligence being built on the platform to allow the rover to make decisions for itself.”
But First: Space Junk
Climate data, robots and rovers — these are areas Olivas might take VIMAL in the future. However, the first problem Olivas and AbdAlmageed plan on tackling is trash, specifically orbital debris. 
NASA defines orbital debris as any non-functional human-made object in orbit around the Earth. Think: spacecraft, satellites, rockets or what you’d get if any of those collided or exploded. Debris ranges in size from sub-microns all the way to several meters — from a paint chip to a school bus — with hundreds of thousands of estimated pieces orbiting Earth.
The trouble comes from the fact that this debris travels at orbital velocities that are dangerous to NASA’s missions — picture that paint chip or school bus traveling at 16,000 mph! Olivas said, “it’s that hyper-velocity impact that causes all sorts of problems, not only with the space station or human spacecraft, but also with satellite technology.” It is a serious threat to astronauts, spacecraft and space exploration in general.
The VIMAL team will be looking at ways to use their sensing, computer vision and AI expertise to identify pieces of debris and track them for long periods of time as they orbit Earth.
USC’s Legacy of Space Innovation
Olivas extends a strong legacy of innovation in space exploration at USC. He joins fellow former NASA astronauts Paul Ronney and Garrett Reisman, who also serve as faculty at USC Viterbi, which is one of a core group of top schools with a distinct astronautical program. This won’t be the first time Olivas and Reisman have worked together, they were classmates in the NASA astronaut program.
To date, school researchers have created innovations in spacecraft propulsion, space science, space environment, space communications, satellites and materials. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was a USC Viterbi alumnus, and the school has a dedicated Space Engineering Research Center at ISI. 
USC Viterbi maintains strong connections with pioneering space organizations and alumni who design and build rockets and space launchers, communications and direct broadcasting satellites, navigational systems, crewed space vehicles and planetary probes.
On a Mission to Collaborate
“At the end of the day, space is a human endeavor,” said Olivas, who pointed out that part of being an astronaut involves looking out for one another. He seemed impressed by this aspect of the work done by VIMAL.
“One thing that I’ve come to appreciate at VIMAL is the inclusive nature of the collaborations; it is really inspirational,” he said.
AbdAlmageed has very intentionally fostered the collaborative environment of VIMAL. “I’m proud that we’ve created a culture in the lab where everybody feels a sense of ownership and partnership.” He continued, “I couldn’t have done something like hire Danny [Olivas] without the significant contributions of everyone in VIMAL who do the work day in and day out. This was a team effort. I am also very grateful to Dr. Craig Knoblock, ISI Executive Director, for supporting our ambitious initiatives and pursuits.”
Olivas certainly seems excited to join the team, “I look forward to sharing, learning and seeing where those opportunities might be with VIMAL,” concluded the astronaut.

Summary


Pandemic-related constraints have hindered the restaurant industry, creating a limited workforce and high demand for service from customers. Robotics, powered by AI and rugged-edge computing, is ready to step in and offer an immediate financial impact on a restaurant’s bottom line.




 Now We’re Cooking: How Artificial Intelligence Helps Bring the Robot Fry Cook to Life 

The commercial foodservice industry is revolutionizing itself through intelligent automation solutions that solve some of the most significant gaps in back-of-house kitchen operations. Pandemic-related constraints have hindered the restaurant industry, creating a limited workforce and high demand for service from customers. Robotics, powered by AI and rugged-edge computing, is ready to step in and offer an immediate financial impact on a restaurant’s bottom line. Aided by machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics, new robotic systems will soon become commonplace in the kitchen, driving productivity while reducing cost and making room for the robotic fry cook to come to life.
 
The new normal 
The restaurant space has been hit hard in the last few years and is just starting its slow recovery from the pandemic’s impact on the industry. As the world moves into the post-pandemic era, there is hope that the industry could return to business as usual. But a new normal has since taken shape, leaving food preparation workers less motivated to resume their posts for various reasons. Robotic systems in the kitchen are in a prime position to help these institutions get back to work–and more efficiently.
 
Software algorithms, explicitly designed for intelligent food service, can enable hardware to streamline repetitive kitchen tasks. The computing systems powering this technology require a CPU, sufficient USP ports, and real-time edge processing with the help of a powerful GPU. As these solutions are developed for immediate use, with additional RMA support offered to restauranteurs, the production of these systems will scale rapidly through the US.  
 
The rugged edge along the kitchen counter
Developers of these types of robotics need to incorporate rugged edge computing, allowing these automated solutions to perform in hazardous environments while executing the core capabilities outlined by the software.
 
Real-time data collected by sensors is mission critical to these robotics’ performance. Uniformity works best when designing the hardware, minimizing the need for client customization, and accelerating time to market. The system electrical panels embedded in the hardware are a vital component of the automation process and should be designed for manufacturing and service that is easy to deploy. This helps guarantee that the modules within the robot can successfully handle sensor data coming from the kitchen.   
 
These robotic systems can be mass manufactured and deployed quickly and efficiently, as manufacturers ensure consistent settings across all products, scale their services, and accelerate time to market. With assets like trained personnel and industrial environments capable of managing assembly of the rugged edge hardware, it becomes possible for manufacturers to produce hundreds of units at a time.  
 
Mass production of a reliable system at scale requires recognizing the clear differentiation between a general-purpose embedded computer and a system built to handle AI algorithms and real-time data workloads. Whether on a fishing boat in the middle of the Atlantic or in the kitchen of a local restaurant, rugged edge computing is essential to balancing the performance, reliability, footprint, and longevity demands of these fast-evolving robotic systems.
 
Let’s get cooking
By combining smart AI algorithms with automated, industrial hardware, the modern restaurant kitchen is evolving in a manner that until recently was considered possible only in science-fiction. Autonomous commercial food prep has the potential to be less reliant on manual labor while improving overall working conditions for cook staff. Mundane, repetitive restaurant tasks performed by robots enhance food quality, safety, and throughput, and can also result in significant cost savings by minimizing human error and creating a streamlined workforce focused on some form of management instead of day-to-day tasks. Autonomous restaurants additionally allow for better, smarter business decisions by providing more–and more valuable–operational data, translating into broad savings over the long term in an overly competitive industry on the cusp of significant change.
 
The pandemic’s world-changing circumstances have presented new opportunity, calling for the tech and food industries to align. Restauranteurs and fast food chains that embrace robotics in the kitchen are “in the right place at the right time,” poised to gain a competitive edge while ensuring that their workflow, staff and customer experience are well looked after. These innovations are geared to flip the foodservice industry on its head, so as this change is embraced, the only thing left to do is to start cooking.

Medical Coding is the Next Stop for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
Industry leaders agree that artificial intelligence in healthcare is taking off; medical coding and billing is the latest use case for ER staffing company TECHealth.

October 03, 2022 - To a layperson, medical codes look like a different language, and in a way they are. Medical coding is a highly complex process in healthcare in which clinicians and revenue cycle staff work together to translate clinical encounters into billable codes for not only reimbursement but other performance tracking efforts. The codes that ultimately end on claims tell the story of a patient’s encounter.
Understanding a clinical encounter is extremely important for patient care and for keeping the doors open. However, in a world of ever-changing payer rules and documentation requirements, medical coding is perhaps more complex than ever.
“Something that is challenging for us is getting payment in a timely fashion so that we can actually make payroll to make sure doctors and APPs [advanced practice practitioners] are paid correctly,” explains Eric Wilke, MD, Eric Wilke, an emergency medicine doctor and chief operations officer at TECHealth, an ER physician staffing company.
Medical coding can get in the way of timely reimbursement. Payers may reject or deny claims because of medical coding errors or missteps. In fact, a survey of hospital executives found that about a third cite coding as their top concern when it comes to denials and denials prevention.
With denial rates on the rise, optimizing medical coding to prevent claims denials is critical. Healthcare organizations must identify the right codes for services provided during a clinical encounter while adhering to payer requirements. Organizations must ensure they are not leaving money on the table by neglecting to code a service or applying the appropriate severity level or modifier.
Organizations are also trying to implement medical coding best practices with fewer coders and revenue cycle staff.
“We’ve experienced hiring challenges for billing and coding positions, especially in the wake of COVID-19,” Wilke says. “We had extended interviews to several people, and they never even bothered to show up.”
The “Great Resignation”—a term used to describe high levels of turnover during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic—has hit healthcare particularly hard. Provider organizations have especially faced shortages of qualified revenue cycle talent, with entry-level roles taking an average of 84 days and over $2,000 to fill. Mid-level revenue cycle positions, which require six to ten years of experience, are taking an average of 153 days and over $3,500, survey results also show.
Many healthcare organizations choose to offshore medical coding to combat domestic staffing shortages and the high costs of filling open roles. But for organizations like TECHealth, “all of the work we were doing was domestic,” Wilke states.
Unfortunately, Google Translate does not recognize medical codes as a language. However, TECHealth found a “bit of an equalizer in that standpoint.”
Tapping into AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken healthcare by storm. The predictive analytics technology is revolutionizing the way certain providers deliver care. For example, Mayo Clinic recently found that AI can help detect atrial fibrillation, while Google Health is tapping the technology to detect cancer.
AI is being leveraged by researchers, providers, and tech companies alike to diagnose some of the most common and deadly diseases out there. However, the technology can also serve a purpose on the administrative side of healthcare.
Medical coding is ripe for AI technology, according to Wilke.
“Anything image or text-centric is a great opportunity for AI,” the healthcare leader explains. “So, yes, pathology, radiology, and dermatology are all areas of opportunity, but so is analyzing charts for billing and coding.”
AI can help organizations overcome the top challenges of medical billing and coding.
“We want something that can process [payments] quickly, so get them to the clearinghouse faster. The faster that works through the system, the better,” Wilke explains.
Tapping AI technology for medical billing and coding means a large portion of TECHealth’s claims were being worked through their IT systems. The technology was able to comb through upwards of 80 percent of claims with limited or without any human interaction. Additionally, the technology was able to process tens of thousands of medical charts in a matter of days to ensure proper coding.
With a kick-out ratio of under 20 percent, Wilke describes AI technology for medical billing and coding as  “a bit of an equalizer” when it comes to the workforce obstacles most healthcare organizations are currently facing, according to Wilke.
“[The technology] is not dependent on the human workforce, which is currently limited,” Wilke elaborates.
The smaller medical billing and coding team was able to work on more complex claims to recoup money from claim denials and to prevent future money-leaking missteps. Most of the low-hanging fruit was already taken care of by the organization’s IT systems.
Growing pains
While medical billing and coding are ripe for AI innovation, as evidenced by TECHealth’s success with the technology, implementation can come with some growing pains for healthcare organizations. The number one lesson learned, according to Wilke, is having quality data.
“If I could go back and redo [implementation], one of the things I would’ve redone is analyzing our coding team to make sure they were using appropriate codes because anyone using an AI engine has to use historical data so they can build the AI’s prediction model.”
“If you don’t give the [AI] the most accurate information upfront, then you don’t always get the most correct information on the backside,” Wilke stresses.
Garbage in, garbage out. That has been a major lesson for healthcare with the advent of analytics. The adage is especially true for predictive analytics models that rely on the data you feed the system to make predictions and workflows.
Healthcare organizations need enough data points or sets to ensure accurate prediction models since using a tiny fraction of your information does not provide the power analytics technologies need to be successful. That data also needs to be clean and accurate, Wilke indicates.
“I would have found somebody that coded very well, so at an appropriate level, and had those historical codes be used to train the AI,” Wilkes states.”If you’re moving to the AI side of the world, you need to analyze your data and the [evaluation and management] levels assigned. Make sure that your audit shows that coding is being done correctly, then pass that forward to the AI training engine.”
TECHealth also relied on its vendor at the time, Fathom, to get the AI prediction models just right for its medical billing and coding needs, Wilke stresses. The organization decided to go with that vendor mainly because of its “fairly robust history” of applying predictive analytics to medical coding and billing.
“They were nimble, easy to work with, and pretty aggressive and forward with making sure things got connected as fast as possible. Their technical team and our technical team worked really well together,” Wilke says.
Having a strategic partner parse through historical data and properly train models was key to TECHealth’s success with medical billing and coding at that time. And despite some pains, AI in healthcare is only growing, especially in the realm of medical billing and coding.
“AI is going to become an essential tool in this arena. It already has a pretty significant role, and it’s only going to get bigger,” Wilke states.

The Role of Human Talents in the Era of Artificial Intelligence

By Soey Lei
As we have entered into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), today’s AI-based technologies are not only assisting in mass production factories but also becoming socially intelligent – they are now utilized to interact with customers in frontline services. While the heated debate on whether AI will replace human employees continues, research evidence has shown that AI does not always outperform humans, especially in contexts such as tourism and hospitality service settings where person-to-person contact and personalized experiences are essential.
Lei, Sut Ieng (Soey) is a lecturer at Macao Institute for Tourism Studies
 A famous example is the first robot hotel in Japan which ended up replacing half of its robots with human staff. Some studies found customers still prefer human service in hospitality settings due to a number of reasons, such as the perception of humans as more effective communication partners, and the low perceived interaction quality and human sensitivity of service robots. Some studies also show that humans outperform service robots when it comes to building relationships and friendships with customers. 
Nevertheless, technologies will remain important and continue to change our lives. While the application of AI and robotic technologies seems to be unavoidable, the role of technologies should be to assist rather than replace humans. Decision makers need to understand the limitations and weaknesses of these new technologies. Paying close attention to consumer perception and reaction to technology-based services on a continuous basis is key, and the goal should be to search for the most effective ways in which humans and AI can work together to create the best customer experiences. Some research works have already been initiated to investigate synergies between human workers and AI. For example, some recent research evidence shows that human-AI collaboration can increase productivity, particularly for managerial professionals; and that people seem to complete household tasks more efficiently and perceive themselves as more effective when collaborating with AI. As employees might feel threatened by AI, identifying the situations under which they feel most comfortable working with AI and the factors that potentially reduce their perceived threat will help smoothen management practices in the future. 

The tourism and hospitality
industry provides unique opportunities for individuals to showcase their people
skills. At higher management levels, tourism and hospitality professionals’
abilities in critical thinking, strategic planning, resources integration, and
service innovation will remain crucial and irreplaceable by AI. However, smart
technologies will prevail when humans fail to meet customer expectations. Practitioners
and students should review their performances, skill sets, strengths, and
weaknesses on a regular basis and continuously seek opportunities for self-development.
How should the hospitality workforce become more ‘human’? How should human
sensitivity be further showcased in service settings so as to further exert the
advantages of human intelligence in service delivery? How should service
failures due to human errors be reduced to maximize the value of human
resources? These are critical questions for practitioners, educators, and
students to think about. At the end of the day, customers will turn away from
poor service, regardless of whether it is provided by humans or technologies.

With its rising industry applications and productivity benefits, the study of cybernetics is likely to be a vital element in the advancement of robotics..The craving for gadgets or machines that can keep up with the challenges of the present world and largely function in simpler and smarter ways is evident. Automation and autonomy have offered this by producing and delivering products and services that contain the least amount of human intervention, making certain jobs more convenient than ever before even when information is incomplete and uncertain. The appearance of new service robots and their wide evolution into new applications has further facilitated the world of automation. Due to the dynamic nature of robotics, numerous application sectors are now using robotics to perform predetermined tasks and enhance human efforts in both physical and analytic ways. Robotics has enhanced task efficiency, dependability, and quality, all of which were earlier, products of a laborious procedure. Being a critical component of automation, robotics is currently used in an ever-growing variety of fields, like manufacturing, transportation, healthcare &amp; medical care, utilities, defence, facilities, operations, and more recently, information technology. Here Cybernetics enters as a primary element as robots need to be advanced..What is Cybernetics and what makes it different from Artificial Intelligence (AI)?.Cybernetics is a study of science that focuses on developing technologies that act or think like humans by researching how electrical devices or machines and the human brain function to enhance the value of the job to be performed. Cybernetics is the best workaround physical embodiment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and predictive analysis and control, investigating underlying systems/structures, possibilities, and limitations of complex mechanisms, including robotics, and generating an autonomous environment that uses minimal to no human interaction. AI and cybernetics are two dissimilar perspectives on intelligent systems or systems that may act to achieve an aim. Making computers imitate intelligent behavior using pre-stored world representations is the primary goal of AI. In general, cybernetics tells us how systems control themselves and can take actions autonomously based on environmental signals even when the information is minimal and subject to significant uncertainty or noise. These systems go beyond simple computation; they can also control biological (body temperature regulation), mechanical (engine speed regulation), social (managing a huge workforce), and economic (controlling a national economy) systems..How does Cybernetics work?.Every cybernetic system's aim is to be set up so that its operations are linked in a variety of input-output system configurations which are normally driven with reference control signs. This is achieved by processing feedback-based automatic closed-loop control systems that can decide which behaviors should be changed, which actions should be tracked, how to compare the actions to the reference, and how to adapt the application behaviors in the most effective way. In natural cybernetic systems, this regulatory mechanism generates or organizes by itself with the help of self-learning. On the other hand, artificial cybernetic systems behave or are influenced by human-implemented automatic control systems. Essential elements of cybernetic systems are sensors, the controller, actuators and the system to be controlled..Cybernetics in robotics.Cybernetics in robotics systems' main objective is to use AI and machine learning in the sense-plan-act paradigm normally used to develop robots so they can operate productively in real-world scenarios. Developing a robot to understand and differentiate complex situations every day is highly demanding and getting the situation awareness correctly identified is crucial to ensuring the desired reference control signal can be identified for implementation. This can make sure an industrial robot recognizes and picks up the correct item for the next stage of the manufacturing process from a selection of parts to ensure the requests of the human to be served a variety of beverages will get the correct drink. Sensors and sensor systems that are perfectly calibrated are necessary for ensuring the situation awareness is achieved perfectly and in real-time using AI-based models which can be learned and applied in various situations such as driverless cars, medical robots, automated manufacturing, and home care robots..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
