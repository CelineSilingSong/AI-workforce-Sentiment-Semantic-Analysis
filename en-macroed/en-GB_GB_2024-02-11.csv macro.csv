Artificial Intelligence is like a highly specialized tool in a corporate setting, adept at performing specific tasks such as analyzing data, predicting patterns or automating routine processes. This is not new and has been around for a while now - after all, wasn't Netflix
NFLX
-0.3% recommending content for us using AI to watch almost a decade ago?


Generative Artificial Intelligence, or Gen AI, on the other hand, is a subset of AI and is relatively newer. It can create new content, like generating an image or design, using its programming to 'imagine' and produce things that didn't exist before. Think of AI as a highly skilled worker, while Gen AI is more like an innovative artist or creator.

HR leaders are now expected to go beyond their typical area of expertise (people) and understand/adopt new technologies (like AI) within the workforce, to both make teams more productive and create policies for safe use.

PROMOTED
The Difference Between AI And Gen AI
To further differentiate these concepts, let's break it down.

Netflix's recommendation system is an example of AI and not Gen AI. It uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze your viewing history, preferences, and behaviors. Doing so can predict and suggest content you're likely to enjoy. This system continually learns and adapts based on your interactions with the platform, making its recommendations increasingly personalized and accurate over time. The use of AI in this context is a prime example of how technology can enhance user experience by providing tailored suggestions for the end user. An example of machine learning in HR applications is the use of applicant tracking systems (ATS) that leverage machine learning algorithms to screen resumes and applications. These systems analyze resumes to match job seekers with job openings based on criteria such as skills, experience, and education.

Gen AI, in contrast, is about creating new content or data that didn't exist before. It involves AI systems that can generate new images, text, music, or other media that mimic human creativity. So while Netflix recommendations are a sophisticated use of AI, they don't involve the creative, generative processes characteristic of Gen AI. An example of Gen AI in HR applications is the creation of personalized training programs and content. Gen AI can analyze an individual employee's learning style, performance data, and career development goals to generate customized learning modules, activities, and educational materials. This tailored approach ensures that training is more engaging, effective, and directly aligned with the employee's growth path and the organization's needs.

Impacts Of Gen AI On The Workplace
Gen AI will be the most significant change to workplaces since the agricultural and industrial revolutions. This may sound like an extreme, however, in its early stages, it’s shown promising revolutions across many facets of how organizations work.

According to a recent McKinsey report, the adoption of AI is expected to sharply accelerate the timeline for automation, potentially automating up to 29.5% of work hours in the U.S. economy by 2030, compared to 21.5% without AI. The report suggests this change is not limited to manual or routine tasks - but extends to areas requiring creativity, expertise, and interaction with people​​.
However, the introduction of Gen AI into teams poses unique challenges. Research from the Columbia Business School indicates integrating AI into human teams can impact performance and coordination, leading to a decline in productivity. Despite the productivity gains offered by AI, there is a notable human aversion to working with AI agents, which raises concerns about trust and job satisfaction – key competencies of employee engagement and retention. This aversion is not uniform across cultures, indicating a need for differentiated strategies in global organizations. HR professionals and organizational leaders must collaborate to create common practices and guidelines that address cultural differences and trust issues, ensuring Gen AI implementation within the workforce enhances rather than hinders employee engagement and productivity.
AI creates a landscape where individuals can evolve from specializing in just one or two skill areas to proficiently handling several interconnected skills simultaneously. Deepening the integration of Gen AI in organizations will need more robust learning programs and a culture that emphasizes teaching and learning across three dimensions: individual, organizational, and the AI itself. About 75 percent of the value that Gen AI use cases could deliver falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D, according to a June 2023 McKinsey report.
I believe AI will not replace all humans anytime soon, but rather both humans and machines will enhance their capabilities over time to effectively harness the full potential of Gen AI for an organization. To truly understand and leverage this transformative technology, I encourage you to dedicate time to learning about the power of Gen AI by immersing yourself in it and giving it a try. A good place to start is to reference this report by FlexOS that covers the top 150 GenAI tools.

I have a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence. I’m leaving the tech industry. Applying machine data to help me move on with my life

					02/12/2024 • Illustrated by Estelle Guillot




After six months of searching-and-not-searching for management-level jobs in tech, I am done. I have done what society demanded of me. I have pursued what I thought needed to be pursued. I valiantly pushed on toward a goal that should have been mine but never was. I have given my time, my energy, and my youth for a white-collar world that will never stop gorging on people like me.  
I am done.  
Growing up in India, I did everything right. I excelled in math and science. I gave up my dreams of becoming a writer in favor of a stable, steady engineering job. I followed the path set down by men like Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google. I completed my master’s at a top University of California school in a field that promised to place me in the frontiers of change — robotics and artificial intelligence. I found a job in the self-driving industry and worked on AI that claimed to make the world a better place. And then reality struck me on the head, forcing me to look up. 
In total, I worked in the AI industry for four years. The result: absolutely nothing. None of the products I worked on ever reached the people they were supposed to help. Tech leaders and evangelists enjoy preaching about helping society and serving the ones who need a leg up. But after observing their actions and not just their words, I learned that it’s all a facade. There is no scope for those who want to work on socially impactful products. The current tech universe is centered around investor happiness, futuristic demos, and making executives richer than their wildest dreams. It has no place for ideals or idealists. For a while ,I hung on with my eyes willfully shut, because it was the only way to pay the bills and hold on to my work visa. But everything changed when the effects of COVID turned the tech industry upside down. 
By the time I was hit by the layoffs in Summer 2023, I had already survived multiple ordeals similar to other young workers: switching to remote work during the pandemic after only a few months of experiencing the old norm, having to support my family when businesses everywhere ground to a halt, being forced to live away from my home when wave after a deadly wave of COVID hit my country. All to hold onto a pointless job and a dehumanizing visa. I’m sorry to say that even after I got laid off, I didn’t wake up at once. After all, it’s hard to let go of the dream one’s entire life has been built on. From July to December 2023, I applied to 500-plus companies, interviewed with less than five percent of those, got led on by recruiters, went through multiple rounds of interviews with a few companies before they yanked those jobs out from under me to give them to someone who came “highly recommended.”  
It’s 2024, and the layoffs have continued into the new year. Optimism dictates that I wait around and keep trying. The next role must be lurking just around the corner. In the beginning, I had taken an inside view of the whole situation. I am terribly smart, a good leader and so, so capable. I must be able to get a job soon, right? 
But zooming out, a different picture greeted me. I decided to learn from AI and look at all the available data. There are hundreds and thousands of others in the same laid-off boat who are just as capable and just as in need of the very same jobs. Some in more desperate situations than mine. Whenever workforce reductions begin, the companies go for the middle management — the product, program and project managers, those whose roles are not tied to the “core” business, whatever that may be. History repeats itself and in the quest for “lean” organizations, those in charge of people, culture, and other intangible benefits, get placed squarely in the line of fire.  
If these organizations stopped to look at the way history tends to play out, they will see that by cutting out the “non-essential” staff, they are spreading the work out onto the already-burdened shoulders of the “essential” ones, people who may have neither the will nor the skill to take on managerial tasks. Among the survivors, burnout is high, fear of the next layoff tangible in the air, resulting in an anxious and less motivated workforce. Organizations and leaders have lost respect and trust. A good lesson would be to look at what happened at companies in the 1980s and ’90s after mass layoffs around the appearance of new technology. Shareholder profits and short-term goals can and have pulled companies under in the past. 
Currently, for many of those who got laid off software roles are the only way to rejoin the tech industry and get a visa sponsorship. But I’m tired of being told what to do and being forced to work on products that create no real impact. There is no guarantee that the next company wouldn’t throw me under a bus the first chance they get. The modern tech company has successfully shifted the risk and responsibility from the employers onto the fragile employees. Executives take zero responsibility for a worker’s well-being and are then surprised when people defer from putting their hearts and souls into their jobs. They forget that the only way to ensure a “productive” workforce is to make the workers feel happy, safe, and cared for.  
Right before the layoff, I nearly ended up digging myself further into the corporate grave. I got offers from some of the best business schools in the U.S., but something always stopped me from taking them up on their offers. Once I even paid to hold a seat, but fate/destiny/an-evil-layoff prevented me from starting the course. I was lost, confused and more than a little stunned by the way things had turned out.  
At that time, my friends helped me find a way out of the fog. One friend consoled me by saying that she never pictured me remaining in the corporate world anyway. She believed in my ability to create, to think differently, and to forge my own path. She helped me let go of my misconceptions and loosely held visions of the future. That conversation led to days and months of thinking, overthinking, and ruminations about the future. I found that it was easier to figure out what I didn’t want and didn’t have any further need of: the tech industry. And with the dawn of the new year, I finally found the courage to let go. 
I am tired of tech, its inherent hypocrisies, and its everlasting hooplas. I am sick of being forced into doing performative actions to prove my worth. I am done being treated as a diversity candidate and having to convince powerholders that I am worthy of their time and money. I am done with being viewed as a risk and too young and too foreign. I am frustrated that even after so many decades, the rot in Corporate America remains too deep to be flushed out. I am, simply, done.  
Moreover, I refuse to give up on all that I have gained in the past six months: my health, my sanity, my creativity, my freedom. I refuse to be forced into the office for the sake of presenteeism. I refuse to give in to the demands of emotionally insensitive, profit-minded, short-sighted leadership teams. I refuse to look the other way when the underlying problems with a company and its culture refuse to be addressed. I refuse to be treated as a second-class citizen and eyed as a potential “mom.” I refuse to assimilate and conform and become “an organization man.” Because try as I might, I know they will never truly accept me or treat me well. 
I have thought long and hard about what I want to do next. What my future should look like. What my ideal job could be. How would I like to spend the rest of my time on this precious but burning planet?  
The answer is simple and the one right in front of all of us: to do things that make one happy. Of course, the jump to self-employment and being my own boss is going to be hard, but ultimately better for my mental and physical health. I found that I enjoyed doing freelance and consulting work that is self-sustaining. I like having the time to volunteer and being an active member of the community. It feels wonderful to benefit others in a way that is visible and tangible. After escaping the confines of the archaic 40-hour work week I have no intentions of willingly putting back on the shackles of white-collar employment. It’s true: once you see the rot, it’s really hard to unsee.  

I know that not everyone can walk away from their jobs. I admit that I may be one of the lucky few who can. Working in tech provided me with one huge lasting benefit — a kind of financial freedom I had never known before. My years in tech helped me build a modest nest egg that now gives me the dignity and confidence to dream of a better life without seeing myself as a burden to my partner. I will always be grateful for that. 
Besides, I’ve also learned that it’s okay to plateau. It’s okay to slowly build a stable and steady life. It’s okay to not want what others want. It’s okay to make your own mistakes and choices and not give into the pull of the system. It’s okay to not pursue constant growth. It’s okay to stop living in fear of being left behind. 
I feel eager to get started on the next phase of my life. Of course, this is just one of a multitude of choices I could be making. But I choose to take the path that feels right. The one that beckons and comforts. The one that aids my family, friends, and my community. The one that gives and does not take. The one that lets me pause and breathe. I choose to lean on my privilege and the support of my family. I choose to ignore the demands of corporate feminism and allow my partner to take care of things for a while. I choose my mind, my body, and my peace.

A quarter of workers fear that AI will drive women out of the workplace, according to new research from Code First Girls. A survey from the social enterprise found that more than eight-in-ten workers are using ChatGPT in their workplace across a variety of roles, including tech, content creation, graphic design, and copywriting.Six-in-ten said they're using it mainly to improve productivity, with half saying it helps them work faster.However, a surge in the use of generative AI tools has also given rise to fears over the potential impact of the technology on female staff. One-quarter of workers said they believe the use of AI will “push women out of the workforce” while nearly half agreed that the potential imbalance in tech will result in biased or discriminatory AI models.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProWhen it comes to recruitment, researchers said unintentional bias in AI models and algorithm development can result in a lack of diversity among shortlisted candidates, thanks to male-dominated training data.(Image credit: Getty Images)UK businesses that adopt AI earn millions more than those that don'tAI interest is fueling a surge in digital apprenticeships across the UKThousands of disabled people 'missing' from tech workforceAnna Brailsford, CEO of Code First Girls, said the research highlights growing concerns among female tech workers that the emergence of generative AI tools could have a negative impact on their careers.""The development of AI continues to demonstrate useful applications across a variety of industries and sectors. However, by not prioritizing diversity in its development, we risk building models that are inherently discriminatory against race and gender minorities,” she said.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

It happens to be the case that AI's abilities overlap more with support occupations,"" said Revelio economist Hakki Ozdenoren.AI recruitment tools have been a contentious topicFears that AI recruitment tools are biased are well-founded. In 2018, Amazon was forced to pull an AI recruitment tool after it was discovered that it was disproportionately favoring men. Because the tool was trained on data about previous hires - mostly men - it started downgrading any resumes containing the word 'women's'.RELATED WEBINAR(Image credit: IBM)Transform your people management and optimize your HR strategyIn September 2023, a study by Aligned AI found that gender bias still persists in large language models (LLMs). When it comes to professional gender bias, researchers said OpenAI’s GPT-4 is the most biased AI, with a score of 19.2%, followed closely by Databricks’ Dolly 2.0, and Stability AI’s StableLM-Tuned-Alpha.While some researchers have claimed that AI can actually reduce bias in recruitment, this idea was contested in late 2022 by University of Cambridge researchers, who found that using AI to narrow candidate pools can increase uniformity rather than diversity in the workforce, as it's calibrated to search for the employer’s 'ideal candidate'.""These tools are trained to predict personality based on common patterns in images of people they’ve previously seen, and often end up finding spurious correlations between personality and apparently unrelated properties of the image, like brightness,"" said Euan Ong, researcher on the project.

Already, gen AI can be leveraged across the value chain: from product design and content creation across campaign images, marketing text, website code and videos, to online consumer experiences through virtual styling and digital clienteling. Meanwhile, conventional AI can be leveraged to forecast demand for buying and merchandising teams or gather insights for store associates and retail teams.The management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company estimates that gen AI could add up to $275 billion of economic potential to apparel, fashion and luxury sectors’ operating profits. It estimates the technology could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending, while as much as one-fourth of gen AI’s potential value in fashion may be driven by use cases in design and product development.As a result, 73 percent of fashion executives expect to prioritise gen AI this year, as cited in BoF and McKinsey’s State of Fashion 2024, while 62 percent of fashion businesses already use gen AI in the workplace.However, only 4 percent claim to use AI “regularly”, while 21 percent use it “occasionally” and 37 percent “experimentally”. The most popular use cases are focused around creative experimentation — in marketing, creating copy or visual content, or to assist in design and product development. Use cases in stores and supply chain operations are still nascent despite their potential.ADVERTISEMENTCrucially, the rate of change executives seek in their business by integrating gen AI and other technologies is out of step with existing skill sets. The State of Fashion report finds that many will face a talent gap, given that just 5 percent of the surveyed executives said they are ready to make best use of the technology.To accommodate next-gen technologies, job requirements across different functions will need to change — in some cases, they already have. Many job specifications in product development require an understanding of computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modelling software. Soon, fashion professionals can expect requests for skill sets or specialisms in gen AI programmes like Midjourney, ChatGPT and their competitors.What’s more, leaders and HR teams need to consider how they can foster the right workplace culture and technical support to optimise the use of next-gen tools.This BoF Careers white paper explores how fashion businesses can approach integrating gen AI into their workplace, the core skill sets needed in a digitally competent workforce, and the pastoral requirements to effectively support an employee cohort reimagining its day-to-day practices for long-term success.Featuring actionable insights and analysis from global experts:Rhianna Cohen is the creative director for the creative strategy studio Mørning, working with global brands such as Nike, Calvin Klein, Coty, Meta and more.

There are many types of AI content generators with a variety of uses for consumers and businesses.
ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot, inspired a flurry of attention with its November 2022 release. The technology behind it -- the GPT-3 language model -- has existed for some time. But ChatGPT made the technology publicly available to nontechnical users and drew attention to all the ways AI can be used to generate content. Now, more than a year after its release, many AI content generators have been created for different use cases.







This has prompted questions about how the technology will change the nature of work. Some schools are banning the technology for fears of plagiarism and cheating. Lawyers are debating whether it infringes on copyright and other laws pertaining to the authenticity of digital media. President Joe Biden also passed an executive order in October 2023 that addresses the technology's opportunities and risks in the workforce, education, consumer privacy and a range of other areas. Generative AI has the potential to change the way content is created.

What is AI-generated content?
AI-generated content -- or generative AI -- refers to the algorithms that can automatically create new content in any digital medium. Algorithms are trained on a large amount of data. Outputs are then returned based on that data and a comparatively little bit of user input. But the key is that content is new and generated automatically.
The most common example of a generative AI algorithm is ChatGPT. ChatGPT performs natural language processing and is based on the language model GPT-3. GPT-3 is trained on a large amount of human text from the internet and teaches the language model how to respond when interacting with users.

Other generative AI programs work in a similar way. They are trained to develop a body of knowledge and use that knowledge to create novel outputs.
Many commercial generative AI offerings are currently based on OpenAI's generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Codex.


What are the different types of AI-generated content?
AI-generated content is not just limited to mimicking human writers. AI-generated content also exists in other media, such as the following:

Image.
Speech.
Video.
Music.
Code.

Despite the many types of content generative AI can create, the algorithms used to create it are often large language models such as GPT-3 and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers -- also known as BERT.





How generative AI is used
These different media can be used in tandem to generate various content. They can be used in many fields, including the following:

Academia, to write papers and other long-form content.
Law, to write legal briefs.
Science, to automate and expedite drug discovery.
Art, to generate new works and unique content ideas.
Manufacturing, to expedite product development.
Digital marketing, to write copy and product descriptions, as well as draft social media posts.
Software development, to generate, remediate and summarize code.
Cybersecurity, to perform accelerated threat detection and develop malware.



AI content generators
There are AI content generator tools in every medium -- some paid and some free. Many are based on similar technology and add features to address specific user needs. Below are some of the top content generators organized by content type.
Written

AI-Writer is an AI writing assistant that helps reword and remediate an existing piece of content, creates unique article drafts, provides citation lists, summarizes SEO competitors and creates SEO-optimized content from Google.
Gemini (formerly Bard) is Google's conversational AI tool, powered by a language model of the same name. It is available in more than 230 countries and territories and functional in over 40 languages. Gemini competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT and aims to improve the way people search for and retrieve information. One example of a use for Gemini is asking it for meal ideas based on what food is in the house. Another example is asking it to explain complex scientific concepts in a way a child could understand. Gemini, like ChatGPT, is multimodal, meaning it can handle images as well as text. Gemini integrates with other Google services such as Gmail and Google Docs.
ChatGPT is a machine learning-powered chatbot trained to engage in realistic dialogue. The chatbot can debug code, challenge incorrect premises and refuse to respond to certain requests. The model produces convincing content but does struggle with factual accuracy. It was trained using reinforcement learning and is informed by previous OpenAI projects such as GPT-3 and Codex. It also integrates with image models to generate images from a text prompt.




ChatGPT can help users troubleshoot and generate computer code.






ChatSonic is a dialogue-focused content generator from Writesonic built on top of GPT-4 with added features. Users can choose from 16 different personas to chat with, including poets and accountants. Users can also interact with ChatSonic via voice and choose to have ChatSonic respond audibly. ChatSonic is connected to Google's knowledge graph and includes up-to-date information from the internet.
Claude is a conversational AI tool by Anthropic, an AI safety and research lab. Claude is in beta and is integrated into Slack to summarize threads and answer questions. It provides a principal-based approach to performing chatbot functions and can handle adversarial questions. Anthropic was founded by two former OpenAI employees.
Docs is Google's cloud-based, collaborative word processor with AI features to generate, summarize and brainstorm text. Docs is integrated with Google Bard as well.
Jasper AI is a long-form AI copywriting tool and article generator that includes more than 50 content generation templates in 25 global languages. Jasper's user interface is simple to use and lets content creators specify SEO keywords and tone of voice in the prompt.
Magic Write is an AI text generator for Canva Docs. Users can prompt magic write to brainstorm, generate outlines and generate content ideas. It was developed using GPT-3.
Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine. It includes many of the same natural language functions that ChatGPT has to offer. A unique feature of Perplexity is that it can provide sources to back up the answers that it has generated. It functions more as a search engine than an original writer, but still generates original content.
Rytr is an AI content generator that lets content creators specify a content use case, tone of voice and keywords. It also comes with plugins for WordPress.
Spellbook by Rally is writing software designed to help lawyers with legal drafting. Spellbook can draft new contract clauses, list common negotiation points based on the contract and create contract summaries.
Wordtune is an AI tool for AI21 Labs that can perform a variety of general language tasks, such as rewriting sentences and citing sources.

Image

Craiyon, originally called DALL-E mini, was developed by researchers at Google and Hugging Face. It produces a batch of AI-generated images in response to a text prompt. The image quality is generally lower than that of Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. The images often appear blurry and unrealistic.
DALL-E is OpenAI's image generator that creates images and art from a simple text prompt. DALL-E can also make realistic edits to images using a caption. It can remove components and change image texture, for example. It can also create several variations of an existing image based on the original. DALL-E uses diffusion, which starts with a random pattern of dots and creates an image from it.
Midjourney is an image generator hosted on a Discord server. Users can manipulate the generator via Discord bot commands or through a web app. It generates realistic-looking images based on text prompts. Some users have noted that Midjourney output resembles paintings rather than photographs. Users are encouraged to post their creations on designated X -- formerly known as Twitter -- and Reddit pages to help train the system.
Stable Diffusion is Stability AI's generator that can create photorealistic images from an inputted text. It can also be used to fill in missing or deteriorated pieces of art and has an easy-to-use in-browser function through DreamStudio. Stable Diffusion uses diffusion to create images.

Music

Amper music is a generator that creates music from prerecorded samples. The software can be used to match music to video, where users can specify the duration of music and where in the music a climax should fall.
Dadabots is a generative neural network that creates a constant live stream of artificial music in different genres and raw audio neural networks that imitate bands. For example, its infinite bass solo video is a 24/7 stream of emulated bass noises.
Harmonai is a community-driven organization that creates open source tools for generating novel sounds based on diffusion, a process that takes white noise and manipulates it into audio samples automatically. Harmonai aims to develop open source audio synthesis and manipulation tools. Harmonai released Dance Diffusion, which has six publicly available music generation models -- each trained on different sets of data sets.
MusicGen is a Hugging Face Space that lets users generate audio from a description, an example file or a sound clip recorded directly from the device's microphone.
Soundraw is an AI music generator that can be used to generate royalty-free background music. Users can choose the tempo, mood, genre and theme of the song.

Code

CodeWP is an AI code generator specifically for WordPress. It works with JavaScript, PHP, WooCommerce, Breakdance, Oxygen and Regex conditions. CodeWP helps WordPress users by minimizing the time spent on development. Like other content generators, CodeWP works based on small text prompts.
CodeWhisperer is an AI coding companion from Amazon that provides AWS users with code recommendations based on existing code and comments. The tool can also highlight code that might create a security vulnerability and suggest changes.
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code generator that generates code from natural language prompts in the code comments. For example, a coder could write ""design a website landing page"" and it would produce the appropriate code. It is free to use for verified students, teachers and open source project maintainers. Others can use Copilot with a paid subscription or through a one-time 30-day free trial. CoPilot also has an Enterprise tier that corporate developers use as a pair programmer with internal source code.
Tabnine is a coding assistant that predicts and generates a programmer's next lines of code based on syntax. Tabnine makes suggestions based on a coder's style and programming patterns. It works with a variety of languages including Ruby, Python, Rust and Go.

Other

Absci is a drug creation company that designs antibodies from scratch using AI. Their Integrated Drug Creation platform designs antibodies without prior training on an existing target. This speeds up the process of drug discovery, enables the design of new drugs and enables personalized medicine. The scientist prompts the model with a target protein and the program generates an antibody in response.
Bing is Microsoft's AI-enabled search engine with chatbot functions. Users can query it the way they would a normal search engine, and it will return fully synthesized answers instead of the standard list of links.
Creo is a computer-aided design system that uses generative design, enabling expedited design of physical objects. It also optimizes designs based on material and manufacturing requirements.
DuckAssist is an AI feature in the DuckDuckGo search engine that generates answers using auto-summaries of Wikipedia pages. It aims to limit natural language models' tendency to hallucinate answers and provide incorrect information.
Duet AI is a set of AI features for Google's enterprise collaboration suite, Workspace Enterprise. Duet embeds AI features in several of Workspace's tools. Google Slides can produce AI images, audio and video for presentations. Google Sheets can automatically derive insights from data and generate formulas using AI. Gmail can draft and generate email replies automatically.
Grok is xAI's -- Elon Musk's AI startup -- version of ChatGPT. It has internet browsing capability and can answer users based on up-to-date information on the web. The tool is designed to answer questions that other AI systems might typically avoid and have a more humorous tone.
Pi is a chatbot designed to serve as the user's personal assistant. Inflection AI launched the tool. It is designed to offer personal advice and support. It comes from LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman and DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman's company Inflection AI.
Supermeme.ai is an AI-powered meme generator. Users can input several hundred characters of text and the program generates a meme based on it. AI automatically chooses a template and writes a caption. Users can also generate memes based on a theme. The memes follow a classic ""bottom text"" format.
You.com is an AI-powered search engine with chatbot functions. Users query You.com, and the search engine returns a summary of search results in a conversational tone. You.com also provides citations for its responses. But it is not limited to text -- it also features an image generator and code generator.

While automatically generating content has its benefits, it's also fraught with risk and uncertainty. Read up on some of the pros and cons of AI-generated content.

The arrival of generative artificial intelligence has been nothing short of a professional earthquake, shaking up the very foundations of career landscapes across the board.See Also: 5 Requirements for Modern DLP
As we traverse this seismic shift in innovation, it's becoming increasingly clear that gen AI is playing a dual role: It's both the villain in the tale of job displacement and the hero ushering in a new era of enhanced job roles and opportunities.
Let's peel back the layers of this narrative and examine the somewhat bitter truth about gen AI's impact on careers.
The Job Role Revolution: Disruption or Destruction?
Gen AI's impact on traditional job roles is less of a gentle nudge and more of a shove off a cliff. Roles steeped in routine tasks and aspects of customer service are finding themselves face-to-face with the automation guillotine. Gen AI - with its flashy capabilities to generate content, spit out code and mimic customer service agents - is challenging the notion of what kind of work requires a human touch.
Yet, we're told not to view this disruption as the end of the line for these professions. Instead, it's supposed to lead to a magical transformation in which humans are liberated from the monotony of their tasks to pursue higher-level, more creative endeavors. Customer service agents, for example, are now expected to deal with the complexities of human emotions and behaviors that gen AI can't quite grasp - yet. But let's be honest: Is this evolution or just a fancy way of saying, ""Find a new job""?
New Careers and Skill Sets: The Silver Lining or Just More Clouds?
On the bright side, new careers and skill sets are emerging, thanks to our AI overlords. There's a growing demand for AI specialists, data scientists and ethics compliance managers, which reflects the desperate need for humans to keep AI systems in check. The irony is that we're now creating jobs to manage the technology that's making other jobs obsolete.
This new era emphasizes the importance of being a jack-of-all-trades. Professionals now must juggle technical skills, ethical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. But there's a catch: You need to be a lifelong learner, constantly updating your skill set to keep up with the relentless pace of AI advancements. The goal posts for employability are not just moving; they're on a high-speed train.
Ethical and Societal Chess
Diving deeper, gen AI isn't just driving a technical and operational overhaul in the professional world; it's opening a Pandora's box of ethical dilemmas and societal challenges.
As AI systems gain autonomy, we're scrambling to find professionals who can navigate the murky waters of ethics, privacy and social justice. It's a tall order, considering these digital genies are already out of the bottle, weaving themselves into the fabric of our decision-making processes.
The ripple effect of gen AI on society calls for a Herculean effort to revamp education, training programs and social safety nets. But let's not kid ourselves. The call for a collaborative effort among governments, industries and educational institutions to support workforce transitions feels more like a polite suggestion than a concrete plan.
Surviving the Gen AI Wilderness
For the average professional trudging through the wilds of gen AI, the mantra is: Adapt or perish. Embracing continuous learning and staying on top of AI trends is now a survival strategy, not just career advice. And let's not forget the need for ethical literacy, as if understanding the complexities of AI wasn't daunting enough.
Networking and interdisciplinary collaboration are touted as lifelines in this era of uncertainty. But in reality, they're just fancy ways of finding allies in your quest to remain relevant in the face of gen AI's relentless march forward.
Skepticism, Adaptability and Humor
The narrative surrounding gen AI and careers is a mix of genuine opportunity and veiled threats. While this technology promises to revolutionize job satisfaction and innovation, it also carries the risk of making vast swaths of the workforce obsolete. 
Navigating a career path in the age of gen AI is a journey fraught with uncertainty. It demands a blend of skepticism, adaptability and a dash of humor to tackle the challenges head-on. Welcome to the brave new world of work, where the only constant is the relentless hum of the machines.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

As an employment-focused social network that counts more than 1 billion business professionals and 65 million organizations among its users, LinkedIn has a unique view of job-seeker behavior and what skills employers are looking for. And right now, everyone is focused on generative AI.

According to the company’s recent “Future of Work Report: AI at Work,” 55% of LinkedIn users’ jobs will be impacted in some way by generative AI.
The report also showed that between December 2022 and September 2023, views for AI and AI-related jobs rose 12% across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Applications for AI and AI-related job postings for those seven countries increased by 11%, and in just the U.S., views and applications rose by 21% and 19%, respectively.
“By and large, what we’re seeing is there are different speeds of displacement, different speeds of augmentation happening, but it is happening across all sectors,” said Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist.


“What that tells me is that the adoption rate of this technology ... it is not a flash in the pan,” said Kimbrough during a panel discussion at the MIT Shaping the Future of Work Initiative launch event in January. “It is here. It is changing what employers are looking for.”
The initiative, led by co-directors Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and MIT economist David Autor, uses research to analyze the labor market and improve job quality and job equity for non-college workers.
Here are some additional takeaways from the LinkedIn analysis and panel discussion.
Disrupting industries
In its analysis, LinkedIn found that 49% of women and 45% of men will experience disruption in their jobs because of generative AI. Women are in the majority, according to the report, because they are overrepresented in jobs that can be partially done by machines, such as administrative and office management positions.


LinkedIn also studied the U.S. communities where the workers who are most likely to be disrupted live.
“We asked, ‘What’s the median income in the communities that they live in?’” Kimbrough said. “It was 10% above the median. These were folks that were not the locksmith but the librarian. This is your solidly middle-class [cohort] that looked to be the most exposed.”
Becoming ‘AI literate’
The LinkedIn analysis found that its users are rapidly adding AI skills to their profiles, though Kimbrough said that doesn’t mean they have to become AI experts.
“You just have to know how to be AI literate, how to use the software in your domain,” Kimbrough said. “That’s going to help you be a little bit more efficient. So it’s not about all of us becoming coders; it’s about all of us just getting a little bit more literate in our space.”
That dovetails with the study’s findings that employers today are willing to focus on skills more than previous job titles or degrees.

How should AI-generated content be labeled? 


“What we actually find in our own data is that when you take a skills-based approach … you actually expand your potential talent pool, sometimes as much as 20 times,” Kimbrough said. “Getting over that initial barrier of ‘Did you go to a certain school or did you get a certain degree or did you have a certain title?’ makes a huge difference for hiring.”
Investing in employees
Workers are focused on investing in their skill sets, and Kimbrough and MIT Sloan professor of the practice Zeynep Ton urged employers to invest in their employees as well.
LinkedIn found that companies that excelled at internal mobility and upskilling retained their employees for nearly twice as long as companies that did not do those things well.
Offering employees a career path “is huge,” Ton said. “Once you commit to promoting from within, then your entire HR system changes, because now you’re hiring differently; now you’re coaching people differently.”
And while a paycheck is still a priority, Kimbrough said, younger generations are reporting that it’s also important that their employer takes a vested interest in them.
“They want to feel that they have a career path and not just the job,” Kimbrough said.

Today, “how” we work and “who” we work with are the defining transformations in the workplace. Soon, every human team member across departments as varied as human resources, sales, customer service, and engineering will have their own GenAI co-pilot, customized to their role and key responsibilities. Conversational AI has led to a myriad of new use cases where GenAI is our new work buddy.


We have several specialized AI powered assistants working side by side with human workers. Teachers have copilots for homework grading, such as Class Companion, architects have an AI assistant for design, SketchPro. Online learners studying at Kahn Academy have Kahnmigo to help them become better learners, while learners on the Uplimit platform have CoBot as their AI powered teaching assistant.

In the corporate world, we are seeing early adopters such as Deloitte, McKinsey, Microsoft, and Walmart launching enterprise AI powered work buddies to help employees be more productive.

PROMOTED
While workers experiment with GenAI, some companies discourage usage. A BCG Digital Acceleration study of 2,000 global executives found more than 50% discourage GenAI adoption. This seems like the debate we had in 2009, when, according to a Robert Half survey, 54% of U.S. companies banned workers from using social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn while on the job. Today, can you imagine being banned from using LinkedIn at work?

Workers will use new technology on their own, regardless of whether it is adopted by their organization. A recent survey by Fishbowl reports that 68% of 5,067 workers use ChatGPT at work, but they do not disclose this to their manager. Instead of debating new technology usage, leaders must develop a plan for GenAI’s adoption aligned to their strategic business priorities.

Lead the GenAI Transformation in Your Organization 
The only way to lead the GenAI transformation is to roll up your sleeves and start using GenAI to understand how this will you impact both you as a leader, and every employee in the company. Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, says, “CEOs who are not using Generative AI will fail.” They will fail, because GenAI will change the way leaders think, communicate, and strategize about the business.
The best way to determine GenAI use cases is for senior leaders to experiment with GenAI and share what they have learned company-wide. Leaders can start their journey by forming cross-functional executive teams, so GenAI is aligned with the organization’s key business priorities, current AI capabilities, and key business problems.
Understand the Sentiment for using GenAI Among Workers and Leaders
International Monetary Fund estimates AI will affect almost 40% of global jobs, replacing some and complementing others. Some employees are experiencing a fear of becoming obsolete. Others are actively embracing AI to improve their productivity and creativity. A BCG survey of 13,000 people in 18 countries—from executive leaders to middle managers and front-line employees—finds leaders are much more optimistic than front-line employees about AI (62% vs. 42%) and how to incorporate it into one’s job, with 80% of leaders feeling optimistic, while only 20% of front-line workers felt they understand the impact of AI on their job.
This discrepancy on using AI between workers and leaders can negatively impact morale and productivity. Almost a third of job seekers said they are looking for new positions because of GenAI disruption. The American Psychological Association reports workers who are worried about AI disrupting their role are 57% more likely to feel that their productivity is declining and 40% more likely to feel ineffective at work.
A commitment to frequent employee pulse surveys is critical is understand worker sentiment and take action to address employee fears of becoming obsolete.
Train All Workers on Safe and Equitable Usage of AI 
The explosive use of GenAI is uncovering a need to up-skill the entire workforce. BCG research finds workers expect their employer to provide AI literacy and this is true of 80% of white-collar workers, 76% of blue collars, and 74% of pink collars. Almost one-third of workers across 16 countries report they are pursing learning opportunities on their own in response to AI disruption, because their company training was inadequate.
The large professional service companies are the early adopters in GenAI training. PwC is committing $1Billion over three years to train 75,000 workers in GenAI so they can safely incorporate this into their work. Genpact is another company that has developed a GenAI training program, giving employees instant access to the collective intelligence of the company. To date, 60,000 have gone through the self-paced training immersion and 22,000 have completed. This is in addition to a 12-week immersive program for developers, including a deep dive into prompt engineering.
Pilot Use Cases With Involvement of Cross Functional Executive Teams
McKinsey’s launch of Lilli, a GenAI solution, is one example of how an AI powered work buddy can provide streamline searching and synthesizing more than 100,000 documents and a network of experts across 70 countries. This process kicks off a new project at McKinsey and often takes about two weeks of researching and networking. Now Lilli streamlines this quickly and efficiently. In addition to increasing productivity of team members, McKinsey team members can use Lilli as “thought sparring partner” anticipating client questions sand creating an enhanced project plan.
McKinsey’s lesson in piloting Lilli is one we all need to be aware of; Phil Hudelson a McKinsey partner who leads the development of our technology platforms said that “the technology was the easy part, the bigger challenge was bringing the right team together from functions such as HR, talent development, cyber security, and risk management to address all the angles in launching the GenAI solution.
Redesign Job Roles Where Automation Will Have the Most Impact in the Workplace 
GenAI is already transforming job roles. Take the role of a customer service representative. A global retailer recently introduced a work buddy to answer nearly 50% of customer inquiries. But this did not translate into job losses among customer service representatives. Instead, nearly 8,000 of these customer service representatives were re-skilled as virtual interior design advisors. The global retailer now charges for this service, and it is a new source of revenue.
GenAI is in the early stages of experimentation at many companies. The first question leaders will deal with is, “Will GenAI lead to job loss?” But the far bigger question is how will companies adapt to GenAI which is becoming more intelligent, more functional, and more ubiquitous to how employees work each day. A leader’s answer to the impact on jobs needs to focus less on job loss and more on how jobs must be re-designed, as GenAI improves exponentially. Leaders must embrace GenAI, and build a “test and learn” culture, so workers know how GenAI can enhance their productivity and creativity.

The current technological scene of this century is evolving at a rapid pace, with AI being at the heart of these changes. This evolution has led to sweeping transformations in the workforce, which has raised a debate concerning what awaits job opportunities as AI and automation take hold. Even though some perceive AI as a threat to employment and job stability, others consider it an impetus for the creation of new jobs alongside increased efficiency. It is important to undertake a closer examination at the complex nature of AI and work, unraveling some details about what it might mean for individuals and establishing how businesses, politicians, professionals specifically can tap into.
While the development of AI has led to concerns over job losses, the fear of being replaced by technology is not a recent phenomenon. There have been numerous historical examples of these fears, such as the developments of the Industrial Revolution that indicate technology disruptions can cause damage to labor markets but following time lead to creation of new types for jobs and industries. On the other hand, AI poses a different type of problem because it is unprecedented in its speed and scope as well as cognitive abilities.
Over the last couple of years, AI technologies have begun to play a key role in several industries. In the industrial sector, AI-based robots and automation have redefined production lines in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This also encompasses the healthcare industry, where AI algorithms have assisted in diagnostics, treatment planning and patient care while in finance sector AI is used to gain risk appraisal, fraud detection and personalized financial services. These applications are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. AI technology can be applicable to almost every industry: autonomous vehicles relating to transportation and machine learning-based crop management systems for agriculture are just some examples of this (Table-1).
Table-1 AI Skills Demand

These sectors with AI integration have different effects on jobs. While some positions have been automated, new jobs that demand different competencies have emerged. Similarly, in manufacturing we see declining demand for manual routine tasks and increasing requirements of AI maintenance, supervision, and programming.
Job Concerns and New Opportunities
The implementation of AI across industries has caused growing concerns about job losses for positions that require structured and simple decision processes. Different jobs in sectors such as customer service, transportation, and simple data entry are more vulnerable to automation. For example, the introduction of self-driving technology may dramatically change responsibilities like that of taxi and truck drivers.  Several reports and studies have tried to measure the potential effects by AI and automation regarding jobs. For instance, a report from the World Economic Forum suggests that even though artificial intelligence and automation may result up to 75 million job displacement by 2025[4] but it is likely that around133million fresh roles could be created and the statistics will be different by 2030 as explain in Figure 1. Nevertheless, these estimates greatly differ depending on the sector of industries as well as region and environment.
Figure-1 Jobs at Risk by Automation (2030)

Job losses caused by AI is not purely an economic problem but is also a societal one. It is evident that job loses can have drastic social and societal consequences, of which some include rise in inequality, economic insecurity as well as other strings. Therefore, it is important for the policymakers and industry authorities to remember these aspects as they look into ways of ensuring that AI does not cause a harm but become useful in their applications.
Rather than causing unemployment to spread, AI is also a major employment generator. New job fields are also emerging, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence implementation and data analytics as well as cybersecurity and AI ethics. These roles are not only in the tech industry but extend to other industries that deploy AI for use. For instance, the healthcare industry has witnessed an increase in demand for AI technologists who can team up with medical personnel to enhance patient outcomes. In finance, AI has established positions for data scientists and compliance officers to translate its insights informed by the algorithmic information and make sure that these are in line with regulatory requirements. There is, therefore, an urgent need for education as well as training programs that are tailored towards matching the changing job market. These not only covers technical skills related to AI and data science but also soft skill such as adaptability, critical thinking, problem-solving.
The Skills Challenge and Ethical Issue
Since AI has begun changing the workplace, a gap forms between workers’ existing competencies and those they need to fulfill roles created due to automation. This skills gap is a big problem for job seekers and employers of labor who want to use AI in their activities. The strategies involved to fill this gap encompass reskilling and upskilling. This cover equipping the workers with applicable training and education that fulfils the job requirement in a job market dominated by AI. Thereby, securing job giving competitive advantage in AI driven market. For an illustration, employees should prioritize to learn digital literacy, AI programming and data analytics to compete technology demanding market criteria.
The ethical issues are arising in the professional environment with the use of AI. Concerns of privacy, discrimination in AI algorithms and who is responsible for the consequences of decisions driven by artificial intelligence are wrecking. For example, this concerns the endeavor to keep AI from generating new types of partiality or exacerbating those that already exist. The centrality of strong regulatory regimes to oversee the influence A.I will have on jobs and society. This includes policies regarding data privacy, AI safety and ethical use of AI in conjunction with working conditions under an increasingly automated workplace. Various countries are taking different approaches to AI governance. For instance, the European Union chose to come up with recommendations for ethical AI at an early stage while countries such as Japan work towards incorporating it in their roadmaps for economic development and societal welfare.
The Future outlook
AI in the future of work is not about human job replacement. AI can also respond to manual and monotonous duties making humans engage in creativeness activities or those involving strategic aspects. There are studies in various sectors, which demonstrate the advantages of AI-human cooperation. For instance, in the field of medicine, AI helps doctors to diagnose diseases and come up with proper treatment plans that improve patient outcomes. The future of work will be a more flexible one, full of dynamism and increased diversity; AI is thus going to play a critical role in accelerating productivity as well as innovation. Thus, adaptation and constant learning in combination with productive interaction with AI will be the basis for success of this new era.

LoginThe Workforce Summit Generative AI and chatbots that can answer questions much faster than managers and HR personnel are helping to slash workloads and free up executives for higher-value work, say several executives who have embraced the newest wave of automation.But companies are still divided on whether automation and the adoption of new AI technology will guarantee productivity and efficiency gains, arguing that human know-how, empathy, soft skills and critical reasoning are still needed to get the biggest benefit from technology. Amy Coleman, corporate vice president for human resources and corporate Functions at Microsoft.  Peter RaeGenerative AI would predominantly drive “task augmentation with a human in the loop, rather than outright job automation … at this stage of the technology’s development,” according to a major McKinsey report on the potential of the technology released at The Australian Financial Review Workforce summit on Monday.At Microsoft, an HR chatbot has helped the company eliminate more than 21,000 hours of work since its introduction about a year ago. For higher level questions which the bot can’t answer, an HR team member uses the bot in conjunction with their own intel to resolve the issue.“We’ve applied an AI bot to simple HR questions,” said Amy Coleman, corporate vice president, human resources and corporate functions, Microsoft. “We have HR service centres all over the world that would normally come in and ask you that.Advertisement“[If] I’m getting ready to go on maternity leave, what do I need to be doing [and] thinking? AI can help us answer a lot of those questions and then make the self-service better as well. So we’re finding a lot of productivity there.”It is a scenario that is also playing out inside global energy management giant Schneider Electric, which is trialling a similar bot to streamline HR processes by encouraging staff to direct questions on leave allocation or parental leave provisions and other issues to the company’s chatbot.“GPT will go straight through to Schneider’s policies and start prompting, ‘have you thought about other flexibility that you want to use through that policy? Do you want to access purchase leave? Here’s the process. Here’s a diagram,’” Schneider’s human resources vice president Justine Cooper said.McKinsey partner Seckin Ungur and IAG group executive Christine Stasi both say AI needs to be paired with human interaction and critical reasoning to deliver real value. Peter Rae“It becomes a much more connected experience than kind of diving through different policy documents.”The company is also using AI in an open talent pool, which encourages staff inside the business who are keen on a new role to hang out their shingle for an internal transition or promotion. The software can gauge the skills that are transferrable to other parts of the business and has already made links for staff their managers might have missed.AdvertisementIn one instance, the open talent pool found an employee in the marketing division who was keen on a change and had the necessary skills for a more senior role in the HR team. The platform then found he had the required skills to make a jump into management strategy.Inside private hospital operator Healthscope, artificial intelligence is being used to improve rostering by predicting attendance out to a timeframe of 10 weeks.Greg Horan, CEO, Healthscope says AI is being used to help rostering. Peter Rae“We can get an idea of what that demand looks like, so that we can optimise our rostering to get the right person, at the right time, the right care, and the right the way through to the 72-hour window to ensure that again … our workforce is at the right time, right place, right cost as well,” chief executive Greg Horan said.Meanwhile, insurance giant IAG is using generative AI to streamline and expedite its claims handling processes across all categories of assets.The company has been able to cut down the assessment time on total write-offs from 15 days to five days, while also drastically reducing the number of times a claims officer had to contact the customer, from six times to one.AdvertisementDuring mass flooding in New Zealand in 2023, which generated more than 48,000 claims, the company devised a robotic process to glean the data needed to make an assessment, which then freed up claims handlers to spend more time offering support to traumatised customers on the phone.The result was a more than 700 per cent increase in IAG’s ability to process large claims, jumping from 500 a day to 150 an hour, IAG group executive Christine Stasi said.The outcome has been a workforce it is upskilling and reskilling to help customers one on one, Ms Stasi said. “We started training our claims consultants more on empathy-based service, identifying customers who were facing personal trauma,” she said.Inside the Productivity Commission, take-up of the new technology is happening at a more cautious pace even if staff can immediately see where AI could help, chairwoman Danielle Wood said.One possible application could include using AI to distil or summarise the hundreds of submissions the commission receives on a single inquiry. The technology could also be used to help the public find specific answers quickly on the commission’s website, which includes reports that can span hundreds of pages.“You can imagine the benefits of using AI to distil and pull out key themes – it would be really powerful. We also are quite famous for producing very long reports, so we were thinking of AI chatbots on the website that allow people to ask questions and interrogate those reports without necessarily having to digest five 500 pages,” Ms Wood said.Advertisement“There are lots of ways in professional life ... which can really transform the way we operate.” RelatedAI shock: Tech companies axe 34,000 since start of yearRelatedMeet ChatPwC, the custom-built AI tool being rolled out at the firmRelatedCBA claims AI is already making it work 30pc betterSamantha Hutchinson is the AFR's National Reporter.

		Code generation and copilots are just the beginning of new AI-enabled ways to develop, test, deploy, and maintain software. 	




 









Coding in the ’90s usually meant selecting an editor, checking code into CVS or SVN code repositories, and then compiling code into executables. Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse and Visual Studio improved productivity by including coding, development, documentation, building, testing, deploying, and other steps in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Cloud computing and DevSecOps automation tools brought in the next wave of developer capabilities, making it easier for more organizations to develop, deploy, and maintain applications.  
Generative AI is the catalyst for the next paradigm shift, promising to change how organizations create and maintain software as well as enabling new development tools and paradigms. The question for many developers and IT leaders is whether AI means the demise of coding as we know it. A related question is how it will affect the evolution of SDLC and DevSecOps over the next decade. With these two questions in mind, I went searching for ideas and predictions.
Is genAI a new tool or a new way of developing? 
“I am a big believer in code, and I have seen many people bet against code in my 25-year career, and they have always lost,” says Joe Duffy, CEO of Pulumi. “AI will automate and augment coding, not replace it, thereby raising the level of abstraction that we humans operate at, considerably accelerating productivity and output.”











 
 
 
That’s one viewpoint. To consider others, I went back to the classics.

In Frederick Brooks’ classic book on software development, The Mythical Man-Month, he shares a study on software development productivity showing “the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements.” In the 20th anniversary edition of the book published in 1995, he republishes the 1986 article, “No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering,” which predicted that “a decade would not see any programming technique that would by itself bring an order-of-magnitude improvement in software productivity.
We don’t know yet whether copilots and other generative AI coding capabilities will exceed these benchmarks.











 
 
 
“The software delivery lifecycle is getting disrupted by generative AI,” says Ashish Kakran, principal of Thomvest Ventures. “Dev and devops teams will become more productive with a higher percentage of team members potentially achieving outputs similar to those of 10x engineers”.
That productivity gain and democratizing the software development skill set may be possible as genAI capabilities mature and developers realign their responsibilities. “Copilots in their current form are really about developer productivity and removing that busy work,” says Ed Thompson, CTO of Matillion. “Those who assume that copilots have already fundamentally changed the job are working on the incorrect assumption that a developer’s job is to write code—it’s to solve problems.”
10 ways generative AI will transform software development
How will generative AI transform software development over the next decade? Here are 10 predictions:











 
 
 

Generating code from natural language prompts is the standard
Code validation is a critical developer responsibility
Manufacturing as the new development paradigm
Less coding, but greater code supply-chain risks
New paradigms accelerate integration
Developers manage AI agents
AI touches multiple phases of the SDLC
GenAI and human development personas emerge
AI improves ops capabilities in dev processes
Organizations must protect themselves from AI risks

Generating code from natural language prompts is the standard
Kaxil Naik, director of Airflow engineering at Astronomer, says, “Coding will become more efficient with AI-generated boilerplate code and AI-assisted copilots translating natural language into functional code, simplifying the understanding of complex codebases and ensuring adherence to best practices.”
StackOverflow’s 2023 developer survey shows that 70% of developers are using or are planning to use AI tools in their development process. Of those already using AI in development, over 82% use it to write code. These numbers suggest a paradigm shift in how developers will develop code, reuse existing code, and build components.
Code validation is a critical developer responsibility
The ability to prompt for code adds risks if the code generated has security issues, defects, or introduces performance issues. The hope is that if coding is easier and faster, developers will have more time, responsibility, and better tools for validating the code before it gets embedded in applications. But will that happen?











 
 
 
“As developers adopt AI for productivity benefits, there’s a required responsibility to gut-check what it produces,” says Peter McKee, head of developer relations at Sonar. “Clean as you code ensures that by performing checks and continuous monitoring during the delivery process, developers can spend more time on new tasks rather than remediating bugs in human-created or AI-generated code.”
CIOs and CISOs will expect developers to perform more code validation, especially if AI-generated code introduces significant vulnerabilities. “If developers don’t implement automation to scan and monitor AI-generated code, it means exponentially more code to fix and more tech debt,” adds McKee.
Manufacturing as the new development paradigm
One question about using Gen-AI tools to develop code is how it will impact tools and standards at large organizations with many development teams supporting thousands of applications. What will development look like in larger organizations if developers write less code but integrate more genAI-developed code?











 
 
 
“The tooling mix across teams results in a lack of standards and complex onboarding, not to mention that it adds to the cognitive load of developers,” says Markus Eisele, developer tools strategy and evangelism at Red Hat. “A blend of best practices combined with easy access through centralized developer portals is here to change this. Topped with the enriched capabilities of an application platform, this has the potential to remove friction and help with applying best practices across team boundaries.”
The implication is that IDEs may morph into assembly platforms similar to computer-aided design (CAD) in manufacturing or building information modeling (BIM) in construction. The focus shifts from building custom components to assembling preexisting ones and leveraging built-in tools to validate the design. 
Less coding, but greater code supply-chain risks
Another implication of code developed with genAI concerns how enterprise leaders develop policies and monitor the supply chain of what code is embedded in enterprise applications. Until now, organizations were most concerned about tracking open source and commercial software components, but genAI adds new dimensions.











 
 
 
“Devops practitioners will play a major role in maintaining and managing the AI supply chain: the security, authenticity, and origins of AI-based models will come under more scrutiny in an enterprise’s day-to-day operations,” says Ilkka Turunen, Field CTO of Sonatype. “Implementing a strategy that evaluates AI risk and properly manages an AI model’s bill of materials will help ensure proper AI hygiene and management across the devops infrastructure of any organization.”
Expect SAST, DAST, and other security and code management tools to increase code-scanning automation capabilities and help validate whether genAI code meets policies before developers integrate code into enterprise repositories.
New paradigms accelerate integration
Developers can expect new capabilities in integrations, which have already seen orders of magnitude of improved capabilities over the last decade through APIs, IFTTT SaaS integration platforms, integration platforms as a service (iPaaS), and other ecosystem technologies. That said, developers still perform much work to map data fields, code transformation logic, ensure reliability, and adjust for performance considerations.











 
 
 
Emmanuel Cassimatis, AI and Innovation team at SAP, says, “When it comes to integration, the development lifecycle has historically been quite fragmented across its different steps, from design, build, test, integrate, deploy, deliver, and review. AI can allow unification by tapping a picture from data from different applications, resulting in greater collaboration between developers.” 
It’s only a matter of time before developers use genAI to build codeless, self-healing integrations with natural language requirements and auto-generated visual flows.
Developers as managers of AI agents
Phillip Carter, principal product manager at Honeycomb, believes that genAI will transform the tasks developers and quality assurance engineers will do in the future. “In the potentially far future, natural language is likely to guide more code generation and tests that verify generated code. If we see another massive shift in AI capabilities like the transformer, we can expect AI agents to do most of this work, with developers programming goals and constraints for these agents to follow.”











 
 
 
Carter continues with a bold prediction, saying, “With a new transformation that puts AI at the helm, it’s possible that programmed agents could be enabled to analyze runtime behavior for QA, observability, and security tasks to check known unknowns, something developers are often bogged down by.”
I find this prediction interesting, as it implies developers and engineers will move up the stack to define architecture, non-functional, and operational requirements—guiding genAI on developing and testing rather than writing code and automating tests.
Carter doesn’t believe in a developer-less future and continues, “Humans would remain in the loop at all times, concerned more with goals, constraints, and analyzing unique circumstances.”











 
 
 
AI touches multiple phases of the SDLC
While copilots and many genAI tools today focus on coding, expect new capabilities to transform other phases and responsibilities in the SDLC. Humberto Moreira, principal solutions engineer at Gigster, says, “As best practices evolve for incorporating genAI into the SDLC, different models might work best for particular phases of the cycle, for example, one model optimized for requirements, one for code development, and one for QA.”
The genAI paradigm shift is already impacting QA as tools enable more robust test cases and faster feedback on code changes,
“With the rise of AI, I think a less discussed aspect is how all the facilities around coding will witness a sea change,” says Gilad Shriki, co-founder of Descope. “It’s a matter of time before SDKs, testing, and documentation are AI-generated or assisted, which means developers will need to code and document their work in specific AI-consumable formats.”











 
 
 
Shriki’s last prediction suggests that developers may have to adjust their language, similar to how people must learn to speak the language that virtual assistants are programmed to comprehend. I hope this prediction doesn’t become a reality because it could mean that genAI only delivers conveniences and not necessarily productivity or quality improvements.
GenAI and human development personas emerge
GenAI’s role in software development could splinter off from the roles and responsibilities currently held by human developers. Tools like code generators, compilers, and other dev tools would serve both human and machine personas.

“What’s interesting is that I think there might end up being a new view of code: one view is that traditional human view of code, the one that developers are trained and accustomed to reading and writing, but then there’s a second, somewhat hidden view, which is the AI-security-optimized, defensive view,” says Dustin Kirkland, VP of engineering at Chainguard. “This view is less readable by humans but perfectly readable by compilers and interpreters, and in this way, it becomes just another intermediate format for code.”











 
 
 
The question is whether alternative views will improve machine learning’s ability to identify defects, security issues, and other problems more accurately and efficiently.
AI improves ops capabilities during the dev process
Cody De Arkland, director of developer experience at LaunchDarkly, suggests use cases when genAI can help improve application reliability and operations. “We can see the early signs of how dev tooling will learn from interactions, and the key will be intuitive assistance.”
De Arkland suggests these examples:











 
 
 

Develop web application components that match the learned design standards
Create the feature flag as it detects a developer building a new feature
Stage new software deployment (CI/CD), but also roll it back when it learns of problems
Enable real-time feedback loops to QA from customized runs instead of post-deployment

These ideas raise the question of what next-gen devops and SRE capabilities will be enabled or augmented by genAI. 
Organizations must protect themselves from AI risks
One last prediction concerns the risks of exposing genAI to the organization’s intellectual property, including code and data. As genAI enables new capabilities across the full SDLC, there will be new questions about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.
“As we work toward the vision of an end-to-end AI-enabled software development process, technology professionals across the board want to ensure that any code generated is of the highest quality and does not hurt the overall reliability or maintainability of the application,” says Brandon Jung, VP of ecosystem and business development at Tabnine. “With a keen eye on the data going into the model—both yours and the training set—take the time and effort to evaluate, select, and deploy AI in ways that protect your policies and your most valuable assets–your code and your data.”
The question is whether genAI algorithms and the tools that enable them will build safeguards to protect the enterprise’s assets and how much these protections will also rely on genAI capabilities.











 
 
 
While we’re still early in the genAI era of software development, it’s becoming clear that code generation and copilots are just the beginning of new AI-enabled ways to develop, test, deploy, and maintain software.

        Where human intuition fits amidst the growth of generative AI at work

The uniquely human strengths of your team's Detectives 


Generative AI tools may become near ubiquitous in the way we work over the next few years, but new global research into common workplace personas – which found that nearly one in three Australian workers consider themselves to be ‘Detectives’ who prefer to find things out for themselves – suggests that humans aren’t quite ready to give up their roles as authoritative founts of wisdom and information.







The research – conducted by productivity platform Slack and market research firm YouGov – polled 15,492 desk workers worldwide to better understand the diversity of psychological traits in contemporary workplaces. Thirty-one per cent of the 1014 Australian respondents to the survey said that they best match ‘The Detective’ workplace persona, which is characterised by a burning personal curiosity to find the information they need rather than having it presented to them.
The study identified five distinct workplace personas, with Detectives working alongside ‘Road Warriors’, ‘Networkers’, ‘Problem Solvers’, and ‘Expressionists’ that run the gamut of individual working styles and information processing preferences.
Detectives – who are more common in western countries such as France (38% of respondents), the UK (34%) and US (33%), but less common in Singapore (21%) and India (16%) – were found to be far more likely to value finding the right information as quickly as possible, and sharing that information with others on their team.
Over half (53%) of Detectives said they were driven by a sense of purpose and job security, describing themselves as organised with a preference for figuring things out on their own. They are also most likely to be described by their colleagues as good at digging up information and knowing everything that’s going on at the company.
This is one of the reasons Detectives are so valuable to their teammates, says Slack APAC technology evangelist at Salesforce, Derek Laney, even amidst the emergence of generative AI-powered bots.
""My experience at work is that people like to connect with each other to find the answers to their pressing questions,"" Laney told iTnews. ""This is why we see the importance of The Detective in teams. This persona has a really good understanding of where knowledge lies and how to access it, and a productivity platform like Slack is purpose-built for that.” 
“Having the ability to find answers quickly and help others connect with that information easily is paramount - whether that’s via generative AI tools or through human action. But that approach shouldn’t be limited to The Detective persona alone. Building a culture within teams where people are encouraged to find the answer first before asking someone else is going to inherently boost your productivity.""
The power of intuition
With Gartner predicting that over 80% of enterprises will have deployed generative AI by 2026, desk workers are likely to increasingly look to those tools for answers rather than their colleagues.
Generative AI models are being trained on small data sets specific to one business or industry, theoretically making them more accurate and less prone to ‘hallucinations’ that have tainted their reputations as reliable sources of fact to date.
Law firm MinterEllison, for one, recently adopted a generative AI platform that is already being credited with saving up to five hours per day for half of those who have trialled it.
Such platforms will progressively be integrated with online collaboration platforms, putting more accurate answers at the fingertips of everybody in the team.
That’s likely to help many team members stop reinventing the proverbial wheel: “things go round and round in meetings because we’re not that great at capturing and reusing tacit information,” Laney said, noting that collaboration tools “are capturing more of this tacit work information and helping you synthesise that.”
Aiming to provide a range of ways for teams to engage, Slack has rolled out a broad range of collaboration tools that facilitate different types of communication – with features like huddles, clips, canvas and Slack Connect – complementing information services like Slack Atlas, and business process tools, such as Workflow Builder alongside over 2,600 app integrations.
Yet no matter how much new technology is adopted, and how quickly generative AI takes hold in the workplace, Laney warns that it’s premature to dismiss the humanistic elements, highlighting that Detectives will still be valued members of the team.
Many core information retrieval functions may be enhanced by generative AI tools, Laney said, but “not all things are going to be, or should be, automated.”
“Humans are really good at saying ‘I don’t feel quite right about that, although I don’t know why’,” he explained, highlighting the value of humans’ ability to “make non rational linkages between information. Neuroscientist Antonio Domasio said that we are not thinking machines that feel; rather, we are feeling machines that think.”
“That’s intuition, and that’s the brain doing its magic thing – and in partnership with AI you can start to use explorative tools to build out that intuition, and to say ‘Maybe that’s the answer that I’m looking for to validate what the brain is telling me.’”

Business leaders in the United States have revealed that they are more satisfied with their jobs thanks to artificial intelligence, according to a new report.
Tech.co's survey among 1,047 business leade3rs found tat 59% who are using AI in their roles said it has improved their job satisfaction.
Another 30% of the respondents said AI has had a ""strong"" or ""significant"" impact on their work processes.









The findings come amid recent research that only 22% of employees across the world are satisfied with their jobs in 2023.
According to Tech.co, their new findings suggest that ""artificial intelligence could be the key to increasing the amount of gratification employees receive from their job in 2024.""
Easily accessible AI tools
Aaron Drapkin, Tech.co's lead writer and AI expert, attributed AI's impact to its easily accessible nature.
""ChatGPT and co. wouldn't be impacting job satisfaction in quite the same way if they were more complicated to configure, cost lots of money, or became so intelligent that they rendered workers redundant,"" Drapkin said in a statement.

He noted that while it may cause major economic change in the future, its current capacity to support employees now makes it a ""significant net benefit"" for most workplaces.
""Right now, we're living in a proverbial sweet spot. The tools are free, easy to use and not powerful enough to work independently and replace the humans using them,"" he said.
""This is great - but none of these things are absolutes. AI clearly has the capacity to completely transform how we work - but ensuring this transformation continues to be gradual, manageable and beneficial will be no easy task.""
Uses of AI at work
According to the report, the top uses of AI in their workplace are data analysis (32%) and writing tasks (26%). Other uses include:










Scheduling and calendar management (21%)
Automated data entry (20%)
Quality control (20%)
Cybersecurity (20%)
Running customer support chatbots (19%)
Design tasks (19%)
Document classification and management (17%)
Inventory management (16%)

Drapkin said this shows how freely available AI tools are helping with a huge range of tasks, especially ones that employees find repetitive, boring, and time-consuming.
""We've never had tools this capable at our fingertips before, and the data suggests it's making a tangible difference to the lives of people using them,"" Drapkin said.

Artificial intelligence is beginning to impact jobs and policies within universities as adoption of the technology grows, a new study finds.
More than half (56 percent) of those surveyed said they have new responsibilities related to AI strategy, according to Educause, a nonprofit focused on education and technology. Most of those experiencing the change are executives (69 percent), followed by managers and directors (66 percent), staff (46 percent), and faculty members (39 percent).
“Above and beyond the other risks [with AI], the risk to our workforce is they’re already overworked and now we’re asking them to do extra things,” said Jenay Robert, a senior Educause researcher. She cautioned against adding more responsibilities without changes in job titles or descriptions.

“It’s an important finding in terms of supporting the workforce,” she said. “Codify the role in people’s jobs so they know what to expect.”
Educause’s first “AI Landscape Study” focuses on the impact of the increasingly pervasive technology. The study polled 910 people who work at universities, surveying them in November and December. 
Its findings delved into new topics: namely, how—or if—AI is shaking up faculty members’ jobs, both in the work they are doing and how they use the technology.

“When October, November was rolling around, there was a shift where AI wasn’t a brand-new hot topic, but people were settling in, having job roles dedicated to it,” Robert said.
Few of the respondents were aware of new jobs being created because of AI, with only 11 percent stating they knew of new job creation. New jobs that were created included chief AI officer, senior AI adviser, chief data scientist and AI program manager.
The survey also touched on AI policies, which have been discussed but often remain murky for academics. Nearly half of respondents were not happy with the AI policies their university had in place, with 48 percent stating those policies did not address ethical and effective decision-making. About 20 percent of respondents said their AI-related policies were somewhat or extremely restrictive, in some cases banning students or faculty from using AI tools.

Of the universities making AI policies, nearly half of institutions (43 percent) are working with a third party to develop AI strategy, while 30 percent are working with peer institutions or networks and 22 percent are working with professional associations.
The largest focus of the newly created or altered policies is on teaching and learning (95 percent). Academic integrity falls in that category, according to respondents, with 72 percent saying their academic integrity policies have been impacted by AI. Policies related to technology, cybersecurity and data privacy were also affected.
Only 11 percent of respondents said that no one at their institution is working on AI-related strategy, with 73 percent stating “some or most” departments are working on some sort of AI strategy.

Despite the work on policies, Robert said there needs to be more communication across the walls often created in academia.
“I think the take-home message is if folks are not sure they can use the technology or know the risks, to reach across the silos and talk to people in privacy, security and IT departments and see what already exists,” she said. “And as the use cases bubble up [from faculty and staff], it’ll help leaders figure out what new policies or guidelines need to be created.”
Most of the policymaking, according to the survey, is due to fears that students are using AI for “inappropriate” purposes, with 68 percent of respondents stating that as a concern.
There’s also a focus on preparing students for the workforce, with 64 percent of respondents calling that their biggest goal. Only 25 percent planned on using AI adoption for research purposes, and just 17 percent viewed AI adoption as a way to boost the institution’s reputation.
Despite the growing focus on AI, there is still a lack of formalized training at institutions: only 56 percent of universities train their faculty members in AI, with the numbers dipping for staff (49 percent) and students (39 percent). There’s also a lack of long-term focus and goals, according to the report, which found only 7 percent of institutions are working to establish AI-focused senior leadership positions and just 14 percent are budgeting for long-term AI costs.
Consistent with many other recent surveys, the Educause study also found that generally there is cautious optimism about AI among faculty, an acknowledgment that AI must to be taught to students and ever-present concerns about academic integrity.

At the beginning of the school year, each of my 11th grade teachers stated that they would not tolerate students using AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. They explained that any use of AI would be considered plagiarism and could result in a failing grade.
Despite these warnings, I regularly hear my classmates laugh about how they used ChatGPT for the prior night’s homework. Their gloats are often accompanied by comments along the lines of “Work smarter, not harder” and “Teachers literally make it so easy to use AI.”
My classmates at the public high school I attend in New York City are not unusual: In a recent survey, 89 percent of students who responded said they had used ChatGPT for homework.
 
 

It’s easy for teachers to admonish students not to use ChatGPT and then blame them when they do. But educators must realize that the work they are assigning, which largely relies on rote memorization, is a perfect fit for artificial intelligence.
Rather than browbeat students for using AI, maybe educators should outsmart AI by reimagining education so that it requires more creativity and critical thought, the aspects that separate people from robots.

Since third grade, I have been taking standardized tests. Now that I’m older, these include Regents exams, New York State tests and Advanced Placement assessments. My teachers say that our scores on these tests are a reflection of our academic proficiency, as well as a predictor of our future academic and professional success.
Yet, in my experience, all standardized tests do is reduce nearly every class, even the most interesting, to regurgitation.
Take AP Psychology. I signed up for this class because I am fascinated by the subject, especially the philosophical and open-ended aspects that require thoughtful discussion and analysis. But rather than encouraging us to engage with psychology’s intellectual premises, the class requires us to memorize roughly 400 terms.
 
 

If I can remember each term and its definition, I will have set myself up for success in the class and on the final AP exam.
Sounds fascinating and enlightening, right? Not to me. Unfortunately, this is the current state of education. Exams and teaching to the test have become so ingrained in education that little to no room is left for creative learning, rich discussion, critical thought or the development of emotional intelligence.
These are the very skills and activities that separate people from robots, yet instead of developing them, students are told to act like robots and simply spit back information on exams.
Ironically, AI is, of course, much better at being a robot than a typical student is; systems like ChatGPT can access and spit back large swaths of information better than any person.
Thus, it is no surprise that GPT-4 clocks high scores on the bar exam, SAT and multiple AP exams, including a 5 (the highest possible score) on AP Psychology.
These results show that the modern student is susceptible to AI takeover. If educators wish to effectively prevent AI from entering classrooms, they must reimagine the way students are taught.
 
 

Rethinking education in America should include a move away from teaching to the test and a push toward project-based learning, which encourages students to collaborate, examine and analyze real-world issues and apply scientific research to solve problems.

This approach might even drive test scores higher. A 2021 study estimated that students whose curricula included KIA, a project-based learning approach, would be 8 percent more likely to earn a passing score on AP exams.
While project-based learning may help lift standardized test scores, its real power lies in improving problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. These skills are vital for current students who are preparing for a world with AI.
According to one report, AI could eventually replace 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. The jobs that AI is currently unlikely to be able to replace are the ones that require problem-solving and critical thinking, as well as those that require complex communication, decision-making, creativity and emotional intelligence.
Education is a means to getting a job and being successful. Simply put, for my generation and future generations to succeed, we are going to need much more than rote memorization skills. The good news is that the skills we need are the ones that make learning fun, challenging and exciting.
We are at a crossroads. Educators, policymakers and everyone with an interest in the future of work has a decision to make: They can either continue supporting an education system that teaches students to think in ways that AI can clearly do better, or they can decide to reform education to prepare students for the not-to-distant world of the future.

Sure, AI tools are becoming more common, but generally they are some way from automating entire roles.A real estate agent might use ChatGPT to write a property listing, but AI can't yet open the door of the house.Still, there are a few professions that are already feeling the bite — and the experiences of these workers may be a helpful insight into what's to come for those who aren't yet affected.Copywriters, and in particular freelance copywriters, are seeing large parts of their work automated, and their labour devalued.They're now adapting by learning new AI skills and specialising in the types of work the bots are currently bad at.So, are these copywriters the canaries in the coal mine for AI-led automation?Here's what they have to say about the future of work.An AI tool crashes through a professionLast year, not long after the launch of ChatGPT, Leanne Shelton braced herself for turbulent times.The Sydney-based copywriter, who'd built up her freelance business over nine years, knew that change was coming.And she knew that freelancers, who were less insulated from market shocks than permanent employees, were going to feel the impact first.For Ms Shelton, business soon started drying up.""Clients were like, 'There's this free tool. Why would we invest $2,000 for copywriting when we can get something for free?'""Tim King, a Bendigo-based copywriter, experienced the same.""I saw a 45 per cent reduction in overall lead generation,"" he said. Bendigo-based copywriter and marketing strategist Tim King.(Supplied: Tim King)Lindsay, a copywriter in Sydney, was made redundant at a cybersecurity firm.""They wanted to save costs and so they cut my role,"" she said.""They thought the executives could write their own content using ChatGPT.""Looking for employment, she was alarmed by how far salaries in her line of work, and at her level of experience, had fallen.""A job that would have been mid-management level on $120,000 plus super is now around $90,000.""Tanya Abdul Jalil, a freelance education writer, has colleagues ""desperately scratching"" for work.""Especially the ones whose blogs are their bread and butter,"" she said.""Something that used to take four to five hours and get them a full day's pay can be produced in minutes.""WatchDuration: 6 minutes 42 seconds6m  Expert reveals top occupations affected by the introduction of AI.Perth-based copywriter Kara Stokes sees many in her profession left with a simple choice: adapt or get out.""It’s like Blockbuster Video,"" she said.""They didn't adapt and we saw what happened there.""The problem of measuring AI's effects on employmentIf AI is already having such a dramatic impact on copywriters, how is this reflected in their workforce statistics?The short answer is that it's not. Or at least not yet, experts say.""Workforce statistics always lag reality, right?"" Kylie Walker, CEO of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE), said.""But when you're hearing the same stories arising in multiple places, then it's time to start listening.""Measuring how AI affects employment in general is a problem for economists.This is partly due to a lack of data. Employers may not be transparent about why they're laying off workers or cutting hours.The effect of an AI tool that augments an existing role, rather than replacing it, may not show in employment figures either. Copywriter Zoe Simmons says she's noticed a lot of adverts for jobs editing AI content.(Supplied: Emma Veness)But some studies can detect recent trends.Around midway through last year, three US economists studied jobs and earnings data for copywriters and graphic designers on major online freelancing platforms.They chose freelancers partly because they were most exposed to the repercussions of AI automation, one of the economists, Washington University's Oren Reshef, said.""Freelancers are generally less protected from adverse market shocks compared to more standard employment.""And at the current state of the technology, I believe AI is much better able to replace specific, well-designed tasks, like a short freelance project.""That is, freelancers don't have much job security, and their work is more likely to consist of short, well-defined tasks, which makes it easier to feed this work to AI.The Australian jobs being lost to AI under the radarAustralians are already losing work to AI, but the impact so far has been largely hidden from view. But not to people like Benjamin, whose job was replaced by a chatbot. Read moreThe results of the study were published as a non-peer-reviewed working paper in August.They showed within a few months of ChatGPT's launch, copywriters and graphic designers saw a significant drop in the number of jobs they got and even steeper declines in earnings.And when they dug deeper into the data, the economists found an interesting trend.Being a more skilled freelancer was no defence against loss of work or earnings. This may seem counter-intuitive at first, Dr Reshef said, ""but it makes a lot of sense on second thought"".""Who do we expect to benefit the most from a new technology that improves the quality of your work or your output? Probably those that didn't do a great job to begin with.""Simply put, AI helps level the playing field across all workers.""Automation doesn't mean mass unemployment Freelance education writer Tanya Abdul Jalil has dodged the negative impact of AI by focusing on marketing and business coaching.(Supplied: Tanya Abdul Jalil)Just as less experienced copywriters might earn more by generating and editing AI content, an experienced copywriter who once earned a decent wage may be paid less to do the same job.Mr King, the Bendigo-based copywriter, has noticed this trend.""AI has lowered the bar and increased the ability for [non-copywriters] to generate content,"" he said.""Our creative services as a whole have been devalued.""But there's a risk of generalising too much from short-term data like those used in last year's freelancer study, said Xiang Hui, also from Washington University and a co-author of the working paper.Technology changes, but so do people. AI may improve and be able to automate a higher proportion of existing roles, but people adapt. They learn new skills and apply for new kinds of jobs.Dr Hui said it's hard to predict what will happen in the long run.""The technology improves and its capability to replace certain jobs gets better.""But workers increasingly adopt these new technologies, and the nature of jobs and skills they require may also change over time.""Late last year, ATSE announced that AI could automate 25 to 46 per cent of existing Australian jobs by 2030.But automation doesn't equal unemployment, Ms Walker, ATSE CEO, said.""There will be a shift in where the employment occurs, and in what people are employed for.""Jobs will be there. They just may not be the jobs that we intimately know today.""Copywriters are adapting to AISo what can copywriters teach us about adapting to AI?Having seen the writing on the wall, Ms Shelton, the Sydney-based copywriter, swiftly pivoted to AI coaching last year.She now earns more from teaching people how to use generative AI tools than she does from copywriting.""I pretty much started listening to podcasts and reading books about AI,"" she said.""[When] 150 people registered for the first webinar, I realised I was onto something."" The AI chatbot ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022, amassing 100 million users within a couple of months.(ABC News: Gian De Poloni)Zoe Simmons, who has physical and mental disabilities, said her type of writing — focusing on her experience of disabilities — meant she'd avoided the downturn.""Thankfully lived experience is something a robot or AI cannot do,"" she said.Mr King has rebranded as a marketing strategist, advising clients on how to promote their product, rather than just writing copy.And when he does write copy, he uses AI.""For me, it's a tool that I use to infinitely speed up my processes. ""Potentially AI will take your job but at the end of the day it means we can shift into higher value work.""Whether or not AI means workers end up doing less of the drudge work, early studies show it can boost the efficiency of ""knowledge workers"" (such as analysts, engineers, and accountants) at some tasks.In a recent Harvard Business School study, employees at Boston Consulting Group were randomly assigned access to GPT-4, OpenAI's latest large language model. Those using AI completed 12.2 per cent more tasks while doing them 25.1 per cent faster. They also produced higher quality work compared to those not using AI.As with the freelancer study, the least-skilled workers benefited the most from AI.""People in the lower half of that distribution had a much larger productivity bump,"" Edward McFowland, co-author of the Harvard study, said at the time.""But on average, everyone seems to do better.”AI can be helpful, but sometimes notThese findings may sound simple enough, but there's one big catch that has implications for how AI may be used to automate office work.When the Boston Consulting Group consultants were given tasks beyond a certain threshold of complexity and nuance, those who used AI did worse.How Australians are already using ChatGPTFrom consulting ChatGPT for relationship advice to asking it to write a love poem on behalf of your dog, here are stories of the novel and unexpected ways Australians have been using generative AI.Read moreThat is, AI isn't always helpful.Sometimes, it makes workers worse at their jobs.And it gets still more complicated. Some AI-assisted consultants bucked the trend and did better at the more complex tasks than those not using AI.The researchers' conclusion may be heartening for any white-collar worker concerned that a wave of automation will sweep them out of the office. AI use should be tightly supervised and — at least for now — reserved for a narrow range of tasks, Dr McFowland said.""Companies cannot simply ignore these tools, because they have tremendous value that their competitors will be exploiting,"" he said.""However, turning them loose on all use cases can have an array of detrimental consequences.""Has the impact of AI been overstated?Companies that ditched their copywriters may be experiencing the ""detrimental consequences"" of having too much faith in AI, according to those same copywriters.Freelancers report old clients getting back in touch and admitting the bot's copy wasn't up to scratch.""It has a very Americanised tone, the grammar is all off, and the sentiment is a bit strange as well,"" Mr King said.""I've noticed a swing back to copywriters.""An MIT study published last month suggested AI won't replace as many jobs as predicted by studies in 2023.Jobs previously identified as being at risk of AI displacement weren't currently ""economically beneficial"" to automate.ABC Science on YouTubeWant more science — plus health, environment, tech and more?

Quick LinksWhat Is AI Poisoning?   How to Use Nightshade      

Key Takeaways


 Nightshade is an AI tool that ""poisons"" digital art, making it unusable for training AI models. 
 The tool alters digital artwork in a way that appears unchanged to humans but confuses AI algorithms. 
 Nightshade provides a way for digital creators to protect their work from being used in AI datasets without consent. 









 AI tools are revolutionary and can now hold conversations, generate human-like text, and create images based on a single word. However, the training data these AI tools use often comes from copyrighted sources, especially when it comes to text-to-image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, and others. 

 Stopping generative AI tools using copyright images to train is difficult, and artists from all walks of life have struggled to protect their work from AI training datasets. But now, that's all changing with the advent of Nightshade, a free AI tool built to poison the output of generative AI tools—and finally let artists take some power back. 


 What Is AI Poisoning? 
 AI poisoning is the act of ""poisoning"" the training dataset of an AI algorithm. This is similar to providing wrong information to the AI on purpose, resulting in the trained AI malfunctioning or failing to detect an image. Tools like Nightshade alter the pixels in a digital image in such a manner that it appears to be completely different to the AI training on it, but largely unchanged from the original to the human eye. 





 Thongden Studio/Shutterstock   

 For example, if you upload a poisoned image of a car to the internet, it will look the same to us humans, but an AI attempting to train itself to identify cars by looking at images of cars on the internet will see something completely different. 

 A large enough sample size of these fake or poisoned images in an AI's training data can damage its ability to generate accurate images from a given prompt as the AI's understanding of the object is compromised. 

 There are still a few questions on what the future holds for Generative AI, but protecting original digital work is a definite priority. This can even damage future iterations of the model as the training data upon which the model's foundation is built isn't 100% correct. 





 Using this technique, digital creators who do not consent for their images to be used in AI datasets can protect them from being fed to generative AI without permission. Some platforms provide creators the option to opt out of including their artwork in AI training datasets. However, such opt-out lists have been disregarded by AI model trainers in the past and continue to be disregarded with little to no consequence. 

 Compared to other digital artwork protection tools like Glaze, Nightshade is offensive. Glaze prevents AI algorithms from mimicking the style of a particular image, while Nightshade changes the image's appearance to the AI. Both tools are built by Ben Zhao, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. 



 How to Use Nightshade 
 While the creator of the tool recommends Nightshade be used alongside Glaze, it can also be used as a standalone tool to protect your artwork. Using the tool is also fairly easy, considering there are only three steps to protecting your images with Nightshade. 





 However, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before getting started. 
 Nightshade is only available for Windows and MacOS with limited GPU support and a minimum of 4GB VRAM required. Non-Nvidia GPUs and Intel Macs aren't supported at the moment. Here's a list of supported Nvidia GPUs according to the Nightshade team (the GTX and RTX GPUs are found in the ""CUDA-Enabled GeForce and TITAN Products"" section). Alternatively, you can run Nightshade on your CPU, but it'll result in slower performance.  If you have a GTX 1660, 1650, or 1550, a bug in the PyTorch library can prevent you from launching or using Nightshade properly. The team behind Nightshade may fix it in the future by moving from PyTorch to Tensorflow, but there are no workarounds at the moment. The issue also extends to the Ti variants of these cards. I launched the program by providing administrator access on my Windows 11 PC and waiting a few minutes for it to open. Your mileage may vary.  If your artwork has lots of solid shapes or backgrounds, you may experience some artifacts. This can be countered by using a lower intensity of ""poisoning.""  





 As far as protecting your images with Nightshade goes, here's what you need to do. Keep in mind that this guide uses the Windows version, but these steps also apply to the macOS version. 

 Download the Windows or macOS version from the Nightshade download page.  Nightshade downloads as an archived folder with no installation required. Once the download is complete, extract the ZIP folder and double-click Nightshade.exe to run the program.  Select the image you want to protect by clicking the Select button in the top-left. You can also select multiple images at once for batch processing.      Adjust the Intensity and Render Quality dials according to your preferences. Higher values add stronger poisoning but can also introduce artifacts in the output image.  Next, click the Save As button under the Output section to select a destination for the output file.  Click the Run Nightshade button at the bottom to run the program and poison your images.  

 Optionally, you can also select a poison tag. Nightshade will automatically detect and suggest a single word tag if you don't, but you can change it if it's incorrect or too general. Keep in mind this setting is only available when you process a single image in Nightshade. 

 If all goes well, you should get an image that looks identical to the original one to the human eye but completely different to an AI algorithm—protecting your artwork from generative AI.

A new bipartisan Senate bill seeks to improve the U.S. pipeline for jobs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies through the development of a workforce framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
The “AI and Critical Technology Workforce Framework Act,” introduced by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., would direct NIST to create a workforce framework for AI and assess whether other critical or emerging technology areas might also benefit from frameworks, according to bill text and a release provided to FedScoop.
“As artificial intelligence continues to play a bigger role in our society, it’s critical the future of this groundbreaking technology is formed in the United States. The way to ensure that happens is by building a workforce engaged in these new technologies,” Peters, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a written statement.
The bill is intended to build upon NIST’s existing National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework — which outlines cybersecurity roles in an effort to help employers build their cyber workforces — as AI is poised to reshuffle the workforce.

Over the next five years, demand for AI and machine learning specialists is expected to increase by 40%, according to a 2023 World Economic Forum report on workforce trends across the world. 
“This bill will ensure that America continues to have a strong and increasingly skilled workforce, will utilize AI to bolster American industry, and will incentivize companies to keep their jobs in the United States rather than outsourcing them overseas,” Schmitt said in a written statement. “Additionally, this bill’s potential to benefit our defense capabilities is endless.”
Under the bill, NIST would be required to report to Congress about other critical and emerging technology areas it finds could benefit from a workforce framework. It would also direct NIST to update the NICE framework to reflect changes in the cybersecurity field and “encourage” the agency to provide resources and guidance on cybersecurity careers to students and adults, according to the release.
