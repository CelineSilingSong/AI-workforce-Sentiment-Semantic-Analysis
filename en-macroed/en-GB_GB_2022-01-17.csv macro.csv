3 Ways That Artificial Intelligence (AI) Will Change Your Job ForeverAdobe Stock

In fact Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai recently predicted that it will turn out to be the most profound human invention so far – more so that electricity, the internet, or even fire!

Certainly, I believe it has the potential to deeply impact everything about the way we live our lives, from how we travel, to how we connect and communicate with friends, and most definitely the way we work and do business.

Whatever job you do now, if it isn’t affected by AI already, it’s very likely that it will be at some point in the not-so-distant future. Here’s my rundown of the five most significant changes AI will make to the world of work in our lifetimes.


AI probably won’t make you redundant – yet!

It’s certainly true that machine learning – the AI technology that’s most relevant to business today – will be able to do some things so much more quickly and efficiently that it won’t be worthwhile to pay humans to do them anymore. This will include things like sensing, moving things around, scheduling, translating, and optimizing machinery. But the jury is still out over whether, in the long or short term, AI will lead to more jobs being lost or created.

One way to look at it is that AI, in theory, will lead to increased business growth and success. Often this will mean (hopefully) more customers. More customers mean more human problems that need to be solved – from complicated customer service issues requiring a human response to the challenge of consistently creating innovative products and services that meet the changing needs of humans. These are tasks that humans will be needed for, for a long time yet!

The arrival of AI is described today as the dawn of the ""fourth industrial revolution."" The first industrial revolution saw political opposition and public unrest from people who feared that agricultural and manufacturing machinery would cause widespread unemployment and even the collapse of society. That fear is still alive today. On the other hand, others believe that technology will lead us into an era that has been described as “fully automated luxury communism,"" where robots provide all our basic necessities at effectively no cost to us. Human beings are then free to spend their time on fulfilling and creative pursuits that give their lives value and meaning.
Both ideas present extreme outcomes, and we’re probably a long way yet from either. What is clear is that AI has the potential to relieve many of us of a lot of the mundane and repetitive elements of our work, so the best way to make sure we don’t become redundant is to work in jobs where our value is elsewhere!

Smart machines will augment and assist us
When we're carrying out those more human, creative, or strategic tasks that won't be automated any time soon, we can expect robots and smart machines to be there to lend a hand. Often this will mean having analytics-capable tools on-hand to make sure our decisions are underpinned by solid data. For example, HR roles will, for a long time yet, still require a human touch to solve human-specific problems. But increasingly, AI is used in recruitment to provide initial screening of the thousands of applications that many large companies attract whenever they advertise a vacancy. You might not be happy to hand over the entire responsibility of picking who will work for you to a machine, but it can greatly improve efficiency by providing early indications of who might be the most suitable applicants.
Those kinds of tasks are carried out by AI software running on machines such as PCs and tablets that we’re all used to, but we will increasingly find ourselves “working alongside” machines in a very literal sense, too. Collaborative robots (Cobots) work on the floor with humans in Amazon’s worldwide network of warehouses as well as facilities such as Ericsson’s 5G smart factory, where assembly, packing, and dispatch of its devices is carried out autonomously by machines while security drones patrol the premises to deter intruders. Online supermarket Ocado uses robots to pick and pack 50,000 customer orders per hour, navigating miles of shelves across football-pitch-sized warehouses.
Our ability and willingness to get along with our new robot colleagues is likely to play a big part in determining how successful we are in the world of work in the near future. For businesses, the challenge will be to make sure humans and robots are both spending their time on the jobs they are best at.

AI will create new types of jobs
Once again, the impact of earlier industrial revolutions is a good source of predictions on how this one might turn out. Certainly, plowmen, weavers, and smiths lost their jobs during the widespread adoption of mechanization in the early 19th century. But as the first mechanized industries emerged, populations became urbanized, and quality of life improved for many people. This led to business and human enterprise evolving to provide services needed to keep everything running and to keep people fed, happy, and entertained.
The same will undoubtedly be true of the AI revolution. Business and society are going through a period of adjustment as we come to understand the power of smart machines and automation, and the human skills needed to lead the way on this are in high demand. More roles are likely to appear involving the ability to identify areas where AI and automation resources will be most effective, for example. Another very valuable human skill right now is the ability to create “buy-in” – effectively developing trust among human workforces and bosses towards AI and smart machines because trust is essential for AI to work!
The key thing to remember here is that any job that can easily be automated is likely to be! Businesses need to ensure that their own workforce is in-tune with this forecasted future and equipped with the “human” skills that aren’t likely to be automated any time soon. These include emotional intelligence (empathy), creativity (AI can write songs but is unlikely to come up with anything that we will consider great music any time soon), and complex decision-making.

One way to think about the impact it will have, is to consider how the invention of ""non-smart"" machines (anything that can't be considered to be ""artificially intelligent"") impacted industry and commerce from the first industrial revolution to the dawn of the AI era, around ten years ago. During this time, machines took on much of the heavy lifting of our manual workload. Now we have ""smart"" machines; increasingly, they will take on the burden of managing our cerebral workload too – anything that requires thought, learning, or decision making!

Key Takeaways



                AI is poised to displace millions of jobs, both blue-collar and white-collar.            


                However, there are skills that AI cannot master: strategy, creativity, empathy-based social skills, and dexterity.            


                We need a new social contract that emphasizes the importance of proper education and collaboration with AI.

The following is an excerpt adapted from AI 2041 by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Qiufan. Copyright © 2021 by Kai-Fu Lee. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.Artificial intelligence can perform many tasks better than people can, at essentially zero cost. This simple fact is poised to generate tremendous economic value but also to cause unprecedented job displacement — a wave of disruption that will hit blue- and white-collar workers alike. In the future, AI will be doing everything from underwriting our loans to building our homes, and even hiring and firing us. This transformation of how work gets done will not only result in severe unemployment, but potentially ignite a host of social problems, including depression, suicide, substance abuse, widening inequality, and social unrest.So where does that leave us? What are the jobs that AI can and cannot displace? What is the future of work? The jobs most at risk of automation by AI tend to be routine and entry-level jobs. AI’s main advantage over humans lies in its ability to detect incredibly subtle patterns within large quantities of data. Take the example of loan underwriting. While a human underwriter will look at only a handful of measures when deciding whether to approve your insurance application (your net worth, income, home, job, and so on), an AI algorithm could take in thousands of variables — ranging from public records, your purchases, your healthcare records, and what apps and devices you use (with your consent) — in milliseconds, and come up with a far more accurate assessment of your application.Such algorithms will displace routine white-collar work easily, just as software has steadily taken over routine white-collar tasks, such as bookkeeping and data entry. In “The Job Savior,” we saw examples of affected white-collar workers ranging from bookkeepers to insurance underwriters. When combined with robotics, AI will also displace increasingly complex types of blue-collar work. By 2041, warehouse pickers — who perform routine tasks — will have long been displaced; many construction workers will have been displaced, as building practices shift toward prefabricated components built by robots that are easy to assemble en masse.What AI cannot doThis begs the question: What can AI not do?These are the three capabilities where I see AI falling short, and that AI will likely still struggle to master even in 2041:Creativity. AI cannot create, conceptualize, or plan strategically. While AI is great at optimizing for a narrow objective, it is unable to choose its own goals or to think creatively. Nor can AI think across domains or apply common sense.Empathy. AI cannot feel or interact with feelings like empathy and compassion. Therefore, AI cannot make another person feel understood and cared for. Even if AI improves in this area, it will be extremely difficult to get the technology to a place where humans feel comfortable interacting with robots in situations that call for care and empathy, or what we might call “human-touch services.”Dexterity. AI and robotics cannot accomplish complex physical work that requires dexterity or precise hand-eye coordination. AI can’t deal with unknown and unstructured spaces, especially ones that it hasn’t observed.

What does all this mean for the future of jobs? Jobs that are asocial and routine, such as telemarketers or insurance adjusters, are likely to be taken over in their entirety. For jobs that are highly social but routine, humans and AI would work together, each contributing expertise. For example, in the future classroom, AI could take care of grading routine homework and exams, and even offering standardized lessons and individualized drills, while the human teacher would focus on being an empathetic mentor who teaches learning by doing, supervises group projects that develop emotional intelligence, and provides personalized coaching.For jobs that are creative but asocial, human creativity will be amplified by AI tools. For example, a scientist can use AI tools to accelerate the speed of drug discovery. Finally, the jobs that require both creativity and social skills, such as strategy-heavy executive roles, are the ones where humans will shine.While it’s clear that there are a lot of lines of work that AI will struggle to master — and thus would be safer for workers to pursue for their careers — these alone won’t prevent a disaster for the legions of workers displaced from roles that will be easier for AI. So what else can we do to help fulfill the basic human desire for a meaningful livelihood?Relearn, recalibrate, renaissanceTo create more jobs and improve the readiness of workers for the transformation on the horizon, I propose the 3 Rs — relearn, recalibrate, and renaissance — as part of a gargantuan effort to deal with the central issue of our time: the AI economic revolution.People in endangered jobs should be warned well in advance and encouraged to learn new skills. The good news is that, as discussed, there are skills that AI cannot master: strategy, creativity, empathy-based social skills, and dexterity. In addition, new AI tools will require human operators. We can help people acquire these new skills and prepare for this new world of work.Vocational schools need to redesign their curricula to promote courses for such sustainable jobs. Governments could take the lead and provide incentives and subsidies for these courses, rather than blindly pursue broad-brush economic measures, such as universal basic income. Corporations could also provide programs like Amazon’s Career Choice program, under which Amazon pays up to $48,000 for any employee to earn a degree in high-demand fields such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, and nursing.Pandemic or no pandemic, the importance and number of human-centric service jobs, such as nursing, will also increase as wealth and life span increase. Society has consistently devalued such vital human-centric service roles both in terms of how they are perceived and how much they are compensated, and we need to address this oversight.In addition to relearning skills, we need to recalibrate what today’s jobs look like with the help of AI, moving toward a human-AI symbiosis. The most prevalent and basic symbioses will be found in software AI tools. Software powers a human-PC interdependence, which has already revolutionized office work. Software AI tools can devise alternatives, optimize outcomes, or perform routine work for white-collar professionals in many fields. Specific AI tools will be customized for each profession and application — for example, AI-based molecule generation for pharmaceuticals, advertising planning for marketing, or fact-checking for journalism.

A deeper interdependence between AI optimizations and “human touch” will reinvent many jobs and create new ones. AI will take care of routine tasks in tandem with humans, who will carry out the ones that require warmth and compassion. For example, the future doctor will still be the primary point of contact trusted by the patient but will rely on AI diagnostic tools to determine the best treatment. This will redirect the doctor’s role to that of a compassionate caregiver, giving them more time with their patients.Just as the mobile Internet led to roles like the Uber driver, the coming of AI will create jobs we cannot even conceive of yet. Examples today include AI engineers, data scientists, data-labelers, and robot mechanics. But we don’t yet know and cannot predict many of these new professions, just as in 2001 we couldn’t have known about Uber drivers. We should watch for the emergence of these roles, make people aware of them, and provide training for them.Finally, with the right training and the right tools, we can expect an AI-led renaissance that will enable and celebrate creativity, compassion, and humanity. From the 14th to the 17th centuries, wealthy Italian cities and merchants funded the Renaissance, which saw a flowering of artistic and scientific output. We have reason to anticipate that AI will be the catalyst for a new renaissance centered around human expression and creativity. As with the Italian Renaissance, people will follow their passions, creativity, and talents once they have more freedom and time.Painters, sculptors, and photographers will use AI tools to compose, experiment with, and refine artwork. Novelists, journalists, and poets will use new technologies for research and composition. Scientists will use AI tools to accelerate drug discovery. An AI renaissance will reinvent education, giving teachers AI tools to help each student find their own passions and talents. Education will encourage curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity. It will promote learning by doing and group activities that enhance students’ emotional intelligence — and that bring them face-to-face with one another, and not just a screen.A new social contractTurning some of the ideas above into reality would be an unprecedented undertaking for humanity. One thing is clear: We will need to retrain a massive number of displaced workers. We need to raise an astronomical amount of money to fund this transition. We need to reinvent education to produce creative, social, and multidisciplinary graduates. We need to redefine the work ethic of society, entitlements for citizens, responsibilities for corporations, and the role of governments. In short, we need a new social contract.Fortunately, we do not need to create this from scratch. Many elements already exist in different countries. Take, for example, the “gifted and talented” education programs in Korea, primary education in Scandinavia, university innovations (like massive open online courses, or MOOCs, and Minerva Schools) in the United States, the culture of craftsmanship in Switzerland, service excellence in Japan, the vibrant tradition of volunteering in Canada, caring for elders in China, and “gross national happiness” from Bhutan. We need to share our experiences and plot a way forward globally, where new technologies are balanced by new socioeconomic institutions.Where will we find the courage and audacity to take on this gargantuan task? We are the generation that will inherit the unprecedented wealth from AI, so we must also bear the responsibility of rewriting the social contract and reorienting our economies to promote human flourishing. And if that is not enough, think about our posterity — AI will liberate us from routine work, give us an opportunity to follow our hearts, and push us into thinking more deeply about what really makes us human.

Commissioned by the BFI, it’s part of a larger performing music and cinema collaboration, Tracing the Circle, inspired by new restorations of some of the earliest moving images of Japan, preserved at the BFI National Archive and dating back to 1902.
The installation is currently on display at BFI Southbank, accompanied by new music by Japanese composer Midori Takada, a pioneer in experimental and ambient music. The result is a mesmerising work that charts the evolution of architecture, the natural environment and the social landscape through the dual lens of early and contemporary filmmakers, working 120 years apart.

The images were then analysed by bespoke AI software and presented with an animated infographic layer alongside audio-engineered compositions. At first glance the result is an odyssey of infinite algorithms, as the footage flows through Japan’s traditions and landscapes. But the combination of the images with Takada’s euphoric percussion also suggests a warning about the rise of AI tools and how they influence our view of the world.
The creators of Tokinokawa, The Light Surgeons’ Christopher Thomas Allen and Tim Cowie, joined me for a conversation about the project.
Tim Cowie and Christopher Thomas Allen
How did you first come to work with these archive films?
Christopher Thomas Allen: Back in 2018, the BFI National Archive were looking into a lot of early archive films in Japan to coincide with the Olympics. Initially the plan was to do screenings of these films with live music. We were invited to develop a live cinema show and given about five hours of early black-and-white film material.

How did you approach working with such a large amount of material?
Christopher: A lot of the footage was disintegrating and, to be honest, I loved it. When they started to restore it, it almost lost some of its beauty. I love stuff that’s falling apart; it’s evocative of memory. We went through the black-and-white material – we put an order to it, we structured it, and we edited about 90 minutes of thematic narrative.
Working with a Japanese producer, we tried to work out where the locations in the archive footage were, and then finally we got the budget to go there.
The window for doing this became quite intense because it was at the end of 2019 that we finally got the go ahead. I made it over there just before the lockdown kicked off in 2020. Tim was meant to join me to work with Midori on the music, but he couldn’t make it because they changed the travel restrictions.
Tim Cowie  
Tim Cowie: Between Chris going and my flight leaving, which was just a week apart, the travel laws had changed. It was crazy.

Christopher: I managed two weeks of filming and gathering all the material. There were certain places we couldn’t get into because COVID had also impacted Japan, although less so at the time.
When I came back to the UK, the project went into an indefinite pause because everything was closed, and the live show couldn’t be done. It went into this prolonged state of not knowing where it would go. We then started thinking about how it might function as a film rather than a performance. We could go back to the performance later. The concepts and ideas evolved a bit, and we started going through a lot of the footage that was shot while I was in Japan.
How did Midori Takada become involved in the project?
Christopher: I flew over to Paris to see her perform. Musicians like her and Steve Reich are influences on the stuff we’ve made. It was amazing to go and see her live performance and get a sense of the key theatrical element in her work. She had lots of interesting things to say about the archive. We discussed how the archive exists in this relationship between the past, the present and the future. And so, from there, a three-act structure started to emerge. The archive has no fixed position. It’s this constantly moving thing that we’re reassessing from the present and projecting into the future. So those ideas of circular narratives and themes were central in the piece.
Midori went away and started writing and thinking about music based on the sections and chapters that we had edited from the archive footage.
Tim: The idea was that when we got together in London for rehearsals, we would have some time to develop the music and bring the new video footage that Chris shot with the extra sound design layers to it. Unfortunately, we couldn’t collaborate closely with Midori and develop the installation, so we just worked with those pieces of music that she created. I was looking at ways that we could use the music and have the footage projected on a wall. The idea was this metaphor of time as a river running through the piece.
Tokinokawa (2021) 
We’ve got six speakers matching the video screens and the music travelling with them. Everything’s flowing left to right as if it’s a stream. As one little excerpt drifts off, another one drifts back in. There was talk of time all the way through the development of the piece – a lot of Midori’s pieces are at 60 BPM and they’re all on the second. It’s like this ticking clock with the drum pounding, so it made it easier to mix the pieces.
How does her music interact with the sound design?
Tim: I wanted to bring the sound of spaces and environment into the piece, so the sound design layer is made of a lot of film recordings and recordings from the video footage itself. That helps immerse you in the environment. There’s a drone layer that’s being driven by the actual sound in the footage, that’s been processed.

Did you make any discoveries during the experience?
Christopher: There’s a funny story about a dead body, which was affecting and made me think about the material a lot afterwards. One location in the archival footage was a waterfall, Kegon Falls, in a place called Nikko that has a very large Shinto shrine. We arrived there very late in the day, and it was very cold. I had a long 600mm zoom lens on the camera, and I was shooting stuff very quickly.
When I got back, I gave all the footage to Tim and said to him, “Can you look through the rushes and give me some feedback?” and Tim said, “Yeah, I’ve watched it, but there’s a dead person in one of the frames.” I was unaware what he was talking about. In one of the shots there was this poor guy looking directly into the lens of the camera. It was a chilling and freaky moment. It made me think about the detachment of filming, the gaze of the camera and the juxtaposition of something so horrific in such beautiful scenery. This is a famous place for suicide, apparently.
That sent me on a bit of a philosophical trip. In this interim period, when we couldn’t work on the project, I read Jacques Derrida’s book Archive Fever. In that, he talks about this idea of the death drive, and the need to film and to record. For me, a lot of those ideas are implicit in the piece, which became much more than just thinking about a single culture. That’s what led to the idea of the AI.
Tokinokawa (2021)
Can creative developments in AI change our ways of seeing?
Christopher: It’s scary when you think about how quickly this stuff is becoming used in all sorts of ways, consciously and unconsciously, and how AI models are trained, and who’s training them. In cinema, we have the same problem: whose gaze is this?
Going back to the meaning of the archive, it was western production companies going into Japan, looking at it from an orientalist perspective. In the same sense, we’ve got the same thing, neo-colonialism with AI. It’s rich, white technicians building models based on our own biases. All that stuff’s there, but it’s got the potential to be even more dangerous in a way. For example, we used this model called YOLO, which is used a lot for driverless cars. There’s a whole bunch of these models that you can explore and experiment with.
There’s an interesting website called Runway, which is accessible for artists and creative people. We worked with a company called Artists & Engineers to write some software that would utilise some existing models. These models are mad, and you think oh God, I’m never going in a driverless car. It’s spookily accurate and crazily not accurate at the same time. That’s the situation now, but who knows what it will be like in 50 years?

Tim: These models are old as well, aren’t they? I mean these are the models that are available free and to people like us, whereas I’m sure that the technology has moved on a lot since these were created.
It’s both sinister and exciting, because the technology could have dark uses and implications. At the same time, it can open lots of possibilities for freeing up some of this material. I use it on my phone, looking at photos and searching. It’s really nice when I’m going to look at some pictures of my daughter when she was small, and it just throws up all the photos. Or looking for a family member in your photo stream, which is quite a nice and positive thing. It’s about treading carefully around who’s going to write the rules.

Tokinokawa is open daily from midday to 10pm at BFI Southbank until 30 January.
The original films that were used for the Tokinokawa installation are newly restored films from the BFI’s Japan on Film archive and are available to watch for free on BFI Player.

The smart home is now a reality. We have robots that can clean the floor, open blinds, turn on switches and open doors. We also rely on smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to answer questions, read our text messages, manage our diaries and more.
Most of these technologies are perfectly harmless – the vacuum cleans up dust, the blinds open and close and the lights go on and off. But these devices are getting smarter, using artificial intelligence to learn your habits and preferences.
Artificial intelligence – always watching, always learning
What most people don’t realize is just how much data can be collected and processed by artificial intelligence (AI). Take the Facebook smartphone app for instance – you already know that everything you share online is carefully analyzed and processed to build a marketing profile about you. But did you know the app also uses the built-in sensors in your smartphone to see where you are, who you are with and what you are doing – even if you disable location sharing?
This is where the problem with AI at home starts. Your devices may be collecting quite sensitive information that you would not normally share. Because these devices are always present, we quickly forget what they are capable of. Which means that we often do and say things without remembering they may be being recorded.
Consider Alexa, built into smart speakers and streaming devices from Amazon. As well as listening for the ‘Alexa’ keyword, these devices are known to record private conversations which may later be reviewed or analyzed by Amazon.

The reason for recording conversations is relatively harmless – Amazon uses them to improve and personalize their service for you. But what if the AI is being operated by a less reputable provider? Cheap devices will often upload data to AI data centers in China where personal privacy is not guaranteed – and where you have far fewer protections against personal data misuse.
As useful as AI is, we all need to be a bit smarter about how it is used at home. Especially when so many companies are collecting data that is not directly related to the service they offer.
Artificial Intelligence used correctly 
Obviously there are some problems with AI – but that’s not to say it is not helpful when applied to specific situations. Panda Dome uses artificial intelligence to monitor how your computer works under normal circumstances.
Panda Dome doesn’t read your personal files or keep any of your personal data, but the AI can detect when something unusual happens. It can then block suspicious activity that may indicate malware at work – even if the app has never “seen” that type of infection before.
The AI approach is safer, faster and more secure than traditional antivirus techniques. And because it is finely targeted on a single activity, you can trust the AI to behave responsibly.
AI will undoubtedly become more and more common – but as we have shown, users will need to be much more careful about the information they share with their smart homes. Next time you’re in the same room as your Alexa, take a minute to consider what you are saying – and how that may be being collected and used by artificial intelligence systems.

The use of Artificial Intelligence in marine biology research

Marine biologist at the University of Agder (UiA), Kim Tallaksen Halvorsen, labels the marine biology research being done using sonar, camera and Artificial Intelligence along the coast of southern Norway revolutionary.
Scientists from the field of marine biology have previously manually monitored plankton and fish stocks along the Skagerrak coast. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now being used in marine biology research to observe marine life. Cameras, sonar, sensors and other equipment are laden with AI. The algorithms count the fish and plankton, monitor the size of the fish, and can even distinguish one fish from another.
“This is an interdisciplinary success story and a revolution within marine research,” commented Kim Tallaksen Halvorsen, marine biologist at the Institute of Marine Research at Flødevigen. “Artificial Intelligence frees up time for the researcher, but also provides more observations and more information. In addition, the observations are more certain. Artificial intelligence cameras do not get tired, they are attentive all the time.”
In collaboration with scientists from the University of Agder (UiA) and the Institute of Marine Research, Halvorsen is publishing a new study on AI, marine research and mechatronics. The article is accepted for publication in the ICES Journal of Marine Science. The article aims to provide an introduction to AI. In addition, it demonstrates how interdisciplinary collaboration, and the use of artificial intelligence, can open up new research fields in the future.
Artificial intelligence in marine biology research
The use of AI is new to marine biologists, yet Halvorsen considers what he and his colleagues are doing with the help of AI along the coast of southern Norway a ‘revolution’.
“Observing and counting fish used to be manual tasks, where we had to comb through hours of film footage to find the information we were looking for,” explained Halvorsen. “Just measuring the length of a cod requires a picture where the front and back parts of the fish are clearly visible. The work is very time consuming. With artificial intelligence, taking observations is automated. We get the number of different fish species, sizes and other observations immediately.”
AI is applied to distinguish and recognise different fish species, but also to recognise individual fish. This is possible because several species have distinct patterns that are unique to each individual. This is true for species such as corkwring wrasse, ballan wrasse, salmon and cod.
“We use the same technology that is found in mobile phones. When we can monitor fish on an individual level over several years, it will give us new and more certain insight into how the fish live,” said Halvorsen.
New research method using AI
AI is more gentle than traditional research methods according to the researcher. The traditional method utilised by marine scientists is to capture, then sedate and tag the fish. Halvorsen estimates that he has caught and tagged 3000 to 5000 fish a year in this way.
“With Artificial Intelligence, we avoid having to catch, sedate and microchip the fish. This means that we can be less intrusive to marine life, and still obtain more information,” described Halvorsen. In the Coast Vision project, the researchers have monitored the growth and behaviour of individuals over time using only camera observations and AI. This has not been done with natural fish stocks before.
Halvorsen believes that in the future, AI will help us monitor and understand changes in the ocean when they occur. “We can get information about the health of the Skagerrak in real time, and thus be able to initiate immediate measures if something is urgent,” Halvorsen commented.
Interpreting large amounts of data
“Marine ecosystems are large and complex, and so is the amount of data needed to understand the system,” explained Rebekah Alice Oomen, marine biologist at UiA and the University of Oslo. The challenge is not to discover, but to analyse the enormous amounts of data.
“While we used to spend an awful lot of time reviewing and interpreting data, we can now leave that task to artificial intelligence,” Oomen said. “The work has focused on new applications of mechatronics and artificial intelligence to collect and interpret big data.”
The main aim of the new study is to make artificial intelligence tools available to marine biologists.

artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting jobs across all strata of business and IT. 
AI is being incorporated into customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), business intelligence (BI), analytics, cybersecurity, marketing, sales, management, and more. 
Here are five major trends in AI jobs the market is seeing: 
See more: The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market
1. AI Shifts All Roles
AI is shifting all other roles or at least a great many of them.
“There isn’t a shift in AI jobs as much as AI is causing a shift in other roles,” said Patrick Conte, chief commercial officer at Opsani. 
Conte gave the example of cloud application optimization, where AI is allowing DevOps engineers to focus on development and testing and not as much on the size of workloads. 
AI can find the right size, or the service-level objectives, of an application, where a DevOps engineer or team might just request a large footprint that will hold the app, without worrying about over-provisioning and overspending. In this case, AI and its branch technology machine learning (ML) can suggest with high accuracy the size of the workload (CPU, memory, replicas, etc.) and allow the DevOps team to build, test, and send the workload to the site reliability engineering (SRE) team.  
2. Site Reliability Engineering Roles 
AI and ML are bringing about big changes in SRE roles. By using ML to find an optimal set of performance settings in the production phase, the SRE team does not have to take time away from preparing apps for production to worry about tuning them. 
Since the number of permutations of settings for an app or microservice with just three parameters (CPU, memory, replicas) is in the trillions, it requires a system that can operate at machine speed to do the testing and experiments necessary to actually find the optimal combination of values for those parameters.  
“Humans can only guess at the optimal, whereas AI and ML can find it at a faster speed and more reliably,” Conte said. “This doesn’t replace humans but frees them up to do their higher-value jobs.”

3. Cybersecurity and AI 
Cybersecurity engineers scored highest in salary growth in 2020 according to the “Tech Salary Report” from jobs website Dice. The report highlights skills like cloud, AI, ML, and cybersecurity as being in high demand. 
While tech salaries overall grew by 3.6% in 2020, cybersecurity analyst salaries surged by 16.3%. Rates have risen again in 2021. And roles are evolving that harness AI in tandem with standard cybersecurity tools.
“The widespread adoption of remote work led to increased vulnerabilities, providing hackers with unprecedented opportunities to attack and breach defenses,” said Art Zeile, CEO of DHI Group, a provider of AI-powered career marketplaces that focus on technology roles. 
“In response, the need for skilled technologists to identify and plug these security holes saw cybersecurity analysts enjoy the largest growth in salary of any occupation.”  
4. AI in Manufacturing 
Many different verticals are big on AI. And manufacturing is moving into the forefront. 
An MIT survey revealed that about 60% of manufacturers are already using AI. The two most common use cases for AI in manufacturing are maintenance and quality control. 
For instance, instead of people going around equipment and assembly lines at certain time intervals, AI is used to process data coming in from sensors to monitor factors like oil levels, debris on filters, equipment health, performance, vibration, emissions, and more. AI then points maintenance personnel toward the equipment and components that need attention. This saves time and money. And people who can combine the AI and maintenance disciplines should find their services wanted in many quarters. 
“Manufacturing data is a good fit for AI/machine learning,” said Cem Dilmegani, founder of AI Multiple, an AI analyst firm. “Manufacturing is full of analytical data, which is easier for machines to analyze.” 
Similarly, AI in quality control can help inspectors know what to inspect, where to inspect, and how to trace QC issues back to their root cause. 
5. AI in Robotics 
Robotics is another hot market. And it is making heavy use of AI. 
Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group, said the autonomous robotic market alone is worth around $103 billion this year. He predicts that it will more than double by 2025 to $210 billion. 
Where jobs will be plentiful will be in areas such as robotic process automation (RPA). When integrated with AI, RBA helps companies deal with high-volume, repeatable tasks far more efficiently. 
Yes, some tasks will be lost to robots. But plenty of people will be needed to service the robots, harness AI to increase performance, reduce robotic errors, and write software that can incorporate AI, RBA, and plant systems.

Say cheese! Researchers have developed a tiny camera that takes amazingly clear photos. Just don’t sneeze while it’s in your hand. At the size of a coarse grain of salt, you may never find it again.
Smaller cameras could mean lighter smartphones and new James Bond–style gadgets. But that’s not all. Cameras on this scale could swim through the body, hitch a ride on an insect, scope out your brain or monitor hostile environments. And those are just a few of the possibilities.
How do you pack that much picture-taking power into something the size of a crumb? It takes a “radically different approach” to making a camera lens, says Felix Heide. He’s a computer scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey. His lab developed the camera with colleagues from the University of Washington in Seattle. The team shared its work in Nature Communications in November.

Cameras have two main parts: a lens and a sensor. The lens bends incoming light onto the sensor, where the image is recorded. Over the last few decades, sensors have gotten smaller and smaller. But lenses are another story. “Lenses haven’t been miniaturized at all,” Heide says. Most are designed little different today than they were in the 1800s.
Lenses are traditionally made by stacking curved pieces of glass or plastic. A curved surface bends light passing through. How the light bends depends on the curvature. A lens can be a single piece of glass. To bend light in more ways, you can stack several of them together.
Heide’s team took a totally different approach. They made a lens from a metasurface. These surfaces are super thin, human-made materials patterned with tiny structures. The structures are so small they’re measured in billionths of a meter (nanometers). Similar but slightly thicker materials are called metamaterials.

Pictures taken with other mini cameras have been fuzzy and distorted (left). The new camera takes crisp, full-color pictures (right). They’re on par with pictures taken by conventional cameras.Princeton University
“Metamaterials interact with light in entirely new ways not found in nature,” explains Natalia Litchinitser. She’s an electrical engineer at Duke University in Durham, N.C. How they interact depends on the structures ― their shape, density, pattern and what they’re made from. This is also true of metasurfaces.
With the right design, metasurfaces can become miniature lenses or mirrors. That means they can squeeze into tiny spaces and reveal things people haven’t seen before. Another plus? They can be made for pennies. That’s because you can make them using the process developed for producing computer chips.
Still, Litchinitser cautions, this technology is relatively new and has its limits. For example, metasurface lenses often produce fuzzy pictures or pictures with colored halos around the edges. Litchinitser credits the new camera’s creators for developing computer programs to overcome those problems. For these programs, the researchers turned to artificial intelligence, or AI.
‘Learning’ to get better pictures
When TikTok or Snapchat recognizes your face in a photo and applies a filter, that’s AI at work. The more you use these features, the better their machine learning gets at identifying you. That’s because these programs learn from their mistakes.
With a similar approach, Heide’s team tackled two key challenges for metasurface cameras: lens design and image quality. To get a high-quality image they needed a metasurface with more than 1.5 million metal structures. But how should the structures be arranged to get the best picture? It would take far too much time and computing power to explore every possibility.
Machine learning includes deep learning and neural nets
Luckily, there’s a shortcut. The team wrote a computer program that simulated light traveling through a lens and the picture it created. Then the program tweaked the lens design and ran the simulation again. It compared the new picture to the previous one and judged which was better. As the program cycled through different possibilities, it learned a bit each time about how best to tweak the design and get the best picture.
But even a perfect lens design won’t deliver crisp, clear pictures unless you tackle another challenge. No metasurface lens can perfectly focus all the light rays passing through. That introduces blurriness. To deal with this, the team wrote a second computer program. This one looked at images of a simulated scene. The images were blurry in different ways. By cycling through the images and comparing them to the original scene, the program learned to correct for each type of blurriness. The result: An image-processing program that made pictures sharp and in full focus.
A lens just 0.5 cubic millimeters (a 300-millionth of a cubic inch) in size now rivals the quality of a traditional camera lens 550,000 times that volume. Just like its much bulkier predecessor, the new camera’s pictures are crisp, colorful and capture a wide field of view. You could even take a selfie with it. For now, however, the team is being extra careful and keeping it away from noses.

More About Power Words




artificial intelligence: A type of knowledge-based decision-making exhibited by machines or computers. The term also refers to the field of study in which scientists try to create machines or computer software capable of intelligent behavior.


colleague: Someone who works with another; a co-worker or team member.


computer chip: (also integrated circuit) The computer component that processes and stores information.


computer program: A set of instructions that a computer uses to perform some analysis or computation. The writing of these instructions is known as computer programming.


density: The measure of how condensed some object is, found by dividing its mass by its volume.


electrical engineer: An engineer who designs, builds or analyzes electrical equipment.


engineer: A person who uses science to solve problems. As a verb, to engineer means to design a device, material or process that will solve some problem or unmet need. (v.) To perform these tasks, or the name for a person who performs such tasks.


environment: The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest).


field: An area of study, as in: Her field of research is biology. Also a term to describe a real-world environment in which some research is conducted, such as at sea, in a forest, on a mountaintop or on a city street. It is the opposite of an artificial setting, such as a research laboratory. (in physics) A region in space where certain physical effects operate, such as magnetism (created by a magnetic field), gravity (by a gravitational field), mass (by a Higgs field) or electricity (by an electrical field).


filter: (n.) Something that allows some materials to pass through but not others, based on their size or some other feature. (v.) The process of screening some things out on the basis of traits such as size, density, electric charge. (in physics) A screen, plate or layer of a substance that absorbs light or other radiation or selectively prevents the transmission of some of its components.


graduate student: Someone working toward an advanced degree by taking classes and performing research. This work is done after the student has already graduated from college (usually with a four-year degree).


lens: (in optics) A curved piece of transparent material (such as glass) that bends incoming light in such a way as to focus it at a particular point in space. Or something, such as gravity, that can mimic some of the light bending attributes of a physical lens.


machine learning: A technique in computer science that allows computers to learn from examples or experience. Machine learning is the basis of some forms of artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, a machine-learning system might compare X-rays of lung tissue in people with cancer and then compare these to whether and how long a patient survived after being given a particular treatment. In future, that AI system might be able to look at a new patient’s lung scans and predict how well they will respond to a treatment.


metamaterial: Lab-built materials that develop particularly desirable properties based on the way that they are built, rather than what they’re made from. They have qualities not found in the natural world.


metasurface: A two-dimensional surface that has been engineered with nanoscale structures to manipulate light. They can shape and direct light waves, control their polarization and may even concentrate their energy.


monitor: To test, sample or watch something, especially on a regular or ongoing basis.


salt: A compound made by combining an acid with a base (in a reaction that also creates water). Common table salt is a made of sodium and chlorine.


sensor: A device that picks up information on physical or chemical conditions — such as temperature, barometric pressure, salinity, humidity, pH, light intensity or radiation — and stores or broadcasts that information. Scientists and engineers often rely on sensors to inform them of conditions that may change over time or that exist far from where a researcher can measure them directly.


simulation: (v. simulate) An analysis, often made using a computer, of some conditions, functions or appearance of a physical system. A computer program would do this by using mathematical operations that can describe the system and how it might change over time or in response to different anticipated situations.


smartphone: A cell (or mobile) phone that can perform a host of functions, including search for information on the internet.


technology: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry — or the devices, processes and systems that result from those efforts.

Loftus, MD, with the University of Florida Health’s Department of Surgery and colleagues, outlined their six important characteristics in an opinion piece published Jan. 18 in PLOS Digital Health.“Patients and clinicians face shared clinical decision-making tasks while under time constraints and high cognitive loads from high volumes of information,” the authors explained. “To this end, we propose a framework for ideal algorithms consisting of six desired data,” they added later. In order for an algorithm to operate clinically, they must be:1. Explainable: Many algorithms are unable to ""show their work,"" commonly known as the black box problem. But quality tools must clarify the traits of a patient and their medical condition while making a diagnosis. Separating association from causation is also crucial. 2. Dynamic: Digital tools should capture and adjust to patients in real-time. For example, intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressure can shift quickly after a head injury, not recognizing these changes can prove deadly. 3. Precise: The average person generates more than 1 million gigabytes of healthcare data during their lifetime or nearly 300 million books, the authors noted. Algorithms must utilize and distill this information to diagnose complex diseases and changing conditions.4. Autonomous: After training and testing periods, AI should be able to learn and offer results with little input from providers or developers. 5. Fair: Implicit bias and social inequities must be accounted for. Prior to including demographic or socioeconomic factors into a prediction model, developers must determine whether that factor has a proven association with a clinical outcome.6. Reproducible: These tools are validated externally and prospectively, and shared among multiple academic communities and institutions. Federated learning uses a decentralized, online infrastructure to train algorithms and presents a good opportunity for developing reproducible tools.  Related AI content:VIDEO: Getting cardiologist buy-in on artificial intelligenceHow machine learning models can predict if patients will show up for appointmentsAI-based system affords physicians more flexible schedules, minimizes burnout triggersAI-based mammo screening protocol reduces radiologist workload by 62%Explainable AI model accurately auto-labels chest X-rays from open access datasets6 features of the ideal healthcare artificial intelligence algorithmMatt O'ConnorMatt joined Chicago’s TriMed team in 2018 covering all areas of health imaging after two years reporting on the hospital field.

The motto is to make any work less laborious and less time-consuming. Among so many gadgets, there are some that are based on artificial intelligence. Here are the top 10 coolest AI-based Gadgets that you can use this year..Self-operating Drones.Drones need to have some level of autonomy to stop them from falling out of the sky or ramming straight into a tree, and it's all thanks to AI that drones like the DJI Phantom 4 Advanced can pilot themselves as and when needed. The Phantom 4 Advanced, similar to several other models, is smart enough to pick you out from a crowd and take a selfie of you without you having to do anything laborious. The same kind of intelligent tech enables it to identify a quickly approaching obstacle, so it can swerve to avoid it – all thanks to the onboard image processing AI..Google Home.All of that high-level programming and engineering filters its way down to the Google Assistant, which comes built into the Google Home as well as a growing number of other devices. When your speaker recognizes your voice, that's AI at work – machine learning identifying the characteristics of your speech even if you're saying words that it hasn't heard you say before. A different kind of artificial intelligence is deployed to make sense of what you're actually saying, to work out which words in which order and which context should prompt which responses. You can't yet chat to a smart speaker quite as easily as a human being, but when you can, it'll be because of AI engineering..KODA AI Robot Dog.If you can't have a real dog, you can always go for the KODA AI Robot Dog. It interacts with people the same way a real puppy does. This self-evolutional robot dog has a decentralized platform, acts as an emotional companion, and can even provide physical support..Nobi Smart Lamp.If you have a family member who lives independently, the Nobi Smart Lamp can give them peace of mind. This practical gadget looks like a ceiling lamp and automatically detects falls. It then notifies emergency contacts, getting your loved ones the help they need at the right time..Morebot Scout: AI-Powered Smart Home Robot.Great for home security, the Morebot Scout AI-Powered Smart Home Robot, has enough sensors and AI algorithms to eliminate blind spots. Even better, you can control it via Alexa and Amazon..Zmirror All-in-One Smart Mirror.The Zmirror All-in-One Smart Mirror is smart enough to analyze your skin health and improve your productivity. And that's exactly why you want to have it on your nightstand or by your bathroom sink. Plus, you'll get superb audio for all your YouTube videos, Kindle books, and more with the Harmon Kardon speakers..Square Off Grand Kingdom Set Smart AI Chessboard.The Square Off Grand Kingdom Set Smart AI Chessboard is a smart game. It uses robotics, sensors, and artificial intelligence to move the chess pieces on its own. And it even lets you play chess with anyone in the world. With 20 different levels of difficulty, it allows you to play at your own competitiveness..Tempo Studio AI Home Gym.With the Tempo Studio AI Home Gym, AI gets you into shape. It lets you access live and on-demand workouts for personalized guidance. It's just like having a personal trainer who's available 24/7. It also comes with all the equipment you need like two dumbbells, a barbell, a recovery roller, plates, and more..PowerVisionPowerEgg X Explorer AI Personal Camera.The PowerVisionPowerEgg X Explorer AI Personal Camera has the technology to recognize faces and objects. It learns from you and knows what to zoom in on. So, while you waterski, this drone focuses on you and not the seagull floating next to you..Samsung JetBot 90 AI+ Robotic Vacuum.With its AI-based sensors and navigation, the Samsung JetBot 90 AI+ Robotic Vacuum may be the smartest vacuum you've ever met. It has a LiDAR sensor that detects distance and location, while a 3D sensor recognizes small and fragile objects. Finally, an object recognition algorithm maps the best cleaning route..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
