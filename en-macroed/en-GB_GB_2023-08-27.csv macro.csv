So what should the next generation of workers be trying to pursue?Hibaq Farah and Tom AmbroseTue 29 Aug 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Aug 2023 09.21 EDTShareTeenagers deciding their future this year have a lot to contend with. In England, those who sat their A-levels suffered the biggest results drop on record while the top grades in GCSEs also fell. And now they face the question: will the career I choose to pursue even exist by the time I enter the workforce?Artificial intelligence has hit the mainstream with the popularity of generative AI programmes driven by large language models such as ChatGPT. Businesses are increasingly adopting the technology. A study, which was published last week by the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, suggests 57% of workers are using such tools to save time in the office, especially for summarising meeting notes and long documents.Yet the automation of such tasks also means the chance to eliminate or reduce certain roles, not just in administration, but across many fields as the technology becomes more sophisticated. According to a survey of professionals by Thomson Reuters published last week, 67% of respondents believe AI will have a great impact on their profession in the next five years, while more than half predict the technology will create new career paths.So exactly what are those new professional opportunities that the next generation of workers should be trying to pursue?‘It’s all being disrupted’“There is no such thing as a future-proof career anymore,” says Dr Andrew Rogoyski, the director of innovation and partnerships at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey.“AI and other forms of automation have been disrupting and changing careers for years now and generative AI is the latest technology encroaching on careers that we previously thought safe from technological advances – it’s all being disrupted by AI.”According to Rogoyski, subjects such as science, engineering and cyber-security will continue to be in demand, despite AI assistive technologies that may be used in the field. Similarly, careers in healthcare that involve human-to-human interaction: nursing, social care and medicine for example.“I would advise students to become AI literate, you don’t have to be coding AI software but you will probably be using AI tools in your future career so get a head start. Careers may always evolve, change and dissolve, my advice to students is to be flexible, imaginative and brave,” Rogoyski says.James Knightley, the chief international economist at the Dutch banking group ING, doubts “very much that any career will be untouched by AI”. He suggests one safe bet is to become a skilled artisan, for example learning high-end carpentry.‘Learning the machine’One area that looks in real trouble is the creative sector, with Rogoyski saying roles such copywriting and graphic design could be gradually outsourced to AI. The sector has struggled with the advancement of generative AI tools: from writers striking in Hollywood against such tools being used to produce scripts and story ideas, to film-makers using image generators in their work such as DALL-E 2.But Prof Sunil Manghani at Winchester School of Art is encouraging his students to get acquainted with the technology. He has started bringing AI into sessions with students, for example, in a project with Tate Britain: “One of the phrases we’ve found ourselves using is ‘learning the machine’,” Manghani says.AI can also make the industry more accessible, says Ed D’Souza, who is also a professor at Winchester. “It’s a challenge to education: do you need to go to an art or design school to enter into parts of the industry? The good thing is that AI and the potential of using this for people without those skills is that they can learn through the machine, they can enter the industry at different points.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People trained in using AI are therefore going to be at a significant advantage to those who are not.“We clearly have a skills shortage in many professions and the opportunity AI could open to have people from many different backgrounds enter the world of professional work without necessarily having to have the same qualifications.“If we can tap into it in the right way by investing in education and training, it really opens up the ecosystem. AI can be a great leveller.”Another area of opportunity is health. Owen Addison, a professor of oral rehabilitation at King’s College London, welcomes AI as a potential safety net for diagnosticians in the future.“I actually see AI as being likely to empower dentists to be better diagnosticians and to be able to provide preventative care and monitoring better with such support systems in place,” he says.“But the surgical part of the role will remain something that requires highly skilled personnel to do and it’s not something that’s going to be quickly removed.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Work & careersfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceRepublicans claim a ‘coup’ attempt to delegitimize Kamala Harris’s candidacy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for some time, but the launch of ChatGPT last November took it mainstream, sparking excitement and suspicion in equal measure. It reached 100 million users in just two months, becoming one of the fastest-growing internet services ever. However, ChatGPT’s ability to generate human-like text, answer questions, and more has left people asking, could it replace our jobs?


Throughout history, people have been skeptical of new technologies, with old ways often deemed best. There were concerns that the telephone would make people lazy and anti-social and that the television would negatively impact the radio (which faced similar criticism), replace reading and conversation, and destroy family life. The car, the elevator, the refrigerator – many things we take for granted today were rejected at first.

It’s natural to be wary of the unknown, but businesses shouldn’t let their distrust of AI stop them from exploring its potential. Experimenting with AI is the best way for leaders to face their fear while evaluating the technology’s capabilities and limitations. And there are plenty of both.

Automated Processes

Perhaps one of the most obvious business benefits of AI is the automation of repetitive, time-consuming processes.
Many of the tasks performed by businesses are a drain on people’s time. Take a typical HR department that finds itself answering the same, basic employee questions. By using a digital assistant, HR can concentrate on more business-critical tasks while employees can quickly find the information they need, boosting productivity. The same applies to sales and customer service. Rather than waiting to speak to a representative, AI lets customers access the information they need when they need it.

AI can reduce administrative time and optimize many other aspects of business operations by automating the human element.
Some businesses are already using AI to onboard new hires. AI helps by automating the delivery and receipt of the necessary paperwork, company policies, and login information – eliminating delays and creating a positive experience that helps set the tone for an employee’s tenure. Digital assistants can also guide new employees through their induction – proactively suggesting the next steps and recommending learning materials and background reading to get them quickly up to speed in their new role.

Faster, Better-Informed Decisions
AI’s ability to automate, augment and support business decision-making is also worthy of attention. The theory is that leaders can make quicker decisions involving complex data unclouded by cognitive biases, improving business operations and enhancing the customer experience.

For example, AI specialists Peak use “customer transaction data – taken from thousands upon thousands of purchases – to learn what products certain segments of customers are buying together. This model is then used to recommend complementary products on the website.” Amazon and Netflix use a similar approach to provide personalized recommendations.
The beauty of AI is that it analyzes vast quantities of data and spots patterns that might not be obvious to the human eye or brain. IT author Thomas Erl cites the example of a company that, through AI, identifies a weakness in its business operations. It found that after customers return products, they are less likely to buy again or will buy less from the company – highlighting the returns process as a vital area for improvement and competitive advantage. Similarly, a company might use AI to analyze job applicants and the candidate journey to identify trends, such as when people typically drop out and make improvements. Of course, it’s then up to leaders to decide what steps to take.
Supporting Content Creation
A more contentious but no less exciting application of AI is content creation. Can AI produce the nuanced copy of a skilled writer? Not yet, but it can streamline the creative process.
Jasper, for instance, is a marketing-focused version of Chat GPT that can generate various types of customer-facing content, from blogs, social media posts, and web copy to sales emails and advertising copy.
However, in Tiger Recruitment’s experience, AI-generated content has limitations and struggles to emulate a company’s voice and tone. AI will never know your company and industry as well as your marketing team and text can sound stilted, but it can help with research and ideas. Say you’re tasked with writing social media posts on a keyword or topic – AI can suggest ideas and even produce a first draft. It requires human input to insert prompts and carefully review any content produced. But it can create efficiencies, allowing marketers to focus on other tasks.
Complementary Not Replacement
It’s easy to get carried away with the possibilities of AI – this article barely scratches the surface. But it’s important to be aware of its limitations, many of which are because it’s an emerging technology and lacks human qualities such as empathy, critical thinking, and creativity. It can’t magically drive efficiencies or deliver insights – it needs access to quality data, and at this stage in its evolution, human oversight is required.
There are data privacy and integrity issues too. As Devon Lovell, People Partner and HR Consultant at Fitzgerald HR points out in a podcast on AI in HR, what you put into ChatGPT is no longer yours – even if you delete it, it’s still there, which raises important questions about confidentiality.
The accuracy and authenticity of AI is another concern, with Lovell adding, “It’s not a human being and there can be biases in Chat – based on who uses it. You could get a biased opinion on something without even realizing it.”
When it comes to AI, there are still issues to be ironed out, but as the debate intensifies and the technology advances, business leaders will need to consider if and how AI has a place in their organization. As with most innovations, the challenge will be to weigh up the risks of adopting the technology against the risk of rejecting it and falling behind.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds much promise for the Republic of Korea. The Korean government developed its National Strategy for AI in 2019, building on the National AI R&D Strategy and Data Industry Vitalization Strategy, to revitalize Korean economy, transform Korean society and close the gap with global AI leaders. In 2022, the current administration announced 12 areas of National Core Technology, one of which is AI, and recognized the strategic importance of advancing AI to harness its scientific, diplomatic, and economic potential. As one of the most AI-ready countries in APAC, South Korea is creating a data dam to bolster its data ecosystem and make public data accessible to businesses and individuals to enhance AI innovation. To further strengthen the AI policy landscape, the Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee of Korean National Assembly passed a proposed legislation (currently making its way through the parliament) to enact the AI Act which sets out the key principles for safe and responsible development of AI with the aim of improving the lives of Koreans.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD 476.3 billion of productive capacity in South Korea, equivalent to a quarter of GDP in 2022. South Korea has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

The transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. From the curated programs Netflix suggests for you, to your smart refrigerator telling you when to buy more milk, to the online ads for things you didn’t even know you wanted, AI has become ubiquitous in our lives.  The same applies to the legal profession. Artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, is all the buzz in the blogs, conferences, meeting rooms, and water-cooler conversations of legal professionals. It comes filled with possibilities – and reservations. Both expectations hinge on human oversight. Jump to ↓   Understanding AI  The good, the bad, and the technical  Human oversight  Will you make generative AI standard practice? Understanding AI By its simplest definition, AI is technology that allows a computer to operate in a “human” way. It takes in data from its training and its surroundings and returns information based on what it learns or senses. Many terms contribute to the lexicon of AI, but generative AI creates the most noise. Generative AI is a type of machine learning that creates drafts of content like documents, images, songs, and art in response to prompts from the user. These tools comb through large volumes of content to create “the best” response to the prompt. Rather than extracting data, as AI can do in things like contract management software, it generates data, like drafting a brief. ChatGPT is one of the best-known types of generative AI.  The good, the bad, and the technical A recent survey of law firm professionals concluded that a large majority of those surveyed (82%) believe that GenAI can be readily applied to legal work. However, a slight majority (51%) felt that generative AI should be applied to legal work. That dichotomy suggests some hesitation in using generative AI in legal technology for the high-stakes work of lawyers. Here are the factors to consider: HallucinationsNo, you’re not seeing things. But your chatbot might be generating them. Hallucinations are when generative AI creates false information. In a 2023 example, a US personal injury attorney used a chatbox to help prepare a court filing that contained six made-up cases. When his opponent and the judge discovered his error, the mortified attorney apologized that he didn’t know a chatbox could falsify information. Generative hallucinations can appear credible because AI is designed to create coherent text. BiasBias is a human function and since humans train the algorithms that AI uses, those biases can be passed along. Without proper protocols in training, including diversity in the training team, unconscious bias can be baked into machine learning models. TransparencyYou don’t have to know how to cook a fancy French recipe to appreciate its deliciousness. And you don’t have to know how AI works to utilize its benefits. But you should know why an algorithm has arrived at the decision it provides. Transparency means the AI vendor you choose should be able to explain how their system works, what it is capable of, and where the data comes from.   Special ReportRead more about evolving attitudes of generative AI in the legal industry.Access the full report Human oversight Human expertise is the silver bullet of artificial intelligence. Despite what science fiction tells us, machines are machines, and they don’t operate unless programmed and instructed by humans. Human expertise is critical on both sides of the AI equation: user and vendor. User expertiseA continuing concern for legal professionals is that AI will replace lawyers. Not so. In the definition above, “generative AI creates drafts of content,” the emphasis should be placed on drafts. Regardless of what AI generates, it needs human eyes on it to ensure that what has been created is accurate and pertinent to the prompt. In the same way an attorney would oversee the work of an entry-level employee, monitoring and managing AI is a good business practice. This oversight plays a crucial role in minimizing risks, maintaining control, and harnessing the benefits of AI in a responsible manner. Vendor expertiseIt all comes down to trust. The personal injury lawyer trusted ChatGPT to create court documents for his case, and it failed him miserably. For an industry-specific AI platform, industry-specific expertise is important to establish trust. In the legal world, few organizations compare to the industry expertise of Thomson Reuters. With more than 500 bar-admitted attorney-editors, and a team of cutting-edge data scientists, Thomson Reuters brings human intelligence into its artificial intelligence solutions. When training generative AI legal technology, a specific data set beats a broad data set. You don’t want data from Wikipedia, Twitter, or even Google; you want accurate, targeted information that’s been curated by professionals. Thomson Reuters brings that, in addition to proprietary content from products like Westlaw Precision and Practical Law.  Will you make generative AI standard practice?The coming of generative AI in legal technology is a given. But when legal professionals decide to make it a standard practice remains a question. The efficiencies it brings by creating drafts need to be quantified with regard to the time it takes to review and monitor the results. By replacing time spent on monotonous tasks with ones utilizing legal expertise, organizations of all sizes will see an increase in profits and employee satisfaction.  Charting the Course for the Future of Generative AISee what Thomson Reuters President and CEO Steve Hasker has to say on the buzz of generative AI.Read blog post   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceTechnology",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative artificial intelligence, including large language models such as ChatGPT and image-generation software such as Stable Diffusion, are powerful new tools for individuals and businesses. They also raise profound and novel questions about how data is used in AI models and how the law applies to the output of those models, such as a paragraph of text or a computer-generated image.

“We’re witnessing the birth of a really great new technology,” said Regina Sam Penti, SB ’02, MEng ’03, a law partner at Ropes & Gray who specializes in technology and intellectual property. “It’s an exciting time, but it’s a bit of a legal minefield out there right now.”
At this year’s EmTech Digital conference, sponsored by MIT Technology Review, Penti discussed what users and businesses should know about the legal issues surrounding generative AI, including several pending U.S. court cases and how companies should think about protecting themselves.  
AI lawsuits
Most lawsuits about generative AI center on data use, Penti said, “which is not surprising, given these systems consume huge, huge amounts of data from all corners of the world.”
One lawsuit brought by several coders against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI is centered on GitHub Copilot, which converts commands written in plain English into computer code in dozens of different coding languages. Copilot was trained and developed on billions of lines of open-source code that had already been written, leading to questions of attribution.  
“For people who operate in the open-source community, it’s pretty easy to take open-source software and make sure you keep the attribution, which is a requirement for being able to use the software,” Penti said. An AI model like the one underpinning Copilot, however, “doesn’t realize that there are all these requirements to comply with.” The ongoing suit alleges that the companies breached software licensing terms, among other things.
In another instance, several visual artists filed a class-action lawsuit against the companies that created the image generators Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DreamUp, all of which generate images based on text prompts from users. The case alleges that the AI tools violate copyrights by scraping images from the internet to train the AI models. In a separate lawsuit, Getty Images alleges that Stable Diffusion’s use of its to train models infringes on copyrights. All of the images generated by Stable Diffusion are derivative works, the suit alleges, and some of those images even contain a vestige of the Getty watermark.


Just because something is out there for free doesn’t mean it’s free of rights.

There are also “way too many cases to count” centered on privacy concerns, Penti said. AI models trained on internal data could even violate companies’ own privacy policies. There are also more niche scenarios, like a case in which a mayor in Australia considered filing a defamation lawsuit against ChatGPT after it falsely claimed that he had spent time in prison.
While it’s not clear how legal threats will affect the development of generative AI, they could force creators of AI systems to think more carefully about what data sets they train their models on. More likely, legal issues could slow down adoption of the technology as companies assess the risks, Penti said. 
Fitting old frameworks to new challenges
In the U.S., the two main legal systems for regulating the type of work generated by AI are copyrights and patents. Neither is easy to apply, Penti said.
Applying copyright law involves determining who actually came up with an idea for, say, a piece of visual art. The U.S. Copyright Office recently said that work can be copyrighted in cases where AI assisted with the creation; works wholly created by AI would not be protectable.  
The patent office, which offers a stronger form of protection for intellectual property, remains vague on how patent law will apply to the outputs of AI systems. “Our statutory patent system is really created to protect physical gizmos,” Penti said, which makes it ill-equipped to deal with software. Decade by decade, the office has reconsidered what is and is not patentable. At present, AI is raising critical questions about who “invented” something and whether it can be patented.
“In the U.S., in order to be an inventor, at least based on current rules, you have to be a human, and you have to be the person who conceived the invention,” Penti said. In the case of drug development, for example, a pharmaceutical company could use AI to comb through millions of molecular prospects and winnow them down to 200 candidates and then have scientists refine that pool to the two best possibilities.
“According to the patent office, or according to U.S. invention laws, the inventor is the one that actually conceived those molecules, which is the AI system,” Penti said. “In the U.S., you cannot patent a system that’s created using artificial intelligence. So you have this amazing way to really significantly cut down the amount of time it takes to get from candidate to drug, and yet we don’t have a good system for protecting it.”
Given how immature these regulatory frameworks remain, “contracts are your best friend,” Penti said. Data is often seen as a source of privacy or security risk, she added, so data isn’t protected as an asset. To make up for this, parties can use contracts to agree on who has the right to different intellectual property.  
But “in terms of actual framework-based statutory support, the U.S. has a long way to go,” Penti said.
What a murky legal landscape means for companies
The legal issues accompanying generative AI have several implications for companies that develop AI programs and those that use it, Penti said.

Developers might need to get smarter and more creative about where they get training data for AI models, Penti said, which will also help them avoid delays caused by a lack of clarity around what’s permissible.
Companies beginning to integrate AI into their operations have several options to reduce legal risk. First, companies should be active in their due diligence, taking actions such as monitoring AI systems and getting adequate assurances from service and data providers. Contracts with service and data providers should include indemnification — a mechanism for ensuring that if a company uses a product or technology in accordance with an agreement, that company is protected from legal liability.
“Ultimately, though, I think the best risk-mitigation strategy is proper training of employees who are creating these systems for you,” Penti said. “You should ensure they understand, for instance, that just because something is out there for free doesn’t mean it’s free of rights.”

Here's How to Prepare - Bloomberg Law,2023-08-28,Bloomberg Law,https://news.bloomberglaw.com,"PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare.",N/A,"PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare.","PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare.",N/A,N/A,"PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare. Generative artificial intelligence has more potential to change the workforce than almost any technological innovation since the internet began. And it’s being used to change how businesses can efficiently and effectively get work done.What’s more, employees are excited to use it. PwC’s 2023 Global Hopes & Fears Survey shows that 52% of respondents have identified at least one way generative AI will positively impact their work. Savvy businesses are implementing generative AI in a variety of ways in their workforce. Transforming work and automating routine, non-value-added tasks can free workers to pursue a human-led, tech-powered approach to business objectives.What’s ChangingGenerative AI tools can improve the employee experience, for example, by transforming systems used for changing 401(k) and benefits-related programs. Instead of navigating a maze of confusing menus, employees can ask for exactly what they want, and those programs can successfully execute their requests.Generative AI also has the ability to help employees focus on strategic rather than repetitive tasks. Content creation, project management, information analysis, and more time-intensive tasks can be rerouted through generative AI tools, freeing up employees to focus on upskilling, increasing impact, and more efficiently handling their workload.Of course, generative AI is by no means infallible; it can produce incorrect results. It can also be subject to biases, especially current large language models that can be influenced by the biases of the content they were trained on.There are techniques and governance we can use to help mitigate these risks for businesses using generative AI. We assert that generative AI is used to help people, and that people are ultimately accountable for the quality of work and decisions.Human ingenuity and critical thinking should be used to confirm the quality of generative AI conclusions. With the technology still in its infancy, particularly as a business tool, human oversight is necessary for thoughtful implementation.What’s Not ChangingGenerative AI is supplementing and aiding various jobs and freeing workers from time-consuming, repetitive tasks. First, many companies are planning strategic implementation of generative AI and large language models to proactively address privacy challenges and better prepare their workforce.Second, generative AI can effectively be used as an augmentation tool. It can digest large amounts of data and provide summaries but ultimately is intended to help people to perform analysis and recommend decisions. It doesn’t replace the accountability people have on outcomes and decisions.Further, generative AI is already creating new jobs, including prompt engineer, a person skilled at optimizing generative AI task requests. In the coming years we will see many more jobs designed around using, managing, and transforming generative AI in responsible ways.Like many new technologies, its potential effects can cause fear. However, as familiarity with generative AI grows, and it becomes a regular part of life, people will see the benefits in their lives and work.How to PrepareGenerative AI will soon be a fixture of many industries and to enable implementation that’s not only effective but can improve the workplace, companies must prepare now.First, businesses can establish a generative AI governance team. This group would be tasked with understanding how generative AI will affect their business and industry as a whole, looking into both intended and unintended consequences. They can also establish generative AI policies.Similar to HR policy, a guide on responsible generative AI use can set expectations and limits on the use of the technology in the workplace, giving employees confidence in how generative AI can be implemented.Once a policy is in place, generative AI can be adapted to help deliver business outcomes. Companies should manage and prioritize where they focus on generative AI solutions based on business goals and to confirm necessary regulations are followed. This is where human oversight and understanding is key.To pave the way for effective deployment, industry leaders are upskilling their employees on the transformative power of responsible AI usage, so they understand the tools and in-demand skills needed to leverage this technology now and as it evolves for the future. The goal is to augment the workforce and elevate their work, automating tasks and providing data and insights. Upskilling modules will include a diverse range of learning modalities and gamification strategies to enhance engagement and adoption.The deployment of generative AI isn’t the end of the road. Like any tool, it will improve as the underlying technology evolves. With careful and considerate implementation, this paradigm-shifting tool will benefit businesses and employees alike.This article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.Author InformationAnthony Abbatiello leads PwC’s workforce transformation business, delivering HR transformation, talent strategy, change management, organizational development, and rewards services to CEOs and CHROs across sectors and functions.Write for Us: Author Guidelines Continue Reading  Learn more about Bloomberg Law or Log In to keep reading:  Learn About Bloomberg Law  AI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.

These tools can rapidly process and synthesize information and generate new content. The jobs most exposed to automation now are office jobs, those that require more cognitive skills, creativity and high levels of education. The workers affected are likelier to be highly paid, and slightly likelier to be women, a variety of research has found.College-Educated Workers Are Most Exposed to A.I.Researchers at OpenAI estimated the share of tasks in each occupation that could be assisted by A.I. tools.





The median percentage of tasks that could be done by A.I. in jobs that require a high school diploma or less is 10 percent. It's 18 percent for those requiring a high school diploma; 38 percent for a two-year or vocational degree; 70 percent for a four-year degree; and 64 percent for a graduate degree.

Generative artificial intelligence has the power to shape the world we all live in, so learning how to harness and deploy that power should be part of a University of Virginia education, a new faculty report says.
Just don’t use ChatGPT to write your papers for you.
AI and its implications have been on the minds of UVA faculty for a while, especially after OpenAI released ChatGPT, a computer program that mimics human writing, in November. Last spring, a seven-member AI task force, which included an Honor Committee representative, brought together more than 300 faculty members for cross-Grounds discussions and collected survey responses from 504 students and 181 faculty members, and gathered input from other universities.
The task force, which completed its report this summer, looked into how the emergence of this new technology may affect what and how students learn and how it is assessed. It found that faculty want students to develop artificial intelligence literacy – but with faculty guidance to use AI properly to learn core material more effectively and efficiently.
“AI can serve as a powerful and effective tutor,” the report stated.
There is, however, a “but.” While artificial intelligence can provide students with information, task force members think it could also disrupt important elements of the learning experience by reducing the opportunities for students to turn to professors for help and guidance with a subject. The report marks two sides of the artificial intelligence coin, providing opportunity to learn more while posing the threat of learning less.

“On the upside, high-quality, individualized tutoring has the capability to increase student learning in many subjects,” the report said. “On the downside, AI can function as an undetectable and endlessly customizable paper mill, undermining learning across Grounds.”
The task force advises faculty members to be precise in their expectations regarding artificial intelligence use in their courses.
“Students need clear guidelines for how and when generative AI can be used,” the report advised. “In the spring 2023 semester, 77% of student survey respondents reported that their instructors did not make their AI policies clear to them. In designing learning experiences, instructors must be transparent about how and why AI may, should, or may not be used in the course and in specific assignments.”
Once students achieve a better understanding of artificial intelligence, faculty may delve deeper into course content or expand course goals. Faculty members may also need to reassess what writing skills they want students to develop.
“Generative AI can short-circuit learning: students can outsource the work of research, analysis, and writing to these tools,” the report said. “Yet if we help students write with AI in deliberate, meaningful ways, these tools can become powerful writing partners for students and can augment their learning. AI can aid writers in generating new ideas, providing samples and models to follow, offering generalized feedback, helping writers get unstuck and assisting in the editing process.”
The task force report said faculty members may change their assessment process to thwart artificial intelligence, including in-class, pen-and-paper examinations and reducing take-home work. At the same time, task force members caution faculty against using tools that promise to detect AI because they generally prove unreliable.
The provost’s office, through its Q&A pages, discourages faculty from using AI for grading, to safeguard students’ work.

“Students’ original work is, in most cases, their intellectual property, and thus instructors may not enter a student’s original work into an AI tool that will add that work to the tool’s data set,” the answer read. “AI tools are not effective for grading most kinds of assignments, including writing assignments. However, some AI tools can help to ease the grading process, for example by organizing the work and facilitating the use of rubrics.”
The provost’s office also advises students against entering sensitive, personal or proprietary information into an AI program because the programs use new information to help evolve.
While the report stressed the need to adjust to AI, it said there are many obstacles to harnessing it effectively, including limited AI literacy. AI is still rapidly evolving and some faculty are not prepared to reassess their teaching goals and methods, while others only see the downside of artificial intelligence.
The provost’s office encourages faculty members to become familiar with AI applications, because their students already are. But the office also cautions students that using AI to complete assignments may violate the University’s Honor Code.
The task force composed a series of recommendations, including a ""Teaching in a Generative AI World” website, launching an AI-centered assignment design workshop, launching a series of AI workshops in the fall, developing AI expertise at the Center for Teaching Excellence, and offering programs for graduate students and others with instructional responsibility.
Other recommendations include recruiting faculty to launch AI-learning conversations within their departments, funding AI-related grants, developing field-specific AI learning techniques for the central website, and considering a teaching and learning conference.
“This technology is increasingly shaping research, communication and the world of work, and its role in higher education will continue to evolve,” wrote Brie Gertler, vice provost for academic affairs, in a letter to faculty members.
“The Task Force Report provides a fascinating and thoughtful picture of how this technology is already affecting teaching and learning in higher education, and notes that faculty who shared their views with the task force expressed nearly unanimous support for ensuring that students develop AI literacy,” Gertler wrote.

Enterprises are expected to require increased understanding and oversight of generative AI tools among software engineering leaders in the coming years, according to research from Gartner. By 2025, the consultancy predicts that “more than half” of all software engineering leader role descriptions will include explicit requirements for oversight of generative AI as firms increase their use of the burgeoning technology. Gartner said the study highlights both the increased adoption of tools among enterprises as well as the evolving requirements of senior practitioners in effectively harnessing generative AI to deliver value. Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at Gartner, noted that the emergence of generative AI will have a profound effect on future managerial role requirements. LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITPro“Outside of generative AI’s impact on technology implementation, it also changes the managerial responsibilities of software engineering leaders,” he said. In the long term, the consultancy said firms will expect software engineering leaders to consider a range of variables when deploying and effectively harnessing generative AI. This includes more finely curated team management based on relevant skills, as well as an innate understanding of the ethical considerations of using generative AI tools. Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Like any disruptive technology, we need to pause and think instead about how AI, when leveraged and managed in the right ways, has the potential to change our relationship with what we do and how we do it.When it comes to learning and development (L&D) opportunities, that means understanding how this technology can bring value.Have you read?AI: 3 ways artificial intelligence is changing the future of workThe tasks AI should take over, according to workersNot only can it help advance how we learn, but it can expand the scope and access to L&D experiences to nurture the broadest possible pipeline of diverse and future-ready leaders.Changing how people learnThe pandemic rush to cross-train, retrain or uplevel employee skills may have subsided, but the volatility of the past few years has only underscored the need for continuous professional development. Employees now cite a company’s L&D investment as a significant factor in their willingness to stay or sign on with a new employer. In turn, 80% of employers do not plan to reduce their L&D budgets in 2023, contributing to a $395 billion global investment in employee development. The resulting demand may pose capacity challenges, whether an organization is looking to stand up its own L&D function or partner with an external provider. Enter AI, which has already shown to be a useful L&D tool in providing:● Personalized and engaging learning experiences● Pre-training assessment and predictive analytics that can adjust to maximize a learner’s potential● Content creation that frees up L&D professionals to focus on programme strategies● Ability to scale to meet demand – whenever, however, and for whatever number of learnersHistorically, there has been both a perceived and real trade-off between the quality and scalability of learning (one-to-one tutors deliver more value to students than 50-person classrooms). When leveraged well, AI holds the potential to break this cost/quality compromise by allowing high-quality learning to, for the first time, be hyper-personalized at scale.For example, AI will be able to pair content from outside providers with a company’s own content to create a truly customized learning journey aligned to both the leaders’ and the company’s objectives. Additionally, through AI, companies can integrate their leadership development solutions with communications channels – such as email, messaging apps and video conferencing platforms – to receive learning recommendations and/or in-the-moment coaching based on projects in progress, conversation topics, virtual presentations, and more.Without the limitations of human, financial or time resourcing, generative AI has the potential to further the reach of high-impact, high-quality learning experiences so they’re available for broader and more diverse audiences.AI democratizes learning and developmentWhen it comes to diversity, AI has had its challenges. Like most technology, it’s based on data and rules that are provided by humans – and their inherent biases. That might make it easier to dismiss the technology out of hand, particularly with its exponential potential to proliferate those biases. But they’re already present in existing online and offline learning experiences. So why not use the power of AI to help course-correct and mitigate inequities?OpenAI recently announced a grant programme to encourage discussion and democratic governance of AI behaviour. This goes beyond the due diligence any company should conduct to understand the current technology – where the data comes from, how it’s curated, the training and rules infrastructure, and how it aligns with the company’s values and approach to employee development. This grant programme is presumably looking toward the future role of AI in our lives and its impact on society.But the technology is not the only operational behaviour that needs scrutiny. In businesses, development opportunities are typically limited to those who are identified as having high potential as leaders. Yet that identification may have more regard for proximity to current leaders than the actual performance of those outside an inner circle. That’s where the true power lies in using AI to promote leadership diversity. Generative AI with a natural language interface is much more engaging and accessible than any version of AI we have had before. That makes it easier to use to expand scope and nurture potential leaders at all levels by promoting development equity – equitable access for underrepresented groups to formalized, career-enhancing development opportunities – for maximum impact.Measuring real-world impact of L&DL&D is often viewed as nebulous and difficult to measure. I’ve seen a lot of companies lower their expectations about what can be shared to justify development efforts, even though they have the data – they’re just missing a framework. Measuring L&D impact comes down to defining its relationship to business objectives. In my experience, investing in development helps drive measurable impact in the following areas and AI can be a critical enabler of these outcomes:● Retention: encouraging leaders to stay by helping them feel better supported and secure in their skillset. AI can contribute by providing on-demand, always-on availability for leader development.● Productivity: improving engagement to motivate leaders to go above and beyond for their organizations. AI can contribute indirectly by increasing efficiency for L&D professionals and enabling programme innovations, and directly by offering interactive experiences for learners. ● Goal achievement: equipping leaders with the skills they need to better achieve organizational goals. AI can contribute to curriculum content and scaling efforts, and build upon pre-development assessments with objective, post-development evaluations.Operating within a framework ensures a company is capturing data that is useful over time. Because we know that business priorities will shift or even pivot in the face of accelerating change.DiscoverWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about diversity, equity and inclusion? Show moreThe COVID-19 pandemic and recent social and political unrest have created a profound sense of urgency for companies to actively work to tackle inequity.The Forum's work on Diversity, Equality, Inclusion and Social Justice is driven by the New Economy and Society Platform, which is focused on building prosperous, inclusive and just economies and societies. In addition to its work on economic growth, revival and transformation, work, wages and job creation, and education, skills and learning, the Platform takes an integrated and holistic approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice, and aims to tackle exclusion, bias and discrimination related to race, gender, ability, sexual orientation and all other forms of human diversity. The Platform produces data, standards and insights, such as the Global Gender Gap Report and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 4.0 Toolkit, and drives or supports action initiatives, such as Partnering for Racial Justice in Business, The Valuable 500 – Closing the Disability Inclusion Gap, Hardwiring Gender Parity in the Future of Work, Closing the Gender Gap Country Accelerators, the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, the Community of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officers and the Global Future Council on Equity and Social Justice. Three years ago, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, companies made commitments to diversity and inclusion that they are still struggling to realize. They may have the intention. Or the data. Or now the technology. But it takes all these working in concert to move the needle on leadership diversity. It also takes a shift in perspective. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging should be integral, not additive, to corporate goals. Each decision point for a company is an opportunity to build equity and inclusivity into the process. That includes the use of AI to meet new expectations for agility and lifelong learning for everyone. Leveraging AI technology responsibly in parallel with equitable internal processes and infrastructure is what will support sustainable leadership diversity in the future of work.

I love the analogy of ChatGPT that Hubspot CTO Dharmesh Shah shared at the start of the year:
“Netscape was to the Internet what ChatGPT is to Artificial Intelligence.
“The Internet existed before Netscape. But the browser helped millions of mere mortals connect the dots on what could be done, and dream of what could be.”
As this breakout year for generative AI unfolded, that analogy has largely come true.  Unlike some technology breakthroughs that find adoption in organizational siloes or bubble up from the bottom, generative AI has been widely accessible from the start.  Across seniority levels, functions, and industries, the mainstream are using gen AI for work and play.
McKinsey recently shared a study that 79% of respondents say they’ve had some exposure to gen AI and 22% are regularly using it in their own work.  One-third say their organizations are already regularly using generative AI in at least one function.  Three-quarters expect gen AI to cause “significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industry’s competition” in the next three years.
Salesforce reported that 67% of IT leaders are prioritizing generative AI for business in the next 18 months, with one-third naming it a top priority.
And yet, incorporating gen AI into business isn’t just another software implementation.  It’s not plug-and-play.  There are a lot of implications and risks, some known and many unknown.
Even as organizations rush head-first into gen AI, there still aren’t a lot of guardrails.  McKinsey found that just 21% of organizations already using gen AI have any established policies.  Only 32% are mitigating for risks of inaccuracy and only 25% for risks of IP infringement.
This early hype and experimentation stage with generative AI will eventually mature.  
I like this insight from Eric Vandevelde, the AI practice chair at Gibson Dunn:
“It was foreign for boards 15 years ago to think about privacy and have chief privacy officers at the design level of products and services. The same thing is going to happen with AI.”
Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:

Artificial Intelligence: Imitation of Art or Creative Supertool?
The rise of generative A.I. demands urgent reflections on what it means not only to make art but also to make money making art.

			By Josh Tyson • 08/30/23 2:05pm 



















































 


Whether we realize it or not, a great many writers have been using A.I. daily for decades. Spell check, after all, was born in 1971 at Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It became a common tool in Word sometime in the early aughts, and I remember having a sense then that using it was somehow cheating. I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, but at some point, it started feeling lazy not to use spell check. Besides, the artistry isn’t in the ability to spell words correctly but the ability to synthesize experiences into words people can relate to.

On paper, machines can play jazz, but does anyone want to watch one take an extended solo? Possessed Photography
In the wake of powerful new expressions of A.I., like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and a slew of other generative models, the line between the artist and the tool is starting to blur. The implications are massive, both in terms of how people leverage creativity to make a living and in how we decide to define art.
When it comes to our notion of work, the new maxim on the streets bears sober consideration: A.I. isn’t coming for your job; someone using A.I. is coming for your job. A graphic designer leveraging tools like text to image, sketch to image, generative fill and text effects from Firefly, Adobe (ADBE)’s beta collection of generative models, is likely to outpace the designer who isn’t using them.
It’s rather exciting in the near term, but it raises questions about what could happen when these tools outpace the graphic designer using them. Is that a bad thing? The answer probably depends on your view of capitalism or how intertwined your work is with your identity. I see the glimmer of a possibility that by automating the tedium that fills so much of our lives, A.I. might help us break free from the productivity mindset that requires using quantity as a metric of accomplishment instead of quality.
In this moment, however, the sheer power of these nascent tools prompts another question: Will models this powerful and ubiquitous initiate the ruinous decimation of human creation? An artistic armageddon?
I turned to Scott Bourne for an answer. An author, publisher, former pro skateboarder and American expat living in Paris, Scott was a fellow contributor to SLAP skateboarding magazine back in the early days of spell check, but his writing always carried the extra weight of having been punched out on a typewriter. There was no autocorrect in Scott’s world, and to this day he carries no pocket computer, sending much of his correspondence out the old-fashioned way, in envelopes, sometimes sealed with discs of melted wax.
When I asked Scott if he’d be interested in collaborating with Bournebot, a personal large language model (LLM) trained on all of his output—decades worth of poems, stories, interviews and emails—the answer came quickly: “Not in the slightest.”
“What most interests me in this time of technology is touch: human touch and staying human,” he said. “I think it is understood that time is what makes things great. The longer it takes to create something, the better it is, whether it be wine, whisky or a work of art. Haste makes waste, and I think we are wasting a lot of time on speed. Write, rewrite, write again and again and again. Then revise and write it once more.”
What was interesting about his reply was that it echoes an approach to A.I. that I’ve been exploring for the past few years. If technology is going to become more powerful and intertwined with our lives, I’d prefer an outcome that puts a premium on humans’ creativity and problem-solving skills—one where our eyeballs aren’t tethered to glowing screens. Maybe if we’re having conversations with technology instead of staring at it, A.I. can become an invisible ally. Maybe machines can give us the gift of time. Maybe we’ll spend that time having meaningful interactions with other people. Maybe we’ll use it in artistic endeavors: to write and rewrite. Or will it be so easy to point A.I. to the task of writing out our ideas that we won’t bother to take the time?
“No A.I. is ever going to have an experience, so it could never write my poems,” Bourne said. “No A.I. is ever going to feel love or pain or any of the emotions that have created Scott Bourne. I am not just blood and guts; there’s a hard road in there, some hitchhike and fist fight, a little jail time and freight ride. A.I. could only imitate, and all my life I have been avoiding imitations. I think it’s kind of ironic that people now prefer an imitation to the real thing.”
His argument made me think of Oscar Wilde’s assertion that “life imitates art far more than art imitates life.” As I’ve come to understand it, he means that what we experience as life is just what art has taught us exists. I also spoke with New York Times bestselling author and business leadership coach Charlene Li, who loved the idea of having her own LLM (and was actually in the exploratory stages of crafting one).
“It’s not just another me, it’s a better me,” she said of this potential ally. “Seventy percent of what I do, I can now do with GPT. I can do more of the 30 percent that’s unique to me and keep working with the technology to keep adding on to that, and I can do other things—higher-order, more value-added things.”
So, there’s no one answer, just fronds of perception dangling overhead. The task at hand is to wrap your head around generative A.I. and then decide how you want to incorporate it into—or attempt to eliminate it from—your life.
Generative A.I. has kicked over the barrier of technical training as a means to create art. People who feel compelled to explore artistic expression but who don’t have the natural talent or hard-earned skills are now in a position to share their visions. Generative A.I. has the power to raise marginalized voices and engender widespread empathy. But is it bad for people who have trained extensively as artists? That seems likely in scenarios where technology directly threatens livelihoods or intellectual property, and there are already artists litigating around these points.
Perhaps the root problem is that making money as an artist has always been hard as hell. Most of the artists I know have a stable of side-gigs that let them make both art and a living. The lucky ones are able to combine their artistic abilities with something marketable, like graphic design or cosmetology. Getting paid to write short stories, record reviews and band interviews for SLAP felt like a huge break twenty years ago. It was one of many freelance writing gigs I maintained, and I still needed to work odd jobs on the side. From my experience, it’s only gotten harder to find paid work as a writer.
Right now, I feel like I can outperform LLMs. As a trained writer, I don’t have a lot of use for ChatGPT. My favorite thing to do with generative A.I. so far has been feeding Stable Diffusion 2 odd prompts in hopes of getting unsettling results (“Alf eating pasta” continues to deliver).
Rebecca Evanhoe, co-author of a popular book in experience design circles, Conversations With Things: UX Design for Chat and Voice, shared a similar viewpoint on large language models: “I think it’s going to be real hard to get that pen out of my hand. Writing is so essential to my thought process, I can’t really tell you what I think [about something] until I’ve written about it… If I can’t write, I’m not even doing the thinking… But I am a person who has a gift in writing, and I have a lot of training in writing. Writing is very painful for lots of people.”
Writing can be excruciating, and I know it’s only a matter of time before generative A.I. will surpass my writing abilities by certain metrics, most notably speed. In the commercial marketplace, my value as a writer might shrink even further, but I agree with Scott that it will be exceedingly difficult for a machine to replicate my experience.
Our innate human ability to synthesize our experiences for creative problem solving will be hard for technology to infringe upon. That potentially matters less if we’re all adrift in an endless, churning sea of quasi-personalized, auto-generated content that has immense technical prowess but no pulse. That’s why it seems critical for artists and creatives to find ways to use these tools that will augment their abilities, not replace them.
Whether it’s a busy artist using ChatGPT to craft email updates for their mailing list or a designer using generative tools to produce a wider variety of work for clients, technology used responsibly can provide tangible gains in terms of income while also shaping the form these powerful technologies assume. Machines are destined to become more intertwined with our lives. With generative A.I. readily available, there’s an opportunity right now for people to decide what that will look like.
Recently, I was part of a conversation about technology and the nature of art with Laura Herman, a researcher at the University of Oxford. We discussed many aspects of generative A.I. and creativity, but her thoughts on intentionality have been echoing in my head.
“Naturally, when I look at a piece of artwork… I think about ‘What was the artist trying to convey?’ and ‘Why did they do this?’” Herman said. “It can be just physical intentionality—it could be conceptual intentionality. Now [these] new technologies [are] shifting the visibility of intentionality and shifting how that intentionality is brought to bear on the ultimate artwork—there’s so much to think about in that space.”
In a world oversaturated with generative content, it’s possible that people will be more drawn to art that’s being created by humans. On paper, machines can play jazz, but does anyone want to watch one take an extended solo over Coltrane’s “Giant Steps”? What is the quality of the intentionality in that kind of content? Like most of the things we call art, the very heart of jazz is so tied to human experience and discipline that a machine’s best attempt would be eternally relegated to the status of imitation.
Maybe the question isn’t will the tool usurp the artist but will we let it?

Published: 31 Aug 2023


 
Disinformation and inappropriate content abound in digital environments, and users may struggle to determine the source of such content or how to filter it out.







Content moderation is commonly used as a social media screening practice. It enables the approval or rejection of comments and content created and posted by users. The task involves removing rule-violating content to ensure published posts adhere to community guidelines and terms of service.
AI can aid in that process. It searches for, flags and eliminates AI-generated content that violates the rules or guidelines of a social media platform, website or organization. This includes any audio, video, text, pictures, posts and comments deemed offensive, vulgar or likely to incite violence.

What is content moderation?
Historically, organizations have moderated content with human moderators who would review all content before it published, said Jason James, CIO at retail software vendor Aptos. The moderators would check the content for appropriateness and either approve and post or disapprove and block it.
Unfortunately, users would often not know if their content was rejected or, if so, the criteria for the rejection process. The entire process was manual and prevented real-time responses to postings. Approval was also ultimately subjective to the decision and leanings of a single moderator.
As a result, many organizations adopted a mix of automated and human intervention to moderate content, James said. Human moderation on top of automation is critical because, if something offensive fell through the cracks, the organization would face serious consequences.
Automated moderation occurs when user-generated content posted through the platform or website is automatically screened for violating the platform's rules and guidelines. If it does, the platform either removes it altogether or submits it for human moderation, said Sanjay Venkataraman, chief transformation officer at ResultsCX, a CX management vendor.



If an organization has strong best practices for content moderation, then it could more easily embrace AI tools to moderate content.







Moderation for AI-generated content
AI content moderation is a machine learning model. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and incorporates platform-specific data to catch inappropriate user-generated content, Venkataraman said.
An AI moderation service can automatically make moderation decisions -- refusing, approving or escalating content -- and continuously learns from its choices. Moderation for AI-generated content is complex, and the rules and guidelines are evolving in tandem with the pace of technology, Venkataraman said.
""Content created using generative AI and large language models is very similar to human-generated content,"" Venkataraman said. ""In such a scenario, adapting the current content moderation processes, AI technology, and trust and safety practices becomes extremely critical and important.""
As generative AI brings a lot of contextual understanding and adaptability into content generation, moderation tools must be reinforced with advanced AI capabilities to detect nonconformance, Venkataraman said. That includes training the AI models with larger numbers of data sets, using humans to validate a higher sample of content, collaborative filtering with community-generated feedback on published content, and continuous learning and feedback.
AI-generated content is increasing, and organizations must adapt to the rapid pace, James said.
""As content can be created faster, the need to review and moderate content more quickly also increases,"" James said. ""Relying on human-only moderators could create a backlog of reviewing content -- thus delaying content creation. The delays created impact collaboration, ultimately resulting in a poor user experience.""





5 types of AI content moderation
Organizations have five methods they can adopt to effectively use AI content moderation to scale. They are the following:

Pre-moderation. Businesses can use NLP to look for words and phrases to ensure content meets their guidelines, including words and terms that could be offensive or threatening. If they met those criteria, the content could be automatically rejected, and the user warned or blocked from future postings. This automated approach limits the need for human moderators to review every post.
Post-moderation. This method enables users to post content in real time without going through pre-moderation review. When a user posts something, a moderator would review the content. With this method, users could see content that violates community guidelines before a moderator notices and blocks it.
Reactive moderation. This method enables users to serve as moderators, who review posts to determine if they meet or violate their own community standards. This method crowdsources moderation to the community rather than using and employing human moderators.
Distributed moderation. This approach is similar to reactive moderation, where users vote to determine if a post meets or violates their own community standards. The more positive votes received, the more users see it. If enough users report the post as a violation, the more likely it is blocked from others.
User-only moderation. This enables users to filter out what they deem to be inappropriate. The moderation is only done through registered and approved users. For example, if several registered users report the post, the system automatically blocks others from seeing it.



How AI will affect content moderation
Generative AI will continue to lead the AI evolution, James said. This will put greater pressure on organizations to invest in AI at some level to remain competitive. That, in turn, will make AI content moderation a must-have capability.
""AI will be more heavily used to not only create content, but [to] respond to postings on social media,"" James said. ""This will require that organizations employ AI-empowered content moderation to not only automate, but also modernize their existing process.""
AI can enable faster, more accurate moderation with less subjective review by human moderators, James said. And, as generative AI models evolve and become more advanced, content moderation will become more effective over time.
""Already, [AI] can automatically make highly accurate automated moderation decisions. ... By continuously learning from every decision, [it's] accuracy and usefulness can't help but evolve for expanded usefulness,"" Venkataraman said.

With the release of a host of generative AI features for Grammarly, students now have a rich set of tools available to help them with every aspect of their writing. From collaboration to feedback to citations and even guidelines on appropriate use, Grammarly has embraced generative AI as an essential tool for student learning.


Enhanced Editorial Collaboration
A generative AI did not write this article, but one did read it and make suggestions. And the result is better for it. Editing is increasingly in short supply. One hundred years ago, being published was difficult, but if one was, one was almost certainly edited. Today, anyone with a computer can find an outlet in which to be published; the challenge is finding an editor. Grammarly, with its ever-watchful eye, is the next best thing.

Having an AI read one's writing is intensely valuable. The standard joke is that the average article in an academic journal has at most three readers, including the author, the editor, and three to five referees. For much non-academic online writing, where there is neither editor nor referees, a better estimate for the number of readers is slightly under one; that is if one includes the author.

PROMOTED
Long ago, Grammarly advanced from being a copyeditor looking for misspellings and grammatical mistakes to being a more full-bodied editorial assistant, monitoring tone and use and making suggestions on improving clarity or achieving the desired effect. With the release of Grammarly’s readily accessible generative AI components, the editorial assistant becomes an editorial collaborator, ready to brainstorm ideas, evaluate the strength of a thesis statement, explore counterarguments, and otherwise add value during the writing process.

Built For Students
Educators may worry that with the complete set of features, Grammarly will free students from the drudgery of actually having to do their own homework. While it is always a bad idea to bet against the ingenuity of students looking to evade work, Grammarly has provided safeguards.

When asked, ""Can you do my homework for me?” Grammarly politely declines, stating:
I'm sorry, but as an AI-powered assistant, I am not able to do your homework for you. However, I can provide you with resources and guidance to help you complete your homework on your own. Is there a specific subject or assignment you need help with?

(Note: Ironically, when writing this article, Grammarly looked at this quoted response and made some editorial suggestions to make it less wordy. So, it is clearly not always taking its own advice when it comes to the AI’s output.)

This type of safeguard, gently reminding students to do the work themselves, is tightly integrated, and Grammarly will discourage students from generating long-form text by AI if they attempt to do so. Messaging within the product redirects them to ideate with Grammarly instead while reminding them to adhere to their institution’s or instructor’s policies.
When asked how Grammarly keeps students from abusing generative AI, the reply is informative:
Grammarly ensures that generative AI is not abused by implementing strict security protocols and constantly monitoring its system. They have a team of experts who are dedicated to ensuring that the use of AI is transparent and that student data is protected at all times. In addition, Grammarly does not collect any personal information that is not necessary for the functioning of their service. By taking these measures, Grammarly is able to provide a safe and secure environment for students to improve their writing skills with the help of AI technology. 
This point about privacy is an important one. In speaking with Grammarly’s Head of Education, Jenny Maxwell, she noted that, unlike some generative AI systems, Grammarly keeps student information secure, allowing students to write freely about any subject without worrying about having ideas or personal information passing irretrievably into the ether.
Manageable Guidance
Grammarly does an excellent job of keeping its guidance manageable. Whereas unconstrained ChatGPT provides page-long explanations or suggestions with 8 to 12 bolded options, Grammarly keeps things to a handful of sentences, helping students stay focused on the task without getting lost in a web of possibilities.
Two simple examples demonstrate this point.
When asked to help brainstorm ideas for an essay on Sherlock Holmes, Grammarly replies: “Of course! There are many potential angles to consider for an essay on Sherlock Holmes” and then proceeds to delineate three possibilities and prompts the student to ask if additional help is wanted. The total response is 103 words.
When asked the follow-up question, “What is unique about Holmes's deductive reasoning skills?” Grammarly again gives a precise response, using only 47 words to spell out the unique attributes.
At 103 words for the first response and 47 words for the second, these are replies that students can absorb and respond to. By comparison, the same questions put to ChatGPT generate replies of 395 and 414 words, respectively. The answers may be more comprehensive, but in the context of a student writing an essay, they are less likely to be helpful, especially if students are supposed to construct the argument themselves.
Addressing Educator Concerns
Grammarly, especially when enhanced with generative AI, has its detractors. Their concerns are primarily of two kinds: those having to do with developing the skill of writing and those having to do with students doing the work assigned to them.
As regards the former, when the question is put to the AI, Grammarly provides an excellent summary of potential concerns.
[With] Grammarly … there are some limitations and potential drawbacks to consider. For example, the AI-powered assistant may not always catch every error, and some suggestions may not be applicable or may even be incorrect. Additionally, relying too heavily on Grammarly may hinder the development of writing skills, as users may become overly dependent on the tool instead of learning to identify and correct errors themselves.
Just as spellcheck has for the most part improved spelling, making people aware of grammatical errors when they are made is more likely to improve grammatical understanding than to prevent its formation.
Regarding the latter concern, that of AIs doing the assignments for the students, here is where the work falls back on the teachers to craft assignments so that they cannot be completed by just handing a single prompt to a generative AI.
The best teaching occurs when a teacher can attend to a student’s work process rather than just looking at the work product. Assignments that shine a light on student research, student idea formation, outlines, and drafts, leading to papers, rather than just looking at a final result, will be much harder to fabricate. They will also provide more significant opportunities for effective teaching.
Embracing the Inevitable
Mathematics has long had to address the challenge of advanced tools–calculators, spreadsheets, symbolic computation, etc.–that can render obsolete traditional homework. This does not mean that problem sets are no longer assigned, only that the assigned types have changed. Similar changes will need to be made for writing assignments.
The reality is that generative AI tools are here to stay. They can either be incorporated into teaching or left for students to use in the shadows. If teachers can keep their eyes fixed on the goal of writing as the clear expression of well-reasoned ideas, they should have no problem finding a place to use tools like Grammarly.

The tech giant is aiming to get on a strong competitive footing against Amazon and Microsoft, but experts say there’s plenty of challenges for the technology in the world of medicine.

At the end of each hospital shift, the outgoing nurse has to quickly bring the incoming one up to speed about all of the patients under their care. This “handoff” can take multiple forms, including conversations, handwritten notes and electronic medical records. “[It’s] a risky part of the healthcare journey, because we're transferring information from one healthcare provider to another,” says Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation for HCA Healthcare. “We have to make sure that it's done in an accurate way and that nothing falls through the cracks.”

Schlosser and his team at Nashville-based HCA – one of the largest healthcare systems in the country with 180 hospitals and around 37 million patients a year – thought this transfer of information could be a good opportunity to apply generative artificial intelligence. Large language models are good at summarizing and organizing data. But when HCA scoured the market for potential vendors, Schlosser says they couldn’t find any companies building solutions for this handoff issue.

HCA had an existing partnership with Google Cloud, so they turned to Google’s software suite called Vertex AI, which helps customers build and deploy machine learning models. Google offers its own foundation model, known as PaLM, but the platform is model agnostic, meaning customers can also swap in and build on OpenAI’s GPT-4, Facebook’s Llama, Amazon’s Titan or any other model of their choosing.

In a bid to woo more healthcare customers, Google has also been developing a healthcare-specific large language model. The company announced Tuesday it will release the latest version – called Med-PaLM 2 – to a wider number of customers in September. HCA is one of several healthcare customers that has had early access, along with the pharmaceutical giant Bayer, electronic health record company Meditech and digital health startups Infinitus Systems and Huma. This renewed push into healthcare comes as Microsoft and Amazon are making their own AI-powered inroads into the sector, and it’s far from clear which will come out on top when the dust clears.

“We’re still five minutes into the marathon,” Gartner analyst Chirag Dekate says of the healthcare AI landscape.
In 2021, Google disbanded its standalone Google Health division but said health-related efforts would continue across the company. Its recent AI solutions in the industry are geared towards solving piecemeal problems. For example, Google released AI tools last year to help healthcare organizations read, store and label X-rays, MRIs and other medical imaging. Earlier this year, the company unveiled AI tools to help health insurers speed up prior authorization.
The use case focus is necessary because of AI technology itself, says Greg Corrado, head of health AI at Google. Despite the hype over large language models, he says it’s “naive” to expect them to be “able to do anything expertly off the shelf,” adding that “In practice, these systems always require identification of specific use cases.”
When it comes to large language models, Google has been playing catchup to OpenAI, the startup behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, which has received $10 billion investment from Microsoft. In 2022, Microsoft acquired Nuance Communications for $18.8 billion, giving it a major foothold to sell new AI products to hospital clients, since Nuance’s medical dictation software is already used by 550,000 doctors. “Nuance has an enormous footprint in healthcare,” says Alex Lennox-Miller, an analyst for CB Insights, which makes Microsoft “well-positioned” for the use of its generative AI software for administrative tasks in the sector.
Before the generative AI boom, Amazon, Microsoft and Google were all competing for cloud customers. With $48.1 billion in cloud revenue in 2022, Amazon holds around 40% of the market share, according to technology research firm Gartner. Microsoft follows with 21.5%, while Google places fourth behind Alibaba Group with more than $9 billion in cloud revenue and 7.5% of the market.
It’s also no surprise that they are all now trying to specifically target healthcare customers, a complex and heavily regulated industry, says Dekate. He says that’s because if you’re able to prove use cases in a more complex environment, like healthcare or financial services, then it signals to other customers that generative AI is ready for broader adoption.
But no one is there yet. What all the cloud companies have presented to customers are building blocks, says Dekate. That is, plenty of ways to utilize their AI platforms in bespoke applications their customers have to build. But what those customers want are fully-built solutions.
“Amazon, Google and Microsoft are fighting it out to dominate the commanding heights of the generative AI economy,” says Dekate. “But none of them have articulated a good enough vertical story.”
Because healthcare is so highly regulated and the consequences of mistakes are high, generative AI use cases need to start out very small. For HCA that means one hospital – UCF Lake Nona – is currently piloting the handoff tool as a proof-of-concept. The AI ingests patient data from the past 12 hours, including lab results, medication, important events, and spits out a transfer summary, that also includes suggestions for what the oncoming nurse should be thinking about in the next 12 hours, says Schlosser.
While it’s built using Google’s Vertex AI software, HCA has been experimenting with different foundation models, including PaLM and Med-PaLM. “We're actually doing a lot of head-to-head testing right now to see where does the generic model work better, and where does a medically-trained model provide more accuracy and better outcomes,” says Schlosser. “I imagine both will actually have important roles in the future we're trying to create.”
The idea of using multiple models to solve a complex problem, known as “composite” artificial intelligence, presents an interesting challenge for the cloud providers, says Dekate. They are simultaneously offering their own in-house models but also partnering with other companies in order to offer “the promise of choice,” he says. Dekate expects that more and more we’ll start to see Google, Microsoft and Amazon start offering services to help customers be able to evaluate different models. Schlosser says HCA has so far been taking a manual approach to evaluation by having doctors and nurses evaluate the outputs of the model relative to what the human team would do as a side-by-side comparison.
Corrado says that at the state of the art right now, generative AI models can be likened to “an eager, studious assistant that's trying very hard to do a good job. And you should view the output critically, as a draft and say, Okay, well, what did you miss? What did you get wrong?”
OpenAI has taken the view that bigger is better when it comes to the amount of data that the model is trained on. Its GPT-3 model, which was trained on the open internet, had around 175 billion parameters and the latest version, GPT-4, is thought to have more than 1 trillion parameters (though the company has not publicly confirmed the total amount). Google says the largest PaLM and Med-PaLM models have 540 billion parameters. The company declined to comment on the size of PaLM 2.
But as models are trained on more and more data, there can be issues with performance. In July, a group of researchers from Stanford and UC Berkeley said their tests suggested that GPT-4’s performance had suffered some degradation over time, echoing anecdotal reports that can be seen on developer fora. Although this was a preliminary finding and researchers are still learning how generative AI models work, this does spark some concern, especially as it’s not entirely clear how such AI systems arrive at their answers. “One of the biggest problems in healthcare for these algorithms is going to be the difficulty they have with transparency,” says Lennox-Miller.
Corrado says these concerns are precisely why Google is experimenting with niche LLM models that are trained on narrower sets of data. Without tailoring models towards specific use cases, such as healthcare, he says, “you run the risk of just having a Swiss army knife, which is not the best knife, and it's also not the best screwdriver. And it's also not the best toothpick. And we think that it's better, particularly in these high value settings, to do domain adaptation, understand what the use case is, and have the same kind of rigorous quality evaluation and version control that you would expect from a real product.”
Another challenge for most large language models is that they’re not constantly learning. They typically have a cutoff date for their training data. For example, the free version of ChatGPT was trained on data until September 2021. But knowledge in healthcare is always advancing, so doctors who use these tools need to have a good sense of how recent the data they’re working with is. Corrado says Google is still deciding what the cutoff will be, but that it will be communicated to customers. “We don't rely on these systems to know everything about the practice of medicine,” says Corrado.
In the hospitals of the future, Schlosser envisions an “AI assistant to the care team,” that he believes will have “amazing power in reducing administrative burden.” HCA has also been working with Google and the publicly-traded ambient AI company Augmedix to automate medical note-taking in the emergency room. Schlosser says around 75 doctors at 4 HCA hospitals are using the technology. The “holy grail” for doctors, he says, is that they could focus on providing care to patients and “the documentation would take care of itself.” The reason they’re starting in the emergency room is because that is one of the most complicated venues to prove the technology actually works.
When it comes to using Augmedix’s tool, the doctor directly asks the patient for their consent to record the examination and use an AI tool for note-taking, says Schlosser. For the nurse handoff tool, which is not patient-facing, it falls under HCA’s broader privacy consent around using patient data for research and process improvement, he says. HCA is also working on using generative AI for ER discharge summaries, as well as handoffs from the ER to inpatient. Schlosser says as HCA thinks about scaling the use of AI for administrative purposes, the company will have to consider “the right way to let all patients know that an AI is part of a care delivery process.”
Consent and privacy are major concerns around the use of AI in healthcare and Google generated significant controversy with an earlier partnership with the hospital system Ascension using AI to analyze millions of medical records. In 2019, reports of the company’s “Project Nightingale,” raised concerns about data privacy and security. Both Google and Ascension said the work was compliant with federal patient privacy laws.
In the case of PaLM and Med-PaLM, Google says that none of the models are being trained on patient data at HCA or any other customer. “HCA's data is HCA's data and nobody else's,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian tells Forbes. “Think of it as a vault in our cloud that only is used to train the version of the model that they're using. It's not shared with anybody else. None of that data is used to improve our base model.”
Despite the challenges to generative AI from technical capabilities to privacy and data concerns, Schlosser is optimistic that tools built on technology will become part of the standard toolkit for doctors. HCA is taking a slow approach built on alleviating some of the burdens of their day to day job, he says, because he thinks once doctors start embracing AI, they’ll be positioned to guide the best way to use it for more complicated applications.
“I want clinicians to fully embrace AI as a partner that's making their life easier, before we start getting into some of those more controversial areas,” he says.

The business landscape has undergone a significant shift over the past few years because of artificial intelligence (AI). This technological advancement has innovated business practices and is changing the way we work.
Businesses are increasingly turning to AI to solve problems and perform tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence. Across different industries and occupations, AI is being used to detect patterns, make predictions and even create content.
However, the rapid rate of AI adoption is putting workplaces at risk of overlooking its potentially adverse impacts, particularly those that could impact the health and well-being of workers.
AI in the workplace
The type of AI currently being used in workplaces has a narrowly defined role. It primarily augments the work being performed by humans, as seen by customer service chatbots, robots working alongside factory workers or cancer diagnostic platforms.
The recent strike of the Writers Guild of America offers an example of workers in a field once previously thought to be shielded from automation fighting to protect their jobs from the use of generative AI to write scripts and produce creative content in Hollywood.
But future types of AI might be very different than the ones we are seeing now. In the future, AI that matches, or even surpasses, human intelligence might be introduced into workplaces. These stronger, more capable forms of AI will undoubtedly change the role of human workers.

Some economists project that up to 300 million full-time jobs could have some portion of their tasks performed by AI. Others predict that the quickly growing advancement and use of AI could also create a number of new jobs that require workers to work alongside machines.
Worker health and well-being
Throughout history, periods of technological transformation have introduced new tools to workplaces and altered working conditions in ways that have impacted worker health in both positive and negative ways. 
The increasing availability of smartphone technology, for example, has given rise to the digital gig economy characterized by temporary and freelance work, or short-term contracts. While this shift presents novel work opportunities, it also contributes to widespread labour market precarity that has negatively impacted the well-being of workers.

Our understanding of how AI will impact working conditions and worker health, however, is not yet clear. There are several ways in which current (and future) forms of AI could bring advantages and disadvantages to workers.
On one hand, AI could be used to perform strenuous tasks that pose the greatest risk to workers’ health. It could also identify occupational hazards and employees’ physical and mental well-being in real-time to quickly deliver health and safety solutions.

At the same time, AI being more applicable to some industries or occupations could result in inequities within the labour market. Currently, the occupations where AI is least useful are those that involve unpredictable and highly physical job tasks (e.g., nursing aides, janitors, food service workers) or those that have leadership responsibilities (e.g., chief executive officers).
Some predict AI has the potential to contribute to a hollowing out of the labour market, with widening income gaps and disparate effects on worker health.
The adoption of AI within the workplaces could also increase the intensity and stressfulness of work or create pressure among humans to keep up with machines. And in cases of biased design, AI could reinforce discriminatory workplace practices faced by workers from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.
Prioritizing health research on AI
According to a recent report led by the non-profit Institute for Work & Health and informed by a multidisciplinary team (including me), research about the health impacts of AI should take several critical directions.
There is a need for research to better understand how increasingly autonomous and advanced versions of AI will impact working conditions and worker health. Equally vital is the creation of a road map for AI design that optimizes health.
The report also underscores the importance of research that can be put into practice. Research needs to meaningfully inform discussions about the health and safety implications of AI adoption, as well as the regulations needed to safeguard human health.
Workers should also be able to access evidence to better understand the potential impacts of the technology — both harmful and helpful — on their jobs and well-being, and to gain practical insights on how to safely work alongside AI.
AI will bring rapid and large-scale changes to the working world. Without evidence of the health-related challenges and opportunities AI may present, it will be difficult for decision-makers to protect and promote worker health and safety. 
There is a critical need for research that can be used to understand, anticipate and address AI’s potential risks and opportunities for the human workforce, and to ensure that worker health and well-being is at the forefront of AI adoption.

The future of work has long been plagued by anxieties about automation. The newest technology to evoke both anxiety and optimism is generative AI.Questions have been raised regarding whether jobs may be replaced by AI as a result of advancements in generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard. Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilised as a spark for writing ideas and helping with repetitive content generation, yet it is unlikely that it will ever match the genuine originality of humans.Ultimately, the extent to which AI will take away jobs depends on various factors, including the rate of AI advancement, the willingness of businesses to integrate AI into their operations, government policies, and societal attitudes. Jobs will be enhanced by AI in the future. However, one may make the case that work replacement for some results in job augmentation for others. Although it is impossible to anticipate how generative AI will advance, discussions of this technology's potential importance for the future of work center on its present capabilities. So, is AI really poised to take over your job? Let&rsquo;s find out. The 'AI age' has arrivedAn important step forward in the public's exposure to AI technologies was marked with the introduction of ChatGPT. Machine learning models are beginning to engage with people in the real world as part of this new wave of technological change, showcasing its advantages and disadvantages.According to the Future of Jobs Report, approximately 75% of questioned enterprises anticipate implementing artificial intelligence, which will result in high churn, with 50% of organisations anticipating job growth and 25% anticipating job losses.      According to a research from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, artificial intelligence played a role in over 4,000 job losses last month as interest in the quickly developing technology's capacity to carry out sophisticated organisational functions and reduce workloads has increased. Analysts point out that while generative AI is still in its infancy, it is already producing new occupations, similar to other technologies that have displaced human employees.Disruptions aheadAccording to an IBM report, over the course of the next three years, the introduction of AI and automation will require 40 per cent of the workforce to upgrade their abilities. The 3.4 billion people employed worldwide, or about 1.4 billion, will be impacted.In the following years, we are likely to see a paradigm shift from humans helping machines to humans helping machines.According to the World Economic Forum, 85 million jobs would be lost to AI worldwide by 2025. Furthermore, according to the organisation's ""The Future of Jobs Report 2020,"" technology will add 97 million new jobs over the next few years.Artificial intelligence (AI) increases human productivity and intelligence. Although it is difficult to foresee change on a larger scale, it most certainly exceeds our expectations. Not only will AI improve the efficiency of coding, marketing, legal, and administrative tasks, but it will also fundamentally alter how all types of enterprises and organisations are created and operated.When 42% of organisations are considering how to utilise AI in the near future and 35% of businesses are currently utilising it, concerns about AI replacing jobs are justified. The likelihood of worker layoffs increases as AI technology develops and becomes less dependent on human participation, even though this does not necessarily imply that workers are being fired.What do the reports say?According to the ILO, businesses only think AI is capable of performing a limited set of tasks, thus it may complement human employment rather than displace it.The demand for quickly expanding skills, such as AI/machine learning, cloud computing, cybersecurity, product management, project management, and digital social media, represents a seismic shift in the job market with a billion jobs projected to dramatically change within the next ten years as a result of AI.Workers won't soon be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the IT giant IBM said in its analysis that those who use AI will replace those who don't.Around 300 million jobs, or 18% of all jobs worldwide, could be automated, according to a new Goldman Sachs analysis, with more developed countries being severely impacted than emerging markets.The worldwide corporate software, healthcare, and financial services industries are all projected to be significantly impacted by improvements in AI, according to a separate analysis from Goldman Sachs research. The corporate software sector appears to be entering the next wave of innovation after the growth of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud computing revolutionised how we function as a society, with well-known tech firms ready to release their own generative AI tools.      The bottom lineThe latest research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) of the United Nations asserts that while AI will revolutionise labour, it won't necessarily eliminate jobs.The ILO believes that while AI may not completely replace most professions, it may complement them. According to the ILO, businesses only think AI is capable of performing a limited set of tasks, thus it may complement human employment rather than displace it.There are two sides to this story: robots and artificial intelligence (AI) will displace certain human occupations, but they'll also bring about the creation of new ones. As AI technologies advance, new industries and business models may emerge, leading to the creation of jobs that we can't fully predict at this moment. Although it's possible that parts of your job duties could be replaced by AI, it's crucial to realise that AI does not always take the place of human workers. As a result of AI investments, many tasks will become obsolete, necessitating the development of new roles and capabilities. Hence, it will be safer to say that AI will not replace a job, but a person using AI will.","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,

SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Canva, the world’s only all-in-one visual communication platform, has released new data on professionals’ understanding of AI as its presence in the workplace and culture expands.


From the boardroom to recent graduates, professionals at every level are navigating the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence at work. As businesses race to reap the benefits of AI, employees are trying to balance their performance with spending time learning new tools, though many lack the time or resources to do so effectively. The result is a collective experience in which professionals are being inundated with conversation about AI, both at work and in their personal lives, but don’t yet have a deep or practical understanding of how to best use the technology.


The survey of 1,000 professionals in a business setting, conducted by global research and data partner Sago, indicates that employees are feeling increased pressure to appear tech-savvy and up to date with the latest trends amongst peers and friends. Amid this sea change, employers have an opportunity to foster AI skill-building to prevent imposter syndrome in the workplace.


The survey unveiled a range of reactions to AI’s rise:



Professionals feel a need to keep up appearances as they learn:


26% say they have sometimes exaggerated their knowledge of AI or generative AI at work to keep up with superiors or colleagues.



72% of professionals said they were familiar or very familiar with the term “artificial intelligence,” but this number dropped to 51% when asked about familiarity with “generative AI.”





Millennials are leading the uptake and adoption of AI, having the most positive perceptions of generative AI in the workplace:


59% said that they believe generative AI is part of the solution when it comes to helping humans achieve their full potential in the workplace, compared to 43% of Gen Z.



Meanwhile, over a third (36%) of Gen Z said they felt like AI is a problem when it comes to humans achieving their full potential at work, compared to 18% of millennials.





AI know-how is increasingly important outside of work, too:


While 35% of professionals have used AI tools in the workplace, more (43%) have used AI in a personal capacity.



21% of respondents say they have overstated their knowledge with friends and family. Why? 26% said it was because they did not want to look foolish for not knowing or needing to ask for clarification.





Even senior leaders feel behind when it comes to AI knowledge:


More than a third of senior leaders (VPs and above) said they have exaggerated their AI knowledge in work (38%) or personal (39%) settings, suggesting that when it comes to learning AI, the playing field is level despite differences in experience.





Despite their knowledge gaps, professionals clearly believe in the importance of learning AI:


41% of professionals worry that they will fall behind in their jobs if they don’t know how to leverage AI.



Those who have worked to improve their AI and generative AI knowledge find it fun (44%) and confidence-boosting (35%).





Given nearly all (85%) professionals indicated they are at least somewhat interested in improving their AI and generative AI skills and knowledge, employers may be well poised to offer time for learning and access to easy-to-learn tools that best suit their teams’ needs.


“The AI space is evolving faster than any one of us can grasp alone. It’s a simultaneously thrilling and overwhelming opportunity that people are naturally reacting differently to,“ said Cameron Adams, co-founder and Chief Product Officer at Canva. “In our product, we’ve tried to make it a no-brainer to start using AI when designing in Canva by embedding it in familiar or intuitive ways. A quick and empowering way to start learning AI is by using it for low-stakes tasks, like a meeting agenda or a lesson outline. Creating a culture of sharing AI experiences and learnings among teams can prevent people from feeling behind and spark new discoveries.”


To put respondents’ feelings about AI into perspective, Canva created five audience segments based on the data that reveal which professionals are driving – or detracting from – the conversation around generative AI:



Emerging leaders – 23% of professionals surveyed – committed themselves to learning AI over the past 4-6 months and are leading or actively participating in AI work conversations. These are the ""firstcomers"" or ""early adopters"" of workplace technology.



Learners – 13% of professionals – are starting to commit themselves to learning and are active listeners in AI conversations (soon-to-be emerging leaders). These are the ""fast followers"" of generative AI tools at the office.



AI Curious – 28% of professionals – this is the ""silent majority."" They are currently non-users but already see the connection to gen AI and their careers. They know they should start learning, but there's a blocker (this is the next group to ""convert"") and the way we do that is largely a) making gen AI practice ""fun and exciting,"" b) lean into curiosity at the consumer level to grow confidence for professional uses, and c) show how AI can help them do their work faster and improve quality.



Detractors – 19% of professionals – are those actively pushing against AI tech, calling it ""a fad"" and believing it's ""part of the problem"" at work.



Imposters – 17% of professionals – are often ambiguous, sometimes looking like emerging leaders (or other audiences), but their hallmark is that they admit they have stretched the truth about generative AI skills at work, and overreport knowing fake AI terms.

The workers differentiate pedestrians from palm trees in videos used to develop the algorithms for automated driving; they label images so AI can generate representations of politicians and celebrities; they edit chunks of text to ensure language models like ChatGPT don’t churn out gibberish.Share290 Comments",https://schema.org,BreadcrumbList,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2HIECN7JX2F4NHDT7RHZG3A3E.JPG&w=1600&h=900', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2HIECN7JX2F4NHDT7RHZG3A3E.JPG&w=1800&h=1800', 'height': 1800, 'width': 1800}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2HIECN7JX2F4NHDT7RHZG3A3E.JPG&w=800&h=600', 'height': 800, 'width': 600}]","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rebecca Tan', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/rebecca-tan/'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Regine Cabato', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/regine-cabato/'}]","{'@id': 'washingtonpost.com', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/img/wplogo_344x60_blk.png', 'width': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '344 px'}, 'height': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '60 px'}}, 'name': 'The Washington Post'}","Behind the AI boom, an army of overseas workers in ‘digital sweatshops’",2023-08-28T06:00:34.014Z,2023-08-29T22:42:24.766Z,,,False,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'World', 'position': 1, 'item': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/'}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Asia', 'position': 2, 'item': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/'}]",,,,,,,,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/28/scale-ai-remotasks-philippines-artificial-intelligence/,,Scale AI’s Remotasks workers in the Philippines cry foul over low pay,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent', 'isAccessibleForFree': False}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Washington Post', 'productID': 'washingtonpost.com:basic', 'description': 'Breaking news and analysis on politics, business, world, national news, entertainment and more.

Syrian media institutions are still far from the accelerating pace of the artificial intelligence revolution and are not effective in investing in it to develop various journalistic styles at a time when international media outlets are employing artificial intelligence in their work and in developing creative content and in front of the tendency of major technical companies to program applications that serve the traditional press.
The obstacles affecting AI in Syrian newsrooms are divided between logistical, technical, and knowledge obstacles, in addition to government restrictions that limit access to some of these tools for journalists residing inside Syria.





In this file, Enab Baladi discusses AI benefits for journalists and asks experts, academics, and journalists about its risks to the profession and the consequences of keeping pace with this development or not on media institutions.
Tools for journalists and organizations
Artificial intelligence has been associated with various fields, including the world of journalism, some of which benefit journalists in their daily work and some that benefit media corporations in providing better access to their audience.
Shehata al-Sayed, CEO of the Osh Group for Technology and Artificial Intelligence Industries, told Enab Baladi that the field of journalism and media is witnessing rapid developments with the advent of AI technologies and its use in this field and that by using appropriate tools, journalists can be helped to produce high-quality news content in a faster time.
One of the most important areas in which artificial intelligence tools benefit journalists is the ability to generate texts and preliminary content based on available data and facts, which saves time and effort in preparing reports. Also, summarizing tools allow journalists to quickly summarize long texts to extract key points.
Machine translation enables journalists to cover events from different regions in multiple languages accurately and quickly, while smart search tools provide the ability to search a huge amount of information to obtain relevant quotes and figures, according to al-Sayed.
Advanced tools allow verification of information and allegations, while other tools provide the ability to produce visual and audio content, including graphics, video clips, and audio, with high quality and lower cost.
Thanks to advanced forecasting and data analysis techniques, audience patterns and trends can be detected, which helps produce more in-depth and specialized press materials, according to al-Sayed.
Investigative journalist Abdul-Latif Haj Mohammad, a graduate of the London School of Economics in the field of discovering artificial intelligence and studying in the field of ethics in artificial intelligence, told Enab Baladi that in the midst of the “artificial intelligence revolution,” countless tools have emerged that can help journalists in different ways. Among them is the Bard tool that Google recently launched in Arabic, and it is one of the other tools the company is working on, according to Haj Mohammad.
Google is testing a tool known internally as Project Genesis that could take details of current events, for example, and generate news content from them, people familiar with the matter told The New York Times in July.
Google offered this tool to major American news organizations, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and News Corp, which owns several media outlets, which expressed concern about the “ridiculing” of this tool for the effort of journalists in producing accurate and creative material.
The AI tool, according to News Corp, is a kind of personal assistant for journalists to automate some tasks and save time while taking into account ethical responsibility, and that it will help guide the publishing industry away from errors of generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT.

Technologies towards better audience reach
The 2023 annual report of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism highlighted the public’s tendency to receive information through social media, and with the development of technologies added to these platforms using artificial intelligence, the report recommended that the media focus more on determining how social media can be used to attract new people to follow.
The report warned of a wave of personalized news content driven by artificial intelligence but potentially “unreliable.”
AI technology can be used to create news summaries and personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors, which can help journalists reach a larger audience and create more relevant and engaging news, according to investigative journalist Haj Mohammad.
Among the artificial intelligence systems currently available, Haj Mohammad sees three technologies that publishers should be looking for and media leaders should invest in:

 Natural Language Processing (NLP): These are artificial intelligence systems that can read, write, translate, and generate texts, such as the ChatGPT platform that is based on Neuro-Linguistic Programming technology.


 The recommendation system: It is an artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning and deep learning, and it can be used to customize sites. Examples of its uses include users receiving advertisements for products they searched for previously, and it is also used in article recommendations.


 Computer vision or image recognition: It is a technology that has the ability to recognize images.

Through the latest technology, representatives from eight global news organizations worked on a project called “AIJO” (an abbreviation of the first two letters of artificial intelligence and the first two letters of journalism in English), which takes advantage of the power of artificial intelligence in several criteria, including, to understand, identify and mitigate newsroom biases, by identifying men and women in images, and calculating how equal they appear in reports and news, similarly to how much ethnic diversity is in the published news space.
In turn, the CEO of Osh Technology Group, Shehata al-Sayed, said that through predictive modeling technology, current news events and public opinion trends can be predicted using data, which allows the production of relevant content.
Search engines within the news site must be optimized to make them smarter to meet the search needs of readers, and bots can be used to automate routine tasks, such as publishing content and monitoring social media, according to al-Sayed.




Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation or approximation of human intelligence in machines. The goals of artificial intelligence include computer-enhanced learning, reasoning, and perception. AI is being used today across different industries, from finance to healthcare.
There are currently many applications of artificial intelligence, the most important of which are expert systems, natural language processing, voice recognition, machine vision, or image recognition. Artificial intelligence as a term has been used in its current form since 2003 and is taught academically as a branch of computer science.




Barriers to the use of artificial intelligence in the Syrian press
Syrian media corporations and their journalists face many obstacles to using the new tools of artificial intelligence, which threatens the possibility of benefiting from them in developing their work and the content presented to the public, whether it is visual, audio, or written.
These obstacles are divided into three main sections: financial, technical, and training.
Arabic language, cognitive deficiency, and authoritarian grip
The technical barriers that organizations and independent journalists face are directly related to two main factors. The first is that most of the new tools do not support the Arabic language.
This may create a major obstacle for the journalist during his work, as well as the media not investing in departments where programmers, data analysts, and journalists meet to design and test tools that serve journalistic work, whether through artificial intelligence or otherwise.
According to the Syrian journalist Murad al-Quwatli, Syrian institutions, like their Arab counterparts, are waiting for and trying to use what is produced in the United States and Europe, but not all tools and programs that serve journalistic work reach the region, and if they do arrive, their use is restricted by the fact that they are tools of the institution that developed and produced them. Therefore, it is rare for an Arab media outlet to have its own artificial intelligence tool.
The CEO of Osh Group, Shehata al-Sayed, told Enab Baladi that the most prominent difficulties are the scarcity of AI tools and applications in the Arabic language compared to the English language in terms of morphology, parsing, and grammar and that the leading companies in this field are preoccupied with working in the English language, as it is a global and dominant language.
In addition to the foregoing, the poor accuracy of some machine translation tools and automatic transcription of Arabic texts due to the complexities of the latter, the lack of availability of data and the huge Arabic content needed to train artificial intelligence models, and the difficulty of accessing advanced algorithms, because a limited number of companies control them.
According to al-Sayed, these problems can be solved by encouraging Arab startups to develop artificial intelligence tools suitable for the Arabic language and the needs of media content, making huge data sets available to the private and public sectors, to train and develop artificial intelligence algorithms, and establishing joint laboratories between universities and media institutions, to research and develop the use of AI in journalistic work.
This requires providing the necessary technical infrastructure, including devices and networks, to accommodate these technologies, according to the AI expert.
Haj Mohammad sees continuous learning as an important tool in the hands of journalists, and they can allocate time to learn about what is new and changes that occur in the profession of journalism.
One of the obstacles is the process of training on artificial intelligence tools, which may require a certain experience to deal with them in order to reach the best possible results, and in light of the lack of access to all technologies to the Syrian and Arab press institutions, this seems difficult.
Al-Quwatli pointed out that Europe and the United States already have institutions that provide training on artificial intelligence tools, but the Middle East and North Africa region needs more time.
Al-Quwatli believes that media organizations and journalists in Syria and the Arab region are still new to learning about the capabilities of artificial intelligence in journalistic work, which began practically with the ChatGPT boom in 2022.
He added to Enab Baladi that this does not mean that there are many journalists who have come a long way in increasing their skills by using artificial intelligence tools and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and their experience can be used.
In addition to the above, there is no talk in the Syrian press or among Syrian journalists inside Syria about the use of artificial intelligence in their work, as the authorities block the websites of the most popular artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT and Bard.
The Syrian authorities are constantly blocking various websites and pages on the Internet, most of which are opposition-affiliated websites, including some useful global websites such as social media, but they later lifted the ban on social media after popular pressure.

Financial barriers to independent institutions
Most AI tools offer paid services with annual or monthly subscriptions, and some of these tools require special training for journalists to learn to use them, which leads to additional financial burdens for organizations or freelance journalists.
These obstacles pose a challenge to independent press organizations, which may not receive significant annual funding from a specific entity on a continuous and permanent basis.
Al-Quwatli says that the high financial cost of artificial intelligence programs and tools poses a challenge to invest in them, explaining that artificial intelligence tools are not limited to ChatGPT, but there are programs and tools dedicated to analyzing data, audience behavior, etc., and the cost of subscription is high.
While press institutions in the region are facing great financial challenges, they also find themselves facing a new challenge represented in investing in artificial intelligence tools, whether by producing them or subscribing to paid services, according to al-Quwatli.
New AI tools play an active role in journalism and its development, which prompted al-Quwatli to create his own guide in which he collected these tools while analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, pointing out that journalistic institutions that do not pay attention to AI will find themselves very late in the next five years.
The CEO of Osh, al-Sayed, told Enab Baladi that the high cost of owning artificial intelligence tools and the difficulty of financing them by media institutions is one of the major difficulties faced by journalistic work.
The establishment of financial support funds and business incubators to support artificial intelligence projects is one of the solutions that institutions can follow to solve this problem, according to al-Sayed.
For his part, journalist Haj Mohammad said that only large media companies have the necessary financial resources to invest in expensive technologies and develop their own algorithms in this field.
While al-Quwatli believes that there are few solutions in this context, it remains for journalists and institutions to resort to using free copies as a temporary solution despite their limited usefulness and the inability to use them for free for a long time.

Does AI threaten journalists?
The speed of digital transformation threatened hundreds of thousands of jobs globally as the business world changes over time, and the future of work indicates an enlightened perspective on what companies and institutions need according to the data of digitization and technological developments amid the increasing revolution of robots and estimates of artificial intelligence solutions as a substitute for humans in many jobs.
According to a study by McKinsey and Company for global management consulting on the future of work for the year 2023, one in 16 workers may have to change their profession by 2030, representing more than 100 million workers across the economies of eight major countries, which together represent more than 60% of the world’s population.
The study considered that job growth will be more concentrated in jobs that require high skills, such as healthcare or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
In terms of journalism and media work, the Reuters Institute for Digital News 2023 report showed that the public prefers to get news from celebrities, influencers, and social media personalities rather than journalists and media professionals.
And the projections of the Center for Education and Workforce at Georgetown University in the United States showed that newsroom jobs, including visual and radio news anchor, reporter, and staff writer, will decrease by 3% from 2022 to 2031.
Auxiliary, not obsessive
Dr. Mona Abdel Maksoud, assistant professor at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo University, told Enab Baladi that the future of journalistic work with artificial intelligence is a “promising” future due to its rapid development.
Abdel Maksoud believes that it saves the journalist from many tasks that used to consume his time and effort in order to produce routine work that does not require much creativity.
The assistant professor at the Faculty of Mass Communication gave an example that artificial intelligence will save the journalist the work of collecting and organizing information, dealing with big data, and revising it, as it was before, as the journalist currently relies on simultaneous translation, access to a number of information sources through open sources, as well as communication with decision makers and departments of officials through social media platforms.
In the part related to verifying information, Abdel Maksoud pointed out that the past period witnessed the development of a large number of tools that can help the journalist verify and revise the information and base it on evidence and data in order to start relying on it in monitoring.




Investing in AI in developing the journalist’s work will save a lot of effort and make him focus on creative and innovative matters, and any journalist who has not and will not develop his tools with or without artificial intelligence is writing the end of his journalistic career himself.
Dr. Mona Abdel Maksoud – Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo University




Mattia Peretti, who manages JournalismAI — a research and training project at Polis, the international journalism think tank of the London School of Economics, considered that artificial intelligence does not steal journalistic jobs nor replace the journalist, but it can take on some tasks, and the user decides what they are.
Peretti stated that artificial intelligence can carry out several tasks that support the work of the journalist, and like any other technical innovation before, it changes the roles of the newsroom, but it is up to journalists after that to decide what they ask of artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence does not have ambition in itself, nor the ability to steal jobs in the foreseeable future.
Dr. Arwa al-Kali, a trainer in data journalism, media, and news verification, believes that artificial intelligence cannot take over the work of information fact-checkers, but rather it can assist and guide them through various tools, and information-checkers are the ones who verify the authenticity of the news and the validity of its sources.
Al-Kali stated that it is not possible to rely on artificial intelligence to generate journalistic work because what it provides needs to be scrutinized, and it also provides false information and can confuse.
The trainer al-Kali’s assessment came during a training session that Enab Baladi attended virtually on information auditing and artificial intelligence, presented by the Pamela Howard Forum to cover global crises in cooperation with the International Journalists’ Network (IJNet).
After many information errors were discovered in AI platforms for generative conversations, the term “AI hallucinations” appeared, which describes chatbots fabricating the information provided, a problem that many technical experts doubt can be solved.
Keeping abreast of AI
The academic, Abdel Maksoud, expected that the journalist who is content with only collecting information manually, machine translation, or superficial media interviews, or even limiting himself to basic analytical skills and ordinary routine skills, will “disappear” and will have no place in the future of journalism.
Even with regard to critical thinking, problem-solving, innovation, and creativity, Abdel Maksoud suggested reaching a certain stage in the future in which artificial intelligence would be a competitor to humans, pointing to the need for people to be prepared for how to employ intelligence to serve their capabilities and capacities.
According to the Reuters Institute report on the trends and expectations of journalism, media, and technology for 2023, it is necessary to train journalists to work with artificial intelligence in order to avoid or reduce the effects of job displacement that it may cause.
The report pointed out the need for news organizations to invest in training journalists to work with artificial AI systems effectively and for news organizations, developers, and regulatory bodies to cooperate to set standards and guidelines for the ethical use of generative artificial intelligence in journalism.

Does it threaten journalists’ charter of ethics?
Various media outlets follow work mechanisms and professional charters that govern the manner in which they deal with various aspects of work.
Although these charters differ in their linguistic form, in line with the institution’s work style, identity, and the extent of its independence, at least six principles of journalism and media values constitute a common denominator that many media outlets seek to achieve in their coverage, namely accuracy, impartiality, objectivity, integrity, credibility, and independence.
In the face of any differences between what is narrow at the institutional level and what is broader at the professional level as a whole, in June 2019, the International Declaration of Professional Ethics for Journalists was adopted, which is an amended version of the Bordeaux Declaration issued in 1954, under the name of the International Federation of Journalists’ Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists.
The amended declaration consists of a preamble and 16 clauses specifying the rules and method for the journalist’s dealings with his sources and colleagues and the methods that can be used to obtain news and data, with the necessity for the journalist to acknowledge that fraud, distortion of facts, slander, spreading abuse and smearing reputation and unfounded accusations are a serious professional failure.
Articles 5 and 6 of the Declaration stipulated that the principle of speed in disseminating breaking information or news should not take precedence over the principles of verifying its sources and giving the concerned parties the opportunity to respond to them. The journalist should also make every effort to correct any information published that turns out to be inaccurate.
Faced with these principles and many others that fall within the same framework, workers in journalism and information verification stress the necessity of having rules for artificial intelligence that define what is available and possible and help the journalist in developing his tools and what is dangerous to the profession and affects its ethics in terms of undisciplined practices or uses.
The founder of the Verify-Sy platform, Ahmed Primo, told Enab Baladi that talking about standards governing the uses of artificial intelligence is not premature, as misleading, inaccurate, or fake content using artificial intelligence techniques is present and widespread, and major media organizations and journalists have fallen into the trap, and the content has been treated as accurate content, like the pictures that spread of the arrest of former US President Donald Trump.
In Primo’s opinion, these matters added a burden on fact-checkers and journalists to raise awareness for users of communication sites, media institutions, and journalists.
In terms of artificial intelligence means to combat misleading content, there are some techniques that people may use for research motives that do not start with curiosity and do not stop at research purposes, which provide exaggerated content, completely subjective, what calls for concern about the future of journalism or information, whether as journalists or contemporaries of a new experience present strongly.




It is necessary to develop media codes of honor and standards that journalists follow with regard to AI, and this takes a long time to reach our Arab region and a longer time for the journalist and the recipients of information to understand it at the same time.
Ahmed Primo – Founder of the Verify-Sy platform




The recipient is exposed daily to a lot of misinformation with the emergence of content that is not subject to the standards of accuracy and objectivity.
However, access to artificial intelligence will facilitate the spread of the phenomenon of “fake journalists,” “fake programmers,” and “fake artists.” These tools do not mimic everyone’s professions, but they will turn many into incompetent people in their professions, according to Primo.
The issue requires a lot of effort, awareness, and caution, as the image today can lie, and the sound can be imitated, or an exact copy can be created, according to the founder of the Verify-Sy platform.
Primo stressed the need to develop tools for fact-checkers and those affected by this phenomenon to come up with means that enable them to discover content based on this technology and distinguish it from unreal content, with the need to spread more media awareness and create curricula related to media education to teach it, similar to curricula for erasing technology illiteracy.
Investigative journalist Abdul-Latif Haj Mohammad agrees with Primo that the development of some programs to a large extent in generating and organizing information does not negate the role of the journalist in verifying the information he receives, without denying that there are basics in verifying information, photos, videos and different types of data that some journalists have not realized yet.
Haj Mohammad also indicated the need to work on a comprehensive guide that outlines the broad lines for the use of artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence systems can have a built-in bias by creators that leads to prioritizing certain stories or viewpoints over others or neglecting human groups on political grounds, for example, and stifling its views.
Journalist Murad al-Quwatli believes that holding discussions at the level of press institutions is a means of determining the mechanisms for using artificial intelligence and identifying the ethical and professional aspects in dealing with this technology.
This necessitates cooperation between journalistic institutions, specifically in a region such as the Middle East, in a way that serves to advance journalistic work and agree on the basis for new tools in the profession, concludes al-Quwatli.

Enab Baladi asked AI
ChatGPT is one of the most popular artificial intelligence tools, which is used in many fields and sectors, including journalism.
Enab Baladi asked ChatGPT what it can offer to journalists, and its answer was as follows:
1- Idea generation: The tool can help journalists exchange ideas about articles, headlines, and news story angles by providing a brief general idea on a specific topic and requesting a model for generating creative ideas.
2- Research assistance: The tool can be used to collect basic information or statistics and contexts for reports and articles by requesting the provision of data, facts, or explanations related to the requested topic.
3- Drafting and planning: It can help draft outlines or initial drafts of articles by asking for expansion in different sections or obtaining supporting details.
4- Preparing for press interviews: The tool can be used to simulate interview questions and answers. This helps anticipate possible responses and improve the final result.
5- Editing and Proofreading: The tool helps review and edit written content, suggest sentences with alternative wording, and correct grammatical and spelling errors.
6- Accuracy: The tool helps verify the validity and accuracy of information before it is presented to the public.
7- Explain complex topics: The tool can explain complex topics to journalists in simple ways, which is reflected in the materials presented to the public later.
8- Breaking news: ChatGPT can generate quick summaries based on the available information, which helps in the completion of breaking news.
9- Interactive content: The tool helps create interactive elements such as surveys and tests.
10- Translation: It provides fast translation from several different languages.
ChatGPT concluded that although it is a valuable tool for journalists, it is essential to verify the information received and for the journalist to be aware of ethical considerations and potential biases within the information.

Most Americans haven’t used ChatGPT; few think it will have a major impact on their job
By Eugenie Park and Risa Gelles-Watnick

For the latest survey data on ChatGPT, see “Americans’ use of ChatGPT is ticking up, but few trust its election information.”
The debut of ChatGPT has led some tech experts to declare it part of a “robot revolution.” But most Americans haven’t used ChatGPT, and only a small share think chatbots will have a major impact on their jobs. Even fewer Americans say chatbots would be helpful for their own work, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted July 17-23.
How we did this
Pew Research Center has long explored Americans’ perspectives on emerging technologies and uses of artificial intelligence. The current study examined adults’ experiences with chatbots such as ChatGPT, particularly in relation to their jobs. This survey was conducted among 5,057 U.S. adults from July 17 to 23, 2023. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race and ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.
Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

Who has used ChatGPT?

Among those who have heard of ChatGPT, 24% say they have ever used it. That amounts to 18% of U.S. adults overall.

Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have used ChatGPT. Among those who have heard about ChatGPT, about four-in-ten adults under 30 have used it; that share drops to 19% when looking at 50- to 64-year-olds and to just 5% for those 65 and older.


College-educated Americans stand out: 32% of adults who have a college degree or more education and have heard of ChatGPT have used it.


Among those who have heard of the chatbot, men are more likely than women to report using ChatGPT (29% vs. 19%).

How do Americans use ChatGPT?

One-in-five U.S. adults who have heard of ChatGPT say they have ever used it for entertainment. A similar share (19%) say they have used it to learn something, while 16% of those who have heard of the tool and are employed say they have used it for tasks at work.
Younger adults are more likely than their older peers to have used ChatGPT for education or amusement. For example, among those who have heard of ChatGPT, three-in-ten adults under 30 have used it for learning, compared with 11% of those 50 and older.
Similarly, 29% of adults who are under 50 and have heard of ChatGPT have used it for entertainment, while 10% of their older counterparts have done the same.
There is a similar pattern among employed adults who have heard of the tool: Those under 50 are more likely than those 50 and older to report having used ChatGPT for work (18% vs. 10%).
Adults with a high school education or less who have heard of ChatGPT are significantly less likely than their peers with higher levels of formal education to have used ChatGPT for entertainment, learning or work. For example, among those who have heard of ChatGPT, 13% who have a high school diploma or less say they have used it to learn something new, compared with roughly one-in-five or more of those with some college (21%), a bachelor’s degree (19%) or a postgraduate education (26%).
How has ChatGPT use changed recently?

More Americans who have heard of ChatGPT are using it for work and learning today than when the Center first asked about this in the spring. For example, the share of employed adults who have heard of ChatGPT and have used it for work tasks increased from 12% in March to 16% in the new survey, which was conducted in July. The share who have used ChatGPT to learn something has also risen slightly during this time.
Which industries do Americans think will be most affected by chatbots?
Generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT may have its greatest impact on jobs that were traditionally thought to be immune from automation – namely, higher-paying jobs that require a college education.

In the Center’s new survey, about half or more of those who have heard of ChatGPT say chatbots will have a major impact on software engineers (56%), graphic designers (54%) and journalists (52%) over the next 20 years. Smaller shares think chatbots will have a major effect on teachers (44%) or lawyers (31%).  
But Americans are less likely to think chatbots will impact their own job. Some 19% of employed adults who have heard of ChatGPT think chatbots will have a major impact on their job. Another 36% say it will have a minor impact and 27% expect no impact at all.
Which Americans are most likely to think chatbots will affect their own jobs?

Among employed adults who have heard of ChatGPT, 60% of those ages 30 to 49 say chatbots will have a major or minor impact on their own job in the next 20 years. This is the highest percentage of any age group.
Those with more formal education are also more likely to think chatbots will have an impact on their job. For example, among working adults who have heard of ChatGPT, 71% of those who have a postgraduate degree say this, compared with 60% of those with a bachelor’s degree only and even smaller shares of those with some college (48%) or a high school diploma or less (42%).
Views on this question also vary by industry.

Those who work in information and technology and have heard of ChatGPT are the most likely to say chatbots will have a major or minor impact on their job. Three-quarters of these workers say this, including 37% who say chatbots will have a major impact on their work.
Around two-thirds (66%) of those who have heard of ChatGPT and work in education banking, finance, accounting, real estate or insurance think chatbots will affect their job.
At the other end of the spectrum, 40% of adults who have heard of ChatGPT and work in hospitality, service, arts, entertainment or recreation say chatbots will affect their job.
Will chatbots help people do their jobs?

Most employed Americans don’t anticipate chatbots being very helpful for their own work. Only 15% of working adults who have heard of ChatGPT say chatbots would be extremely or very helpful for their job, with 5% saying they would be extremely helpful.
Younger workers who have heard of ChatGPT are more optimistic that chatbots would help them do their job.
Workers with higher levels of formal education are also more optimistic. Those who have heard of ChatGPT and have a college degree are slightly more likely than those without a college degree to say these types of tools would be helpful for their job.
How do Americans feel about government regulation of chatbots?

The emergence of ChatGPT has sparked conversations about government regulation of artificial intelligence.  
Asked which is their greater concern, two-thirds of those who have heard of ChatGPT say it’s that government will not go far enough in regulating chatbot use. Some 31% instead say their greater concern is that the government will go too far.  
Of those who have heard of ChatGPT, majorities of Democrats and Republicans say their greater concern is not enough regulation. But this view is more common among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents than among their Republican and Republican-leaning counterparts (75% vs. 59%).
CORRECTION (Oct. 25, 2023): In a previous version of this post, the chart on views about chatbots and government regulation incorrectly stated that the findings were based on employed adults. The chart is based on adults who have heard of ChatGPT. This change does not affect the analysis or conclusions.
Note: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

16:31:54Africa/Tripoli,,,,,,,,"Libya’s Tripoli-based Ministry of Economy and Trade is discussing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform ideas into products of economic value.

The discussions took place last Thursday (24 August) during the first meeting of the Artificial Intelligence Committee to study the mechanisms of employing AI to develop the efficiency of economic and institutional performance held at the Ministry.

The meeting discussed ways to develop a mechanism to support the process of converting ideas into products of economic value for the transition to the knowledge economy and the employment of artificial intelligence to develop the efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of the national economy and to create a stimulating work environment.

Regarding the committee and its objectives, the Spokesperson for the Ministry of Economy and Trade and member of the Artificial Intelligence Committee, Fawzi Wadi, told <em>Libya Herald </em>that the committee was established by a decision of the Minister of Economy and Trade, Mohamed Al-Hwej. Its aim is to achieve maximum benefit from the technical and informational development in the world and the boom in the field of financial and business technology to ensure the establishment of a diversified economy based on sound scientific foundations.

Wadi pointed out to work on improving the indicators of the knowledge economy in Libya to reduce the gap between it and the developed countries in this field and to take advantage of the returns offered by this economy, which calls for diagnosing the reality of the national economy and shedding light on the most important challenges facing Libya and ways to overcome them to reach a knowledge economy.

He stressed the development of an action plan that guarantees the use of AI to serve the Libyan economy and in line with the available capabilities and creative ideas of Libyan youth and to ensure the success of their projects. The Ministry of Economy and Trade seeks, he added, through its various mechanisms and affiliated institutions to find local and international financing opportunities for them in addition to supporting projects based on innovation and renewal.",,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://libyaherald.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",Economy Ministry discussing use of artificial intelligence to transform ideas into products of economic value,2023-08-27 16:31:54,2023-08-27 14:31:54,,

How will AI impact the job market?




story by Allison Sylte
published Aug. 31, 2023
















Are robots coming for us? 
According to one study, roughly half of our jobs could be done by existing automation technologies. Meanwhile, the STEM fields that were considered some of the safest careers in the not so distant past are now thought to be some of the most vulnerable to being replaced by artificial intelligence. 
“This is critical, because previous waves of automation have always affected mostly low-skilled jobs that require routine tasks,” said Boris Nikolaev, an assistant professor in the Colorado State University College of Business. “The new wave of AI technologies, however, will have the biggest effect on white-collar jobs that require significant personal investment in education, like finance, marketing, writing and legal services.”
Nikolaev has started to teach the next generation of business leaders how to embrace potentially disruptive technology through a new class called “Artificial Intelligence and Strategic Value Creation,” which offers students the opportunity to learn the mechanisms behind AI, how it can help with certain tasks and the potential ethical pitfalls that might exist along the way.
“To quote an IBM study: ‘AI won’t replace people, but people who use AI will replace people who don’t,’” Nikolaev said. 













How concerned should we be about losing our jobs to AI?








Worries about jobs lost to new advancements are hardly new. 
Two centuries ago, 90% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture, but as technology has improved, less manpower has been required for the same output, placing that number at closer to 2% in the modern day. Meanwhile, workers have simply shifted careers into fields that require a human skillset, be it manufacturing when there was less demand in the agricultural sector to delivery driving and programming when e-commerce changed the face of traditional retail. 










“Historically, new technologies have created winners and losers among workers and sectors, depending on their ability to adjust to changing skill set requirements and occupational structures.” ”
— Boris Nikolaev, assistant professor, College of Business










Teaching the next generation how to work with AI 
That’s why it’s all the more important for workers to embrace – rather than resist – an increasingly automated world. Gaurav Jetley, an assistant professor of computer information systems in the CSU College of Business, teaches two courses catering to all backgrounds of students that explain how AI and machine learning models work, where to apply them and how they can be used to create actionable business insights. 
Jetley says he encourages all of his students to at least learn rudimentary coding skills as well as how to become comfortable with adapting to new software. 
“Lifelong learning and adaptability have always been keys to success, since what is the norm today may be a relic of the past as soon as the next month,” he said. 
While AI might be more efficient for certain tasks, Jetley said the next generation of workers should focus on developing their critical thinking and ability to adapt to changing situations, and plan on pursuing continued education as new skill sets become more in demand. 
To put it more succinctly, some skills won’t fall by the wayside. “In a way, there’s nothing to worry about,” Nikolaev said. “Just be yourself: a human.”

Artificial intelligence is upending many industries at the moment, and in the filmmaking world, a key area that is currently under threat of automation is storyboarding. 
Numerous AI tools have been released this year with the aim of replacing storyboard artists, and among the most advanced-looking I’ve run across is Storyboarder.ai, which claims to offer a solution to the “laborious and time-consuming process” of storyboarding. The company proposes that it can create “professional storyboards quickly and effortlessly.”
The video below describes how it works. Users upload a PDF of their screenplay to the cloud-based platform. The software then analyzes the script to create a shotlist. The user then reviews the shot descriptions, and selects some general settings for each shot. The program then generates the images, which can be further refined for style and content. 

The product is developed by Germany’s Fynal, a film production company based in Dortmund and Essen that bills itself as the “largest film production [company] in the Ruhr area.” 
A competing product is Storyboardhero from Singaporean tech company Ilathys. This product requires the user to create their script within the software, which doesn’t seem as useful as Storyboarder’s automated analysis of a script written in an industry-standard format.
Jean-Christophe Bouglé, co-founder of StoryboardHero, says, “We have been creating videos for clients for more than 10 years through our video agency called Fewstones. It used to take us days to create scripts and storyboards. That’s why we created StoryboardHero, an AI storyboard generator. We have been able to drastically reduce the time needed to create full storyboards for our clients and prospects.” 
One curious feature of Storyboardhero is the company also offers an option for its in-house artists to redraw the storyboards, which seems to defeat the purpose of using their software in the first place.
While these are storyboard-specific AI programs, it’s becoming clear that people are also using more generic AI tools for the purpose of boarding. In this Youtube video, the creators explain how they’re using the generative AI program Runway to create a primitive version of storyboards:


Amid’s Take: In the near-term, these AI storyboard tools appear to have greater applicability to live-action filmmakers than animation, because production storyboards in animation have to convey much more information than just shot composition and framing. However, it’s not difficult to envision a near-future where animation producers begin incorporating these technologies into productions, which would allow them to hire fewer storyboard artists whose role would be to refine pre-existing AI-generated boards.
What cannot be denied is that these technologies are progressing faster than the animation industry’s response to the tech. AI will soon be a competitor for industry jobs that have existed for the last century in animation production. Artists (and their representative unions) need to develop a response to this new threat and make clear to producers why human board artists should not, and more importantly cannot, be replaced by AI technologies.

Walmart: Generative AI tool will assist workers, not replace them

Walmart has deployed My Assistant, a generative AI tool for employees to help with generating content generation and summarizing large documents, acting as an overall ""creative partner"" for employees.







In detailing the new tool Wednesday, Walmart officials also tried to address broad concerns that AI tools like this will replace employees.
""There continues to be heightened debate about AI and automation, as well as its impact on the future of work,"" wrote Donna Morris, executive vice president and chief people officer, and Cheryl Ainoa, executive vice president of new business and emerging technologies, in a post on LinkedIn. ""Here's our belief: it will take both people and technology to deliver on our purpose to help people save money and live better.""
Generative AI ""can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it's trained on,"" the executives wrote.
This technology will free employees ""from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing more time and focus for improving the customer/member experience,"" according to the blog post.
Walmart may be ahead of some of the major HR vendors in releasing generative AI tools to help with employee productivity. Analysts and vendors see HR departments as significant users of the technology because their work substantially involves tasks where generative AI has seen successes, including communications, report writing and data analysis.

GenAI and productivity promises
""What Walmart is doing is intriguing because it's putting some of the highly personalized aspects of generative AI directly into the hands of the workforce,"" said Ben Eubanks, chief research officer at Lighthouse Research & Advisory.

To illustrate how generative AI tools can be helpful to employees, Eubanks imagined some of the prompts employees can enter, such as, ""Explain my healthcare benefits in language a high school graduate can understand,"" or, ""During orientation, who are three people who I should connect with?""
In a new report, the Boston Consulting Group believes generative AI could boost HR productivity by up to 30%. It said generative AI can accomplish this by ""dramatically increasing self-service"" as well as content creation, visualization and as much as half of onboarding tasks.
""Generative AI promises to lower the frictions and boundaries between humans and software in a way we haven't seen before,"" said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Gownder sees generative AI as a powerful aid for customer-facing roles. ""Navigating traditional mobile apps can be time-consuming and requires a learning curve,"" he said.
But a natural language generative AI interface can become a bridge to interact with backend systems such as inventory databases, making it easier for frontline workers ""while also lowering the burden of training them to use multiple software systems,"" he said.Patrick Thibodeau covers HCM and ERP technologies for TechTarget Editorial.

Dive Brief:

Walmart rolled out My Assistant, a generative AI-powered tool, to all non-store U.S. employees, the company announced Wednesday. 
The feature is available to 50,000 employees in a desktop and mobile app interface within Me@Campus, the company’s employee app. The tool can accelerate draft writing, act as a creative partner or summarize large documents, according to Walmart. 
The company also expects to use the tool for new hires during orientation and to help employees better understand company benefits during annual enrollment. Walmart will continue to build out the tool to support integrated self-service capabilities. 





















Dive Insight:
As enterprises grow more familiar with what generative AI can do for employees, adoption at scale has picked up among the largest organizations.
Commercial real estate company JLL released its proprietary large language model to its more than 103,000-member workforce earlier this month. Consulting firm PwC is rolling out its conversational AI assistant to employees in a phased approach, with around 1,000 employees having access to the tool as of August 15. McKinsey also equipped 7,000 employees with a generative AI tool this month.
Walmart has now joined the pack, giving access to its generative AI tool to more than 50,000 corporate employees. The company said it does not believe generative AI will take over for workers, but rather serve as a tool to allow employees to spend less time on monotonous, repetitive tasks. 
“Generative AI can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on,” said Donna Morris, EVP and chief people officer at Walmart, and Cheryl Ainoa, EVP, new businesses and emerging technologies at Walmart, in a LinkedIn post Wednesday. “For out-of-the-box, truly brand-new thinking – that’s what humans are good at.”

The discount giant is including a generative AI-based feature called “My Assistant” in the new Me@Campus “super app” it is providing to tens of thousands of corporate employees. Generative AI is based on machine learning (ML) and can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.
The Me@Campus app also has features designed to aid employees in managing their careers, and finances, obtaining required learnings, and working on teams. Walmart says it is also working toward using the app for new associate orientation and to help associates better understand and choose their benefits during annual enrollment. 
In a LinkedIn post, Donna Morris, executive VP, chief people officer and Cheryl Ainoa, executive VP, new businesses and emerging technologies, Walmart, said MyAssistant will help employees with tasks such as speeding up the drafting process, serving as a creative partner, and summarizing large documents.
Ideally, Walmart hopes this technology will free employees from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing them more time and focus for improving the customer experience. In June 2023, the company rolled out the Walmart GenAI Playground, an early-stage internal generative AI tool where employees  can explore and learn about the new technology. 
“My Assistant has the potential to change how our associates work and solve problems,” Morris and Ainoa said in the LinkedIn post. “The conversation around GenAI continues to grow, sparking interest and curiosity around how it will reshape our work, interactions, and relationships. We believe GenAI will revolutionize the retail industry, make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers/members, and create better work experiences for associates.”
Walmart leverages AI across the enterprise
While Walmart is still developing its generative AI capabilities, the retailer has been actively integrating AI into its enterprise. At the kickoff of its recent two-day 2023 Investment Community meeting, Walmart unveiled a plan for what the discount titan says is “a new more connected and automated supply chain which will improve the experience for customers and associates and simultaneously increase productivity.” Over half of Walmart’s fulfillment centers could be automated within three years. The retailer expects the outcome to improve in-stock levels, inventory accuracy and flow across all fulfillment channels.
Walmart also utilizes applied AI to identify when an item purchased online can be fulfilled from one of its 4,700 stores instead of fulfillment centers. This step is intended to reduce both the number of miles driven and the number of boxes used for shipping.

The discount giant is including a generative AI-based feature called “My Assistant” in the new Me@Campus “super app” it is providing to tens of thousands of corporate employees. Generative AI is based on machine learning (ML) and can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.

The Me@Campus app also has features designed to aid employees in managing their careers, and finances, obtaining required learnings, and working on teams. Walmart says it is also working toward using the app for new associate orientation and to help associates better understand and choose their benefits during annual enrollment. 

In a LinkedIn post, Donna Morris, executive VP, chief people officer and Cheryl Ainoa, executive VP, new businesses and emerging technologies, Walmart, said MyAssistant will help employees with tasks such as speeding up the drafting process, serving as a creative partner, and summarizing large documents.

Ideally, Walmart hopes this technology will free employees from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing them more time and focus for improving the customer experience. In June 2023, the company rolled out the Walmart GenAI Playground, an early-stage internal generative AI tool where employees  can explore and learn about the new technology. 

“My Assistant has the potential to change how our associates work and solve problems,” Morris and Ainoa said in the LinkedIn post. “The conversation around GenAI continues to grow, sparking interest and curiosity around how it will reshape our work, interactions, and relationships. We believe GenAI will revolutionize the retail industry, make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers/members, and create better work experiences for associates.”

Walmart leverages AI across the enterprise

While Walmart is still developing its generative AI capabilities, the retailer has been actively integrating AI into its enterprise. At the kickoff of its recent two-day 2023 Investment Community meeting, Walmart unveiled a plan for what the discount titan says is “a new more connected and automated supply chain which will improve the experience for customers and associates and simultaneously increase productivity.” Over half of Walmart’s fulfillment centers could be automated within three years. The retailer expects the outcome to improve in-stock levels, inventory accuracy and flow across all fulfillment channels.

Walmart also utilizes applied AI to identify when an item purchased online can be fulfilled from one of its 4,700 stores instead of fulfillment centers. This step is intended to reduce both the number of miles driven and the number of boxes used for shipping.

To ensure that items can more sustainably travel from stores to customers’ homes, the retailer combines multiple orders on single delivery routes and delivers them using electric vans.

With AI pervading almost every domain, there is excitement, concern and questions over where the technology can lead us. Little wonder, its impact is so fiercely debated. (Watch video)The Good 3 excerptsAI is the formative force impacting the world today across every dimension.AI can help you express what you want to say with the right information, in the right way at the right time with the right context.AI will fundamentally shift the way that we use time, ideally in a way that allows us to thrive, be excited, get more joy and laugh with others.2 video momentsI could see a world where your job is more interesting because you're applying judgement more often than you are doing the ministerial type parts of all of our jobs. (watch video)AI can serve us as coach and mentor, allowing us to have a better sense of who we are and create a sense of self-awareness which allows us to value ourselves and have others value us more. (watch video)1 insightArtificial Intelligence has the potential to make our lives exciting and our work interesting. It can enhance human well-being. In the words of Dr John Halamka, ""five years from now if you are doing colonoscopy without AI, that's malpractice.""The Bad 3 excerptsThere is also the possibility that AI takes us into a very dark place.In some ways it's inherently more threatening than automation for physical work.AI will be able to give us answers to questions but we will never understand why AI came to that conclusion.2 video momentsThere's a lot of interest and concern in Artificial intelligence and knowledge work in some ways it's inherently more threatening than automation for physical work because we're used to tools for physical work for centuries now. (watch video)What worries me more is that some of the AI tools have become so good at language and logic that we start to imbue them with these other aspects of humanity and we start to trust and believe in them. (watch video)1 insightIt could gradually lead us to a space where we stop using our reason and put entire faith in AI. In the words of Fareed Zakaria, ""we are returning to a pre-enlightenment world where we know what the answer is but we don't know why"".The way ahead3 excerptsCompanies will have to help workers adapt to AI and provide at-scale training opportunities. People will require assistance to incorporate AI into the work they are doing, so they view the tech not as a threat but as a sort of helpful assistant or co-pilot.If people are to trust AI, there has to be transparency about the algorithms being used by the AIs, everything from what data is being used to how it is being analysed.Governments and agencies will have to figure out what the right amount of regulation is in order to not stifle the budding technology but also to not let loose a monster. 2 video momentsWe aren't going to go directly to Star Trek, but what you are going to get is a much larger population that is much more tapped into their human potential. (watch video)We know how to architect values into technology. I am confident that we will create a software constitution that preserves some values. (watch video)1 insightWe should not try to regulate technology rather we should try to regulate use. Looking at the risks and rewards of every possible individual use of AI is crucial to guiding us to a world where the net benefit to society is distinctly positive, says Dr. Daniel Huttenlocher.",,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/103135523'}"
