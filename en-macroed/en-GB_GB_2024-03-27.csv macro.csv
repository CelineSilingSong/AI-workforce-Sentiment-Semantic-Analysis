Historically a labour-intensive industry, change could soon be on the horizon for the construction workforce, driven by generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) and data analytics.“It won’t be too long before we see site activity managed remotely by robotics”Making use of this technology will help us to understand how buildings are used, what people need from them, and how to implement better risk and safety regulations. RSM UK’s recent Real Estate 360 survey found that 41 per cent of businesses see gen AI as a threat, and with only 19 per cent invested so far, there’s much to do when it comes to changing perception.One of the industry’s biggest challenges, particularly during the past four years, has been to manage rising costs and material and labour shortages. This has been further exacerbated by the industry’s use of data capture, often being slow to feed in changes and requiring human intervention to forecast costings and outcomes. It is no secret that that industry faces a real skills and productivity issue, as more than 500,000 UK construction workers are set to retire in the next 10 years, while 2023 saw a 6 per cent fall in apprenticeship starts.New world, new skillsThat is all set to change in the next two decades, as we’re going to see a major shift in labour profiling and skills required in construction, especially as gen AI advances. This will encourage greater diversity in the workforce and change people’s mindsets on the skills required.  Traditionally, construction is perceived to be a manual industry with all activity taking place on site, but the reality is the industry needs workers with skills in design, architecture, surveying and planning. Currently, just 13 per cent of the overall workforce is made up of women.However, technology is opening up more opportunities to utilise different skillsets and ways of thinking, and it won’t be too long before we see site activity managed remotely by robotics. This will lead to the removal of barriers linked to gender and disability, enabling people to take on construction roles and manage onsite operations remotely from their desks, for example controlling a crane. Equally, better technology implementation will support greater flexibility towards shift patterns, especially for those trying to juggle work and home life.Previously, the industry has also experienced challenges due to government restrictions on overseas labour. However, as technology becomes more embedded in site operations such as automated routine tasks, language and geographical barriers will also fall away, as communication will be through robotics. As with anything new, this will be a trial-and-error process, and it may take the industry some time to get to grips with how it’s managed, but in the long term it will lead to fewer mistakes.In addition, as data capturing and analytics advances, businesses will be more informed and have the opportunity to innovate and develop more efficient processes relating to carbon neutrality, design and decision making.Gen AI will also play a fundamental role in the future of building safety and regulation, especially from a design perspective. Robotics technology is being adopted in Asia and parts of Europe that provides onsite surveillance and accesses areas that contain chemical and hazardous material.As remote management develops, this will also lead to better onsite safety as there will be fewer people manually operating machinery and equipment, reducing the risk of accidents.However, as technology advances, other risks will transpire relating to cyber security, so businesses will need to consider their long-term risk-management strategies relating to remote access and cyber breaches.The shift to gen AI requires collaboration with education providers, and we’ve recently seen this in action with Balfour Beatty signing a 54-year contract in partnership with the University of Sussex to build and operate a new student accommodation project.A growing number of universities are also introducing gen AI degree programmes, indicating that those leaving higher education from now will be most impacted by the changing technology landscape. The partnership between industry and education is important for the future of construction, because as technology brings together traditional ways of thinking with modern methods of innovation, there will be some conflicts to overcome. 2024-03-28Contributor Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email  Add to Bookmarks","[{'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/#website', 'url': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/', 'name': 'Construction News', 'description': 'Read UK Construction Industry News, Analysis, Opinion and data', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/?s={search_term_string}'}, 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB'}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'url': 'https://emap-romulus-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/03/Kelly_Boorman-6364_002.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://emap-romulus-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/03/Kelly_Boorman-6364_002.jpg', 'width': 1024, 'height': 683}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/#webpage', 'url': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/', 'name': 'Could generative AI bring about remote construction work? | Construction News', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/#primaryimage'}, 'datePublished': '2024-03-28T12:18:24+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-03-28T12:18:24+00:00', 'author': {'@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/#/schema/person/1f7e20941779cfd310366f9f5e677835'}, 'description': 'Kelly Boorman is national head of construction and a partner at RSM UK With low margins and little room for error, the construction industry faces the', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/']}], 'isAccessibleForFree': 'True'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/long-reads/opinion/could-generative-ai-bring-about-remote-construction-work-28-03-2024/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Could generative AI bring about remote construction work?'}]}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/#/schema/person/1f7e20941779cfd310366f9f5e677835', 'name': 'Contributor', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/#personlogo', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'url': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3c7d6e631b5194096728e4eed580ee14?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'contentUrl': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3c7d6e631b5194096728e4eed580ee14?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'caption': 'Contributor'}, 'url': 'https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/author/web-team-test-cron/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a second wave could lead to the automation of more jobs amid rapid advances in AI.Analysing 22,000 tasks in the economy covering every type of job, the IPPR said 11% of tasks currently done by workers were at risk. This could, though, increase to 59% of tasks in the second wave as technologies develop to handle increasingly complex processes.It said routine cognitive tasks – including database management, scheduling and stocktaking – were already at risk, with potential to displace entry level and part-time jobs in secretarial work, administration and customer services.However, the second wave of AI adoption could impact non-routine tasks involving the creation of databases, copywriting and graphic design, which would affect increasingly higher earning jobs.Women would be significantly more affected, as “they are more likely to work in the most exposed occupations, such as secretarial and administrative occupations”, the IPPR said.In the worst-case scenario for the second wave of AI, 7.9m jobs could be displaced, the report said, with any gains for the economy from productivity improvements cancelled out with zero growth in GDP within three to five years.In a best-case scenario for full augmentation of the workforce with generative AI, no jobs would be lost, while the size of the economy could be increased by 4%, or about £92bn a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Either way, it is set to be a gamechanger for millions of us.“But technology isn’t destiny and a jobs apocalypse is not inevitable – government, employers and unions have the opportunity to make crucial design decisions now that ensure we manage this new technology well.

The IPPR's report warns that jobs lost to AI have no net benefit for the economy
                        












































Why you can trust Sky News


Up to eight million UK jobs are at risk from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a report warning that the low-skilled would be worst affected.The effects of generative AI are already being widely felt as 11% of tasks done by workers are currently exposed, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said.



It said that back office, entry level and part-time jobs were at the highest risk of being disrupted during the so-called first wave, with women and young people the most likely to be affected as a result.But its analysis showed that as more employers integrate AI technology into their work processes, up to 59% of tasks would be hit without government intervention, leaving the low-skilled most exposed.The figure equated to 7.9 million roles, the report said, adding that such a shift would provide no benefit to gross domestic product (GDP).





The authors described that as the ""worst case scenario"".But they painted a more positive picture for the economy, and people, if the transition was effectively managed through an industrial strategy that placed an emphasis on protecting key human functions through regulation and that aimed to unlock investment, particularly in training.

They claimed this could lead to an economic boost of 13% to GDP, around £306bn a year, in the best case.The government is yet to bring forward any legislation specifically aimed at the rise of AI, but last month did announce plans to spend more than £90m on new AI research hubs that will look into ways of using AI responsibly across areas such as healthcare, chemistry and mathematics.

But we are only at first base in what AI can do for the labour market.""We can help maximise the benefits of AI if employers and government work together, particularly on skills development and compliance.""It's a fast-moving area - one where we need people proficient and trained in using AI as it is now but also given the skills to adapt to future developments.

low-skilled worst hit, report warns","Up to eight million UK jobs are at risk from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a report warning that the low-skilled would be worst affected. The effects of generative AI are already being widely felt as 11% of tasks done by workers are currently exposed, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said. It said that back office, entry level and part-time jobs were at the highest risk of being disrupted during the so-called first wave, with women and young people the most likely to be affected as a result. But its analysis showed that as more employers integrate AI technology into their work processes, up to 59% of tasks would be hit without government intervention, leaving the low-skilled most exposed. The figure equated to 7.9 million roles, the report said, adding that such a shift would provide no benefit to gross domestic product (GDP). The authors described that as the ""worst case scenario"". But they painted a more positive picture for the economy, and people, if the transition was effectively managed through an industrial strategy that placed an emphasis on protecting key human functions through regulation and that aimed to unlock investment, particularly in training. They claimed this could lead to an economic boost of 13% to GDP, around &#163;306bn a year, in the best case. The government is yet to bring forward any legislation specifically aimed at the rise of AI, but last month did announce plans to spend more than &#163;90m on new AI research hubs that will look into ways of using AI responsibly across areas such as healthcare, chemistry and mathematics. Carsten Jung, senior economist at the IPPR, said: ""Already existing generative AI could lead to big labour market disruption or it could hugely boost economic growth, either way it is set to be a game changer for millions of us.  ""Many firms are already investing in it, and it has potential to speed up many more tasks as more businesses adopt it. ""Over the next five years it could transform knowledge work. ""The question now is less whether AI can be useful, but rather how fast and in what manner employers will use it. ""History shows that technological transition can be a boon if well managed, or can end in disruption if left to unfold without controls.""  Read more: IMF issues warning on affect of AI on global workforceI lost my job due to AI toolThe number of firms using AI and how workers feel about it A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology, said: ""This research is hugely speculative. ""There are numerous reports which also predict AI will spark a huge creation in jobs, unlocking further growth and ramping up productivity. ""AI already contributes more than &#163;3.7bn to our economy every year and we have already invested &#163;290m since 2018 in skills and talent initiatives for the jobs of the future. ""We continue to assess the impact of AI on different sectors and ensure employers play a leading role in building robust UK skills and talent. We are also working with Innovate UK and the Alan Turing Institute to develop guidance on the core AI skills people need, which will be published later this year."" Recruitment & Employment Confederation deputy chief executive Kate Shoesmith said of the findings: ""Some employers are using AI well, such as in scheduling, sourcing candidates, background checks and personal development plans. But we are only at first base in what AI can do for the labour market. ""We can help maximise the benefits of AI if employers and government work together, particularly on skills development and compliance. ""It's a fast-moving area - one where we need people proficient and trained in using AI as it is now but also given the skills to adapt to future developments. So, the education system needs to be built around these core employer needs, with flexibility to fund appropriate short-course training, as would come from a more flexible Apprenticeship Levy.""",658,business,"London, UK",2024-03-26T15:10:00Z,"['https://e3.365dm.com/24/02/150x150/skynews-openai-video_6457998.jpg', 'https://e3.365dm.com/24/02/768x432/skynews-openai-video_6457998.jpg', 'https://e3.365dm.com/24/02/800x600/skynews-openai-video_6457998.jpg']",2024-02-16T16:18:00,PT0H1M10S,https://news.sky.com/iframe/widget/video/6457996,Sky News LIMITED,1989.0,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rupert Murdoch'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

From students crafting essays and engineers writing code to call center operators responding to customers, generative artificial intelligence tools have prompted a wave of experimentation over the past year. At MIT, these experiments have raised questions — some new, some ages old — about how these tools can change the way we live and work. 
Can these tools make us better at our jobs, or might they make certain skills obsolete? How can we use these tools for good and minimize potential harm?
The generative AI wave has elicited excitement, anxiety, and plenty of speculation about what's to come, but no clear answers to these core questions. To discover how generative AI can lead to better jobs, MIT is convening a working group on Generative AI and the Work of the Future. The working group is kicking off with 25 companies and nonprofits alongside MIT faculty and students. The group is gathering original data on how teams are using generative AI tools — and the impact these tools are having on workers. 
“The world counts on MIT to turn sophisticated ideas into positive impact for the good of society,” says MIT President Sally Kornbluth. “This working group is focused on doing exactly that: In the face of broad public concern about AI’s potential to eliminate jobs, they are developing practical strategies for how to use generative AI to make existing jobs better and improve people’s lives.”
Organized at MIT’s Industrial Performance Center (IPC) and led by IPC Executive Director Ben Armstrong and MIT professors Julie Shah and Kate Kellogg, the working group recently released the first edition of its monthly newsletter, Generation AI, to share its early findings — and convened its first meeting of AI leads from a diverse cross-section of global companies. The working group also hosted a workshop on Feb. 29 highlighting responsible AI practices, in partnership with MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program.
The MIT team driving this initiative is a multidisciplinary and multi-talented group including Senior Fellow Carey Goldberg and Work of the Future graduate fellows Sabiyyah Ali, Shakked Noy, Prerna Ravi, Azfar Sulaiman, Leandra Tejedor, Felix Wang, and Whitney Zhang. 
Google.org is funding the working group’s research through its Community Grants Fund, in connection with its Digital Futures Project, an initiative that aims to bring together a range of voices to promote efforts to understand and address the opportunities and challenges of AI.
“AI has the potential to expand prosperity and transform economies, and it is essential that we work across sectors to fully realize AI’s opportunities and address its challenges,” says Brigitte Hoyer Gosselink, director of Google.org. “Independent research like this is an important part of better understanding how AI is changing the way people and teams do their work, and it will serve as a resource for all us — governments, civil society, and companies — as we adapt to new ways of working.”
Over the next two years, the working group will engage in three activities. First, it will conduct research on early use cases of generative AI at leading companies around the world. The group’s goal is to understand how these new technologies are being used in practice, how organizations are ensuring that the tools are being used responsibly, and how the workforce is adapting. The group is particularly interested in how these technologies are changing the skills and training required to thrive at work. MIT graduate student Work of the Future Fellows are collaborating with companies in the working group to conduct this research, which will be published as a series of case studies beginning in 2024.
Liberty Mutual Insurance joined the working group as part of its long-standing collaborative relationship with MIT researchers. “In a year of extraordinary advancements in AI, there is no doubt that it will continue shaping the future — and the future of work — at a rapid pace,” says Liberty Mutual CIO Adam L’Italien. “We are excited to collaborate with MIT and the working group to harness it to empower our employees, build new capabilities, and do more for our customers.”
Second, the working group will serve as a convener, hosting virtual quarterly meetings for working group members to share progress and challenges with their uses of generative AI tools, as well as to learn from their peers. MIT will also host a series of in-person summits for working group members and the public to share research results and highlight best practices from member companies. 
Third, based on the group’s research and feedback from participating organizations, the working group will develop training resources for organizations working to prepare or retrain workers as they integrate generative AI tools into their teams.
IBM has joined the working group as part of its broader investments in retraining and job transformation related to generative AI. “Skills are the currency of today and tomorrow. It is crucial that employees and employers are equally invested in continuous learning and maintaining a growth mindset,” says Nickle Lamoreaux, senior vice president and chief human resources officer at IBM. 
The working group has already interviewed or engaged with more than 40 companies. Working group members include Amsted Automotive, Cushman and Wakefield, Cytiva, Emeritus, Fujitsu, GlobalFoundries, Google Inc., IBM, Liberty Mutual, Mass General Brigham, MFS, Michelin, PwC, Randstad, Raytheon, and Xerox Corp.

Town hall leader Nick Peel told councillors the authority was ‘moving towards’ a pilot scheme on the introduction of Generative AI, a technology which he said ‘creates high quality content using deep learning models’, in some of its departments.


  He said that any future use of artificial intelligence systems by the authority should be based on improvements to services for the people of Bolton and not for purely financial reasons.






 
 









Cllr Peel was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat councillor Neil Maher.


  He said: “Dramatic changes and opportunities will arise from the use of AI in many office based functions including local government.


  “These could provide financial savings and efficiencies in an ever increasingly difficult financial situation for councils.

  “Can the leader indicate what investigations and development work is being undertaken by the council into the use of AI?”


  Cllr Peel, said: “This is the first question we’ve had in this chamber on artificial intelligence but I do predict there will be a lot more. It will become part of our lives.


  “It’s a rapidly moving aspect of technology. Work is already underway within the council to start to explore how best to take advantage of the potential it may generate for delivery of services.”


  Cllr Peel added that Generative AI will have a wide range of applicability across services to ‘speed up delivery, help customer focus and increase efficiency’. He said it could allow staff to dedicate a higher proportion of their time to more complicated aspects of their work.


  Cllr Peel said that recent events such as the Covid epidemic had led to an acceleration of tech innovation including AI. He added that any use of AI should be service driven.



  He said “I’ve always taken a view that transformation and improvements to services can be achieved through the use of innovative tech.


  “However, it should never be finance driven – as we’ve seen this can lead to hastily thought out and ill-conceived use of tech that leaves customers behind.


  “It should always be service driven and in this way the digital revolution can truly be harnessed to improve people’s lives.”

HR is fundamentally about managing humans – so how will the job change in a future where powerful generative AI tools are everywhere?

Empathy, emotional intelligence and an understanding of human nature are essential when it comes to managing a human workforce. Not exactly qualities that machines – even ones as human-like as ChatGPT – are renowned for!


So, are we going to see widespread replacement of human HR departments with cold, calculating chatbots that only care about measuring human efficiency and weeding out weaknesses?

Well, hopefully not. Instead, I think that HR professionals will use generative AI to automate routine and repetitive elements of their work, freeing time for them to nurture and develop the human-to-human skills needed for their more high-value tasks.

Here’s my overview of how I believe the work of HR departments will change – and in many cases already is. I’ll also take a look at the wider implications for how the place of these essential professionals in society is likely to evolve over the next five to 10 years.

Recruitment And Talent-Hunting
Finding talented people is always a challenge, but generative AI tools will help out with the routine and administerial work. Not just by doing it more quickly, but by finding more efficient and personalized ways to reach out to prospective hires and advertise a workplace.
At the start of the process, it will be used to generate ideas around ideal candidate personas, creating overviews of the skills, qualities and personality traits that might make an applicant right for the job. Then, it can create dynamic, personalized job descriptions aimed at encouraging a wider pool of applicants.
For companies that hire thousands every year, it will be used to carry out initial assessments to ensure candidates meet basic criteria. After that, it can offer simulated interviews and roleplays to help candidates prepare for their application. Rather than used as a form of screening, it should be thought of as a tool that will help recruiters and other HR professionals to get a better understanding of candidates as unique human beings, before meeting them face-to-face.

Workforce Development 
Businesses are going to need to ensure their workforces are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the AI era, and this responsibility falls on the shoulders of HR workers.

Generative AI is great for training – it can create anything from complex technical manuals to simple step-by-step walkthroughs. Public models like ChatGPT already capable of doing this, but businesses will increasingly invest in training their own private AI models tailored to their needs.
These reports can be personalized to individual learners, taking into account their unique skills and learning requirements.
As we move forward, we will find generative video and even world simulation tools becoming available. These will be used to create even more engaging, personalized training experiences. Language models will provide feedback in real-time, just as if the trainee had an instructor standing with them.
There are some risks here – we know generative AI doesn’t always get things right, which could lead to dangerous misinformation or mistakes. So, there will always be a need for transparency about how these systems operate, as well as human oversight.
Workplace Management And Analytics
Rather than spending hours studying metrics and statistics, generative AI tools can quickly analyze data and compile reports highlighting key workforce trends.
It can identify future staffing needs and highlight areas and causes of high staff turnover. It will provide quick, relevant insights into factors like employee sentiment and satisfaction. It will also be used to create narrative and visual projections around the impact of strategic HR decisions.
These will simplify the understanding of the underlying human element driving a business's success or failure for HR professionals.
Of course, we have to be careful when converting human activities and emotions into numbers. Bias in the way data is collected or analyzed can lead to unfair outcomes and overly intrusive data gathering or AI initiatives can create unhappy employees. Risks in all of these areas must be carefully assessed and guarded against.
Employee Experience
It’s the job of HR departments to create inclusive, positive experiences for workers throughout the business. Ensuring employees are able to carry out their duties effectively without being hindered or held up by internal processes is a critical task.
Here, generative AI will be used to create onboarding material relevant to individual new hires, provide personalized and relevant answers to common HR queries through chatbots, and gather and interpret employee feedback.
Here, quality of service is of utmost importance. Few things are as irritating as talking to bad chatbots. At the same time, more people are coming to accept that when used well, they can be a very efficient way of getting information.
This all helps HR departments understand the “pain points” that employees experience on a day-to-day basis as they carry out their work and navigate their own career pathways.
The Changing Role Of HR Professionals 
With generative AI taking on the routine and administrative elements of their work, the perception of HR professionals in the workplace will change dramatically. The higher level of visibility given to the human-centric elements of their work will mean they are less likely to be perceived as “back office” or even “faceless” functions, instead becoming more deeply ingrained in the working lives of their colleagues. The role of HR professionals in staff wellness and the development of healthy work/life balance, as well as promoting inclusion and diversity, will come to the front.
This means that HR professionals' strategic value will grow exponentially. Moving beyond being facilitators of operational efficiency, they will have the chance to become champions of positive organizational change, ethical application of technology, and curators of healthy, caring workplace culture.

Generative AI is the fastest-growing AI technology and, as with every industry, it presents huge opportunities for the legal sector and lawyers in particular.
However, the adoption of generative AI in the sector has its unique set of challenges due to the nature of legal work.Related Company ProfilesThomson Reuters CorpView all
Applicability of generative AI to legal work
There is a clear consensus among lawyers that generative AI can be applied to legal work. According to a 2023 Thomson Reuters survey research on the matter, 82% of respondents who work within the legal sector answered that generative AI or ChatGPT can be applied to legal work.
The use cases of generative AI in law range from drafting contracts/ documents to conducting legal research and due diligence. Increased efficiencies created by generative AI allow lawyers to focus their efforts on more analytical and sophisticated tasks. Ultimately, the adoption of the technology raises the stakes for being a good lawyer by automating routine, unprofitable, and time-consuming tasks, leaving lawyers to strictly focus on strategic legal analysis.
Concerns about the risks remain
Despite the hype around generative AI within the legal sector, there remain risks that law firms and legal teams need to consider before adoption. In the same Thomson Reuters survey, only 51% of survey respondents said they believed generative AI should be applied to legal work despite the majority agreeing that it can be applied. This boils down to concerns about the accuracy, reliability, data privacy, and security of the content produced by generative AI. Hallucinations are a key limitation to the use of generative AI solutions, as these answers often sound believable but are essentially made-up facts.
Reliance on fabricated information can have severe repercussions, particularly in the case of legal work. Additionally, lawyers highlight their privacy concerns with generative AI given the sensitive nature of client data and the need to process confidential data when using the technology.

The role of lawyers in developing the product
To prove useful, generative AI for lawyers requires specific legally trained models that rely on large amounts of authoritative and up-to-date data. For example, ChatGPT-4 was last updated in April 2023, meaning cases or any significant rulings that followed that date would not appear in searches, providing inaccurate legal information and advice.
Lawyers would need to be involved in creating a generative AI product for use within the legal industry, as subject matter expertise is particularly vital in this field. Law firms seeking to adopt generative AI will thus need to allocate a specific budget for purchasing the necessary tools and addressing the talent and skills gap that exists when deploying this technology.
A 2024 generative AI survey by LexisNexis states that 43% of the 200 largest law firms (Am Law 200) have a dedicated budget for investing in generative AI solutions this year, and 90% of law firms and corporate respondents expect their investment in the technology to increase over the next five years. Ultimately, it is clear that law firms are aware that they will be at a competitive disadvantage if they do not invest in generative AI.

Adobe and Microsoft have partnered to bring Adobe Experience Cloud workflows and insights to Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 to enable marketers to collaborate easily when developing creative content, managing marketing campaigns, and more.  
The new integrated capabilities will bring relevant marketing insights and workflows from Adobe Experience Cloud applications and Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Copilot, which will enable users to develop creative briefs, create content, manage content approvals, deliver experiences and more. 
This will help marketers working in applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Teams and Word to manage their everyday workflows more efficiently and improve collaboration between the internal and external teams working on marketing projects and campaigns.  
“The demand for personalised content across social media, mobile and other fast-moving channels has been exploding, pushing marketers to drive greater efficiency and productivity in their everyday work,” said Amit Ahuja, senior vice president, digital experience business at Adobe. “Marketers spend a great deal of their day working across Adobe and Microsoft applications, and the partnership provides a unique offering for marketing teams, streamlining daily tasks across planning, collaboration, create and campaign execution.” 
The new capabilities will enable marketers to monitor the status of a marketing project, understand the effectiveness of a campaign, identify outstanding approvals and actions to take, or define audience and key performance indicators. These insights will also be available to enable marketers to create briefs, presentations for executive reviews, or reports. Marketers can also create imagery with Adobe Firefly generative AI or copy for marketing experiences through Adobe Experience Manager Sites. 
“Microsoft and Adobe share a common goal of empowering marketers to focus on the work that’s most important – creating impactful campaigns and enhancing customer experiences,” said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president, artificial intelligence at work, Microsoft. “By integrating contextual marketing insights from Adobe Experience Cloud applications and Dynamics 365 within the flow of work through Copilot for Microsoft 365, we deliver on our shared goal while helping marketers streamline their efforts, break down barriers, and deliver exceptional results.”

Workforce upskilling key to averting AI job loss 'apocalypse'

Widespread AI job losses across the UK can be averted if government and industry collaborate to protect jobs and focus on workforce upskilling

 AI job losses in the UK could impact up to eight million people unless the government takes urgent action to address skills gaps, according to a new report. Analysis from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) found entry level, part-time, and administrative jobs are at greatest risk, affecting women, younger workers, and those on lower wages the most.The study assessed 22,000 tasks spanning various roles across the UK economy, and found that 11% of worker roles are already exposed to AI. The most affected include ‘routine cognitive’ tasks such as database management, and ‘organizational and strategic’ tasks such as scheduling or inventory management.However, more jobs could be put at risk as companies integrate existing AI technologies deeper within operational processes, the study warned. Long-term, this could result in AI carrying out 59% of tasks and eventually affecting higher-earning jobs.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITPro""We could see jobs such as copywriters, graphic designers, and personal assistant roles being heavily affected by AI,"" said IPPR senior research fellow and report author Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan.AI job losses: The worst-case scenariosThe report sets out three potential scenarios whereby AI job losses occur. The worst-case scenario, the study found, would see “full displacement” of the UK’s workforce, with all at-risk jobs eventually being replaced. Under this scenario, around 7.9 million jobs could be lost across the country with no GDP gains.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Wage gains for workers could be more than 30% in some cases – but could also be nil.Impact of AI job losses can be mitigated through trainingWithout government action and with companies left to their own devices, the worst-case scenario is a real possibility, the IPPR warned.""Already existing generative AI could lead to big labor market disruption or it could hugely boost economic growth, either way it is set to be a game changer for millions of us. Many firms are already investing in it, and it has potential to speed up many more tasks as more businesses adopt it,"" said Carsten Jung, report author and senior economist at IPPR.""History shows that technological transition can be a boon if well managed, or can end in disruption if left to unfold without controls. Indeed, some occupations could be hard hit by generative AI, starting with back office jobs.""The IPPR urged the government to develop a job-centric industrial strategy for AI.This, the think tank said, should support green jobs, which it noted are less vulnerable than others to automation. Similarly, the government was advised to enact fiscal policy measures such as tax incentives or subsidies to encourage job augmentation over full displacement.Nikolaz Foucaud, managing director for EMEA at Coursera, echoed the report’s calls for a sharpened focus on training and upskilling.Foucaud said that while AI job losses will likely occur in coming years, proactive efforts now will be critical to reduce the impact on the workforce and enable workers to move into new roles.“The IPPR report’s warning of potential job losses from AI points to an increasing urgency to accelerate AI training and upskilling for UK workers,” he said. “The data serves as a stark reminder that companies cannot afford to be complacent about the impact of AI on existing jobs.RELATED WEBINAR(Image credit: IBM)Empower HR resources and focus on strategic value“AI presents a golden opportunity for business growth and increased productivity. For lower-skilled jobs, in particular, it could save workers’ time on repetitive tasks and provide opportunities for wider career progression. However, the effective adoption of AI, designed to complement rather than replace humans, hinges on a workforce equipped with the necessary expertise.”Foucaud said the report’s indication that women are specifically at-risk should also raise serious concerns.The IPPR report findings on this front align with similar research from Code First Girls this year, which found that tech workers fear the increased use of generative AI could “drive women out the workforce”.“Organizations must ensure that women do not miss the opportunity to benefit from AI upskilling and this must include flexible options for training,” he said. “This will be vital for ensuring women’s careers evolve alongside AI rather than facing a heightened risk of being replaced by it.”

As employers explore ways to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the bounds of existing and emerging legislation and guidance, and as government agencies, states, and municipalities seek to regulate AI in employment and other areas, the use of AI by job applicants has proceeded largely under the radar. But an increasing number of job candidates are using AI, including to draft and review resumes, cover letters and writing samples, to complete job applications, and even to help them prepare for and participate in job interviews. This use is often undetected by employers, which can lead to problematic results.
It is critical that employers understand the ways in which candidates can use AI in the hiring process and learn how to effectively navigate potential issues that might arise without negatively impacting the pool of talented applicants or running afoul of employment laws.
HOW ARE JOB CANDIDATES USING AI?
Job candidates are using AI in a variety of ways. A 2023 survey from a provider of online and app-based resources for job seekers found that almost half of them were already using ChatGPT to generate resumes and cover letters, and 70% of applicants reported a higher response rate from employers when using ChatGPT to create or revise application materials.1 Indeed, a 2023 Harvard Business Review article theorized that “[u]sing tools like ChatGPT to help craft [a] resume may very well be the new norm in a few years’ time.”2
In addition to using AI to generate and revise applications, resumes, cover letters, and other written materials, candidates are also using AI in connection with interviews. For example, in 2023, multiple news agencies reported on a TikTok video (with over two million views) that showed how to use AI to prepare for interviews by using the tool to generate possible interview questions based on the job description. Indeed, a recent survey found that 41% of college students believe that using AI to prepare for interviews is acceptable.3
More troubling, some applicants may use AI to respond to text, pre-recorded, or video interview questions. This controversial use of AI was highlighted in a 2023 TikTok video that showed a woman using an app on her phone to generate answers to questions while they were being asked during a video interview.4 While some believe that the post was an advertisement for the app the woman was using and not a real-life scenario, the video shows yet another way that AI can creep into the hiring process.
EMPLOYMENT LAW CONSIDERATIONS
While Congress, agencies, and state and local governments have not addressed the use of AI by applicants, existing federal employment guidance and laws on employers’ use of AI provide insights into how employers might regulate applicants’ AI use.
For example, in May 2022, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued “The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees” (the EEOC ADA Guidance), which contains guidance on how the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) could limit employers’ use of AI to screen job applicants. Although focused on employers’ use of AI, the guidance’s is helpful in understanding how employers might limit an applicant’s use of AI. Among other things, the EEOC ADA Guidance notes that one of the most common ways that employers can violate the ADA is by failing to provide a “reasonable accommodation” for job applicants to be fairly considered. Relatedly, the EEOC ADA Guidance explains that employers cannot use AI to “screen out” job applicants with disabilities under the ADA.
With these concerns in mind, if an employer has a general policy prohibiting AI based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reason (e.g., combatting plagiarism and misrepresentations about skills and experience), then it may need to make an exception for job applicants with disabilities if the applicant can articulate why they need the AI to assist them in the application process. If the underlying purpose of an employer’s workplace policy banning job applicants from using AI could be accomplished with alternative means (e.g., using AI tools and human screeners to detect potential AI plagiarism in applications), then employers may need to adjust the policy for applicants with disabilities. Further, if a job applicant with disabilities uses AI to, for example, draft their resume, but is still able to perform the offered position’s essential functions, employers should be careful not to automatically screen them out because of a blanket ban on AI use.
On the whole, while employers should take some comfort from the EEOC ADA Guidance’s instruction that they never need to “lower production or performance standards or eliminate an essential job function as a reasonable accommodation” under the ADA, employers should proceed cautiously and purposefully when regulating job applicants’ use of AI, including by following the recommended practices set forth below.
In May 2023, the EEOC issued “Select Issues: Assessing Adverse Impact in Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence Used in Employment Selection Procedures Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” which contained guidance on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.5 Although the Guidance is focused on how employers can use AI within the bounds of Title VII, it also provides helpful insights for employers as they develop policies governing on job applicants’ use of AI.6 At the forefront of this guidance is the EEOC’s clear message that employers may be liable for any discriminatory use of AI-influenced “selection procedures” (i.e., any measure used to make an employment decision) in a manner that has a disparate impact on job applicants based on their protected characteristics (e.g., race, sex, religion, etc.). In light of this, if publicly available data or studies are published that show that job applicants with protected characteristics are disproportionately using AI to apply to certain industries or occupations, then affected employers should proceed with caution when deciding how to restrict candidates’ use of AI and should not automatically reject candidates because of their use of any form of AI in the application process.
Existing and proposed legislation is also informative. For example, Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act in 2020 requires employers to disclose their use of AI in the hiring process, which suggests that employers could require candidates do the same.
Finally, employers restricting a job applicant’s use of AI should draft their policies with the Biden administration’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” (the AI Blueprint) in mind to mitigate potential legal exposure and reputational harm.7 Because the AI Blueprint focuses on how AI can exacerbate existing biases in employment, employers seeking to restrict or prohibit the use of AI by job applicants should ensure that their rules do not inadvertently or disproportionately impact certain groups of applicants.
EMPLOYER RECOMMENDATIONS
Employers must be prepared for candidates to use AI in a variety of ways during the job application process and should draft rules and procedures that address the various ways candidates can use AI and take into account existing federal, state, and local laws and guidance. Employers and their counsel should stay on top of the ever-evolving legal landscape in this area and the new AI tools entering the market.
With this general advice in mind, employers should consider taking the following steps to address job applicants’ use of AI:

Ensure there are nondiscriminatory business reasons for prohibiting or restricting the use of AI at various stages of the application process. For example, some uses, like preparing for a job interview with AI generated questions or using AI to edit resumes or cover letters, might be acceptable, while other uses, like using AI to draft resumes or cover letters from scratch, draft or edit writing samples, or answer interview questions might be problematic.
Post on your job portal or third-party job posting a notice about your AI rules and a link to those rules.
Post on your job portal or third-party job posting a specific notice tailored to particular jobs if certain AI-related rules apply only to those positions.
Depending on your AI rules, require candidates to attest that they have not used AI in any part of the application process or require them to disclose their use of AI.
Include in your notices and rules information about seeking a reasonable accommodation in the application process, including using AI.
Train job recruiters, HR personnel, and interviewing staff to detect potential job application materials that have used AI.

AI “tells” in written materials include things like: (1) use of repeated words or phrases; (2) a lack of personalization, including failing to include details about skills and experiences or failing to address the specific job for which the applicant is applying and parroting back language from the job posting without elaboration or context; (3) formatting inconsistencies; (4) different tones and writing styles within a single document and across documents; (5) overly complex or verbose language; and (6) similarities between multiple applicants’ written materials.
Indicators that an applicant is using AI during interviews in real-time include things like: (1) applicants pausing too long after the question is asked; (2) applicants looking off camera before answering; and (3) applicants providing answers that sound scripted.
In addition, as candidates progress through the hiring process, job recruiters, HR personnel, and interviewing staff should be on the lookout for inconsistencies in what candidates said about their experience and skills in written materials or video interviews and what they or their references say later in the hiring process. 


Include an in-person, nondigital interactive step during the job-application process (e.g., in-person interview without electronics) and be diligent with checking references to better assess an applicant’s skills and experience (e.g., by comparing what skills and experience is conveyed during the in-person interview or by references and with what was conveyed in the applicant’s written materials or during remote interviews).

CONCLUSION
Employers should be mindful that job applicant use of AI is likely to increase over time. Additionally, it may become more difficult for employers to accurately track job applicant use of AI as AI improves and there are fewer noticeable AI “tells” or “hallucinations” in job-applicant materials. As employers attempt to navigate this evolving landscape, they must proceed cautiously when imposing restrictions on job applicant use of AI to ensure they remain in compliance with existing federal, state, and local employment and labor-law obligations.

What is Generative AI?
The branch of artificial intelligence known as ""generative AI"" is concerned with developing models and algorithms that may generate fresh and unique content. Generative AI algorithms apply probabilistic approaches to produce new instances that mirror the original data, typically with the capacity to demonstrate creative and inventive behavior beyond what was explicitly designed.
How Does Generative AI Tool Work?
Generative AI tools operate by employing advanced machine learning techniques, often deep learning models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs). These models are trained on massive datasets to understand patterns and underlying structures. The models learn to create new instances that mirror the training data by capturing the statistical distribution of the input data throughout the training phase.

Ideas Made to Matter


                        Artificial Intelligence


Who should be the head of generative AI — and what they should do 

By
Kara Baskin

Mar 28, 2024






Why It Matters		



Adopting artificial intelligence takes time and proper leadership. Heads of generative AI manage how companies use the technology to manage people and help set the right tone.

Generative artificial intelligence has rapidly become an organizational priority. After it was launched in late 2022, ChatGPT had 100 million active users in less than two months, and many executives now consider managing AI’s impact to be a leadership priority.

But adoption takes time and requires proper stewardship. In a recent webinar hosted by MIT Sloan Management Review, London Business School professor Lynda Gratton discussed the new roles companies are creating to guide AI initiatives, the job responsibilities of these leaders, and how companies can use AI for people management.
Introducing the “head of generative AI”
Many companies are introducing positions to guide generative AI use. Last year, Coca-Cola moved Pratik Thakar from his role as head of global creative strategy to senior director of generative AI. Likewise, advertising agency M&C Saatchi named chief data strategy officer James Calvert its new head of generative AI, Gratton noted.
She pinpointed five key job responsibilities for those in these new roles:
Steering the strategic direction and alignment of AI work.
Establishing and sustaining a collaborative generative AI ecosystem.
Monitoring and evaluating generative AI experiments to inform best practices.
Identifying high-impact use cases for scalability.
Overseeing generative AI integration across business units.
Some generative AI leaders might have a creative background; others could come from tech. Gratton said background matters less than a willingness to experiment.
“You want somebody who’s got an experimental mindset, who sees this as a learning opportunity and sees it as an organizational structuring issue,” she said. “The innovation part is what’s really crucial.”
Ways to use AI for people management 
The head of AI could encourage use of the technology to help with managing employees, Gratton said. This encompasses three key areas:
Talent development. Companies can use chatbots and other tools to recruit people and help them manage their careers.
Productivity. AI can be used to create assessments, give feedback, manage collaboration, and provide skills training.
Change management. This includes both internal and external knowledge management. “We have so much knowledge in our organizations … but we don’t know how to find it,” Gratton said. “And it seems to me that this is an area that we’re really focusing on in terms of generative AI.”


Trust, collaboration, and open-mindedness are essential
As companies embark on their generative AI journeys and add leadership in this area, transparency is key.

“Employees need to feel that they trust their managers,” Gratton said. “This isn’t just a piece about technology; it’s also a piece about how you manage change.”
Some workers fear that AI could replace them. A good leader will address those concerns and generate companywide enthusiasm across roles and age groups.
“The CEO and the leadership team have got to set a narrative. When you have high levels of ambiguity, the job of a leader is to tell stories about the future, to help people think: ‘This is where we’re walking; this is why it’s happening; this is how we feel about it,’” she said. This includes getting everyone in the organization involved in thinking about how to use generative AI.
Leaders should remember that buy-in across all career stages and skill levels is essential. Generative AI isn’t just the domain of youth.
“We shouldn’t stereotype the idea that it’s only young people who are thinking about this. In fact, if you look at people at every stage in their working life, they are very interested — and there’s even some data that show the over-50s are really working to experiment and to understand generative AI,” Gratton said. “Don’t be blinkered about what you expect your employees to do.”

Generative AI can help social impact teams be more productive, creative and effective in serving their communities. In fact, Google.org funding recipients report that AI helps them achieve their goals in one third of the time at nearly half the cost.But while a recent Google.org survey found that four in five nonprofits think generative AI may be applicable to their work, nearly half said their organization is not currently using the technology. They cite a lack of tools, awareness, training and funding as the biggest barriers to adoption.To help nonprofits make the most of this technology, we are announcing the Google.org Accelerator: Generative AI, a six-month program supporting nonprofits developing high-impact applications of generative AI.

What effect is generative artificial intelligence likely to have on wage inequality?
While no one can say for sure yet, it’s possible generative AI might reduce the contemporary societal problem of income inequality. That’s one of the conclusions reached by MIT Sloan School Associate Professor Nathan Wilmers in a new analysis.
About the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER)IWER is a multidisciplinary research and teaching unit that is located within the MIT Sloan School.  IWER’s mission is to conduct and disseminate cutting-edge research that improves the lives of workers and their loved ones and guides managers in crafting a successful and inclusive future of work.

Wilmer’s new working paper, “Generative AI and the Future of Inequality,” was recently published online as part of a new collection called An MIT Exploration of Generative AI. This collection consists of 25 papers on the societal impact of generative AI that were authored by members of the MIT faculty, with support from seed grants from MIT. Wilmers, who is the Sarofim Family Career Development Associate Professor and an Associate Professor of Work and Organization Studies at MIT Sloan, is a member of the core faculty of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER). He has done extensive past research identifying factors that drive labor market inequality.
In his new essay, Wilmers observes that generative AI could reduce the premium in wages received by college-educated knowledge workers—a contributor to inequality— because the technology may disrupt higher-paid white-collar jobs more than low-wage jobs. What’s more, he notes, early research suggests that, within a given job, large language models (LLM) benefit lower-skilled workers more than top performers—a result likely to compress wage scales over time.  “LLMs appear to be a skill leveler, delivering the biggest performance boosts to the previously worst performers,” Wilmers writes.
Should this occur, Wilmers points out that generative AI might over time undermine the rationale for the competitive meritocratic systems that sort students into colleges and jobs and increase income inequality along the way. “The meritocratic regime is only cost-effective if the productivity differences between slightly different candidates [for a job or for admission to a school] are large,” Wilmers writes—something that may become less true in the age of generative AI.
In addition, Wilmers makes the case that protections against displacement by generative AI use are the kind of workplace “collective goods” that motivate workers to seek union representation—suggesting that the technology could result in increased interest in unionization, including among white-collar workers.  And unions, Wilmers notes, not only help provide employment protection but also tend to reduce income disparities among their members through standardization of pay scales. As a result, he argues, “white-collar unionization that is primarily stimulated by generative AI…could strengthen inequality-reducing effects” of the technology by bringing about more standardized pay for white-collar workers.
On the other hand, Wilmers points out that there’s no guarantee that generative AI will reduce income inequality. Indeed, it could have the opposite effect. Wilmers cites a number of possible reasons. College-educated workers could end up competing with non-college-educated workers for blue-collar jobs. Some firms may prove far more adept than others at harnessing generative AI for competitive advantage, resulting in significant disparities between companies, and thus in the wages of their respective workforces. What’s more, some research suggests that managers who experience more precarity in their own work lives—something that technological changes like generative AI can engender—are in turn more likely to impose precarity on the people who work for them.  Finally, generative AI could result in more intensive workplace surveillance of workers that enables companies to tie wages closely to individual worker productivity.
While it’s impossible to predict precisely what effects generative AI will have on labor market inequality, Wilmers believes there’s a benefit to thinking through a range of possibilities. Identifying a number of the possible impacts large language AI models could have, he writes, his can help  “guide policymakers to broaden the consideration set of ways that LLMs can effect inequality.”

Investments into AI-driven startups increased substantially as of 2021, as generative AI emerged and at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it became clear that working from home and cyber solutions were a permanent part of the workplace. Consequently, investments grew from a little over 30 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 to more than 65 billion U.S. dollars in 2021. However, investments in AI startups had been slightly declining in 2022 until the record level of funding for OpenAI and other generative AI investments at the tail end of the year. Artificial Intelligence investments during COVID-19During the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of investment rose in nearly all organizations across the globe. The increase was most staggering in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry where nearly 44 percent of companies reported an increase in their use of artificial intelligence. The automotive industry, being one of the more advanced automation industries in the world, also increased its investment by over 40 percent. The automotive industry automation market totaled two billion U.S. dollars in revenue . Artificial Intelligence in business and recessionThe increased use of AI in the United States is enabling companies to reduce their labor demands and hiring cycles, thus becoming more efficient. Nearly a third of companies have either implemented or begun to implement AI driven solutions within their organization. In the context of energy driven recession faced by Europe - that is impacting the entire world - AI comes to the rescue. Most mobile companies reported an energy saving of 10 to 15 percent. Such small steps are vital in maintaining a robust technological economy in recession times.

General summary

A recent survey conducted by Google.org revealed valuable insights into the potential of generative AI for nonprofits. 75% of nonprofits believe generative AI can transform their marketing efforts, particularly in content creation and personalization. However, two-thirds of organizations face barriers due to unfamiliarity with the technology, and 40% lack AI education within their teams. To address these challenges, Google for Nonprofits offers training resources, such as a productivity guide for Gemini for Google Workspace, and has donated over $2 billion in Google Ad Grants and Google Workspace access to support nonprofits in leveraging AI-powered tools.

Nonprofits around the world do critical work in their communities, from helping people build new skills, to studying and protecting biodiversity. But they’re also often stretched, under-resourced and weighed down by time-consuming administrative tasks.Research shows that generative AI tools can improve productivity by 66%. That efficiency could be particularly valuable to nonprofits, taking smaller tasks off their plate in order to focus on bigger-impact efforts.We recently surveyed more than 4,000 organizations in our Google for Nonprofits program to get a better sense of other opportunities, and obstacles, of using generative AI in the nonprofit world. Here are three insights from that survey, plus some AI tools nonprofits can start using today.1. 75% of nonprofits said that generative AI had the potential to transform their marketing efforts.When asked about the most immediate potential of generative AI in their work, survey participants consistently mentioned marketing tasks that involve writing or personalizing content. Whether creating effective ad copy to reach new donors or running an awareness-building campaign, effective fundraising and communication involves a lot of time-intensive customization.With AI-powered Google Search ads, organizations can reach new audiences with relevant messages tailored to their goals. Tools like responsive search ads allow nonprofits to enter multiple headlines and descriptions for an ad, and over time, Google Ads will automatically test different combinations and learn which performs best.For example, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) used Google Ad Grants to serve 48 million public service announcements. That included encouraging voter registration for citizens who had upcoming elections in their area, and sharing information about local causes, like donations to support local female entrepreneurs, to those most likely to be interested in them.

The United Nations Development Program used AI-powered Google Search ads to serve 48 million public service announcements and drive engagement for local projects.






To help more social impact organizations take advantage of AI-powered tools, in 2023, the Google for Nonprofits program donated more than $2 billion in Google Ad Grants and Google Workspace access to nonprofits. This gave more than 300,000 nonprofits around the world the opportunity to use AI-powered technology at no cost.2. Two-thirds of nonprofits said a lack of familiarity with generative AI was their biggest barrier to adoption.The survey found that four in five nonprofits think generative AI may be applicable to their work — but nearly half said their organization is not currently using the technology. And the majority of respondents said they lacked awareness of potential use cases.We’ve seen firsthand that when nonprofits are trained on how and when to use this technology effectively, generative AI can help them support their communities in entirely new ways. For instance, generative AI-powered career coaches and tutors can provide tailored support to job seekers and students, while queryable databases can help policymakers and the public ask questions about and dig deeper into topics like the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.Read about other ways nonprofits are using AI, including the 21 participants in our newest accelerator focused on generative AI solutions.3. 40% of nonprofits said nobody in their organization was educated in AI.We heard repeatedly that while nonprofit staff are experts in their field, they’re often not technology specialists. So they’re looking for low- or no-cost, simple training on generative AI — ideally tailored to the social impact sector.That’s why we published a productivity guide to accompany Gemini for Google Workspace, the add-on subscription now available to Google Workspace for Nonprofits users. The guide outlines ways to use these generative AI tools, like to help you write grant proposals and volunteer communications, generate images for marketing assets, organize donor databases and more. Interested nonprofits can get started today with a Gemini for Google Workspace no-cost trial.Check out the entire report for more insights, and learn more about the Google for Nonprofits program.

That might not be a good thing.Why AI agents that could book your vacation or pay your bills are the next frontier in artificial intelligence.by  Kelsey PiperMar 29, 2024, 9:00 AM EDTFacebookLinkMalorny/Getty ImagesKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.ChatGPT and its large language model (LLM) competitors that produce text on demand are very cool. So are the other fruits of the generative AI revolution: art generators, music generators, better automatic subtitles and translation. They can do a lot (including claim that they’re conscious, not that we should believe them), but there’s one important respect in which AI models are unlike people: They are processes that are run only when a human triggers them and only to accomplish a specific result. And then they stop.Now imagine that you took one of these programs — a really good chatbot, let’s say, but still just a chatbot — and you gave it the ability to write notes to itself, store a to-do list and the status of items on the to-do list, and delegate tasks to other copies of itself or other people. And instead of running only when a human prompted it, you had it work on an ongoing basis on these tasks — just like an actual human assistant.At that point, without any new leaps in technology whatsoever — just some basic tools glued onto a standard language model — you’d have what is called an “AI agent,” or an AI that acts with independent agency to pursue its goals in the world. AI agents have been called the “future of artificial intelligence” that will “reinvent the way we live and work,” the “next frontier of AI.” OpenAI is reportedly working on developing such agents, as are many different well-funded startups.They may sound even more sci-fi than everything else you’ve already heard about AI, but AI agents are not nonsense, and if effective, could fundamentally change how we work. That said, they currently don’t work very well, and they pose obvious challenges for AI safety. Here’s a quick primer on where we’re (maybe) headed, and why.Why would you want one of these?Today’s AI chatbots are fun to talk to and useful assistants — if you are willing to overlook a set of limitations that includes making things up. Such models have already found sizable and important economic niches, from art to audio and video transcription (which have been quietly revolutionized over the last few years) to assisting programmers with tools like Copilot. But the investors pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI are hoping for something more transformative than that.Many people I talk to who use AI in their work describe it as like having a slightly scatterbrained but very fast intern. They do useful work, but you have to define each problem for them and carefully check their work, meaning that much of what you might gain in productivity is lost in oversight. Much of the economic case for AI is that it could do more than that. The people at work on AI agents hope that their tools won’t just help software developers, but that the tools could be software developers. In this future, you wouldn’t just consult AI for trip planning ideas; instead, you could simply text it “plan a trip for me in Paris next summer,” as you might a really good executive assistant. Today’s AI agents do not live up to that dream — yet. The problem is that you need a very high accuracy rate on each step of a multistep process, or very good error correction, to get anything valuable out of an agent that has to take lots of steps. But there’s good reason to expect that future generation AI agents will be much better at what they do. First of all, the agents are built on increasingly powerful base models, which perform much better on a wide range of tasks, and which we can expect to continue to improve. Secondly, we’re also learning more about how to build agents themselves. A year ago, the first publicly available AI agents — AutoGPT, for example, which was just a very simple agent based on ChatGPT — were basically useless. But a few weeks ago, the startup Cognition Labs released Devin, an AI software engineer that can build and deploy entire small web applications. Devin is an impressive feat of engineering, and good enough to take some small gigs on Upwork and deliver working code. It had an almost 14 percent success rate on a benchmark that measures ability to resolve issues on the software developer platform GitHub. That’s a big leap forward for which there’s surely an economic niche — but at best, it’s a very junior software engineer who’d need close supervision by a more senior one. Still, like most things AI, we can expect improvement in the future. Should we make billions of AI agents?Would it be cool for everyone in the world to have an AI personal assistant who could plan dinner, order groceries, buy a birthday present for your mom, plan a trip to the zoo for the kids, and pay your bills for you while notifying you of any unexpected ones? Yes, absolutely. Would it be incredibly economically valuable to have AI software engineers who can do the work of human software engineers? Yes, absolutely. But: Is there something potentially worrying about creating agents that can reason and act independently, earn money independently, make copies of themselves independently, and do complex things without human oversight? Oh, definitely. For one, there are questions of liability. It’d be just as easy to make “scammer” AIs that spend their time convincing the elderly to send them money as it would to make useful agents. Who would be responsible if that happens? For another, as AI systems get more powerful, the moral quandaries they pose become more pressing. If Devin earns a lot of money as a software engineer, is there a sense that Devin, rather than the team that created him, is entitled to that money? What if Devin’s successors are created by a team that’s made up of hundreds of copies of Devin? And for those who worry about humanity losing control of our future if we build extremely powerful AI systems without thinking about the consequences (I’m one of them), it’s pretty obvious why the idea of AIs with agency is nerve-racking. The transition from systems that act only when users consult them to systems that go out and accomplish complex goals in the real world risks what leading AI scientist Yoshua Bengio calls “rogue AI”: “an autonomous AI system that could behave in ways that would be catastrophically harmful.” Think of it this way: It’s hard to imagine how ChatGPT could kill us, or could even be the kind of thing that would want to. It’s easy to imagine how a hyper-competent AI executive assistant/scam caller/software engineer could.For that reason, some researchers are trying to develop good tests of the capabilities of AI agents built off different language models, so that we’ll know in advance before we widely release ones that can make money, make copies of themselves, and function independently without oversight. Others are working to try to set good regulatory policy in advance, including liability rules that might discourage unleashing an army of super-competent scammer-bots.And while I hope that we have a few years to solve those technical and political challenges, I doubt we’ll have forever. The commercial incentives to make agent AIs are overwhelming, and they can genuinely be extremely useful. We just have to iron out their extraordinary implications — preferably before, rather than after, billions of them exist.A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

As a 20-year veteran of writing code and as a CEO of a company that serves software developers, I had a reflexively skeptical reaction to early predictions that generative AI would eventually make most software development skills obsolete.
While I’m still somewhat skeptical, my experience playing with gen AI in my daily development work has prompted me to open my aperture to what I think is possible. AI will change software development in some pretty fundamental ways, both for better and for worse. Let’s start with the positives.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



An end to grunt work
Developers spend an inordinate amount of time on details like syntax and punctuation. Much of this can (and should) go away. Instead of poring over manuals or piecing together snippets from code exchanges, they will describe a desired outcome and get perfectly formatted code in response. Large language models (LLMs) can also check existing code to ferret out typos, punctuation mistakes and other details that drive developers crazy. 
Reinventing frameworks
Software frameworks like Spring, Express.js and Django have delivered an enormous productivity boost by abstracting away the mundane aspects of software development, setting consistent guidelines and furnishing prewritten code for common functions. Gen AI will enhance their value by creating boilerplate code, automating repetitive tasks and suggesting code optimizations. AI can also help customize framework components to a specific project.
The rise of the generalist
The stock in trade for many developers is their expertise in a particular language. Proficiency in Python or Ruby won’t matter as much when machines can spit code in any language. Similarly, specialized backend skills like testing and code optimization will quickly migrate to gen AI models. The most prized skills will be what machines don’t do well, such as building compelling user interfaces, translating user requirements into specs and inventing new ways to support customers. Software “poets,” or people who dream up big ideas of what can be accomplished in code, will own the spotlight. 
A revolution in testing
Gen AI was made for software testing. The developer writes the code, and the bot creates as many test scripts as you want. A recent IDC survey found that the top two most anticipated benefits of gen AI by a wide margin are software quality assurance and security testing. This will disrupt the DevOps practice of continuous integration/deployment and send many testing specialists looking for new lines of work.
Citizen development on steroids
The current crop of low-code/no-code development tools is already good, and gen AI will take them to the next level. For all their automated elegance, low-/no-code still requires people to piece together a workflow on a whiteboard before committing it to software. In the future, they’ll be able to give the model a hand-drawn sketch of the desired workflow and get the necessary code back in seconds.
AI isn’t a panacea, though
For all its promise, gen AI shouldn’t be seen as a panacea. Consider these potential downsides.
Risk of over-testingadvertisement
Because models can churn out tests quickly, we could end up with many more than we need. Over-testing is a common problem in software development, particularly in organizations that measure performance by the number of tests a team generates. Running too many duplicative or unnecessary tests slows down projects and creates bottlenecks further up the pipeline. When AI can recommend when to remove tests, then we’ll see a huge unblocking of developers — that vision of gen AI excites me for the future.
Skills degradation
“I will always choose a lazy person to do a hard job because he will find an easy way to do it,” is a quote often mistakenly attributed to Bill Gates. While the origin of the quote is unclear, the sentiment is valid. Lazy people find shortcuts that avoid the need for hard work. Gen AI is a drug for lazy developers. It can lead to the creation of bloated, inefficient and poorly performing code. It can throttle the innovation that makes great developers so valuable. Remember that gen AI writes code based on existing patterns and data. That can limit the innovative potential of developers who might not consider more out-of-the-box solutions.
Trust deficitadvertisement
Gen AI is only as good as the data used to train the model. Poor quality data, training shortcuts, and lousy prompt engineering can lead to AI-generated code that doesn’t meet quality standards, is buggy or doesn’t get the job done. That can cause an organization to lose trust in the quality of gen AI and miss out on its many benefits.
Now the money question: Will AI make software developers obsolete?
Although some headline-grabbing pundits have suggested it, there’s no historical precedent for such a conclusion. Technological advancements — from high-level languages to object orientation to frameworks — have steadily made developers more productive, but demand has only grown. Gen AI could dent the market for low-end basic coding skills, but the bigger impact will be to move the entire profession up the value chain to do what LLMs don’t do very well at the moment: Innovate. Remember that gen AI models are trained on what is already known, not what could be. I don’t expect a machine to design a revolutionary user interface or dream up an Uber anytime soon. 
Nevertheless, developers won’t see a transformation like this again in their careers. Instead of raging against the machine, as I initially did, they should ride the wave. The prospect of doing away with much of the tedium of building software should excite everyone. The risk that some functions may disappear should be an incentive to action. High-quality developers who translate business requirements into elegant and performant software will always be in high demand. Make it your mission to move your skills up the stack.

						FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces OMB Policy to Advance Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management in Federal Agencies’ Use of Artificial Intelligence

					Statements and Releases				










Administration announces completion of 150-day actions tasked by President Biden’s landmark Executive Order on AI
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is issuing OMB’s first government-wide policy to mitigate risks of artificial intelligence (AI) and harness its benefits – delivering on a core component of the President Biden’s landmark AI Executive Order.  The Order directed sweeping action to strengthen AI safety and security, protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for consumers and workers, promote innovation and competition, advance American leadership around the world, and more. Federal agencies have reported that they have completed all of the 150-day actions tasked by the E.O, building on their previous success of completing all 90-day actions.
This multi-faceted direction to Federal departments and agencies builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s record of ensuring that America leads the way in responsible AI innovation. In recent weeks, OMB announced that the President’s Budget invests in agencies’ ability to responsibly develop, test, procure, and integrate transformative AI applications across the Federal Government.
In line with the President’s Executive Order, OMB’s new policy directs the following actions:
Address Risks from the Use of AI
This guidance places people and communities at the center of the government’s innovation goals. Federal agencies have a distinct responsibility to identify and manage AI risks because of the role they play in our society, and the public must have confidence that the agencies will protect their rights and safety.
By December 1, 2024, Federal agencies will be required to implement concrete safeguards when using AI in a way that could impact Americans’ rights or safety. These safeguards include a range of mandatory actions to reliably assess, test, and monitor AI’s impacts on the public, mitigate the risks of algorithmic discrimination, and provide the public with transparency into how the government uses AI. These safeguards apply to a wide range of AI applications from health and education to employment and housing.
For example, by adopting these safeguards, agencies can ensure that:

When at the airport, travelers will continue to have the ability to opt out from the use of TSA facial recognition without any delay or losing their place in line.
When AI is used in the Federal healthcare system to support critical diagnostics decisions, a human being is overseeing the process to verify the tools’ results and avoids disparities in healthcare access.
When AI is used to detect fraud in government services there is human oversight of impactful decisions and affected individuals have the opportunity to seek remedy for AI harms.

If an agency cannot apply these safeguards, the agency must cease using the AI system, unless agency leadership justifies why doing so would increase risks to safety or rights overall or would create an unacceptable impediment to critical agency operations.   
To protect the federal workforce as the government adopts AI, OMB’s policy encourages agencies to consult federal employee unions and adopt the Department of Labor’s forthcoming principles on mitigating AI’s potential harms to employees. The Department is also leading by example, consulting with federal employees and labor unions both in the development of those principles and its own governance and use of AI.
The guidance also advises Federal agencies on managing risks specific to their procurement of AI. Federal procurement of AI presents unique challenges, and a strong AI marketplace requires safeguards for fair competition, data protection, and transparency. Later this year, OMB will take action to ensure that agencies’ AI contracts align with OMB policy and protect the rights and safety of the public from AI-related risks. The RFI issued today will collect input from the public on ways to ensure that private sector companies supporting the Federal Government follow the best available practices and requirements.
Expand Transparency of AI Use
The policy released today requires Federal agencies to improve public transparency in their use of AI by requiring agencies to publicly:

Release expanded annual inventories of their AI use cases, including identifying use cases that impact rights or safety and how the agency is addressing the relevant risks.
Report metrics about the agency’s AI use cases that are withheld from the public inventory because of their sensitivity.
Notify the public of any AI exempted by a waiver from complying with any element of the OMB policy, along with justifications for why.
Release government-owned AI code, models, and data, where such releases do not pose a risk to the public or government operations.

Today, OMB is also releasing detailed draft instructions to agencies detailing the contents of this public reporting. 
Advance Responsible AI Innovation
OMB’s policy will also remove unnecessary barriers to Federal agencies’ responsible AI innovation. AI technology presents tremendous opportunities to help agencies address society’s most pressing challenges. Examples include:

Addressing the climate crisis and responding to natural disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is using AI to quickly review and assess structural damage in the aftermath of hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is developing AI to conduct more accurate forecasting of extreme weather, flooding, and wildfires.
Advancing public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using AI to predict the spread of disease and detect the illicit use of opioids, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is using AI to reduce waste and identify anomalies in drug costs.
Protecting public safety. The Federal Aviation Administration is using AI to help deconflict air traffic in major metropolitan areas to improve travel time, and the Federal Railroad Administration is researching AI to help predict unsafe railroad track conditions.

Advances in generative AI are expanding these opportunities, and OMB’s guidance encourages agencies to responsibly experiment with generative AI, with adequate safeguards in place. Many agencies have already started this work, including through using AI chatbots to improve customer experiences and other AI pilots.
Grow the AI Workforce
Building and deploying AI responsibly to serve the public starts with people. OMB’s guidance directs agencies to expand and upskill their AI talent. Agencies are aggressively strengthening their workforces to advance AI risk management, innovation, and governance including:

By Summer 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to hiring 100 AI professionals to promote the trustworthy and safe use of AI as part of the National AI Talent Surge created by Executive Order 14110 and will be running a career fair for AI roles across the Federal Government on April 18.
To facilitate these efforts, Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance on pay and leave flexibilities for AI roles, to improve retention and emphasize the importance of AI talent across the Federal Government.
The Fiscal Year 2025 President’s Budget includes an additional $5 million to expand General Services Administration’s government-wide AI training program, which last year had over 4,800 participants from across 78 Federal agencies.  

Strengthen AI Governance
To ensure accountability, leadership, and oversight for the use of AI in the Federal Government, the OMB policy requires federal agencies to:

Designate Chief AI Officers, who will coordinate the use of AI across their agencies. Since December, OMB and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have regularly convened these officials in a new Chief AI Officer Council to coordinate their efforts across the Federal Government and to prepare for implementation of OMB’s guidance.
Establish AI Governance Boards, chaired by the Deputy Secretary or equivalent, to coordinate and govern the use of AI across the agency. As of today, the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and State have established these governance bodies, and every CFO Act agency is required to do so by May 27, 2024.

In addition to this guidance, the Administration announcing several other measures to promote the responsible use of AI in Government:

OMB will issue a request for information (RFI) on Responsible Procurement of AI in Government, to inform future OMB action to govern AI use under Federal contracts;
Agencies will expand 2024 Federal AI Use Case Inventory reporting, to broadly expand public transparency in how the Federal Government is using AI;
The Administration has committed to hire 100 AI professionals by Summer 2024 as part of the National AI Talent Surge to promote the trustworthy and safe use of AI.

With these actions, the Administration is demonstrating that Government is leading by example as a global model for the safe, secure, and trustworthy use of AI. The policy announced today builds on the Administration’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework, and will drive Federal accountability and oversight of AI, increase transparency for the public, advance responsible AI innovation for the public good, and create a clear baseline for managing risks.
It also delivers on a major milestone 150 days since the release of Executive Order 14110, and the table below presents an updated summary of many of the activities federal agencies have completed in response to the Executive Order.

Scale AI, the data processing company that advertises itself as a way to train generative AI on higher-quality information, has apparently shut down access to its platform in several countries, leaving gig workers in the lurch.
The company, which does much of its data processing through a subsidiary called Remotasks, cut access to its portal for workers in Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan in  March, according to a report by Rest of World. The gig workers used by Remotask, and by extension Scale, improve data quality by adding labels, annotations, and general human input to information set to be processed by AIs.
The idea is to help AI tools learn by shaping their perceptions of, say, lidar data from cars or other information.
 
 
 













 
 

According to Rest of World’s report, workers — many of whom rely on Remotasks for their main income — were greeted by a message saying that “we regret to inform you that at the moment we are unable to provide service in your location.” The report also notes that remote workers “often have few reliable ways to contact supervisors or escalate complaints,” despite the presence of hotlines and Slack channels.

Scale released a statement in September detailing its relationship with Remotasks, which it calls the “data annotation” side of its business. The company said it partners with the Global Living Wage Coalition and conducts quarterly pay analyses to “ensure fair and competitive compensation” for the gig workers annotating its data. Scale also criticized “misunderstandings and mischaracterizations” about the way it treats its workers through Remotasks.
Scale could not be reached for comment on Rest of World’s report, which said that many of the workers affected by the apparent shutdown only found out about it when they attempted to log in and work. According to Rest of World, a company spokesperson blamed the lack of communication with workers on an administrative error, while saying that the shutdowns were put in place for “enhanced security protocols.”
 
 
 













 
 

In addition to the shutdowns in Pakistan, Nigeria and Kenya, Rest of World reported that new signups for Remotask work had been blocked in several other countries, including Thailand, India, Poland and Vietnam.
Rest of World’s report ran a day after The Information reported that Scale — which has been one of the AI industry’s early success stories — was up for a new round of funding, courtesy of VC firm Accel, which was an early investor in Scale. The proposed funding round would raise the company’s value to $13 billion, a rise of 80%.
The company joins several other big names in the generative AI industry, including AI-powered robot creators Figure AI, LLM creator Anthropic, and market powerhouse OpenAI in lining up hundreds of millions in new funding from investors desperate to capitalize on the much-hyped technology, according to a report from siliconAngle.

Artificial intelligence has been developing in leaps and bounds but along with that progression comes a major threat to human employment.
The International Monetary Fund has released a survey that found AI will affect nearly half of all jobs around the world.
Experts here warn we should start preparing for a future where humans are no longer necessary.

AI could pose 'extinction-level' threat to humans - US govt report







It's been just under a year since ChatGPT by OpenAI kicked off a global AI arms race - a race that's entering a critical new stage.
""I think it's going to get scarily faster in the next six to 12 months,"" said tech entrepreneur Asa Cox.
""I think the next step is going to be super interesting when we move from us copiloting in with the AI to the AI running the show and we're the copilot. So then we'll change seats and then it'll get really exciting.""
At Arcanum in Wellington, Cox trains AI bots to automate aspects of Kiwi businesses - like answering emails, chasing suppliers and organising logistics.
""If you had a team of interns to do all the stuff you didn't want to do, what would you get them to do? And that's all the stuff that AI can now take on,"" Cox said.
""And so people should be watching this and have a long list of 'What can I get rid of and what would I do with that time?' Maybe it is growing the business more, maybe it is spending more time with the family. But there's a huge volume of repetitive things that people right now don't believe that AI can take on. But it can.""
But automating basic admin is just the start. In 12 months AI tools became of creating perfect videos, and the pace of progress is exponential.
The computing power driving advanced AI models is doubling every six months, and in the AI goldrush, whoever sells the shovels, reaps the rewards.
NVIDIA, the company building advanced AI chips, saw its stock price soar almost 2000 percent in five years. Now it's the 3rd most valuable company on earth.



But chatbots are just the beginning - actual bots are arriving.
""We've been able to make robots like this for quite a long time,"" AI Professor Michael Witbrock said.
""And what got stuck was not that we couldn't make them mechanically. It's because they just weren't smart enough to control their bodies.
""So what was going to happen is that pretty good bodies like this with AI, very smart AI, will be able to do more.""
A report by the IMF estimates that currently 60 percent of all jobs in advanced economies could be disrupted by AI, and 40 percent of all jobs globally - potentially leading to mass unemployment.
Those numbers will likely increase as AI's capabilities do, and experts here warn we're running out of time to prepare.
""It is going to change the way human civilization works,"" Prof Witbrock said.
""The nature of work, the nature of what humans are expected to do and what machines are expected to do is going to change quite dramatically. The sooner we start to work out how our society accommodates that change, the better.""
That might sound scary to some, but the potential upsides are equally transformational.
""Biology is so complicated that unaided human beings cannot possibly understand it. With AI helping us, there's a very real chance that we can completely understand biology and make diseases a thing of the past,"" Prof Witbrock said.
An AI-powered cure for cancer, Alzheimer's, and the automation of all the work humans hate. Sounds great, but reaching that bright AI future requires action now.
""I think everyone can agree with us, we haven't done a good job of regulating technology of the past 20, 30 years,"" tech policy analyst Sarah Bickerton said.



""What I would like to see is some policy-developed guardrails around the effects of AI.
""We understand the way in which technology can have negative effects, that's not an insurmountable problem for us to be able to solve.""
Australia, the US, the EU and the UK all have regulatory work underway while our Government is so far taking a hands-off approach.
While how to prepare is an open question, our only certainty is that the age of AI is here and the world will never be the same.
