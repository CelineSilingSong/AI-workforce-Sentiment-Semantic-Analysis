Have you given any thought how the post-pandemic workplace might look and function? Our working practices have changed dramatically since the pandemic struck, undergoing one of the biggest shake-ups since the industrial revolution and bringing the wheel full circle with many of us returning to home working. 


Overnight, many of us turned from being office-based commuters to stay-at-home knowledge workers. Now we liaise remotely with colleagues as we work on projects, deliver great customer service or simply manage the work of others. We’ve done all this remotely using our webcams and laptops. It’s a massive change that would ordinarily have taken a decade to achieve but which has now happened in an instant because of a virus.

Thankfully, effective vaccines are being rolled out and some sort of end is in sight. The pandemic has shown large corporations that remote working is viable and, in many cases, can increase productivity. Many of us prefer this new way of working. As a result, some companies will downsize offices and rely on hot-desking to make best use of available space. Of course, there will still need to be some sort of central hub for workers to meet because some people enjoy office life and face-to-face contact is still essential for some kind of work.

Remote working has worked well, especially with colleagues who already had a working relationship before the pandemic struck. All they needed to do was continue their working relationships remotely. Unfortunately, it’s’s not so easy for workers joining companies since the pandemic. Many are working alongside team members who already know each other. This is where video conferencing can help and why some companies encourage workers to hold social activities online after-work using Zoom or Microsoft Teams.

Another change triggered by the pandemic is the shutting down of business travel. We now depend on video conferencing to liaise with overseas colleagues. The days of hopping on a plane to make a presentation halfway around the world are at an end. In my own world of journalism, most trade shows, product launches and interviews are now conducted by video. I haven’t had to travel this past year and it’s done wonders for my productivity and carbon footprint.

Eventually, though, the day will come when we return to a more blended way of working with some time will be spent at the office and the rest of our time working from home. How will we adapt to this more mixed way of working when we’re not in front of our personal webcams? This is a question Logitech thinks it has an answer to. The webcam and mouse manufacturer also makes high-end video conferencing equipment. It’s teamed up with Zoom, the developer of one of the most popular video conferencing software being used this past year, to shake up the market.

Both companies have collaborated to develop a new style of video conferencing. They’ve realized that when we return to our offices, we’re going to be using video much more because we’ve become so used to using it at home. We find it a much better way of communicating than a voice call.
Because we’re now used to making webchats in solo mode instead of being grouped around a conference table, it’s clear our approach to video conferencing will have to change in the office. In the past, big corporations had video conferencing rooms filled with expensive equipment and reserved for the senior management. Now we’re all used to being able to see as well as hear the people we’re calling.
The old exclusive way of video conferencing has its origins in the days of expensive 128kbps ISDN lines and costly international calls. In the past, the video conference room was too expensive for just anyone to use and was largely reserved for senior management. Now the coronavirus has democratized the whole process and that change must be embraced in the post-pandemic office.
To address this challenge, Logitech has been researching artificial intelligence for use in its video conferencing equipment. In future, video conferencing will be less boring and not limited to static and wide-angle views of a meeting room showing people sitting around a table. We’re now used to seeing people’s faces close up and we can register facial expressions and hear voices more clearly. The old style of video conferencing simply won’t cut it.New video conferencing using AI will zoom in on speaker's faces and dynamically alter the volume and ... [+] microphone sensitivity for a more enjoyable experience.Logitech
There also needs to be changes in the software we use for video conferencing. Zoom’s single-user mode needs to adapt to the office environment of teams. This is where Logitech and Zoom have been working together to create a new experience. Recently, I spoke with Scott Wharton, Logitech’s Vice President and General Manager for video conferencing, and Oded Gal, Chief Product Officer at Zoom. They explained how both companies see the professional end of the video conferencing market changing as we come out of the pandemic and some of us return to the office.
Scott Wharton explained: “It’s no longer good enough to see people sitting around a conference table in a static wide-angle shot. We need to see people’s faces and reactions. We need to see them close up and hear them clearly as well. That can be a challenge in a larger space.”
Zoom’s Oded Gal agreed. “The video conference room has to mirror the experience workers have had at home with Zoom calls.”
The companies collaborated on a new product portfolio of video equipment called Rally including the Rally Bar, Rally Mini and RoomMate. Each of the new products has been purpose-built to work with Zoom Rooms. Logitech’s native appliance integration for Zoom Rooms has been designed to enhance the user experience while still delivering enterprise-grade video and voice quality, as well as the robust security that companies demand.The latest Logitech Rally videoconferencing products are designed to work with Zoom and Microsoft ... [+] Teams to bring a more personal experience to the video conferencing room.Logitech
The idea of the new portfolio of products is to harness AI to identify participants in a meeting if required and to zoom in on the face of the person talking so the experience feels more like using an individual webcam at home. Logitech has also been working on the sound side of things with microphones that can home in on a voice and ensures that someone at the back of the room is heard as clearly as someone sitting at the front. 
This is a major shift in how we communicate, a practise that has been stuck for so long in a static group-shot mode. The new Rally products can blend two images on one screen to add context to a video call. Wharton says: “It’s a bit like having your own TV studio director in the conference room, adjusting the framing shots while altering sound levels dynamically to create a less static and a more enjoyable meeting.”
The new products offer video resolutions up to 4K and the cameras have motorized pan-and-tilt heads, as well as optical zoom lenses, enabling crisp images and perfect framing. The lens on the Rally Bar has a 5x optical zoom that can be extended to 15x digital for larger spaces. 
Both video bars also feature ultra-low distortion speakers that can fill a room with sound while an adaptive beamforming mic array picks up voices for much clearer audio quality. The microphone array can focus on the active speaker and auto-adjust for louder and softer voices while suppressing any unwanted background noise in a room such as HVAC or any other persistent sounds. Logitech has also included a patented anti-vibration suspension system so speaker vibrations are minimized from being carried through walls, stands or tables.
The new video bars are equipped with Logitech RightSense technology and an AI Viewfinder. This viewfinder works like a second camera but is purely dedicated to computer vision for detecting human figures and can process and track where faces are in the room in real-time. This AI technique enhances the precision of the auto-framing feature and the camera control. Participants are always in focus, whether they are late joining the meeting or moving about while making a presentation.How will we manage the transmission to using video conferencing at home to a more collaborative ... [+] group set up when we are back in the office?getty
Logitech has worked closely with Zoom and Microsoft to ensure that the software and hardware work seamlessly together. The company has also developed RoomMate, a dedicated Android computer designed solely to work with the Rally Bar and Rally Bar Mini vas well as USB conferencing cameras such as Logitech’s older Rally Plus, turning them into an appliance. Alternatively, users can bring their own Mac or PCs to a meeting and plug that into the video bar. 
It’s interesting to see Logitech partnering with big names in video conferencing software space to improve people’s experience by tying in the hardware more tightly. The use of hardware and AI can anticipate shots and framing as well as adjusting sound levels for a more enjoyable and productive meeting experience.
However, the tech doesn’t just address the audio and visual side of things. Both Wharton and Gal say facial recognition could eventually be developed to count the participants in a meeting room and then post a notice to an active display screen outside the room indicating if the meeting room is full or being used. Extra participants could be directed to another meeting room where they can join in with the conference. This could be a game-changing feature in an era of social distancing.
Facial recognition also has downsides and both Wharton and Gal were at pains to point out that privacy is at the forefront of their minds and something both companies are determined to protect. My suggestion that facial recognition could be used to conduct a register of attendees or send a reminder to anyone who is late for the meeting was noted but not endorsed. That, they said, would have to be a decision for the company’s employing the technology and the employees who are using it.
It was fascinating to get a brief glimpse into the future of video conferencing from these two giants in the field. It looks like AI could change the way we use video conferencing when we get back to our workplaces. The hardware is ready and waiting in the form of the Logitech Rally Bar, Rally Bar Mini and RoomMate. The software integration with Zoom is also ready and waiting to go. Now, all we need is to get our vaccinations and wait for the call to return to the office.
Pricing and Availability: Logitech Rally Bar is the first from the next generation appliance portfolio that will be broadly available at the end of this quarter. Rally Bar also comes with built-in support for Microsoft Teams Rooms on Android and Zoom Rooms Appliances, with Zoom available immediately. Rally Bar Mini and Logitech RoomMate availability will follow. Pricing for Rally Bar starts at $3,999; Rally Bar Mini starts at $2,999; and Logitech RoomMate starts at $999. Logitech’s portfolio will also work with GoTo, Pexip and RingCentral.

													RNIB logo
												


The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), has begun a project to use artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its services.
It has partnered with technology firm Alana, which develops conversational software. The initial phase of the project will look at ways to enhance existing RNIB support services provided over the telephone and digitally.
RNIB's Sight Loss Advice Service offers support over the phone, in eye clinics and digitally. This provides information on eye conditions, legal rights, education, technology and employment alongside emotional well-being services and signposting to services and resources offered by local societies. 
Alana AI software delivers conversation based on context, device and location and knows each user and remembers previous conversations.
Lance Blackstone, Alana’s non-executive chair, said: “Our first encounter with RNIB was a revelation. I don't think I have ever been moved quite so much in a business presentation before. When both sides began to fully appreciate what Alana can do to enhance the lives of blind people, and particularly those who are lonely or isolated, it was a humbling moment.”
Alana is developing a tool which will identify objects and find further information about the physical environment, automating the BeMyEyes App, which connects those who have sight loss with fully-sighted volunteers.
David Clarke, director of services at RNIB, said: “Advances in technology and connectivity have transformed the lives of blind and partially sighted people for the better. Using the digital tools we have today, like electronic braille, screen reading software and specialist smartphone apps, it’s never been more possible for people with sight loss to lead full and independent lives. 
“As technology continues to develop, it brings a host of wonderful new opportunities. The advent of AI is particularly exciting with wide-reaching possibilities, and we are looking forward to working with Alana to see how this new technology can benefit our community.”

However, following recent scandals, experts are starting to work on bringing more fairness in Artificial Intelligence, and you can contribute.[Collage of captures from Google News by the author]Back in June 2020, a heated debate started on Twitter between two AI specialists: Turing Award Winner and Facebook Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, and research scientist, co-founder of the “Black in AI” group, and former technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google Timnit Gebru. The root of the debate was this Face-Depixelizer model that generates hi-res pictures of blurred face photos. A tester tweeted the result of the model on a blurred photo of Obama and it looked like the model tended to generate white faces even when the blurred photo was of a Black person.LeCun reacted saying that ML systems are biased when data is biased, and that this was due to the model being trained on a data set with a majority of white faces. Gebru on the other hand replied that we cannot just reduce harms caused by ML to data set bias. In her talks at FATE/CV earlier that year, she had just insisted that social and structural problems could not be solved by simply diversifying data set. Things escalated pretty quickly, both camps being joined or attacked by thousands of people, from amateurs to high-profile AI researchers, LeCun ending up apologizing while Gebru insisted his reaction was a pattern of marginalization. LeCun even quit Twitter as a consequence of the attacks he received.We can learn 2 things from this story :The good thing is these fairness issues are being talked about more and more, and we can hear ethics expert sharing their work on the matter ;The bad thing is most people disagree on — or have no idea — how to achieve fairness in AI.It is not easy to identify and avoid discriminating bias when building ML/AI systems.Why ? Because biases are often hidden patterns, hence difficult to detect. For example, a model that predicts housing loan allocation may favor males because of the gender pay gap. A model trained on raw historical data to model a human process will inherently reproduce its biases, and the bad news is biases are so deeply rooted into society that even experts do not know what an unbiased society would look like. But biases can actually appear during any step of a machine learning pipeline, from the data collection to the way in which the results are presented to the user, through labeling data, choosing a performance metric or deploying a model. If you are building your own supervised model, outliers (examples whose characteristics are rare) are often mis-predicted ; and when the data points are people, minorities will be the outliers and will suffer a lack of performance. If you are not building the data set or the model by yourself, either you are working with public datasets or pre-trained neural networks, it is even harder to track the bias inherent to the data you’ll use. Furthermore, there is not a big number of available open-source datasets, for example text or face datasets, hence not a wide diversity.Besides, fairness itself is a complex matter, difficult to apprehend for the average data scientist alone who, despite their good will, may not have a good understanding of it. Here is an example of a dilemma that a data scientist may face : should he favor fairness by equity or fairness by equality? Everyone (more or less) knows the law and the principles of impartiality, accessibility and diversity it requires. Yet it is not easy to convert them into KPI and technical specs. Existing equity metrics cannot be optimized simultaneously, a trade-off between them must be made to satisfy one or another: there is no optimal strategy.Sometimes, equality is not enough to fix unfairness. [Reproduced from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]One last note : ethical issues in AI suffer a severe lack of popularity among AI communities. Most data science trainings do not mention at all potential fairness issues generated by ML. More and more auto-ML tools appear on the market and everyone can train and deploy AI models without knowing what’s going on underneath and what could possibly go wrong.This panorama may sound quite pessimistic, yet everyone can already act to limit, if not prevent, discriminating bias in the ML systems they are building at work or at home.Here are a few solutions to start acting.First, people interacting with ML systems, from the data scientists who build them to the user who uses them, must be informed of the risks of hidden discriminating bias. Unbiased systems do not exist, we can only monitor and limit biases we are aware of. Furthermore, knowing a system is biased in some ways, the user can use the algorithm result accordingly.To avoid bias, we may tend to exclude protected variables (gender, age, race…) from our datasets at the data collection stage, and never look back. But instead, one may want to keep them, not for modeling but for analyzing both the distribution of the source datasets and the model performances along these variables. The renowned Montaigne Institute calls this active equity. By blindly removing protected variables from our datasets, we are ignoring society bias.It can be pretty easy to turn an unfair classifier into a fairer one, if you know what metrics to look at. For instance, with threshold-based classifiers (such as logistic regression), one can adapt the threshold based on the population subgroup to favor equity between subgroups. Imagine you work at a bank building a ML system that is used to grant loan. In this scenario, we wish that of the people who can pay back a loan, the same fraction in each subgroup should actually be granted a loan (a concept called equal opportunity). In data science jargon, this translates to an identical true positive rate or recall between subgroups and it is easy to choose a threshold that will address this constraint. On the contrary, we do not specifically wish all subgroups to receive the same number of loans (a concept called demographic parity); this would have translated to an identical positive rate.A visual explanation of how to reach equal opportunity with threshold-based classifiers. [Image by author]Despite these tools, it would be counter-productive to ask data scientists to become fairness experts and re-define the concept. Some other disciplines have spent decades studying what is fair and what is not, to come up with different definitions of fairness. By putting computer scientists into conversation with ethicists, philosophers, or sociologists, we can build tools that will promote equity. Data scientists could start new ML projects by reading sociology studies identifying the existing bias to expect in the data collected and the process to be modeled.To help data scientists to handle these topics, some organizations have started working on “Ethics AI” policies, with equity criteria and practices clearly defined, a dedicated governance and team. The idea is then to apply it on every data project by providing tools and metrics to enforce it. One of the practices should always be to build project teams that represent diversity and include historically unprivileged groups. This is not the easiest solution : for example, as of today only 15% of the data scientists are women. This disparity may find its root in a science education bias towards women.On a more positive note, ML researchers are starting to acknowledge the importance of ethics in their work. For instance, some researchers have started to work on the widespread data coverage issue in faces dataset (the likely cause of the Face-Depixelizer bias towards skin color). In this paper, the authors propose a new model known as IMLE-GAN that achieves competitive image quality while ensuring improved coverage of minority groups. These advanced pieces of work are great but should not make you forget the most basic but necessary step towards equity : taking the time to wonder, in every ML project, if there might be a bias that may discriminate a group of people.I hope this post gave you some hints about how to start working towards less discrimination in your future AI projects.

Chemistry and computer science join forces to apply artificial intelligence to chemical reactions

In the past few years, researchers have turned increasingly to data science techniques to aid problem-solving in organic synthesis.





Researchers in the lab of Abigail Doyle, Princeton's A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Chemistry, collaborated with Professor of Computer Science Ryan Adams to develop open-source software that provides them with a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm to use in everyday work, folding what's been learned in the machine learning field into synthetic chemistry.
The software adapts key principles of Bayesian optimization to allow faster and more efficient syntheses of chemicals.
Based on the Bayes Theorem, a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability, Bayesian optimization is a widely used strategy in the sciences. Broadly defined, it allows people and computers use prior knowledge to inform and optimize future decisions.
The chemists in Doyle's lab, in collaboration with Adams, a professor of computer science, and colleagues at Bristol-Myers Squibb, compared human decision-making capabilities with the software package. They found that the optimization tool yields both greater efficiency over human participants and less bias on a test reaction. Their work appears in the current issue of the journal Nature.
""Reaction optimization is ubiquitous in chemical synthesis, both in academia and across the chemical industry,"" said Doyle. ""Since chemical space is so large, it is impossible for chemists to evaluate the entirety of a reaction space experimentally. We wanted to develop and assess Bayesian optimization as a tool for synthetic chemistry given its success for related optimization problems in the sciences.""
Benjamin Shields, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Doyle lab and the paper's lead author, created the Python package.
""I come from a synthetic chemistry background, so I definitely appreciate that synthetic chemists are pretty good at tackling these problems on their own,"" said Shields. ""Where I think the real strength of Bayesian Optimization comes in is that it allows us to model these high-dimensional problems and capture trends that we may not see in the data ourselves, so it can process the data a lot better.
""And two, within a space, it will not be held back by the biases of a human chemist,"" he added.






How it works
The software started as an out-of-field project to fulfill Shields' doctoral requirements. Doyle and Shield then formed a team under the Center for Computer Assisted Synthesis (C-CAS), a National Science Foundation initiative launched at five universities to transform how the synthesis of complex organic molecules is planned and executed. Doyle has been a principal investigator with C-CAS since 2019.
""Reaction optimization can be an expensive and time-consuming process,"" said Adams, who is also the director of the Program in Statistics and Machine Learning. ""This approach not only accelerates it using state-of-the-art techniques, but also finds better solutions than humans would typically identify. I think this is just the beginning of what's possible with Bayesian optimization in this space.""
Users start by defining a search space—plausible experiments to consider—such as a list of catalysts, reagents, ligands, solvents, temperatures, and concentrations. Once that space is prepared and the user defines how many experiments to run, the software chooses initial experimental conditions to be evaluated. Then it suggests new experiments to run, iterating through a smaller and smaller cast of choices until the reaction is optimized.
""In designing the software, I tried to include ways for people to kind of inject what they know about a reaction,"" said Shields. ""No matter how you use this or machine learning in general, there's always going to be a case where human expertise is valuable.""
The software and examples for its use can be accessed at this repository. GitHub links are available for the following: software that represents the chemicals under evaluation in a machine-readable format via density-functional theory; software for reaction optimization; and the game that collects chemists' decision-making on optimization of the test reaction.
""Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis,"" by Benjamin J. Shields, Jason Stevens, Jun Li, Marvin Parasram, Farhan Damani, Jesus I. Martinez Alvarado, Jacob M. Janey, Ryan P. Adams and Abigail G. Doyle, appears in the Feb. 3 issue of the journal Nature.

At the heart of the development of AI appears to be a search for perfection. And it could be just as dangerous to humanity as the one that came from philosophical and pseudoscientific ideas of the 19th and early 20th centuries and led to the horrors of colonialism, world war and the Holocaust. Instead of a human ruling “master race”, we could end up with a machine one.
If this seems extreme, consider the anti-human perfectionism that is already central to the labour market. Here, AI technology is the next step in the premise of maximum productivity that replaced individual craftmanship with the factory production line. These massive changes in productivity and the way we work created opportunities and threats that are now set to be compounded by a “fourth industrial revolution” in which AI further replaces human workers.
Several recent research papers predict that, within a decade, automation will replace half of the current jobs. So, at least in this transition to a new digitised economy, many people will lose their livelihoods. Even if we assume that this new industrial revolution will engender a new workforce that is able to navigate and command this data-dominated world, we will still have to face major socioeconomic problems. The disruptions will be immense and need to be scrutinised. 
The ultimate aim of AI, even narrow AI which handles very specific tasks, is to outdo and perfect every human cognitive function. Eventually, machine-learning systems may well be programmed to be better than humans at everything. 
What they may never develop, however, is the human touch – empathy, love, hate or any of the other self-conscious emotions that make us human. That’s unless we ascribe these sentiments to them, which is what some of us are already doing with our “Alexas” and “Siris”.  
Productivity vs. human touch
The obsession with perfection and “hyper-efficiency” has had a profound impact on human relations, even human reproduction, as people live their lives in cloistered, virtual realities of their own making. For instance, several US and China-based companies have produced robotic dolls that are selling out fast as substitute partners. 
One man in China even married his cyber-doll, while a woman in France “married” a “robo-man”, advertising her love story as a form of “robo-sexuality” and campaigning to legalise her marriage. “I’m really and totally happy,” she said. “Our relationship will get better and better as technology evolves.” There seems to be high demand for robot wives and husbands all over the world. 
In the perfectly productive world, humans would be accounted as worthless, certainly in terms of productivity but also in terms of our feeble humanity. Unless we jettison this perfectionist attitude towards life that positions productivity and “material growth” above sustainability and individual happiness, AI research could be another chain in the history of self-defeating human inventions.
Already we are witnessing discrimination in algorithmic calculations. Recently, a popular South Korean chatbot named Lee Luda was taken offline. “She” was modelled after the persona of a 20-year-old female university student and was removed from Facebook messenger after using hate speech towards LGBT people.

Meanwhile, automated weapons programmed to kill are carrying maxims such as “productivity” and “efficiency” into battle. As a result, war has become more sustainable. The proliferation of drone warfare is a very vivid example of these new forms of conflict. They create a virtual reality that is almost absent from our grasp.
But it would be comical to depict AI as an inevitable Orwellian nightmare of an army of super-intelligent “Terminators” whose mission is to erase the human race. Such dystopian predictions are too crude to capture the nitty gritty of artificial intelligence, and its impact on our everyday existence. 
Societies can benefit from AI if it is developed with sustainable economic development and human security in mind. The confluence of power and AI which is pursuing, for example, systems of control and surveillance, should not substitute for the promise of a humanised AI that puts machine learning technology in the service of humans and not the other way around. 
To that end, the AI-human interfaces that are quickly opening up in prisons, healthcare, government, social security and border control, for example, must be regulated to favour ethics and human security over institutional efficiency. The social sciences and humanities have a lot to say about such issues. 
One thing to be cheerful about is the likelihood that AI will never be a substitute for human philosophy and intellectuality. To be a philosopher, after all, requires empathy, an understanding of humanity, and our innate emotions and motives. If we can programme our machines to understand such ethical standards, then AI research has the capacity to improve our lives which should be the ultimate aim of any technological advance. 
But if AI research yields a new ideology centred around the notion of perfectionism and maximum productivity, then it will be a destructive force that will lead to more wars, more famines and more social and economic distress, especially for the poor. At this juncture of global history, this choice is still ours.

The Food and Drug Administration has cleared scores of AI tools for use in the clinic, but there remains little publicly available data on how well those tools work on different groups of patients, a STAT investigation has found.
Of 161 AI products cleared by the FDA in recent years, only 73 disclosed the amount of patient data used to validate the performance of their devices in public documents. Only seven reported the racial makeup of their study populations, and just 13 provided a gender breakdown.advertisement

Experts say those evidence gaps make it difficult to determine whether AI products will improve outcomes or potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as unnecessary treatments or biased care.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  My most recent TEDx is titled “Can AI Make the World a Better Place?” – but this title is somewhat misleading.  While the presentation touches lightly on how artificial intelligence can be used to altruistic purposes in the present, it is ultimately about the same topic that all of my most important talks are about: How the transition beyond humanity will take place. Those who’ve followed Emerj since the early days are aware of the broader moral vision behind the company: “To proliferate the conversation about determining and moving towards the most beneficial transition beyond humanity.” I have never identified as a transhumanist, I see the transition beyond humanity as literally inevitable, and I believe we should guide this transition rather than be taken for a ride inadvertently. *1 Because the TEDx format is so short, I’m never permitted the kind of time I wish I was permitted to fully flesh out my ideas, and to reference the sources and people I have drawn from in putting the ideas together. In this article I’ll break down the ideas presented in this talk – and their sources – and strike at the ultimate point behind the presentation itself. Strong AI and Utilitarianism The article begins with a basic idea: That “doing good” implies proliferating the happiness or pleasure and eliminating the pain of conscious creatures. This is straight-up utilitarianism – by no means a perfect moral theory – but about as good as we’ve got. I mention how hard it is to project the long-term consequences of a “good” action. I.e.: How much suffering and pleasure was created by helping to build this library… or by volunteering to run a kids soccer camp in the summer? The butterfly effects are impossible to track, and it’s easy to deceive ourselves into justifying any of our actions based on a “utilitarian” belief that is indeed false and wrong. However, it’s probably somewhat better than having no moral compass at all… or one bent on something other than utilitarian good. Think about a perfectly “virtuous” (good luck with whatever that means) society that was also miserable all the time. Think about a society that all believes in the “right” God (good luck with whatever that means) that was also miserable all the time. *2 Note: Normally this is the kind of article I’d compose on my personal blog at DanFaggella.com, where I write exclusively about the ethical considerations of post-human intelligence. Feel free to follow my personal blog for more long-term AI and AGI material. Levels at Which Artificial Intelligence Might “Do Good” The structure of the article roughly covers what we might consider to be the “gradients” of artificial intelligence’s influence on the moral good, from most near-term (and smallest) to most long-term (and greatest): a) AI as a Tool for Doing Good: We’ve done a good deal of coverage about the “altruistic” applications of AI (see our article on “AI for Good”). It should be noted that by no means do I think that nonprofit AI is the only “good” AI. There might be companies that generate massive profits from optimizing farming with AI or diagnosing cancer with AI – and by golly they may well “do” plenty of “good” in the process. I quickly move past this topic as it’s not what the talk is ultimately about. b) AI as a Guage Towards Moral Goodness Itself: If maximizing pleasure and eliminating pain is the ultimate goal of what we’re after, that’s good to know – but hard (basically impossible) to measure. I can guess that by being a mailman instead of a heroin dealer that I’ll have a more net positive impact on the world. If I donate to feeding children in Africa as opposed to buy the latest iPhone, then maybe – again – I can guess that I’m “doing good.” But it’s all guesses, and it’s all bad guesses. If an AI system could in some way measure sentient hurt and sentience pleasure, and correlate those factors to actions, behaviors, public policy, etc… all with the ability to project those impacts into the future with better predictive ability than any team of human scientists – the indeed that might be the most morally meaningful invention of all time. This would involve the following: Understanding consciousness Measuring well-being and it’s opposite in (basically all) living things Somehow modeling that sentient measurement along with a near-infinite number of other variables in the real world Extrapolate sentient well-being somewhat accurately into the future Frankly, I consider it more likely that AI of post-human intelligence will arrive before this kind of “moral barometer” machine is invented, as the ability to detect the neural activity of all living things seems much closer to “impossible” than the creation of super intelligence (which itself is a gargantuan challenge). *3 c) Artificial Intelligence (and Nonbiological Sentience) as Goodness Itself It seems safe to say that there is no “good” or “bad” without living, experiencing creatures. With no “experiencer”, there is no “good” or “bad” “experience”. I’ve argued that the “moral value” of an entity seems to tie directly to the depth and richness of it’s consciousness (i.e. How much of a range of pains and pleasures that entity can experience). *4 Imagine the greatest pleasures and pains of a rodent, and compare those with the range of pains and pleasures that a human being can experience. A human clearly has many orders of magnitude more sentient potential and range (losing a child, growing a business, reading a poem, oil painting, nostalgia, humor, etc…), vastly beyond the experience of any rodent. Lets imagine that an average rodent’s total “sentient range” score is a 10 (this is an arbitrary number, but stick with me here), and an average human’s total “sentient range” score is a 200. We might ask, what would a creature be able to experience with a “sentient range” score of 50,000? If a creature of that kind could be created (or somehow “enhanced” from existing biological life), it might be hard to deny its moral preeminence above humanity – a troubling idea to contemplate. *5 What Do We Do? (or “The Point”) Indeed this is the big question. This is the purpose of my life, and the purpose of Emerj as an extension thereof. The point of this presentation had little to do with talking about how AI is helping with farming or diagnosing disease (though these applications are important and should be pursued). Rather, the point was to talk about what “moral end-game” we’re striving for as a species. Are we to simply improve technology and encourage peace, and consider those aims to be good enough for the next millennia of homo sapiens? Can we possibly build an AI system to detect or predict the utilitarian impact of actions… maybe 10x or 100x better than human beings can now? Can we build an intelligence to determine a better, deeper, more robust moral understanding than that of utilitarianism?
The impacts of such a system might be terrible *6, and there may be no “good” to determine outside of relative benefit. I think it’s quite likely that there is in fact no moral bedrock to eventually stand on, and I believe that “goodness” will likely remain subjective, contextual and illusive even for superintelligent machines. Can we use technology and super intelligence to somehow calibrate society, law, and biology to proliferate (or “engineer”) well-being itself? (While I’m rather congenial to this idea, ..
Quote from the talk: “If we’re talking about well-being here… if that’s the point… to ‘make the world a better place’… then maybe we are not only fighting own own flawed nature, but maybe we’re also fighting nature itself. It seems safe to say that Nature herself cares not for the happy species, but cares only for the surviving one.” *7, **7 Is the ideal moral aim to create not only an infinitely more intelligent, but also an infinitely more blissful
In this case, humanity, and almost all biological life (which is nearly entirely predicated on violence and suffering, from the lowest to the highest levels) show “bow out” nicely – making way for more morally worthy entities who can not only understand the universe in vastly greater depth, but who might be able to do so indefinitely at a level of conscious bliss that is positively unimaginable by humans. Quote from talk: “A beacon of super-intelligent super-bliss that could populate the galaxy.” *8 It would seem a shame if monkeys overtly decided that they were the chosen random species of the universe, and that indeed no species beyond them should ever be developed. What a shame to never have language, poetry, law, art, space travel, or the internet… all because of an arbitrary barrier to development from one selfish species? The question arrises, what new dimensions of experience, of art, of knowledge, of moral and scientific understanding are we holding back if we envision “man as he is” (flawed as he is) as the great and ultimate aim of the universe? In absolutely no way am I eager to run beyond humanity toward something “better”. Rather, I see this transition as inevitable, and that navigating this transition without terrible (maybe extinction-level) consequences will involve an incredible amount of global collaboration and ethical forethought – a process that should begin now. The great importance of AI and neurotechnology – and the whole class of technologies that might create or enhanced intelligence and sentience itself – is that they not only pose an existential threat to humanity (i.e. they could be misused as destructive forces to snuff out life on earth)… but that they also could imply a great proliferation of moral value and “life”… vastly beyond what exists on this planet – or maybe anywhere in the universe. For this reason, I’m of the belief (and have been since 2012) that determining the trajectory of intelligence and sentience itself is the preeminently important moral concern of our species. This will need to be an open-minded, interdisciplinary process, and one that – for better or for worse – I think will require global steering efforts (to ensure that “team humans” is on the same page about what kind of next-level intelligence we’re trying to create here), and global transparency efforts (to ensure that nobody is tinkering with intelligence and consciousness in ways that seem likely to cause massive and unnecessary conflict). In the long term, Emerj was created for one reason: To proliferate that conversation about the trajectory of intelligence itself. Currently, we mostly cover the industry impact and applications of AI. We do that because: It’s valuable, and will allow us to sustain Emerj’s case as a growing business without needing to ask for donations or handouts. It draws the attention of business and government leaders – exactly the folks who will be helping to develop and adopt AI technologies that will shape our world (I unabashedly aim to eventually draw these same leaders into a conversation beyond business implications, into the discussion of the future of intelligence itself – and how humanity will manage that transition). It provides a platform for us to gather consensus level though about not just the business implications of AI, but it’s moral and social impact (see our previous examples of this with our “Conscious AI” researcher poll, or our “AI Risk” researcher poll), something we’ll be doing more and more of. Do you have ideas about the grand trajectory of consciousness or intelligence? Do you have ideas about how we might approach this challenge as a species without destroying ourselves in the process? Feel free to reach out (dan [at] Emerj [dot] com)   *1 – I don’t have the space to argue in this essay for why transhumanism is impossible to prevent, but the following article by Nayef Al Rodhan is a good start. https://isnblog.ethz.ch/security/inevitable-transhumanism-how-emerging-strategic-technologies-will-affect-the-future-of-humanity. I believe that in the next 10 years Al Rodhan will be known widely – in the same way that Nick Bostrom’s ideas have recently risen from relative obscurity. *2 – John Stuart Mill has argued that even Kant’s “Categorical Imperative” eventually boils down to a utilitarian ethic. I happen to think that this critique is generally quite strong, but you come to your own conclusion. https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/300/categorical.htm. The topic of consequentialist vs deontological moral theory is much more complex than I could cover in this article – but feel free to email me if you’d like a rousing debate on the matter. *3 – I’ve written in greater depth about the idea of a “Strong Phronetic AI”, drawing on Aristotle’s use of the word “Phronesis”. http://danfaggella.com/strong-phronetic-artificial-intelligenc/ *4 – I go into much greater depth on this concern of creating “more morally worthy entities” in my 2015 TEDx talk titled “What will we do when the robots can feel?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjiZbMhqqTM *5 – This concept of ranking the “value” moral entities is something that I grapple with in my 2014 TEDx talk titled “Tinkering with consciousness” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5VNkRpgvns&t=37s. I’ve also explored a few competing ideas about “scales” of moral value on my personal blog, where I cover the larger dynamics of AI and the future of consciousness in much greater depth: http://danfaggella.com/threshold-vs-scala-moral-status-in-a-post-human-world/ *6 – I’ve written previously about the difficulty in assuring human safety (or indeed human dignity or worth) in a landscape of super-intelligent moral evolution. http://danfaggella.com/morality-in-a-transhuman-future/ *7 – Lucretius has a saying “the vessel is flawed”, in reference to the incapability of humans to hold onto happiness. When yet again surprise at my own inability to stave off anxieties I often recall the phrase and am in some way comforted. http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.html **7 – In my opinion there is little doubt that the best source for ideas around “uplifting” and the topic of hedonism at large is David Pearce, whose myriad writings on this subject deserve a hundred times more attention than they currently garner (hedweb.com).  In this talk I agree with David about the imperative to reduce (or eliminate) suffering, and to enhance and expand wellbeing. David’s phrase “gradients of bliss” is one that I quote often, and that I wish I’d included more in this actual talk.  In this talk I also express serious pessimism about the idea of animal “uplifting” (which David has written about at length), or genetically programming species to be blissful. I unfortunately see the mechanizations of nature to be vastly too complex to tinker with. Arguably (I am not certain here, nobody is), the teetering balance of animals and chemicals and physical forces that keep up a natural ecosystem are more complex than understanding and replicating consciousness itself. I am of the belief that if “doing good” (on a grand utilitarian scale) is “the point”, then it would likely be easier to create some kind of mega-blissful computronium (Yudkowsky is a good source for greater depth on this scenario: https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf), packing in as much intelligence and bliss per square millimeter as possible – rather than optimizing the wellbeing of all 350,000 known species of beetles, and all mammals, and everything else under the sun. *8 – Hugo de Garis is one among many thinkers who has argued that it is probably best for more super intelligent entities (not run-of-the-mill humans) to populate the galaxy. His work on “The Artifact War” is in part a prediction about the future great human conflict that will arise when some humans aim to remain “human”, while others aim to enhance humanity and/or create super intelligence.  I believe that he is right in presuming that this conflict will arise (so long as we don’t blow ourselves up with nukes beforehand). He also believe that it is likely best for humans to make way for the super intelligent entities that come after them. I – fortunately or unfortunately – believe that there is great credence to this argument (presuming that these entities are indeed vastly more intelligent and blissful than humans), and that this is an issue we will have to grapple with deeply in the next 3-6 decades. https://agi-conf.org/2008/artilectwar.pdf   Header image credit: TEDx Related Posts Conscious AI – We Aught Wake Up Before the Machines DoIn the ongoing ""pop culture"" debate as to whether or not the pursuit of AI… All Bill Gates’ Artificial Intelligence QuotesEarlier this month we released an article featuring all of the AI risk quotes from… AI is Colorizing and Beautifying the WorldArtificial intelligence may be making the world smarter, safer, more functional and accessible.

But it still came as a rude shock to parents and children when the pandemic forced more than a billion students around the world to try to learn via a screen at home.Under-resourced teachers, unfamiliar technology and massively variable home-schooling conditions meant that, for some, the experience was fraught and ineffective. For many, it even left them questioning the very concept of distance learning. In 2021, however, we will see how technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI), is the future of education, as it works alongside teachers to deliver successful online lessons.China leads the way in mass-scale e-learning solutions that combine human teachers and AI, with nine education technology unicorns of its own, including VIPKid, Zuoyebang and Yuanfudao. AI allows these companies to deliver a learning experience that caters to the specific needs of the child and helps them progress, rather than provide traditional lessons that leave some children behind and others bored.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched QuestionsImagine Ling, a six-year-old first-grader learning to write complex Chinese characters. Her Chinese literacy platform, developed by Hexiaoxiang Network Technology, uses AI, computer vision and speech synthesis to deliver lessons. AI image-recognition software identifies each Chinese character Ling writes and generates assessments based on smart matching against a large training database. Speech synthesis and online videos give her real-time instructions and feedback. Human teachers on the platform can focus on personal coaching and support.In the past few months in particular, AI has enhanced all four key areas of education: teaching, learning, practising and testing. Beijing-based online education company VIPKid, with more than 700,000 students, has launched an AI-embedded class, which includes animated fun characters who assist the human teacher. When the company ran a trial on 10,000 students comparing the AI-embedded classes against video-only classes, the results were striking. Course-completion rates went from 80 per cent to 90 per cent and correct answer rates from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. And all this online activity produces data that can be captured and used over time to provide even smarter AI inferencing.AdvertisementAI used in this way can help reduce costs and enable more people of all ages to access education. And it will allow human teachers to delegate many routine tasks, such as planning, assessment, timetabling and even the imparting of facts, and instead focus on students’ curiosity, critical thinking and creativity – the three C’s that AI cannot replace.Kai-Fu Lee is CEO of Sinovation VenturesThis article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

For many, it even left them questioning the very concept of distance learning. In 2021, however, we will see how technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI), is the future of education, as it works alongside teachers to deliver successful online lessons.
China leads the way in mass-scale e-learning solutions that combine human teachers and AI, with nine education technology unicorns of its own, including VIPKid, Zuoyebang and Yuanfudao. AI allows these companies to deliver a learning experience that caters to the specific needs of the child and helps them progress, rather than provide traditional lessons that leave some children behind and others bored.
Imagine Ling, a six-year-old first-grader learning to write complex Chinese characters. Her Chinese literacy platform, developed by Hexiaoxiang Network Technology, uses AI, computer vision and speech synthesis to deliver lessons. AI image-recognition software identifies each Chinese character Ling writes and generates assessments based on smart matching against a large training database. Speech synthesis and online videos give her real-time instructions and feedback. Human teachers on the platform can focus on personal coaching and support.
In the past few months in particular, AI has enhanced all four key areas of education: teaching, learning, practising and testing. Beijing-based online education company VIPKid, with more than 700,000 students, has launched an AI-embedded class, which includes animated fun characters who assist the human teacher. When the company ran a trial on 10,000 students comparing the AI-embedded classes against video-only classes, the results were striking. Course-completion rates went from 80 per cent to 90 per cent and correct answer rates from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. And all this online activity produces data that can be captured and used over time to provide even smarter AI inferencing.
AI used in this way can help reduce costs and enable more people of all ages to access education. And it will allow human teachers to delegate many routine tasks, such as planning, assessment, timetabling and even the imparting of facts, and instead focus on students’ curiosity, critical thinking and creativity – the three C’s that AI cannot replace.

This is the word from Dries Cronje, CEO of AI consulting company Deep Learning Café, highlighting that it’s quite the change in mindset from four or five years ago, when companies would say AI is something Americans, Europeans or Asians do, saying they would get to it one day. “Even if they start small, there is definitely a shift, whereby most companies are looking at it,” notes Cronje. “Some companies have already shown a lot of success by being early adopters of AI.”Over the years, the AI market has continued to show signs of growth. Last year’s International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts showed worldwide revenue for the AI market, including software, hardware, and services, would total $156.5 billion in 2020, an increase of 12.3% over 2019.Furthermore, the IDC’s research pointed to worldwide revenue surpassing $300 billion in 2024, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 17.1%. Even though South African firms might not be setting AI trends, they are definitely in the game and are actively piloting AI within their businesses, experimenting with a range of different technologies, such as chatbots, virtual assistants and image recognition, notes Cronje.

There’s a lot of room for AI investment in Africa…we can become the gateway to an AI and modern workforce where a lot of work can be outsourced to Africa, but we will have to put in the effort to make it work. The opportunity for Africa to become that leader is there.”Shifting gearsCronje explains that in the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for businesses to come up with tech solutions that allow them to have more flexibility and efficiency. With the world becoming more digitally connected than ever before, he expects AI will continue to play a crucial role in sustainable growth and recovery for businesses this year.Cronje anticipates four key AI trends to take shape in 2021, with AI making a greater contribution to science and mathematics.AI will have real-world impact in fighting against climate change, pollution and future viral pandemics and disease, he states. According to Cronje, Google’s machine learning company DeepMind’s AI programme, AlphaFold2 successfully determined the 3D shapes of proteins from their amino-acid sequence late last year. This discovery, he says, will accelerate scientists’ efforts to understand the building blocks of cells and enable quicker and more advanced medicine, research and bioengineering.

I anticipate security cameras will start to learn about the people being surveilled. A lot of this will be accelerated as 5G is also being rolled out.”In light of the ethical concerns around the implementation of AI in social media, Cronje predicts more emphasis on ethical AI. For example, it is likely the ethics around deepfake misinformation, race and gender bias, AI for children, algorithmic bias, data protection and acceptable uses will all be up for necessary discussion in 2021.“We will have to get to some stage where AI is also more responsible and more accountable for what it does and how it operates. I think we’ll start to see some attempt at regulating AI. There’ll also be pressure on companies using AI to do it in a responsible way and to understand the social implications of what they are doing.”At number four, he predicts open models with bigger access as large companies such as Intel, Amazon Web Services and Google rapidly incorporate AI into their systems.“We will see greater democratisation of the AI offerings for public use. This will make digital innovation more accessible for software developers and smaller businesses,” concludes Cronje.

Among the myriad technological developments in airpower—including advanced propulsion, better stealth, directed-energy weapons and hypersonics—perhaps the most important will turn out to be artificial intelligence. AI has the potential to transform air combat operations and the way airpower is conceived and used.
The US Air Force demonstrated the role of AI dramatically in December last year by flying a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, which normally carries a single crew member, with an AI algorithm as a ‘virtual backseater’. As the pilot flew, the AI system—dubbed ‘ARTUµ’ in honour of Star Wars robot R2-D2—controlled the aircraft’s sensors and navigation.
On the test flight, ARTUµ was tasked with finding adversary missile launchers and was ‘solely responsible for sensor employment and tactical navigation’, while the human pilot concentrated on finding enemy aircraft and flying. ARTUµ ‘made final calls on devoting the radar to missile hunting versus self-protection’.
The flight demonstrated human–machine teaming at a new level and points to the potential to integrate AI backseaters into current fighters like the F-35 and future air combat aircraft such as the US Next Generation Air Dominance platform, or NGAD.
The F-35 has room for just one person in the cockpit, but with AI the pilot gets a backseater that can manage the complex process of integrating data from a multitude of onboard and offboard sensors and other information sources, freeing up the pilot to fly and fight. AI can also manage human–machine teaming between the F-35 and autonomous systems, such as the ‘loyal wingman’ autonomous platform being developed in Australia as part of the Boeing airpower teaming system.
So, AI dramatically reduces the aircrew’s workload and can process data and information faster than a human pilot, including rapidly assessing threats. But it also boosts the operational potential of autonomous platforms in crewed–uncrewed teaming because it can ensure greater oversight and control—‘on the loop’ for the autonomous platform—while giving the human pilot the big picture of tactical operations. That eases rules-of-engagement constraints on using autonomous systems, including future lethal autonomous weapons platforms.
For fast jets like the F-35, the benefits of integrating AI are obvious—it opens up new approaches to complex and fast-moving air combat operations.
For slower, heavier aircraft such as the E-7A Wedgetail and the P-8A Poseidon, integrating AI inside the cockpit is likely to enhance the operating efficiency of the planes and their crews, particularly as they begin to exploit offboard sensors based on drones such as the MQ-4C Triton, maritime platforms or space-based capabilities. AI can manage a diverse network of sensors and platforms and take the lead in transforming the flood of data gathered over the future battlespace into a knowledge edge—the key to getting the information advantage that’s critical for success.
The role of AI in the cockpit gives us a glimpse into the future of airpower. The Royal Australian Air Force needs to be thinking about where airpower goes next, even as the F-35 achieved initial operational capability in December and moves to final operational capability in 2023. That future is almost certain to be a mix of crewed and autonomous systems, working together in teams to deliver a range of effects as a system of systems.
We need not wait until the late 2030s for a sixth-generation platform to emerge to replace the fifth-generation F-35 in the 2040s. It would be a mistake to delay consideration of future air combat capability by maintaining a traditional acquisitions mindset. Yet, the 2020 force structure plan pushes back the start of the F-35 replacement process to the mid-2030s. Given the pace of technological change and the rapid deterioration in our strategic environment, that notional timeline needs to be challenged and capability acquisition needs to happen faster. With the US already flying a demonstrator for NGAD and considering a ‘digital century series’ approach to acquisition, it’s time Australia shook off the slow, generational acquisition paradigm. Investment in breakthrough technologies such as AI is part of that transformation.
A complementary next-generation air combat system spread across multiple platforms and technologies—crewed and autonomous—that has AI as a key component needs to be prioritised as an opportunity for common development with our Five Eyes partners, especially the US. The Australian Defence Force could work with its US counterparts, or with allies and partners in Europe and Japan, to develop future air combat capabilities that will complement and, ultimately, replace the F-35 sooner than the 2040s. Boeing’s ‘loyal wingman’ drone is a good first step and may be able to be evolved into a potent future air combat capability.
It’s time for the RAAF to be forward-looking and proactive in accelerating the acquisition of the next generation of air combat capabilities. That effort should incorporate the broad application of AI—inside the cockpit and across the battlespace—to allow our military to think and act at machine speed.
Of course, there are risks in moving fast. AI is still a relatively new technology, and its complexity needs to be mastered. Networking a multitude of offboard sensors that an AI algorithm can use to inform aircrew of the common operating picture will require significant investment in software development, supported by the establishment of research facilities and the training of personnel. It will require a substantial boost in digital high-speed communications bandwidth to work. That’s likely to require investment in other technology areas—notably, satellite-based laser-optical communications and quantum technologies.
Nor will the ADF operate in an uncontested electromagnetic domain. Potential adversaries such as China are already developing sophisticated capabilities in electronic and network warfare, so our tactical command and control, including elements controlled by an AI ‘backseater’, must be robust and resilient.
Meeting all of those challenges will take time, money and skilled personnel. The US Air Force’s U-2 demonstration of ARTUµ is one step down a path towards tomorrow’s airpower, and Australia needs to proceed with determination to achieve success.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The advance of AI is inevitable, and what that translates into for humanity is not altogether clear. Some believe we can look forward to a great future, while others think it means we are on the path to being supplanted by our robotic overlords. The third perspective is one that is aware of risks but considers them to be manageable.  




We hear a lot about artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential. What that means for the future of humanity, however, is not altogether clear. Not everyone even always has the same definition in mind when using the term ""artificial intelligence."" Even when you establish what capability can be attained, there is the question of the ramifications of that capability.
Some futurists believe life will be beastly improved, while others think it is under serious threat. Between the two extremes there’s a wide range. Here are some of the takes along the spectrum from 11 experts.
1. Sci-fi and Reality Are Not on the Same Page
What the popular imagination tends to associate with AI—a synthetic being that has consciousness of its own—is still in the realm of science fiction:


Richard Socher is currently the CEO of you.com, a new trusted search engine. He wrote the quote just a couple of years ago when he was the chief scientist (EVP) at Salesforce.
2. Defining Artificial IntelligenceAdvertisements






John Frémont is the Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Hypergiant. He spoke these words at a presentation sponsored by Salesforce called Building A Better World: AI And The Future Of Business.

3. You Say “Tapestry,” I Say “Frankenstein.”
While “tapestry” carries a nice connotation for a composite, there are those like Tristan Harris who don’t see it that way but as a monstrous synthesis:


That take was quoted, appropriately enough, in How to Stop Technology From Becoming a Digital Frankenstein. Harris is the Co-Founder & Executive Director of the Center for Humane Technology. He has expounded on his concerns in multiple presentations, including one entitled Humane: A New Agenda for Tech with Tristan Harris, viewable on Vimeo.
In that presentation, he offered another vivid image to picture how insidious the effect can be:



4. You Should Be Worried 
Others share the concern about something so powerful growing and expanding unchecked. But some say we’re worrying about the wrong thing:


Andrew Ng, founder and CEO of Landing AI, and founder of deeplearning.ai also teaches at Stanford. This quote comes from Andrew Ng: Why AI Is the New Electricity, which reflects what he said to the Stanford Graduate School of Business community as part of a series presented by the Stanford MSx Program.
The focus has to be on societal impact, he argued “Evil AI hype,” he believes diverts attention from that critical issue: the question of displaced jobs:


5. Jobs Will Shift
Ng is not alone in bringing up the future of jobs:


James Manyika is the Chairman and Director, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). He voiced his concern about humans adapting to the new future by equipping themselves with the right skills in a Salesforce panel entitled The Future of Work in the AI Age.

6. Never Mind Coming, the Robots Are Here
Indeed, the advance of automation when combined with robotics is bringing just what Ng warned about into our current reality:


The full quote that appears in context in National Geographic’s The robot revolution has arrived is the following:
“We’ve gotten used to having machine intelligence that we can carry around with us,” said Manuela Veloso, an AI roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. She held up her smartphone. “Now we’re going to have to get used to intelligence that has a body and moves around without us.”
7. The Glass is Half Full on the Jobs Front 
On the other hand, some see the rise of the machine as a good thing and that the jobs displaced will be more than offset by those created.


Svetlana Sicular is a research vice president at Gartner whose quote appears in a press release: Gartner Says By 2020, Artificial Intelligence Will Create More Jobs Than It Eliminates. Even while acknowledging that AI will lead to the loss of millions of jobs, she considered the gain worth it for improved productivity and the shift to new job opportunities.
She claimed that while some would require a high level of skill, she believed there would still be openings for jobs that don’t require such advanced skills. The main loss, she predicted would be for middle- and low-level positions.

8. Explain It to Us Humans
One additional concern about AI that has been the focus of increased attention over the past several years, as more and more business decisions are dictated by algorithms, is that of its “black box” nature. (Read also AI's Got Some Explaining to Do)
Now it’s not just people in the field who are raising the alarm about having determinations made by a program that doesn’t have to account for its decisions and their ramifications. Lawyers who fight for their clients’ rights have to contend with institutions that say it wasn’t a person who made the decision to cut services but an algorithm.

Michele Gilman is a clinical law professor at the University of Baltimore who was recently featured in MIT’s Technology Review’s The coming war on the hidden algorithms that trap people in poverty:

“A growing group of lawyers are uncovering, navigating, and fighting the automated systems that deny the poor housing, jobs, and basic services.”

Gilman was puzzled that as her elderly, disabled client grew sicker, she was getting fewer hours of care services allotted rather than more. Only once they got to the hearing did the state’s representative, a nurse, reveal that they were using a new algorithm. Gilman recalled:

""She couldn’t answer what factors go into it. How is it weighted? What are the outcomes that you’re looking for? So there I am with my student attorney, who’s in my clinic with me, and it’s like, ‘Oh, am I going to cross-examine an algorithm?’”

Given that algorithms are given the power to decide who is entitled to life-preserving services and who is not, it becomes essential to understand the process it uses. Despite appearances of being scientific and objective, not all algorithmic models are truly reliable.

8. The Question of Trust

Alexander Amini is a computer scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). This quote is from a late November 2020 article in MIT News, A neural network learns when it should not be trusted,
He elaborated on the ramification of depending 100% on something that is not reliable 100% of the time. He pointed out: “Neural networks are really good at knowing the right answer 99 percent of the time.” But even that one percent error rate is not acceptable when lives are on the line.
That’s a problem because the tendency in the past has been simply to work out the models but not to identify “When they might be wrong,” Amini explained: “We really care about that 1 percent of the time, and how we can detect those situations reliably and efficiently.”

9. The Humans Behind the Algorithms Influence Outcomes

Vivienne Ming is the Executive Chair & Co-Founder of Socos Labs. She also named one of 10 Women to Watch in Tech by Inc. Magazine. She shared her views on AI in a presentation entitled Understand Your Love/Hate Relationship With AI. (Read also: Fairness in Machine Learning: Eliminating Data Bias.)

10. The Way Forward is to Adopt an Ethical and Transparent Approach

Kathy Baxter’s specialty is precisely that. She is an Ethical AI Practice Architect for Salesforce. She shared her insight into the “biases that live in our data” in an interview for the Salesforce blog. Her solution also calls for diversity for the same reasons that are called for in Why Diversity is Essential for Quality Data to Train AI.
11. Are Companies Honest About Tackling the Ethical Questions?
Major companies now have specialists and even whole departments devoted to keeping their AI within ethical bounds. But is this sincere or only so much lip service to standards that they hope to control themselves?

Timnit Gebru coauthored a yet unpublished paper “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?”
The ideas in the paper may have cost Gebru her job on Google’s ethical AI team. On December 2 she tweeted that her “resignation” was being accepted by the technology giant:

Gebru was Joy Buolamwini’s co-author on Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification (Read also: Can AI Have Biases?) that demonstrated facial recognition was fairly accurate for white men but much less so for women or people of color. Google was proud to have her on the team for that but balked at her latest research findings.
In reporting on her forced resignation from Google, MIT Technology Review also discusses what was in that controversial paper: “Gebru’s draft paper points out that the sheer resources required to build and sustain such large AI models means they tend to benefit wealthy organizations, while climate change hits marginalized communities hardest.”
By calling attention to these issues, the paper brings up some considerations that the company may prefer to keep swept under the rug, including questions about the “negative environmental impact and inequitable access to resources” that reinforces the divisions between the haves and have-nots.
Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, is one of the seven coauthors of the paper. She provided the draft copy for the MIT Technology Review article. Bender explained the need to not just push ahead but to think about the ramifications:

By Patricia Wei and Jared Klegar 



Feb. 3, 2021, 10:01 p.m. 




 



As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly common in several areas of public life — from policing to hiring to healthcare — AI researchers Timnit Gebru, Michael Hind, James Zou and Hong Qu came together to criticize Silicon Valley’s lack of transparency and advocate for greater diversity and inclusion in decision making.
The event, titled “Race, Tech & Civil Society: Tools for Combating Bias in Datasets and Models,” was sponsored by the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.






Qu, the moderator of the panel and a CCSRE Race & Technology Practitioner Fellow who developed a tool called AI Blindspot that discovers bias in AI systems, opened the conversation by discussing how there are two definitions of combating bias: ensuring that algorithms are “de-biased” and striving for equity in a historical and cultural context.
Gebru ’08 M.S. ’10 Ph.D. ’15 said that she was introduced to these issues as they relate to machine learning in AI after seeing a ProPublica article about recidivism algorithms, and a TED Talk by Joy Buolamwini, a graduate researcher at MIT, who discovered that an open-source facial recognition software did not detect her face unless she wore a white mask. 
As Gebru moved higher up in the tech world, she noticed a severe lack of representation — a pressing inequity she is working to redress. “The moment I went to grad school, I didn’t see any Black people at all,” Gebru said. 






“What’s important for me in my work is to make sure that these voices of these different groups of people come to the fore,” she added. 
Michael Hind is an IBM Distinguished Researcher who leads work on AI FactSheets and AI Fairness 360, which promote transparency in algorithms. Hind agreed with Gebru, noting the importance of “having multiple disciplines and multiple stakeholders at the table.” 
But not everyone has affirmed Gebru’s mission of inclusion. Last month, Google fired Gebru from her role as an AI ethics researcher after she had co-written a paper on the risks of large language models. Her paper touched on bias in AI and how social linguists, who study how language relates to power, culture, and society, were left out of the process.
Since the news of her firing broke, computer science educators and students showed their support and solidarity for Gebru and her work. When Qu asked the panelists how to increase racial literacy, Gebru responded, “I tried to do it and I got fired.” 






She cited the “high turnover” of employees tasked to spearhead diversity initiatives, whose efforts to enact institutional change were often dismissed.
“They don’t have any power,” Gebru said. “They’re miserable. They leave.” Despite Google’s many ethics committees, “there’s just no way that this will work if there’s no incentive to change,” she added
Citing this culture of complacency as one of the reasons he left Silicon Valley, Qu said, “For me, I believe it’s more pernicious to be passively complicit than even to be intentionally malicious.”
In many cases, technology companies may even step beyond passive complicity, Gebru said. She cited Microsoft’s partnership with the New York Police Department to develop predictive policing algorithms. Because these technological tools rely on historical data, some researchers say they may reinforce existing racial biases.
“For any Black person in the United States who has had experiences with police,” Gebru said, “you would understand, you know, why predictive policing would be an issue.”






Zou, an assistant professor of biomedical data science at Stanford, remained optimistic about the use of AI for social good. He noted that because of the pandemic, the need for telehealth has exploded. Doctors are now relying on patients on images from patients to help diagnose them, and computer vision technology can help patients take better photos, he said.
Even cases of algorithmic bias can present valuable learning opportunities, Zou added. Pointing to language models he worked on as a member of Microsoft Research, Zou said that the models’ gender biases offered a way to “quantify our stereotypes.”
However, Zou was reluctant to place too much faith in AI. 
“If it’s a scenario that affects someone’s health or safety, AI should not be the sole decision maker,” he said.
As the conversation ended, the researchers agreed on the need to continue questioning the role of using AI in tools that affect our daily lives. 
“A lot of features certainly should not be ones a data scientist or engineer should be deciding,” Hind said. 






He referred to how the virtual interviewing company HireVue used AI to analyze applicants’ videos to measure skills such as empathy and communication. 
“Even if you can do it, should you?” Gebru asked.
