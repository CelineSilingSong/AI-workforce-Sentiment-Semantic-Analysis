For all the progress that’s been made in the field of artificial intelligence, the world’s most flexible, efficient information processor remains the human brain. Although we can quickly make decisions based on incomplete and changing information, many of today’s artificial intelligence systems only work after being trained on well-labeled data, and when new information is available, a complete retraining is often required to incorporate it.
Now the startup Nara Logics, co-founded by an MIT alumnus, is trying to take artificial intelligence to the next level by more closely mimicking the brain. The company’s AI engine uses recent discoveries in neuroscience to replicate brain structure and function at the circuit level.
The result is an AI platform that holds a number of advantages over traditional neural network-based systems. While other systems use meticulously tuned, fixed algorithms, users can interact with Nara Logics’ platform, changing variables and goals to further explore their data. The platform can also begin working without labeled training data, and can incorporate new datasets as they become available. Perhaps most importantly, Nara Logics’ platform can provide the reasons behind every recommendation it makes — a key driver of adoption in sectors like health care.
“A lot of our health care customers say they’ve had AI systems that give the likelihood of somebody being readmitted to the hospital, for example, but they’ve never had those ‘but why?’ reasons to be able to know what they can do about it,” says Nara Logics CEO Jana Eggers, who leads the company with CTO and founder Nathan Wilson PhD ’05.
Nara Logics’ AI is currently being used by health care organizations, consumer companies, manufacturers, and the federal government to do things like lower costs and better engage with customers.
“It’s for people whose decisions are getting complicated because there’s more factors [and data] being added, and for people that are looking at complex decisions differently because there's novel information available,” Eggers says.
The platform’s architecture is the result of Wilson’s decision to embrace the complexities of neuroscience rather than abstract away from them. He developed that approach over more than a decade working in MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, which has long held the mission of reverse engineering the human mind.
“At Nara Logics, we think neuroscience is on a really good track that’s going to lead to really exciting ways to make decisions that we haven't seen before,” Wilson says.
Following a passion
Wilson attended Cornell University for his undergraduate and master’s degrees, but once he got to MIT in 2000, he stuck around. Over the course of a five-year PhD and a seven-year postdoc, he created mathematical frameworks to simulate brain function.
“The community at MIT is really focused on coming up with new models of computation that go beyond what computer science offers,” Wilson says. “The work is connected with computer science, but also considers what our brain is doing that could teach us how computers work, or how computers could work.”
On nights and weekends during the final years of his postdoc, from 2010 to 2012, Wilson was also beginning to translate his algorithms into a commercial system in work that would be the foundation of Nara Logics. In 2014, his work caught the attention of Eggers, who had led a number of successful businesses but had grown jaded about the hype around artificial intelligence.
Eggers became convinced Nara Logics’ AI engine offered a superior way to help businesses. Even back then the engine, which the company refers to as Nara Logics Synaptic Intelligence, had properties that made it unique in the field.
In the engine, objects in customers’ data, such as patients and treatments, organize into matrices based on features they share with other objects, in a structure similar to what has been observed in biological systems. Relationships between objects also form through a series of local functions the company calls synaptic learning rules, adapted from cell- and circuit-based neuroscience studies.
“What we do is catalog all the metadata and what we call our Connectomes go in and mine the database of unstructured data and build links across all of it that relate these things,” Wilson explains. “Once you have that background, you can go in and say, ‘I like this, this, and this,’ and you let the engine crunch the data and give you matches to those parameters. What you didn’t have to do is have any notion of what the right answer was for lots of similar people. You skip that whole step.”
Each object in Nara Logics’ Synaptic Intelligence stores its properties and rules locally, allowing the platform to adjust to new data by updating only a small number of associated objects. The bottom-up approach is believed to be used by the brain.
“That’s totally different than deep learning or other approaches that just say, ‘We’re going to globally optimize everything, and each cell does what the global algorithm tells it,’” Wilson explains. “Neuroscientists are telling us each cell is making decisions on its own accord to an extent.”
The design allows users to explore relationships in data by “activating” certain objects or features and seeing what else gets activated or suppressed.
To give an answer, Nara Logics’ engine only activates a small number of objects in its dataset. The company says this is similar to the “sparse coding” believed to be used in higher brain regions, in which only a small number of neurons are activated in any given moment. The sparse coding principal allows the company to retrace its platform’s path and give users the reasons behind its decisions.
As the company has matured, Wilson has stayed plugged in to the MIT community’s research, and Nara Logics participated in the STEX25 startup accelerator, run by the MIT Startup Exchange.
Leveraging a mind-like AI
Manufacturers are already using Nara Logics’ platform to better understand data from internet-of-things devices, consumer companies are using it to better connect with customers, and health care groups are using it to make better treatment decisions.
“We’re focused on a specific algorithm, which is the mechanics of decision making,” Wilson says. “We believe it’s something you can codify, and we believe it’s something that’ll be insanely valuable if you can get that process right.”
As Covid-19 disrupted industries and underscored the need for organizations to invest in adaptive software tools, Nara Logics nearly doubled its customer base. The founders are thrilled to be scaling a solution they feel is more collaborative and responsive to humans than other AI systems.
“We think the most important difference we’re contributing to is building an AI where people participate and people are in the loop — they’re cognizant and understanding and aware of what it’s doing,” Wilson says. “That helps them make smarter decisions every day, and those add up to make a big difference.”

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.When you hear about artificial intelligence, stop imagining computers that can do everything we can do but better.My colleague Cade Metz, who has a new book about A.I., wants us to understand that the technology is promising but has its downsides: It’s currently less capable than people, and it is being coded with human bias.I spoke with Cade about what artificial intelligence is (and isn’t), areas where he’s hopeful and fearful of the consequences and areas where A.I. falls short of optimists’ hopes. Shira: Let’s start with the basics: What is artificial intelligence?Cade: It’s a term for a collection of concepts that allow computer systems to vaguely work like the brain. Some of my reporting and my book focus on one of those concepts: a neural network, which is a mathematical system that can analyze data and pinpoint patterns.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIf you take thousands of cat photos and feed them into a neural network, for instance, it can learn to recognize the patterns that define what a cat looks like. The first neural networks were built in the 1950s, but for decades they never really fulfilled their promise. That started to change around 2010.What changed?For decades, neural networks had two significant limitations: not enough data and not enough computer processing power. The internet gave us reams of data, and eventually scientists had enough computing power to crunch through it all.Where might people see the effects of neural networks?This one idea changed many technologies over the past 10 years. Digital assistants like Alexa, driverless cars, chat bots, computer systems that can write poetry, surveillance systems and robots that can pick up products in warehouses all rely on neural networks.Sometimes it feels that people talk about artificial intelligence as if it’s a magic potion.Yes. The original sin of the A.I. pioneers was that they called it artificial intelligence. When we hear the term, we imagine a computer that can do anything people can do. That wasn’t the case in the 1950s, and it’s not true now.People don’t realize how hard it is to duplicate human reasoning and our ability to deal with uncertainty. A self-driving car can recognize what’s around it — in some ways better than people can. But it doesn’t work well enough to drive anywhere at any time or do what you and I do, like react to something surprising on the road.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat downsides are there from neural networks and A.I.?So many. The machines will be capable of generating misinformation at a massive scale. There won’t be any way to tell what’s real online and what’s fake. Autonomous weapons have the potential to be incredibly dangerous, too.And the scariest thing is that many companies have promoted algorithms as a utopia that removes all human flaws. It doesn’t. Some neural networks learn from massive amounts of information on the internet — and that information was created by people. That means we are building computer systems that exhibit human bias — against women and people of color, for instance.Some American technologists, including the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, say that the United States isn’t taking A.I. seriously enough, and we risk falling behind China. How real is that concern?It’s legitimate but complicated. Schmidt and others want to try to make sure that the most important A.I. technology is built inside the Pentagon, not just inside giant technology companies like Google.But we have to be careful about how we compete with a country like China. In the United States, our best technology talent often comes from abroad, including China. Closing off our borders to experts in this field would hurt us in the long run.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTip of the WeekHow to be an informed online shopperA reader named Eva emailed On Tech asking about small software programs known as browser extensions, plug-ins or add-ons for Chrome, Safari and Firefox that claim they will save her money.“I keep seeing ads for these browser add-ons like Honey (from PayPal) and Capital One Shopping,” she wrote. “They claim they will automatically find and apply promo codes to save you money whenever you shop online. This sounds terrific, but I keep wondering, What’s in it for them? They’re not just doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. Before I sign up for these services, I want to know what the trade-off is. Can you help me find out?”Brian X. Chen, the New York Times personal technology columnist, has this response:Yes, there is always a trade-off. With free software, your personal data is often part of the transaction.I’d advise taking a few minutes to research the company’s business model and privacy policy.More than a year ago, Amazon warned customers to remove the Honey add-on because of privacy concerns. Honey’s privacy policy states: “Honey does not track your search engine history, emails or your browsing on any site that is not a retail website (a site where you can shop and make a purchase).”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRead between the lines: That means Honey can track your browsing on retail websites. (Honey has said that it uses data only in ways that people expect.)The privacy policy for Capital One Shopping is more explicit: “If you download and use our browser extension, we may collect browsing, product and e-commerce information, including but not limited to product pages viewed, pricing information, location data, purchase history on various merchant websites and services, the price you paid for items, whether a purchase was made, and the coupons that you used.”That’s a lot of information to hand over for software that automatically applies coupons. Whether or not that’s a fair trade is up to you.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBefore we go …So. Much. Money.

Panel: Pentagon Needs High-Level Attention on AI, Digital Workforce to Keep Up With China

Pentagon leaders need to set clear digital readiness performance goals this year as a first step in revamping the requirements process so the United States can maintain its military technological advantage, the vice chairman of a national panel on artificial intelligence said Friday.
Robert Work, former deputy secretary of defense and undersecretary of the Navy, told a joint hearing of the House Armed Services cyber, innovative technologies and information systems subcommittee and the House Oversight and Reform national security subcommittee that, if the Defense Department doesn’t take these steps, China will overtake the United States technologically in the next decade.
The panel laid out recommendations directly affecting the Pentagon in the 700-plus-page report from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Work said the important reforms would require “top-down leadership” that starts with a “high-level steering committee on emerging technology.” Co-chairing that committee would be the deputy secretary of defense, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the principal deputy director of national intelligence. “They set the priorities,” he said.
In short, without that kind of leadership, the report states, “uneven adoption of AI will threaten military interoperability and the political cohesion and resiliency of U.S. alliances.”
That also translates into having the under secretary of defense for research and engineering become the co-chair and chief science advisor to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, where critical decisions are made on what systems to buy.
At the combatant commander level, the report recommends following the example of Adm. Craig Faller, head of U.S. Southern Command, in having an AI operations advocate to advise him and staff on what capabilities they have on hand and also what AI can and cannot do for them. The report notes the advisory role would be similar to the role played by staff judge advocates.
The goal is to have all this in place and running by 2025.
“AI will improve intelligence analysis,” Gilman Louie, venture capitalist and former head of the CIA’s venture capitalist operation In-Q-Tel, said during the hearing.
Work said the Pentagon and other governmental agencies need “to establish a common digital ecosystem” with the private sector, universities and research institutions. The report notes that “a lack of national urgency is dangerous at a time when underlying weaknesses have emerged in our AI ecosystem that impair innovation and when viewed against the backdrop of China’s state-directed AI progress.”
Louie viewed the situation now as “a gathering storm” where China and Russia are using cyber attacks and harvesting data from open Western sources to their advantage. All too often, the Defense Department, governments at all levels and much of private industry do not realize that “software and AI are joined at the hip” and should not simply be added on to big programs. Instead, they are “to be consumed like fuel.”
Eric Schmidt, commission chairman and former head of Google, said “the real strength of our nation will come from software and AI.” He then stressed the importance of attracting home-grown talent to these fields and retaining immigrants who come to American universities for advanced science and technology degrees. As he told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month, the United States holds a slim technological lead over China in part because it offers opportunities that Beijing does not.
“We want entrepreneurs,” Louie said in answer to what kind of immigrants the United States should retain. The report offers suggested legislation on how to attract and retain these immigrants who are doing doctoral work at American universities. “Talent comes to democracies,” he said.
Schmidt said “it’s stupid” to send these graduates back abroad to compete with the United States. Earlier in the hearing, he said China is America’s “pacing competitor” for software, hardware and talent.

Organizational reform and an emphasis on AI are not enough to retain technological edge in high-technology fields, panel members noted.
Former Federal Communications Commissioner Mignon Clyburn told the joint hearing “the military needs expertise in and out of the uniform.” After reviewing Pentagon personnel policies and career paths, she argued that the Defense Department “is unlikely to develop that expertise on its own.”
Worse yet, the Pentagon often loses its uniformed personnel with software development and artificial intelligence skills because there is no sure path for promotion by staying in those fields.
“We must stop bleeding talent,” she said.
Along with that change, she said the services must train “junior leaders … on when to trust machine learning” in their decision-making early in their careers. The military could also incentivize experimentation with and early adoption of AI tools by having that work help officers looking for promotions to more senior positions, much the way the military incentivizes education and other skills by incorporating them via the promotion board process.
Committee members repeatedly questioned the recommendations for a Digital Corps, a Digital Reserve Corps and the establishment of a degree-granting Digital Academy.
Clyburn told the members “we have a clogged pipeline” to entering government service when a candidate with digital skills is interested in joining the workforce, and retaining them is also difficult because promotion opportunities can be limited.
“The Digital Corps is modeled on the Army’s Medical Corps” and organized along specialized lines. It would have its own personnel policies, guidelines for promotion, training opportunities and continued certification.
Clyburn compared the civilian National Reserve Digital Corps to the National Guard or the services’ reserve components. They would meet monthly and have a two-week annual obligation as well: 38 days total. As the report notes, “they can help improve AI education, perform data triage and acquisition, help guide projects and frame digital solutions” across the government.
She added there would be a commitment to serve for a specified time and there would be scholarship inducements to attract recruits.
The Digital Academy would offer a highly-concentrated seven-year technological curriculum. Like the military services academies, there would be no tuition charges but rather an obligation to serve in the Digital Corps for five years upon graduation, Clyburn said.
Cost is definitely a factor as to whether Congress agrees to go ahead with the academy recommendation. Schmidt said, “there are universities helping us with this.”
Several times in his opening statement and later in questioning, Work, like other commission members, said “AI adoption has to be accelerated” and it has to be done with allies and partners to present a united, democratic response to China and Russia.
“We want to be exploiting homegrown talent” as well as attracting graduate students from abroad, he said.
Looking at the Pentagon itself, Work added “there’s a lot of talent in the department. They will rock the world” if barriers are broken down and career paths created. “Give them a classifier” so they can be identified and promoted.
“Computer science is the number-one major, not economics” in American universities, Schmidt said. The problem is these graduates “are coming into the private sector because they can work in it,” which is something that’s currently difficult to do in uniform or civilian government service.

Event Recap: Addressing Inequality in Artificial Intelligence
BY: NATALIE GOLD
When you open your phone with facial recognition or notice suggested products on your social media accounts, that is artificial intelligence (AI) at work. Though AI is useful and can help complete a variety of tasks that usually require human intelligence, it is also laced with problems of inequality and bias. BU’s Hariri Institute for Computing hosted three guest speakers at the forefront of creating change in the field of AI as part of the inaugural Distinguished Speaker Series: AI & Inequalities-Creating Change. Sabelo Mhlambi, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Whittaker presented individually on topics ranging from the colonial values embedded in AI to AI ethics at big tech companies, and then came together for a public panel event.
Sabelo Mhlambi talked about applying the Ubuntu framework to AI research.
Sabelo Mhlambi, a Technology and Human Rights Fellow at Harvard Carr’s Center for Human Rights and founder of Bantucracy, was the first presenter in the series. Mhlambi discussed how AI researchers can reject colonial values by reversing the dehumanization that has been caused by racism, capitalism, and colonization. Mhlambi proposed incorporating an Ubuntu framework into AI. Ubuntu is a sub-Saharan African moral philosophy that posits a person is connected to other persons of the past, present, and future, and is a person because of these connections. Mhalmbi suggests that the Ubuntu framework can help build machines and systems that reflect and value the well-being of communities. “Solutions require the active involvement of all those concerned,“ said Mhlambi.
Timnit Gebru spoke about the hierarchy of knowledge in machine learning.
Timnit Gebru, a computer scientist and co-founder of Black in AI, spoke about her journey to realizing that technology and science are not separate from society. A hierarchy of knowledge, where some ideas are seen as more important than others, can happen when researchers don’t address societal issues in their work. Ideas from areas such as history and critical race theory may be perceived as unimportant. Work that incorporates these ideas and addresses social issues are therefore seen as lesser. Gebru now tries to incorporate ideas from outside the computer science discipline into her AI research. Incorporating social perspectives into computer science research can reveal some of the biases in AI. “Gatekeeping is always done by those in power,” said Gebru. 
Meredith Whittaker explained the relationship between big tech companies and academic institutions.
Meredith Whittaker, Minderoo Research Professor at New York University, founder of Google’s Open Research Group, and co-founder of the AI Now Institute, addressed the intertwining of academia with big tech companies. Only a handful of companies have the means to build and scale AI due to their vast computational power, wealth, and datasets. Many computer science programs across colleges and universities rely on these companies for infrastructure and funding. In return, companies rely on the schools to train and educate the talent that they will eventually hire. This entanglement makes it difficult for criticisms of the tech industry. Whittaker explained that she has seen the same pattern over and over again: researchers ask critical questions of tech companies, conduct research that might threaten the companies, and then face opposition designed to silence their work. “Google is now sure enough of its power that it is no longer pretending to tolerate criticism of its work,“ said Whittaker.
On March 5 2021, the three distinguished speakers came together to answer questions about the role of big tech in AI research, how AI is intertwined with social and labor movements, and what researchers entering the field of AI should know. All the speakers encouraged students to bring their whole selves to their fields of research, including their personal backgrounds and experiences. Whittaker spoke to the power of collective action, specifically pointing to the power of choosing not to work for a certain company. Whittaker suggested that those who have the privilege to choose not to work somewhere should explain why, and amplify their message. Gebru noted that collective movements can support and defend critical research and Mhalmbi echoed these sentiments, suggesting that the rejection of broken systems becomes possible only when the push comes from a larger movement.
These kinds of discussions are just the beginning for addressing biases and inequalities in AI. The Hariri Institute’s inaugural Distinguished Speaker Series highlighted the importance of not only addressing these problems at conferences or lectures, but also in the AI field, itself. Considering how fast the field of AI is growing, solutions for more ethical AI and technology need to be implemented sooner rather than later.

The next Distinguished Speaker Series: Machine Learning for Model-Rich Problems will begin on Friday, April 16th at 11:00 AM. For details and event registration, please visit here.

Online game developed by researchers shows challenges facing the world of work in the future












March 16, 2021


We live in a world where robots increasingly build our cars, algorithms trade stocks and computers translate texts. Robotics, digitalization and artificial intelligence are transforming numerous professions. Some jobs are disappearing, while other new ones are being created. The online game ‘The Automated Life’ now enables users to try out how they might survive in an increasingly automated world of work. The game was developed in the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development.

What will the future of work look like when artificial intelligence and robots do many of the tasks previously performed by human beings? What knowledge and skills will be in demand in the future? Which jobs will no longer be required? Which new ones will be added? These are the issues addressed by the online game ‘The Automated Life’, designed and developed by Alex Rutherford of the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. Players start out with a job that is severely threatened by automation. They have to save up for further training and apply for new jobs, which in turn offer new options for further training programs and careers. Meanwhile, automation relentlessly advances as jobs are constantly eliminated by new technological developments. Bearing in mind how many more years there are to go before they retire and keeping an eye on their bank balance, players have to be quick to make smart decisions so as to win out against automation – and finally enjoy a well-deserved retirement.
“We’re seeing time and again how the accelerating pace of automation is causing people a lot of stress and generating a sense of fear about the future. Our aim was to capture this in a game and show how people in low-paid jobs experience automation,” says Alex Rutherford, Senior Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. At the Center for Humans and Machines, he leads a working group on the future of work, conducting research at the intersection between network science, labor economics and artificial intelligence. Alex Rutherford himself had the idea for the game and he was in charge of the creation process, which also involved New York based game developer Francis Tseng. “In computer games, the developers set the rules – players can only make limited decisions. So in fact it’s rather similar to automation in working life,” says Francis Tseng.
The team at Center for Humans and Machines has caused a stir in the past with its scientific online games. MyGoodness, led by Associate Research Scientist Edmond Awad, is a game about altruism that rates people based on how generous they donate, while BeeMe, led by CHM Research Scientist Niccolo Pescetelli, was an immersive “social game” played on a huge scale at Halloween in 2018 where the crowd collectively controlled a real human being and sent him on an adventure.
The aim of the online game ‘The Automated Life’ will be to analyze players’ data anonymously so as to be able to use it for further research. “Automation in the world of work is an issue that affects us all in some way and confronts society with significant challenges. That’s why research is needed that explores the problems and identifies potential solutions,” says Alex Rutherford.

It is undoubtedly one of the most important inventions of mankind, because it combines important future technologies and will accelerate them. It can also help us to master the greatest challenges of our time.Already today, algorithms using AI are firmly integrated into our everyday life. For example in route calculation with Google Maps, in conversations with Alexa/Siri or our personalized Netflix recommendations.However, artificial intelligence is (still) far from being a general problem solver. Its applications are currently limited to individual areas in which it is constantly improving.“The rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.” — Stephen HawkingThe artificial intelligence known from science fiction movies such as Ex Machina, Blade Runner or Star Trek, which dominates our world, is thus far from being reality. However, anyone who only deals with the subject a little will quickly recognize the opportunities, but also the risks, of this future technology. It is the motor for perhaps the greatest change in human history …Big Data JobsSummary: Artificial intelligence as the brain of our future?Artificial intelligence gives machines the ability to analyze data and make independent decisions and perform human-like tasks intelligently.In fact, most people have already had contact with an AI. Be it through the personalized feed on Instagram, filtered spam in Gmail or the proposed Spotify playlist.AI is especially suited for analyzing and detecting patterns in large amounts of data. It is also able to make accurate predictions based on historical data.The research of artificial intelligence comprises a multitude of sub-areas. These include computer science, neuroscience and linguistics.It is highly controversial among researchers whether artificial intelligence will develop humanity for the better or for the worse. What is certain is that AI will exponentially accelerate either one or the other.WTF is artificial intelligence?To answer the question, when a machine is intelligent, the Turing test is used in general. Simplified: A machine is to consider as intelligent, if its behavior (e.g. in chat-answers) is not distinguishable from a human being.A milestone in this context is the passing of the Turing Test of Google Duplex in May 2018. The further development of the Google Assistant arranged a hairdresser appointment without her counterpart noticing that she was talking to a machine on the phone. Creepy? This is just the beginning.Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Co: Subareas of AIPeople make around 20,000 decisions a day. Most of them unconsciously. What we decide for depends strongly on our past experiences (the data).But what is everyday life for us is incredibly difficult for machines. Over the past 70 years, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence have made considerable progress, opening the door to many areas. For example, computer science, with its complicated computer models, is just as much a part of AI as the neurosciences, which have brought a great deal of knowledge from the human brain — in the form of neural networks, for example — to the study of smart machines. The results are self-learning machines. But learning also involves the reception of information, which confronted scientists with questions about how we communicate with each other and generally process information. Questions upon questions.Trending AI Articles:1. Top 5 Open-Source Machine Learning Recommender System Projects With Resources2. Deep Learning in Self-Driving Cars3. Generalization Technique for ML models4. Why You Should Ditch Your In-House Training Data Tools (And Avoid Building Your Own)The main areas of artificial intelligence can be summarized as follows:Machine Learning: Applications make decisions based on data. A distinction is made between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning requires pairs of inputs and outputs. As soon as the system has been trained with enough data, it is able to create connections on its own. In unsupervised learning the application creates its own model with its own classifiers.Deep Learning: is a subset of Machine Learning. Also called the supreme discipline of AI. It is used to examine large amounts of data for patterns and trends — e.g. in face, object or speech recognition. So-called neural networks are used for this purpose, which are inspired by the biological neural networks of our human brain. The networks are able to learn on their own and to link what they have learned with new content again and again. The human being does not intervene any more. In contrast to machine learning, which works with fixed model groups, deep learning algorithms develop the models independently.Computer Vision: Enables applications to understand images or videos. A common application is face recognition — whether for marking friends on Facebook or identifying suspects. Other applications can be found in medicine, where algorithms can recognize x-rays, compare them with huge amounts of data, and provide doctors with diagnoses and recommendations for action.Natural Language Processing, NLP for short: Attempts to process natural language on a computer. This should enable applications to be controlled by speech. Everyone who has ever talked to Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant or Cortana has been an NLP user.Graphic: https://media.g2crowd.comWeak vs. strong artificial intelligenceIn addition, a general distinction is made between weak AI and strong AI.Weak AI (also called Narrow AI) is limited to individual application problems, whereby they are capable of self-optimization or learning within their limited problem. All AIs existing today fall into this category. Examples can be found in speech recognition via Siri & Alexa, navigation systems like Google Maps but also in the individualized control of advertising.Strong AI (or general AI) is also called super intelligence and fulfills all the clichés of Hollywood movies. The goal is to achieve or even exceed the same intellectual abilities of people. Such artificial intelligence no longer acts only reactively, but of its own accord, intelligently and flexibly.http://www.xmind.net/m/4nrkujHow artificial intelligence is shaping our present and futureArtificial intelligence in the form of intelligent machines is not a specter of the future! For many people, it is already usable in the here and now — be it with Google Maps navigation, Facebook’s news feed or a Spotify playlist personalized for you.It’s important to make a distinction here: We’re only talking about “weak” AI here. All of our artificial intelligences in 2020 are to be classified as weak. They are only applicable to individual application areas. A strong AI, on the other hand, knows everything, can do everything and acts on its own initiative. It is superior to humans in every respect. Such a thing exists (so far, fortunately) only in our imagination. After all, would you trust the same people who demonstrated against Corona security measures during the Corona pandemic to make rules for AIs? I have my doubts if we are ready for that.“A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.”- Alan PerlisIn this article, we’ll take a look together at some of the most important areas of our lives and how AI could disrupt them. One thing in advance: The future will be incredible — whether incredibly good or incredibly bad remains to be seen.Where is AI already being used and what could our future look like with it?The ideal area of application for AI is the analysis and recognition of patterns in large amounts of data. AI systems can make predictions after recognizing the patterns — in the meantime better than humans. Among other things, this opens up the possibility of automating everyday tasks.There are hardly any limits to the use of artificial intelligence. The first applications of simple AI are already firmly integrated into our everyday lives — often without us noticing. But what potential does the new technology offer beyond that?EducationAs the saying goes, “You never stop learning.” Yet our current education system has changed little over the past decades, learning from the changes in our world. Most of the time, someone still stands in front and talks. The rest have to listen. On average, there are 65 students per professor in Germany. At the elementary school, there are “only” 16 students per teacher. This makes it almost impossible to promote the strengths and weaknesses of the students individually. In addition, not everyone learns in the same way (keywords: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, communicative) and not at the same time of day.AI Tutors: Already more than fictionHowever, it has been recognized that digitization is not a passing fad. Providing funding alone is not enough, however, as the DigitalPakt’s €5 billion scope makes clear. The digitization of the education system in Germany is already failing because many of the teachers do not even have e-mail addresses. In addition, many schools in this country are still WLAN-free zones.But leaving aside these “teething troubles,” the education system — along with its students and teachers — is poised for a never-before-seen wealth of fascinating opportunities.Pupils/StudentsPersonalized course plans (“smart content”): artificial intelligence can recognize what type of learner you are and tailor learning content to make it easier to remember. Visual learners watch more video content, auditory learners are introduced to topics via podcasts, and communicative learners are brought together in groups. Media companies will have exciting business models in the future to market a variety of quality content per learner type.On-demand learning: Especially in the tech industry, there are many “night owls” who are more productive in the evening than in the early morning. Why should students be any different? Instead of treating everyone the same, artificial intelligence will also be able to determine the optimal time for learning and thus support learners.AI tutors: some subjects are just not that easy to understand. Whereas in the past you might have been able to intercept a family member with questions, nowadays, for one thing, the topics have become more complex and, for another, there isn’t always someone at home. Artificial intelligence-controlled tutors (like chatbots only with a visual appearance) could help with queries and give learners a hand at any time.TeachersLesson & test preparation: Teachers invest a large part of their work in preparing the topics to be taught. However, it would be a Herculean task to consider the preparation for the different learning types completely separately. Artificial intelligence can do this. In addition, smart machines can also assign students to their type and react to changes in response. Students who need to catch up on certain topics could be given additional support through, for example, smaller interim tests, instead of being pushed to their limits only with the final test.Highlighting student weaknesses: While AI takes the daily grunt work away from teachers and professors, they would have time to devote to creativity, weaknesses as well as supporting learning. In doing so, AI can provide summaries of performance so that subsequently the teacher can work on it with the learner.Encourage engagement: Teacher and learner collaboration could experience a new level. Instead of talking about Rome in 44 B.C., you could engage all types of learners by walking through the historic city in virtual reality. You could experience together how the United States Declaration of Independence is signed. Students could also be placed into levels through gamification and receive benefits for certain achievements. Similar to the principles in our video games.The possibilities are fabulous! Teachers are given powerful tools through artificial intelligence to infect learners with their knowledge and give them a lifetime of opportunities. That these are no longer just fantasies is shown by our research today. Startups like Knewton, Century Tech and Thinkster Math are already creating the education system of the future that learners can look forward to.HealthcareIn healthcare, the three areas of diagnosis and treatment, medical imaging and health management are leading the way in the use of artificial intelligence. That our system needs support is shown by the data: By 2050, one in five Europeans will be over 65.Photo by Piron Guillaume on UnsplashA lot of medical data is already available today. However, this data is hardly used and is often not accessible to patients. This applies both to the selection of doctors and to patients’ own medical records. Another problem is administration. Many appointments canceled at short notice remain vacant, while new patients have to prepare for long waiting times. There is an additional significant workforce gap in the European healthcare sector.Artificial intelligence will be able to take over adminstrative tasks such as appointment management, make predictions about expected treatments and maintain (digital) patient records in the short term.In addition, AI will assist physicians such as nurses with treatment. Artificial intelligence can use image recognition in combination with Deep Learning to diagnose diseases early (see freenome and PathAI) and make recommendations to physicians. In addition, AI can be used to treat diseases preventively. In biotechnology, AI is generating new compounds and testing them at speeds not previously possible. Researchers at MIT, for example, developed AI that can identify new antibiotics. But startups BenevolentAi and Insitro are also conducting research in this area.The goal of artificial intelligence in healthcare is to create freedoms so that doctors and nurses can be brought closer to patients and their individual treatment. The tasks will undoubtedly change, but the jobs will become more important than ever.Photo by Sajjad Ahmadi on UnsplashMobilityThe fact that environmental pollution is very advanced, our cities are overcrowded and thousands of traffic deaths occur every year due to human error is forcing people to rethink. Hardly any other topic has been as hyped in recent years as mobility. The field of autonomous driving in particular is very popular with the public, not least thanks to Elon Musk’s Tesla.Artificial intelligence can take over traffic management in our major cities in the future. Traffic jams can be avoided if all road users communicate with each other in real time. Accidents will be reduced to a minimum if human distraction is eliminated.It’s not just autonomous cars that can be controlled by artificial intelligence as if by magic, but also trucks, public transportation, airplanes, and shipping and rail traffic. Startups like Waymo, Aurora and Einride are already sending autonomous vehicles out on the roads and collecting billions in data. Even new modes of transportation like air cabs are no longer just science fiction, but are being implemented by startups like Lilium. Yet automated driving is not the same as driverless driving. Experts distinguish between five levels, from driver assistants to autonomous driving. Technologies such as AI, cloud computing and blockchain will also make it easier to operate autonomous vehicles like robots remotely in the future. Experts can intervene in special situations without having to be on site.Thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT) in combination with machine learning, vehicles such as aircraft will also be able to be maintained proactively and autonomously in the future. Errors can thus be ruled out in advance, as wear and tear will be detected and avoided in good time.One future scenario could be that people will no longer want to leave their vehicle unused 95 percent of the day. They could switch to car-sharing providers whose vehicles can use machine-learning prediction models to calculate expected usage and thus autonomously meet demand in cities. The free space created by fewer and fewer vehicles could be redesigned and used more efficiently in the smart cities of the future.E-CommercePhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashIn marketing & especially in e-commerce, market leaders like Amazon and Alibaba are already using smart machines and algorithms from customer contact to automated logistics. Simple artificial intelligence, as in the personalized recommendation of products, has long been used by smaller companies as well.In the future, applications for AI are likely to be found in almost every area of online commerce.Customer relationship management (CRM): Even the smallest online retailers collect lots of customer data. Maintaining this data and linking it in a way that leads to a better understanding of the customer and concrete market advantages for the company is very difficult for humans. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, finds this data management easier. It can divide customers into segments and serve them recommendations and content based on these segments.AI Support: Great companies are characterized by their world-class customer support. Artificial intelligence is already supporting our businesses today in the form of chatbots. In the future, however, we could also have digital shopping assistants advising us in the form of virtual people. That these are likely to be indistinguishable from real people is demonstrated by the startup Soul Machines and Samsungs’ NEON.IoT + AI: Probably everyone has heard of the refrigerator that will reorder milk when it is empty in the future. The technology behind this is called the Internet of Things (IoT). Combined with artificial intelligence, this opens up completely new possibilities for online retail in the future. Subscriptions to groceries could be rethought, as could the autonomous repair of items.Last-mile delivery: making deliveries as fast as possible is an important issue for retailers. Thanks to artificial intelligence, drone deliveries and autonomous last-mile delivery vehicles are within the realm of possibility.This is just a small sample. Start-ups like Coveo and Narvar are working on applications that will make shopping easier for us in the future and make it seem even more personalized.Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashIndustryArtificial intelligence is already an integral part of our modern industry. It enables machines to perceive their environment, make their own decisions and learn on their own. AI is driving robots, which have become an integral part of production for decades — especially in the automotive industry.But artificial intelligence will also play an important role beyond that.Automation: In factories, products go through multiple processes. Many of these tasks are recurring and can therefore be automated. Modern robots can recognize objects, assign them and act on them.On-demand production control: New technologies such as 3D printing will make it possible to produce on demand in the future. Artificial intelligence can predictively control production based on demand and with predictive models.Error detection & quality assurance: Machines make fewer errors. This also applies to the thoroughness of their work. There are already machines in factories that ensure the quality of products.Product development: Artificial intelligence can be used, for example through topology optimization, to calculate new structures that, based on their function, deliver better performances with fewer materials.Danger of conflict — Why artificial intelligence is and should always be critically questionedThe use of artificial intelligence opens up previously unimaginable opportunities for mankind, but also risks. For all this to succeed, AI needs one thing above all: structured, detailed data from as many sources as possible.The falsification of data by us humans is problematic, as project “Tay” shows. This chatbot AI from Microsoft was fed conversations from Twitter users. It took just one day for the bot to become both racist and anti-feminist. But the tested AI also reached the wrong conclusions in experiments conducted by the American police. Because the AI was trained with “dirty data” from decades of police misconduct, it caused officers to disproportionately patrol and sweepingly suspect African-American neighborhoods.Another much-discussed issue is the ethics of machines. Because of the unprecedented scope of new technologies, machines will inevitably make life-and-death decisions. The example of autonomous driving raises the question of who gets to live: the child who runs a red light in front of a vehicle or the two pensioners in the vehicle who, if they swerve, will themselves be killed. The MIT Media Lab has used the Moral Machine to create scenarios to test for yourself.Perhaps the greatest concern, however, is the fear of omnipotent (powerful) artificial intelligence overtaking humanity in the Singularity and subsequently suppressing it. Even if, according to the current state of science, such an AI is far from being in the realm of feasibility, the question remains, how can we ensure that strong AIs are good in character? Only so much: The discussion would go beyond this framework.Cool stuffHow will machines — e.g. autonomous cars — decide in critical situations in the future? Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have designed the Moral Machine. Critical situations are shown — for example: children on the roadway vs. an elderly couple in the vehicle — and you have to make a moral decision about life and death. How would you decide, and only then how should the machine judge that:Moral MachineA platform for public participation in and discussion of the human perspective on machine-made moral decisionsmoralmachine.mit.eduSamsungs’ NEON virtual assistants — based on artificial intelligence — give a pretty impressive taste of the future. Whether as tutors in education, customer support in retail or as a virtual friend — they seem amazingly real:Machine learning combined with automation: Strateos Cloud Lab offers scientists the opportunity to have their tests performed autonomously in a lab automated by artificial intelligence and robotics. This involves defining the tests and then running them autonomously.

Artificial Intelligence and the Art of Culinary Presentation




How to preserve the creative process behind haute cuisine is explored in an online GSAPP event.

Photos of plates at L'Arpège by Emily L. Spratt and Alain Passard









On February 16, 2021, Emily L. Spratt, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Data Science Institute, gave an online presentation, “AI and the Art of Culinary Presentation: Gastronomic Algorithms between Alain Passard and Giuseppe Arcimboldo,” sponsored by the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation’s Historic Preservation Program.
Historic Preservation Program Director Jorge Otero-Pailos introduced Spratt, and commended her work for reimagining cultural heritage through the use of artificial intelligence.
“Even if we’re not experts in French cuisine, but just in preservation in general,” Otero-Pailos said, “how can we think of preservation as an expression, as something that needs to be created, and something that we all experience aesthetically?”
Spratt explored the creative process behind the platings, or presentations of food, by Alain Passard, chef and owner of the Paris-based, three-star Michelin restaurant L'Arpège. Her interest in his work was piqued by her observation that his dishes resemble paintings.

A prolific collage artist, Passard is known for employing the medium as an inspiration for his dishes. Computer scientist Thomas Fan and the staff of L'Arpège also contributed to the gastronomic algorithms project, which is notably the first application of Generative Adversarial Networks to the world of haute cuisine. 
“Although the recent developments of artificial intelligence to generate visual content with deep learning techniques, especially GANs, have offered radically new possibilities for its creative applications in the visual medium, there has been little investigation into its use as a tool to explore the engagement of the senses beyond vision alone,” Spratt said. 
Preserving Gastronomy as an Intangible Heritage
Spratt spoke about the preservation of culinary traditions and the history of gastronomic cultural heritage, showing photographs of menus from the Titanic and diagrams illustrating 17th-century linen folding techniques. Although tangible artifacts such as these reveal associations of a particular culinary experience, she pointed out their insufficiency in capturing the full experience of a meal. 





""Vertumnus,"" Guiseppe Arcimboldo, 1591





How can culinary traditions be preserved, Spratt asked, when food is ultimately meant to be consumed? UNESCO recognizes French cuisine as an intangible heritage, which it defines as “not the cultural manifestation itself, but rather the wealth of knowledge and skills that is transmitted through it from one generation to the next.” 
The gastronomic algorithms project, in contrast, emphasizes the cultural manifestation itself. Specifically, the project focuses on the artistic dimension of plating through Passard’s use of collages to visually conceive of actual plates of food. Taking this one step further, the project also explores how fruit-and-vegetable-embellished paintings by the Italian Renaissance artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1526-1593) could be reproduced through the use of artificial intelligence tools. 
Spratt then asked the leading question of her research: “How could GANs, a generative form of AI, emulate the culinary images, and would doing so visually reveal anything about the creative process between the chef’s abstracted notions of the plates and collages, and their actual visual execution as dishes?”
Experimenting With Datasets
Although Passard’s collages are a source of inspiration for his platings, a one-to-one visual correlation between the appearance of both does not exist. The dataset initially comprised photos posted by Passard on Instagram, images provided by the restaurant’s employees, and photos captured by Spratt at L'Arpège during each of the different seasons. This was later supplemented by images of vegetables and fruits on plates, as well as sliced variations procured from the internet using web scraping tools. 


To imitate aspects of Arcimboldo’s food-filled portraits, Spratt relied on a dataset of 300 portraits generated by a GANs-based model. Following initial tests, the dataset and algorithms were fine-tuned to increase the differentiation of individual fruits and vegetables characteristic of the platings designed by L'Arpège.
“The GANs-produced dishes have at once both an alluring aesthetic quality and a frightful one, as a tomato carpaccio seems to be able to open eyes and wink, and vegetable flourishes appear to have grown wisps of hair,” said Spratt.
Aiming for a more abstract version, Spratt added collages—created by both Passard and an artificial-intelligence algorithm—to the preexisting image dataset. Unique combinations such as these set the project apart from other AI-generated artworks.  
The Creativity Behind Culinary Art
Otero-Pailos asked Spratt to speak about the division between documentation and artistic expression in culinary art. “Does the line for you necessarily need to be blurred in this form of documentation? Or would you be okay with just a simple photograph of the plate as a record?”
The project, said Spratt, intentionally challenges the UNESCO definition of intangible heritage. Beyond mere documentation, the crux of the project focuses on the creativity behind culinary art. “How could that creative process [undertaken at L'Arpège] be codified as intangible heritage? How do we capture that?”

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has recommended introducing contemporary subjects like Artificial Intelligence in the curriculum, at relevant stages. The National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT) has initiated the process for the preparation of a new National Curriculum Framework for School Education in pursuance of the NEP, 2020 during which the possibility of introducing an introductory course on Artificial Intelligence (AI) at secondary level would also be explored.
Meanwhile, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced Artificial Intelligence as a subject in class IX from session 2019-2020 and in Class-XI from session 2020-2021 in their affiliated schools.
Artificial Intelligence has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems. Artificial Intelligence can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline administrative tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability.

By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for Artificial Intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students.
All AICTE approved institutions have been suggested to offer Artificial Intelligence as an elective in B.Tech. courses and also start B.Tech course in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to augment the human resource in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics.  So far as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are concerned, their Acts and Statutes allow them to have their own curriculum, academic & research collaboration with Institutions and Universities across the world.
Most of the IITs offer various Artificial Intelligence related courses such as Deep Learning Foundations & Applications, Foundation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Probabilistic Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence, Predictive & Prescriptive Data Analytics, Deep Learning, System Identification, Cyber-Physical Security, Digital Image Processing, etc. Besides, IITs also organize short term programmes, inter-alia, on Artificial Intelligence for the working professional and interested students.
The information was given by the Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.

The National Council of Educational Research &amp; Training (NCERT) has initiated the process for the preparation of a new National Curriculum Framework for School Education in pursuance of the NEP, 2020 during which the possibility of introducing an introductory course on Artificial Intelligence (AI) at secondary level would also be explored.

Meanwhile, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced Artificial Intelligence as a subject in class IX from session 2019-2020 and in Class-XI from session 2020-2021 in their affiliated schools.

Artificial Intelligence has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems. Artificial Intelligence can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline administrative tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability.

By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for Artificial Intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students.

All AICTE approved institutions have been suggested to offer Artificial Intelligence as an elective in B.Tech. courses and also start B.Tech course in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to augment the human resource in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics.  So far as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are concerned, their Acts and Statutes allow them to have their own curriculum, academic &amp; research collaboration with Institutions and Universities across the world.

Most of the IITs offer various Artificial Intelligence related courses such as Deep Learning Foundations &amp; Applications, Foundation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Probabilistic Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence, Predictive &amp; Prescriptive Data Analytics, Deep Learning, System Identification, Cyber-Physical Security, Digital Image Processing, etc. Besides, IITs also organize short term programmes, &lt;em&gt;inter-alia&lt;/em&gt;, on Artificial Intelligence for the working professional and interested students.
