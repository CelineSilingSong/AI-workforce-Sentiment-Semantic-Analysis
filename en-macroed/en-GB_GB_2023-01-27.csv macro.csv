But as AI and automation becomes increasingly capable, how will this alternative labor source affect your future workforce? In this article, we&#039;ll take a look at both some optimistic and pessimistic views of the future of our jobs amidst increasing AI capabilities.    Technology-driven societal changes, like what we&#039;re experiencing with AI and automation, always engender concern and fear—and for good reason. A two-year study from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2030, intelligent agents and robots could replace as much as 30 percent of the world’s current human labor. McKinsey suggests that, in terms of scale, the automation revolution could rival the move away from agricultural labor during the 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently, the explosion of the Chinese labor economy.     McKinsey reckons that, depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely. How could such a shift not cause fear and concern, especially for the world’s vulnerable countries and populations?     The Brookings Institution suggests that even if automation only reaches the 38 percent means of most forecasts, some Western democracies are likely to resort to authoritarian policies to stave off civil chaos, much like they did during the Great Depression. Brookings writes, “The United States would look like Syria or Iraq, with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war, violence, or theft.” With frightening yet authoritative predictions like those, it&#039;s no wonder AI and automation keeps many of us up at night.       “Stop being a Luddite”    The Luddites were textiles workers who protested against automation, eventually attacking and burning factories because, “they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood.” The Luddite movement occurred all the way back in 1811, so concerns about job losses or job displacements due to automation are far from new.    When fear or concern is raised about the potential impact of artificial intelligence and automation on our workforce, a typical response is thus to point to the past; the same concerns are raised time and again and prove unfounded.    In 1961, President Kennedy said, “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men.” In the 1980s, the advent of personal computers spurred “computerphobia” with many fearing computers would replace them.    Frame Breaking — The Luddites    So what happened?    Despite these fears and concerns, every technological shift has ended up creating more jobs than were destroyed. When particular tasks are automated, becoming cheaper and faster, you need more human workers to do the other functions in the process that haven’t been automated.    “During the Industrial Revolution more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated, prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do, such as operating a machine, and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly. This caused output to grow explosively. In America during the 19th century the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50, and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98%. This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it, which in turn created more jobs for weavers: their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900. In other words, technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver’s job, and the skills required to do it, rather than replacing it altogether.” — The Economist, Automation and Anxiety    Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Bright Future?    Looking back on history, it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding AI and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted. Technological change may eliminate specific jobs, but it has always created more in the process.        Beyond net job creation, there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation.    “Simply put, jobs that robots can replace are not good jobs in the first place. As humans, we climb up the rungs of drudgery — physically tasking or mind-numbing jobs — to jobs that use what got us to the top of the food chain, our brains.” — The Wall Street Journal, The Robots Are Coming. Welcome Them.    By eliminating the tedium, AI and automation can free us to pursue careers that give us a greater sense of meaning and well-being. Careers that challenge us, instill a sense of progress, provide us with autonomy, and make us feel like we belong; all research-backed attributes of a satisfying job.    And at a higher level, AI and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty. Already, AI is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention, higher accuracy diagnosis, and more effective treatment and cures. When it comes to eliminating world poverty, one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most. By applying AI analysis to data from satellite images, this barrier can be surmounted, focusing aid most effectively.        Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Dark Future.    I am all for optimism. But as much as I’d like to believe all of the above, this bright outlook on the future relies on seemingly shaky premises. Namely:    The past is an accurate predictor of the future.We can weather the painful transition.There are some jobs that only humans can do.    The past isn’t an accurate predictor of the future    As explored earlier, a common response to fears and concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence and automation is to point to the past. However, this approach only works if the future behaves similarly. There are many things that are different now than in the past, and these factors give us good reason to believe that the future will play out differently.    In the past, technological disruption of one industry didn’t necessarily mean the disruption of another. Let’s take car manufacturing as an example; a robot in automobile manufacturing can drive big gains in productivity and efficiency, but that same robot would be useless trying to manufacture anything other than a car. The underlying technology of the robot might be adapted, but at best that still only addresses manufacturing    AI is different because it can be applied to virtually any industry. When you develop AI that can understand language, recognize patterns, and problem solve, disruption isn’t contained. Imagine creating an AI that can diagnose disease and handle medications, address lawsuits, and write articles like this one. No need to imagine: AI is already doing those exact things.    Another important distinction between now and the past is the speed of technological progress. Technological progress doesn’t advance linearly, it advances exponentially. Consider Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years.     In the words of University of Colorado physics professor Albert Allen Bartlett, “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.” We drastically underestimate what happens when a value keeps doubling.    What do you get when technological progress is accelerating and AI can do jobs across a range of industries? An accelerating pace of job destruction.    “There’s no economic law that says ‘You will always create enough jobs or the balance will always be even’, it’s possible for a technology to dramatically favour one group and to hurt another group, and the net of that might be that you have fewer jobs” —Erik Brynjolfsson, Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy        In the past, yes, more jobs were created than were destroyed by technology. Workers were able to reskill and move laterally into other industries instead. But the past isn’t always an accurate predictor of the future. We can’t complacently sit back and think that everything is going to be ok.    Which brings us to another critical issue ...    The transition will be extremely painful    Let&#039;s pretend for a second that the past actually will be a good predictor of the future; jobs will be eliminated but more jobs will be created to replace them. This brings up an absolutely critical question, what kinds of jobs are being created and what kinds of jobs are being destroyed?    “Low- and high-skilled jobs have so far been less vulnerable to automation. The low-skilled jobs categories that are considered to have the best prospects over the next decade — including food service, janitorial work, gardening, home health, childcare, and security — are generally physical jobs, and require face-to-face interaction. At some point robots will be able to fulfill these roles, but there’s little incentive to roboticize these tasks at the moment, as there’s a large supply of humans who are willing to do them for low wages.” — Slate, Will robots steal your job?        Blue-collar and white-collar jobs will be eliminated—basically, anything that requires middle-skills (meaning that it requires some training, but not much). This leaves low-skill jobs, as described above, and high-skill jobs that require high levels of training and education.    There will assuredly be an increasing number of jobs related to programming, robotics, engineering, etc.. After all, these skills will be needed to improve and maintain the AI and automation being used around us.    But will the people who lost their middle-skilled jobs be able to move into these high-skill roles instead? Certainly not without significant training and education. What about moving into low-skill jobs? Well, the number of these jobs is unlikely to increase, particularly because the middle-class loses jobs and stops spending money on food service, gardening, home health, etc.    The transition could be very painful. It’s no secret that rising unemployment has a negative impact on society; less volunteerism, higher crime, and drug abuse are all correlated. A period of high unemployment, in which tens of millions of people are incapable of getting a job because they simply don’t have the necessary skills, will be our reality if we don’t adequately prepare.    So how do we prepare? At the minimum, by overhauling our entire education system and providing means for people to re-skill.    To transition from 90% of the American population farming to just 2% during the first industrial revolution, it took the mass introduction of primary education to equip people with the necessary skills to work. The problem is that we’re still using an education system that is geared for the industrial age. The three Rs (reading, writing, arithmetic) were once the important skills to learn to succeed in the workforce. Now, those are the skills quickly being overtaken by AI.    For a fascinating look at our current education system and its faults, check out this video from Sir Ken Robinson:    https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity?language=en    In addition to transforming our whole education system, we should also accept that learning doesn’t end with formal schooling. The exponential acceleration of digital transformation means that learning must be a lifelong pursuit, constantly re-skilling to meet an ever-changing world.    Making huge changes to our education system, providing means for people to re-skill, and encouraging lifelong learning can help mitigate the pain of the transition, but is that enough?    Are We F*cked? Will All Jobs Be Eliminated?    When I originally wrote this article a couple of years ago, I believed firmly that 99% of all jobs would be eliminated. Now, I&#039;m not so sure. Here was my argument at the time:    The claim that 99% of all jobs will be eliminated] may seem bold, and yet it’s all but certain. All you need are two premises:    We will continue making progress in building more intelligent machines.Human intelligence arises from physical processes.    The first premise shouldn’t be at all controversial. The only reason to think that we would permanently stop progress, of any kind, is some extinction-level event that wipes out humanity, in which case this debate is irrelevant. Excluding such a disaster, technological progress will continue on an exponential curve. And it doesn’t matter how fast that progress is; all that matters is that it will continue. The incentives for people, companies, and governments are too great to think otherwise.    The second premise will be controversial, but notice that I said human intelligence. I didn’t say “consciousness” or “what it means to be human”. That human intelligence arises from physical processes seems easy to demonstrate: if we affect the physical processes of the brain we can observe clear changes in intelligence. Though a gloomy example, it’s clear that poking holes in a person’s brain results in changes to their intelligence. A well-placed poke in someone’s Broca’s area and voilà—that person can’t process speech.    With these two premises in hand, we can conclude the following: we will build machines that have human-level intelligence and higher. It’s inevitable.    We already know that machines are better than humans at physical tasks, they can move faster, more precisely, and lift greater loads. When these machines are also as intelligent as us, there will be almost nothing they can’t do—or can&#039;t learn to do quickly. Therefore, 99% of jobs will eventually be eliminated.    But that doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;ll be redundant. We&#039;ll still need leaders (unless we give ourselves over to robot overlords) and our arts, music, etc., may remain solely human pursuits too. As for just about everything else? Machines will do it—and do it better.    “But who’s going to maintain the machines?” The machines.“But who’s going to improve the machines?” The machines.    Assuming they could eventually learn 99% of what we do, surely they&#039;ll be capable of maintaining and improving themselves more precisely and efficiently than we ever could.    The above argument is sound, but the conclusion that 99% of all jobs will be eliminated I believe over-focused on our current conception of a &quot;job&quot;. As I pointed out above, there&#039;s no guarantee that the future will play out like the past. After continuing to reflect and learn over the past few years, I now think there&#039;s good reason to believe that while 99% of all current jobs might be eliminated, there will still be plenty for humans to do (which is really what we care about, isn&#039;t it?).    The one thing that humans can do that robots can’t (at least for a long while) is to decide what it is that humans want to do. This is not a trivial semantic trick; our desires are inspired by our previous inventions, making this a circular question. — The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, by Kevin Kelly    Perhaps another way of looking at the above quote is this: a few years ago I read the book Emotional Intelligence, and was shocked to discover just how essential emotions are to decision making. Not just important, essential. People who had experienced brain damage to the emotional centers of their brains were absolutely incapable of making even the smallest decisions. This is because, when faced with a number of choices, they could think of logical reasons for doing or not doing any of them but had no emotional push/pull to choose.    So while AI and automation may eliminate the need for humans to do any of the doing, we will still need humans to determine what to do. And because everything that we do and everything that we build sparks new desires and shows us new possibilities, this &quot;job&quot; will never be eliminated.    If you had predicted in the early 19th century that almost all jobs would be eliminated, and you defined jobs as agricultural work, you would have been right. In the same way, I believe that what we think of as jobs today will almost certainly be eliminated too. But this does not mean that there will be no jobs at all, the &quot;job&quot; will instead shift to determining, what do we want to do? And then working with our AI and machines to make our desires a reality.    Is this overly optimistic? I don&#039;t think so. Either way, there&#039;s no question that the impact of artificial intelligence will be great and it&#039;s critical that we invest in the education and infrastructure needed to support people as many current jobs are eliminated and we transition to this new future.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence - Widespread Job Losses 




Calum McClelland -
January 30, 2023

In schools, the impact of artificial intelligence and automation is often portrayed in a good light. Think back to learning about the water wheel, mills, printing presses, steam engines, and assembly lines. Often, the underlying narrative is that these were great innovations that reduced the burden of labor on humans. However, the technological advances of our time seem to be less well-received. Perhaps it is because of our proximity to these examples of automation. Our closeness prevents us from seeing only the benefits and instead pushes us to see how much our lives and livelihood will be impacted by artificial intelligence.
McKinsey & Company reckons that, depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely. How could such a shift not cause fear and concern, especially for the world’s vulnerable countries and populations? 
The Brookings Institution writes of a “new” kind of automation with more advanced robotics and AI that can bring work displacement to college graduates and professionals as much as it has to vehicle drivers and retail workers. 
With frightening yet like these, it’s no wonder AI and automation keep many of us up at night.   
“Stop Being a Luddite”
Although we may remember from our textbooks that the 19th century brought significant innovations to factories, this does not mean that it was welcomed with open arms by the people then. The Luddites were textile workers who protested against automation, eventually attacking and burning factories because “they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood.” The Luddite movement occurred all the way back in 1811, so concerns about job losses or job displacements due to automation are far from new.
When fear or concern is raised about the potential impact of artificial intelligence and automation on our workforce, a typical response is thus to point to the past; the same concerns are raised time and again and prove unfounded.
In 1961, President Kennedy said, “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men.” In the 1980s, the advent of personal computers spurred “computerphobia” with many fearing computers would replace them.

Frame Breaking — The Luddites
So what happened?
Despite these fears and concerns, every technological shift has ended up creating more jobs than were destroyed. When particular tasks are automated, becoming cheaper and faster, you need more human workers to do the other functions in the process that haven’t been automated.

“During the Industrial Revolution, more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated, prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do, such as operating a machine, and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly. This caused output to grow explosively. In America during the 19th century, the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50, and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98 percent. This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it, which in turn created more jobs for weavers: their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900. In other words, technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver’s job, and the skills required to do it, rather than replacing it altogether.”
-The Economist, Automation and Anxiety
Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Bright Future?
Looking back on history, it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding AI and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted. Technological change may eliminate specific jobs, but it has always created more in the process.
Beyond net job creation, there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation.

“Simply put, jobs that robots can replace are not good jobs in the first place. As humans, we climb up the rungs of drudgery — physically tasking or mind-numbing jobs — to jobs that use what got us to the top of the food chain, our brains.”
–The Wall Street Journal, The Robots Are Coming. Welcome Them.
By eliminating the tedium, AI and automation can free us to pursue careers that give us a greater sense of meaning and well-being. Careers that challenge us, instill a sense of progress, provide us with autonomy, and make us feel like we belong; all attributes of a satisfying job.
And at a higher level, AI and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty. Already, AI is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention, higher accuracy diagnosis, and more effective treatment and cures. When it comes to eliminating world poverty, one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most. The AI and Global Development Lab is recreating historical and geographical human-development trajectories from satellite images starting from 1984 to measure poverty and the effects of foreign aid. 
Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Dark Future
I am all for optimism. But as much as I’d like to believe all of the above, this bright outlook on the future relies on seemingly shaky premises. Namely:

The past is an accurate predictor of the future.
We can weather the painful transition.
There are some jobs that only humans can do.

The Transition Will Be Extremely Painful
Let’s pretend for a second that the past actually will be a good predictor of the future; artificial intelligence will impact some jobs but more jobs will be created to replace them. This brings up an absolutely critical question, what kinds of jobs are being created, and what kinds of jobs are being destroyed?

The claim that 99 percent of all jobs will be eliminated may seem bold, and yet it’s all but certain. All you need are two premises:

We will continue making progress in building more intelligent machines.
Human intelligence arises from physical processes.

The first premise shouldn’t be at all controversial. The only reason to think that we would permanently stop progress, of any kind, is some extinction-level event that wipes out humanity, in which case this debate is irrelevant. Excluding such a disaster, technological progress will continue on an exponential curve. And it doesn’t matter how fast that progress is; all that matters is that it will continue. The incentives for people, companies, and governments are too great to think otherwise.
The second premise will be controversial, but notice that I said human intelligence. I didn’t say “consciousness” or “what it means to be human.” That human intelligence arises from physical processes seems easy to demonstrate: if we affect the physical processes of the brain we can observe clear changes in intelligence. Though a gloomy example, it’s clear that poking holes in a person’s brain results in changes to their intelligence. A well-placed poke in someone’s Broca’s area and voilà—that person can’t process speech.
With these two premises in hand, we can conclude the following: we will build machines that have human-level intelligence and higher. It’s inevitable.
We already know that machines are better than humans at physical tasks, they can move faster, more precisely, and lift greater loads. When these machines are also as intelligent as us, there will be almost nothing they can’t do—or can’t learn to do quickly. Therefore, 99 percent of jobs will eventually be eliminated.
But that doesn’t mean we’ll be redundant. We’ll still need leaders (unless we give ourselves over to robot overlords) and our arts, music, etc., may remain solely human pursuits too. As for just about everything else? Machines will do it—and do it better.
“But who’s going to maintain the machines?” The machines.“But who’s going to improve the machines?” The machines.
Assuming they could eventually learn 99 percent of what we do, surely they’ll be capable of maintaining and improving themselves more precisely and efficiently than we ever could.
The above argument is sound, but the conclusion that 99 percent of all jobs will be eliminated I believe over-focused on our current conception of a “job.” As I pointed out above, there’s no guarantee that the future will play out like the past. After continuing to reflect and learn over the past few years, I now think there’s good reason to believe that while 99 percent of all current jobs might be eliminated, there will still be plenty for humans to do (which is really what we care about, isn’t it?).

“The one thing that humans can do that robots can’t (at least for a long while) is to decide what it is that humans want to do. This is not a trivial semantic trick; our desires are inspired by our previous inventions, making this a circular question.”
-The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, by Kevin Kelly
Perhaps another way of looking at the above quote is this: a few years ago I read the book Emotional Intelligence, and was shocked to discover just how essential emotions are to decision-making. Not just important, but essential. People who had experienced brain damage to the emotional centers of their brains were absolutely incapable of making even the smallest decisions. This is because, when faced with a number of choices, they could think of logical reasons for doing or not doing any of them but had no emotional push/pull to choose.
So while AI and automation may eliminate the need for humans to do any of the doing, we will still need humans to determine what to do. And because everything that we do and everything that we build sparks new desires and shows us new possibilities, this “job” will never be eliminated.
If you had predicted in the early 19th century that almost all jobs would be eliminated, and you defined jobs as agricultural work, you would have been right. In the same way, I believe that what we think of as jobs today will almost certainly be eliminated too. But this does not mean that there will be no jobs at all, the “job” will instead shift to determining, what do we want to do? And then working with our AI and machines to make our desires a reality.
Is this overly optimistic? I don’t think so. Either way, there’s no question that the impact of artificial intelligence will be great and it’s critical that we invest in the education and infrastructure needed to support people as many current jobs are eliminated and we transition to this new future.

The creative AI revolution has sparked fascination and fear in equal measure. Could AI be exploited to cut costs, to demand more work in less time, to make sectors such as design even more precarious or to automate the easiest tasks?

At a concert organised by the University of Oregon, artificial intelligence named EMI managed to deceive its audience by passing off its musical compositions as pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach himself. In New York, a computer programme wrote a novel from start to finish inspired by Jack Kerouac’s legendary On the Road. In Paris, Edmond de Belamy, a portrait painted by an artificial neural network, was auctioned for thousands of euros.
As new and groundbreaking as all this may seem, it is actually part of the prehistory of artificial intelligence (AI). Both the auction and the publication of the novel took place five years ago, in 2018, but algorithms like that of EMI have been in development since the 1980s. The obsession with creating a machine in the image of the human brain, an intelligence capable of calculating, reasoning or even creating artistic works goes back a long way. In recent years, however, steps have been taken at such a speed that the line of what we thought was inconceivable has shifted.
In 2022, AI programmes such as Dall-E2, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion surprised us with their ability to create unprecedented, instantaneous and astonishingly realistic images from a simple text description: from cowboys on the moon to cubist versions of The Girl with a Pearl Earring or recreations of the French Revolution as seen through a fisheye lens. Others, like GPT-3, demonstrated their ability to write complex texts and original poems within seconds.

Just as EMI was able to imitate Bach, there are algorithms that can compose their own melodies, illustrate comic books or write scripts for short films.

Such algorithms are capable of defeating human ingenuity in an artistic contest, as one of their mechanical predecessors did against an unbeatable chess player, Kasparov.
The creative AI revolution has sparked a wave of fascination, but also fear, and not without reason: if 56 per cent of today’s jobs are already threatened by automation, could artists, designers and creative professionals be next in line? And to what extent is artificial creativity capable of making human creativity obsolete?
Where does artificial creativity come from?
Like the human brain, artificial intelligence-based programmes have their own networks of neurons – artificial neurons. Huge amounts of data are stored in them, which are then analysed, classified and recombined. This is how ideas are hatched.
“The big leap in artificial intelligence came a few years ago with the development of deep learning. The support was acquired to train deep networks within very short timeframes so that they could not only analyse data but also learn from their own experience,” Karina Gibert, director of the IDEAI-UPC artificial intelligence research centre and one of Spain’s leading specialists in this field, tells Equal Times. “We call it creative intelligence, because it is able to take separate elements acquired through learning and combine them to generate something new.”
One example is the Edmond de Belamy portrait, created by AI after analysing 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries. Another is The Next Rembrandt project, which, after studying 300 works by the Dutch painter, is capable of painting new works recreating his style. The same procedure is followed by programmes such as Dall-E – a fusion of the name of Pixar’s WALL-E robot and Salvador Dalí – which create images from text. The user writes what they want to see and the AI searches its database and designs several versions within a very short space of time.
AI’s strongest critics accuse it of copying, of practising a sophisticated form of plagiarism. But what it does is not very different, in fact, from the unconscious process developed by the human brain. As Margaret Boden, a leading figure in artificial intelligence, explains, new thoughts that originate in the mind are not likely to be completely new but rooted in representations that already exist . The fact that machines have learned to replicate part of our creative process does not mean that they can emulate it in its entirety.

“There is an element of creativity that cannot be automated,” María Luisa Sanz de Acedo, professor of psychology specialising in thinking skills and creativity, tells Equal Times.

“Some call it subjectivity, others life energy, spirituality. AI can simulate some human behaviour, but that complex inner world is beyond its reach.”
Pablo Sanguinetti, author and researcher on artificial creativity, agrees. “AI doesn’t imagine, feel, have consciousness or understand the world,” he explains. “These systems do one thing extraordinarily well: processing large amounts of information and extracting patterns from that apparent chaos; but what defines creativity with a capital ‘C’ is the human capacity to break free from those patterns, reject them or re-signify them. I’m not sure machines are capable of this yet.”
Tool or threat?
Cristina de Propios is a Spanish artist and designer. She has been focused on innovation since the very start of her career, combining art and robotics. It was only a matter of time before she moved towards artificial intelligence. “When the Belamy painting was sold, it really grabbed my attention. I asked myself ‘how can a machine make art’, but before criticising it I decided to give it a try.”
Her latest project consists of “living canvases” made up of cellular automata that, thanks to deep learning, create different compositions and movements each time. “This technology is very interesting in terms of the visual possibilities it offers and its surprising results. It’s a kind of augmented creativity,” says the artist, who insists on highlighting the importance of the human factor. “AI doesn’t understand what is beautiful or harmonious. It is like a small child that you teach based on what you know.”
Like her, a growing number of creators are using artificial intelligence as creative tools. “The results the machines generate by combining data can act as a stimulus in the creator’s working memory,” says creativity expert María Luisa Sanz de Acedo. In other words, AI can provide resources to avoid having to start from a blank canvas.

“Just as some people go to the sea and others read books, AI can also be a source of inspiration,” explains computer scientist Karina Gibert.

In sectors such as design, however, they do not necessarily see it as favourably. The fear is that the possibilities offered by these advances could be exploited to cut costs, demand more work in less time, to make their sector even more precarious or to automate the simplest tasks. “I think some jobs are definitely at risk,” says Abel Guzmán, a graphic designer. “As with other technological advances, new professions will emerge. There will be people who specialise, who learn to understand how AI thinks, and how to direct it. Personally, in my case, I think I only have two options: to train or be left behind.”
Reskilling, he points out, will not necessarily be easy, especially in a sector that is evolving so fast and where it is difficult to compete with new generations. This is the reason behind the recent protests by creative professionals, such as the manifestos posted on social media, where some have created their own seal to identify their works as AI-free. “I can understand that,” says Guzmán. “Many of these people are older or have a very purist view of the profession. They’ve seen the dangers on the horizon. It’s true, though, that we offer something artificial intelligence cannot. AI produces results but it doesn’t talk to the client, it doesn’t know the emotional charge of a project. If you are looking for a mechanical job, you can ask AI to do it, but if you want a more human, more empathetic job, you should know that you won’t pay the same as to someone who only has a computer farm.”
AI and new myths
The debate over AI’s impact on employment is not the only dilemma presented by creative artificial intelligence tools. The matter of who owns the copyright to these works, for example, remains pending. Is it the AI itself, the person who gives it the instructions, the creators of the works from which it draws its inspiration, or the computer scientist who developed it?

“The rise of a new creative technique not only introduces new forms of production, it also changes the very idea of what art is,” says researcher Pablo Sanguinetti.

“You just have to think about photography, cinema, the printing press. There is always a degree of anxiety at such times: the fear that the technique will replace the artist.” It is the same story already told by science fiction – from Blade Runner to Frankenstein – hundreds of times.
“The fear that people used to have of fate, of gods, of providence, has shifted to a fear of ourselves, of our world of objects. The myths surrounding artificial intelligence are like those that used to surround saints, such as the power to perform miracles,” Fernando Broncano, professor of philosophy at the Carlos III University in Madrid, tells Equal Times.
For the professor, there is no sense in fearing machines, or in thinking that we are fundamentally very different from them. “We are already part machine. The human species is as much a product of its biology as of its technical environment, its tools, its medicines.”
“Life is the greatest example of creativity that exists,” the philosopher recalls. “For example, a storm can produce a change in the environment, it can generate something new, but it is the human being – society – that gives it value, that decides what to do with it. The focus of our thinking should not therefore be on what differentiates us from machines but what we want to do with them.”

Although not yet released due to copyright issues, MusicLM is a signal of what’s to come in using AI to generate music from text descriptions.

What is the impact of taking all the musical know-how and ingesting into an AI brain with only asking questions expressing your musical tastes? Who needs to be a musician to entertain when we will soon be able to create our own music even more easily and tap into the human genius of every muscian that has a recording?


Google researchers say MusicLM is based on a model generating high-fidelity music from text descriptions such as ""a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff"". You can find the details on GitHub.

MusicLM is built on a neural network, and trained on a large music data set of over280,000 hours of music, enabling it to automatically produce innovative music tracks of diverse instruments, genres, and concepts based on text descriptions.

PROMOTED
Essentially, if an AI attempts to mimic a human brain by ingested all the musical patterns, and sound frequencies that it is exposed to. One only needs to search for AI-generated Carti tracks on YouTube to listen to this type of technology like Digital Butterflies.
Like a magic word wand, MusicLM can more accurately produce higher quality fidelity audio, you can even hum a melody to train the AI algorithm to get the right beat you want to hear. According to Google researchers, the model generates music at 24kHz that remains consistent over several minutes.according to researchers. Google researchers have also published an AI training dataset of 5,500 pieces of music to support others researchers working on automated song generation.

This is indeed a sign of what’s to come in the music world. We must answer harder questions and build strategies for effective policy and legal legislation like:


What is the risk of AI algorithms creating their own compositions and work, and who owns this work that AI or the human?
Who owns the music when it’s a blend of everything on the world wide web and creates a new song from the brilliance of our musician’s?
When you purchase music, are you also purchasing the right to use its audio as an AI training data?

Since YouTube sensation and American Idol, Taryn Southern, started composing music with AI, musicians globally are trying to understand the impacts of AI on musicians.
What is clear is that we need to improve our legislation in regards to ownership of musician’s music and understand how AI algorithms should be treated and managed in the musical industry.

Although Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and many other AI market leaders will continue to advance the frontiers of every industry using AI. We as humans have an ethical responsibility to think harder about the world we want to create and leave for future generations.
If you are a Board Director or CEO or C-Level in the Musical Industry, learning more about AI is a business imperative to understand the long term effects of AI in the musical industry and shaping the world you want to protect as “human brains and musical talent” have value and we are rapidly commoditizing precious creative DNA into bits and bytes that will have major impacts to our musicians’ creative ownership entitlements.
At least ask the hard question and do some scenario risk analysis?
Note: 
To support future research, Google has also publicly released MusicCaps, a dataset composed of 5.5k music-text pairs, with rich text descriptions provided by human experts.

Best known for its ability to generate long-form written content in response to user input prompts, Cobbs expected the tool to produce a nuanced and thoughtful response to his specific research directions. Instead, his screen produced a generic, poorly written paper he’d never dare to claim as his own.
“The quality of writing was appalling. The phrasing was awkward and it lacked complexity,” Cobbs says. “I just logically can’t imagine a student using writing that was generated through ChatGPT for a paper or anything when the content is just plain bad.”
Not everyone shares Cobbs’ disdain. Ever since OpenAI launched the chatbot in November, educators have been struggling with how to handle a new wave of student work produced with the help of artificial intelligence. While some public school systems, like New York City’s, have banned the use of ChatGPT on school devices and networks to curb cheating, universities have been reluctant to follow suit. In higher education, the introduction of generative AI has raised thorny questions about the definition of plagiarism and academic integrity on campuses where new digital research tools come into play all the time.
Make no mistake, the birth of ChatGPT does not mark the emergence of concerns relating to the improper use of the internet in academia. When Wikipedia launched in 2001, universities nationwide were scrambling to decipher their own research philosophies and understandings of honest academic work, expanding policy boundaries to match pace with technological innovation. Now, the stakes are a little more complex, as schools figure out how to treat bot-produced work rather than weird attributional logistics. The world of higher education is playing a familiar game of catch-up, adjusting their rules, expectations, and perceptions as other professions adjust, too. The only difference now is that the internet can think for itself.
Hipchen is not alone in her speculation. Alice Dailey, chair of the Academic Integrity Program at Villanova University, is also grappling with the idea of classifying an algorithm as a person, specifically if the algorithm involves text generation.
Dailey believes that eventually professors and students are going to need to understand that digital tools that generate text, rather than just collect facts, are going to need to fall under the umbrella of things that can be plagiarized from.
Although Dailey acknowledges that this technological growth incites new concerns in the world of academia, she doesn’t find it to be a realm entirely unexplored. “I think we’ve been in a version of this territory for a while already,” Dailey says. “Students who commit plagiarism often borrow material from a ‘somewhere’—a website, for example, that doesn’t have clear authorial attribution. I suspect the definition of plagiarism will expand to include things that produce.”
Eventually, Dailey believes, a student who uses text from ChatGPT will be seen as no different than one that copies and pastes chunks of text from Wikipedia without attribution.
“Calling the use of ChatGPT to pull reliable sources from the internet ‘cheating’ is absurd. It’s like saying using the internet to conduct research is unethical,” Gelman says. “To me, ChatGPT is the research equivalent of [typing assistant] Grammarly. I use it out of practicality and that’s really all.” Cobbs expressed similar sentiment, comparing the AI bot to “an online encyclopedia.”
But while students like Gelman use the bot to speed up research, others take advantage of the high-capacity prompt input feature to generate completed works for submission. It might seem obvious what qualifies as cheating here, but different schools across the country offer contrasting takes.
According to Carlee Warfield, chair of Bryn Mawr College’s Student Honor Board, the school considers any use of these AI platforms as plagiarism. The tool’s popularization just calls for greater focus in evaluating the intent behind students’ violations. Warfield explains that students who turn in essays entirely produced by AI are categorically different from those who borrow from online tools without knowledge of standard citations. Because the ChatGPT phenomenon is still new, students’ confusion surrounding the ethics is understandable. And it's unclear what policies will remain in place once the dust settles—at any school.
In the midst of fundamental change in both the academic and technological spheres, universities are forced to reconsider their definitions of academic integrity to reasonably reflect the circumstances of society. The only problem is, society shows no stagnance.
“Villanova’s current academic integrity code will be updated to include language that prohibits the use of these tools to generate text that then students represent as text they generated independently,” Dailey explained. “But I think it’s an evolving thing. And what it can do and what we will then need in order to keep an eye on will also be kind of a moving target.”
In addition to increasingly complex questions about whether ChatGPT is a research tool or a plagiarism engine, there’s also the possibility that it can be used for learning. In other educational settings, teachers see it as a way to show students the shortcomings of AI. Some instructors are already modifying how they teach by giving students assignments bots couldn’t complete, like those that require personal details or anecdotes. There’s also the matter of detecting AI use in students’ work, which is a burgeoning cottage industry all its own.
Ultimately, Dailey says, schools may need rules that reflect a range of variables.
“My guess is that there will be the development of some broad blanket policies that essentially say, unless you have permission from a professor to use AI tools, using them will be considered a violation of the academic integrity code,” Dailey says. “That then gives faculty broad latitude to use it in their teaching or in their assignments, as long as they are stipulating explicitly that they are allowing it.”
As for ChatGTP, the program agrees. “Advances in fields such as artificial intelligence are expected to drive significant innovation in the coming years,” it says, when asked how schools can combat academic dishonesty. “Schools should constantly review and update their academic honor codes as technology evolves to ensure they are addressing the current ways in which technology is being used in academic settings.”
But, a bot would say that.",tags,N/A,"Sofia BarnettCultureJan 30, 2023 1:21 PMChatGPT Is Making Universities Rethink PlagiarismStudents and professors can’t decide whether the AI chatbot is a research tool—or a cheating engine.Photograph: Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveIn late December of his sophomore year, Rutgers University student Kai Cobbs came to a conclusion he never thought possible: Artificial intelligence might just be dumber than humans. After listening to his peers rave about the generative AI tool ChatGPT, Cobbs decided to toy around with the chatbot while writing an essay on the history of capitalism. Best known for its ability to generate long-form written content in response to user input prompts, Cobbs expected the tool to produce a nuanced and thoughtful response to his specific research directions. Instead, his screen produced a generic, poorly written paper he’d never dare to claim as his own. “The quality of writing was appalling. The phrasing was awkward and it lacked complexity,” Cobbs says. “I just logically can’t imagine a student using writing that was generated through ChatGPT for a paper or anything when the content is just plain bad.” Cheat CodeChatGPT Is Coming for Classrooms. Don't PanicPia CeresIdeasChatGPT Stole Your Work. So What Are You Going to Do?Nick Vincent and Hanlin LiIdeasChatGPT Isn’t the Only Way to Use AI in EducationNabeel GillaniNot everyone shares Cobbs’ disdain. Ever since OpenAI launched the chatbot in November, educators have been struggling with how to handle a new wave of student work produced with the help of artificial intelligence. While some public school systems, like New York City’s, have banned the use of ChatGPT on school devices and networks to curb cheating, universities have been reluctant to follow suit. In higher education, the introduction of generative AI has raised thorny questions about the definition of plagiarism and academic integrity on campuses where new digital research tools come into play all the time. Featured VideoHow A.I. Is Changing HollywoodMake no mistake, the birth of ChatGPT does not mark the emergence of concerns relating to the improper use of the internet in academia. When Wikipedia launched in 2001, universities nationwide were scrambling to decipher their own research philosophies and understandings of honest academic work, expanding policy boundaries to match pace with technological innovation. Now, the stakes are a little more complex, as schools figure out how to treat bot-produced work rather than weird attributional logistics. The world of higher education is playing a familiar game of catch-up, adjusting their rules, expectations, and perceptions as other professions adjust, too. The only difference now is that the internet can think for itself. According to ChatGPT, the definition of plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work or ideas without giving proper credit to the original author. But when the work is generated by something rather than someone, this definition is tricky to apply. As Emily Hipchen, a board member of Brown University’s Academic Code Committee, puts it, the use of generative AI by students leads to a critical point of contention. “If [plagiarism] is stealing from a person,” she says, “then I don’t know that we have a person who is being stolen from.”Hipchen is not alone in her speculation. Alice Dailey, chair of the Academic Integrity Program at Villanova University, is also grappling with the idea of classifying an algorithm as a person, specifically if the algorithm involves text generation.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenDailey believes that eventually professors and students are going to need to understand that digital tools that generate text, rather than just collect facts, are going to need to fall under the umbrella of things that can be plagiarized from. AdvertisementAlthough Dailey acknowledges that this technological growth incites new concerns in the world of academia, she doesn’t find it to be a realm entirely unexplored. “I think we’ve been in a version of this territory for a while already,” Dailey says. “Students who commit plagiarism often borrow material from a ‘somewhere’—a website, for example, that doesn’t have clear authorial attribution. I suspect the definition of plagiarism will expand to include things that produce.” Eventually, Dailey believes, a student who uses text from ChatGPT will be seen as no different than one that copies and pastes chunks of text from Wikipedia without attribution. Students’ views on ChatGPT are another issue entirely. There are those, like Cobbs, who can’t imagine putting their name on anything bot-generated, but there are others who see it as just another tool, like spellcheck or even a calculator. For Brown University sophomore Jacob Gelman, ChatGPT exists merely as a convenient research assistant and nothing more.“Calling the use of ChatGPT to pull reliable sources from the internet ‘cheating’ is absurd. It’s like saying using the internet to conduct research is unethical,” Gelman says. “To me, ChatGPT is the research equivalent of [typing assistant] Grammarly. I use it out of practicality and that’s really all.” Cobbs expressed similar sentiment, comparing the AI bot to “an online encyclopedia.”But while students like Gelman use the bot to speed up research, others take advantage of the high-capacity prompt input feature to generate completed works for submission. It might seem obvious what qualifies as cheating here, but different schools across the country offer contrasting takes.According to Carlee Warfield, chair of Bryn Mawr College’s Student Honor Board, the school considers any use of these AI platforms as plagiarism. The tool’s popularization just calls for greater focus in evaluating the intent behind students’ violations. Warfield explains that students who turn in essays entirely produced by AI are categorically different from those who borrow from online tools without knowledge of standard citations. Because the ChatGPT phenomenon is still new, students’ confusion surrounding the ethics is understandable. And it's unclear what policies will remain in place once the dust settles—at any school.In the midst of fundamental change in both the academic and technological spheres, universities are forced to reconsider their definitions of academic integrity to reasonably reflect the circumstances of society. The only problem is, society shows no stagnance. “Villanova’s current academic integrity code will be updated to include language that prohibits the use of these tools to generate text that then students represent as text they generated independently,” Dailey explained. “But I think it’s an evolving thing. And what it can do and what we will then need in order to keep an eye on will also be kind of a moving target.”Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenIn addition to increasingly complex questions about whether ChatGPT is a research tool or a plagiarism engine, there’s also the possibility that it can be used for learning.

Lil Snack & GamesBeat


GamesBeat is excited to partner with Lil Snack to have customized games just for our audience! We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games now!



Metaphysic made history in 2022 on “America’s Got Talent,” introducing hyperreal generative AI content to a national television audience. The team used AI to create photorealistic avatars of the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley, that delivered musical performances on stage that looked perfectly real.
The performances captured the world’s attention, along with leaders in the entertainment industry, including CAA and Los Angeles-based film and television studio Miramax.



“Metaphysic are industry leaders in using generative AI and machine learning to create photorealistic Hollywood-quality content, combined with their ethics-first approach and thought leadership they unlock an incredible opportunity for the entertainment industry and beyond,” said Joanna Popper, chief metaverse officer at CAA, in a statement. “Artificial intelligence will have a transformative impact on content creation and intellectual property. CAA has always been at the forefront of new technological frontiers and we are excited to work with Metaphysic in bringing the most exciting opportunities to our clients and the industry.”
Testament to its technical and creative excellence, Metaphysic has been named the sole AI provider for the highly-anticipated major motion picture Here, produced by Miramax and directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, this adaptation of Richard McGuire’s graphic novelreunites the original Oscar-winning team behind “Forrest Gump,” along with Paul Bettany and Kelly Reilly.advertisement
In an industry-first, Here incorporates hyperreal AI-generated face replacements and de-ageing into the very fabric of its storytelling. 
“I’ve always been attracted to technology that helps me to tell a story. With HERE, the film simply wouldn’t work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysic’s AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible! Having tested every flavor of face replacement and de-aging technology available today, Metaphysic are clearly the global leaders in feature-quality AI content and the perfect choice for this incredibly challenging, emotional film,” said Robert Zemeckis, in a statement.advertisement
Building on its industry-leading generative AI technology for Hollywood, Metaphysic is announcing its new product, Metaphysic Live. Being deployed in production on Here, Metaphysic’s new tool creates high-resolution photorealistic faceswaps and de-ageing effects on top of actors’ performances live and in real-time without the need for further compositing or VFX work. Streaming AI-generated photorealistic content that maps onto real-world scenes at up to 30 frames per second is a dramatic advance in the technology that will be essential to creating immersive AR/VR, gaming and entertainment experiences. 
Kevin Baillie, Production Visual Effects Supervisor on Here says, “It is incredible to see Metaphysic’s AI-generated content flawlessly integrated into a shot live on set! The actors can even use the technology as a ‘youth mirror’ – testing out acting choices for their younger selves in real-time. That feedback loop and youthful performance is absolutely essential in achieving an authentic, delightful result.”
“Metaphysic is rapidly expanding the creative horizons of Hollywood and beyond. Our tools are cost-effective, movie-quality and scalable – we are being forced to reimagine how visual media is produced,”said Thomas Graham, CEO of Metaphysic, in a statement. “With the support of CAA and by working on projects like Here, Metaphysic is demonstrating the transformative power of hyperreal AI to shape the future of entertainment and to eventually help people create AI-generated, photorealistic immersive content while they own and control their data.”
To build upon its incredible technical offering, Metaphysic is currently hiring additional talent to bolster its machine learning, VFX, and product innovation teams. Qualified candidates are encouraged to reach out to Metaphysic.
Metaphysic has appointed creative team leaders, cofounder Chris Ume as AI Supervisor and recently hired Chief Innovation Officer Jo Plaete – as visual effects supervisor for Here.

The development and growing popularity of ChatGPT shows artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to compete with humans for jobs one day, experts say.
ChatGPT, an AI text generator released to the public last November, has quickly garnered widespread attention for its ability to produce ideas for song lyrics, poems and scripts. It also remembers previous texts so users can ask follow-up questions in a conversational way.Recent reports suggest ChatGPT has the potential to pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam and perhaps earn an MBA from an Ivy League business school. A U.S. politician last week even delivered a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives written by the AI bot.  Story continues below advertisement



 These developments represent the potential AI has not only to be integrated into the workforce, but to possibly even oust humans from some jobs performed today, said Varun Mayya, CEO of software building company Avalon Scenes.

How ChatGPT is impacting learning





“At some point, it’s going to be something that is competing with you in the white-collar workforce,” Mayya told Global News.“I don’t think it’s limited to just white collar, though. I think eventually it’s going to be everything.” 


				ChatGPT may threaten ‘intellectual labour’			

ChatGPT is distinct for being able to generate material of varying expertise, ranging from high school to university-level compositions, while other online tools typically can only fix grammar, tone and clarity.  Story continues below advertisement



 It was developed by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based startup that works closely with Microsoft.ChatGPT can be practically anything the user makes of it — it can take on the role of a chef and provide recipes, make business plans for marketers, create press releases for public relations specialists or give advice like a therapist.Several research papers recently examined the potential ChatGPT possesses. In a white paper titled “Would Chat GPT3 Get a Wharton MBA?,” University of Pennsylvania Prof. Christian Terwiesch gave it a final exam for an operations management course at the Wharton School of Business and found that the chatbot would have earned a B to B-.

“Technology hasn’t put everybody out of a job yet, but it does put some people out of a job, and this one’s really interesting because most of the job replacement that’s happened as a result of technological development has been manual labour — but this is intellectual labour that’s threatened here,” said Brett Caraway, associate professor with the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto, on Global News Radio 640 Toronto last week.

“This could be lawyers, accountants. … It is something new and it will be interesting to see just how disruptive and painful it is to employment and politics.”On Jan. 25, ChatGPT was used by U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss to write a brief, two-paragraph speech on a bill that would create a U.S.-Israel artificial intelligence centre, the Associated Press reported. His staff said they believe it was the first time an AI-written speech was read in Congress.Auchincloss said he prompted the system in part to “write 100 words to deliver on the floor of the House of Representatives” about the legislation. Auchincloss said he had to refine the prompt several times to produce the text he ultimately read.  Story continues below advertisement



 Jobs that involve content creation, like speech writing, can be vulnerable to AI replacement, Mayya said.But he believes that AI can be integrated into the blue-collar workforce, threatening those jobs as well.“You’re going to be able to put this AI inside robotics,” Mayya said.“You have the hardware, which is maybe a robot that’s walking around … and then you’ll have software like ChatGPT or some other models sitting inside that’s driving the robot. Eventually it’s going to come for everything. It’s just a matter of when.” 


				ChatGPT flaws prevent it taking over jobs — for now			

Despite its growing popularity, ChatGPT currently possesses several flaws that mean it won’t be replacing humans in the workforce right away, experts say.The software isn’t accurate all the time. It can write plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, as pointed out by its creator. ChatGPT is powered by generative artificial intelligence, which conjures new content after training on vast amounts of data from various sources, including the Internet.

“Many people have called the Internet a bit of a dumpster fire, and certainly there is a lot of things on the Internet that you probably wouldn’t want to put into a technology that you trusted,” said Katrina Ingram, CEO of Ethically Aligned AI, a social enterprise committed to consulting and educating companies on artificial intelligence.

“ChatGPT has learned the lessons of the prior chat bots and it’s put in place some guardrails, but underneath all of that, there’s still a massive amount of training data that has racist, sexist, objectionable content baked into it because that is part of the Internet, and that is part of the training dataset that went into this product.”When assessing ChatGPT’s performance in the Evidence and Torts section of the Multistate Bar Exam, the authors of the December 2022 paper said its accuracy on all portions of the test was only 50.3 per cent. Its score was still much higher than the 25 per cent baseline expected of random guesses, they noted.  Story continues below advertisement



 In his research, Terwiesch found that ChatGPT ran into trouble with performing basic mathematics, making mistakes in Grade 6 level math that can be “massive in magnitude,” his paper read.ChatGPT doesn’t know the difference yet between accurate and inaccurate information, but it can be taught, Mayya said.“There is a human somewhere sitting down helping ChatGPT, saying, ‘Hey, you’re not supposed to say that,’” he said.“My worry is that today, it looks sort of like a toy, slightly useful in a variety of jobs, but I feel like eventually it’s going to be really powerful.” 


				How can ChatGPT be integrated into society?			

Andrew Piper, a professor at McGill University in the department of languages, literatures and cultures, told Global News that he doesn’t see AI like ChatGPT becoming job replacers right away.  Story continues below advertisement



 Rather, he views them as tools that can be integrated into the workforce.“I see it getting integrated into particular processes or workflows and potentially allowing productivity to increase,” he said.“The idea is that it can kind of enhance what you’re doing and get rid of potentially some of the sort of rote work that slows people down.”For example, Ingram cited a friend who works as a copywriter who has been using generative AI as part of their job. She said it has helped her friend come up with ideas for content creation.If corporations do decide to use these tools in their work, they should be transparent and indicate to the user that AI was involved in the creation of that content, like ingredients on a food label, she explained.However, she questions as to why AI would be used to automate tools used for human expression, like writing.“In the work that I’ve done, in looking at things that get automated, we tend to automate things that we don’t like to do. I find it really curious that we are deciding to automate creating art and writing,” she said.  Story continues below advertisement



 “These are expressions of humanity that I think many people take pleasure in, and so I’m really wondering about that: Why do we want to automate those things in the first place?”

Businesses that develop these technologies need to think about the “social consequences” of their creations when they release them out into the public, Piper said.“This is a developing technology and we have to kind of learn about it, learn with it and study it as we develop policy,” he said.“One thing that’s frustrating as an educator is this thing has just been thrown out there in the world and we’re all running around cleaning up the mess. … Corporations that are developing this technology, applying this technology, really need to think through what the consequences are of the implementation that they’re thinking about.”  Story continues below advertisement

Artificial Intelligence Identifies Long-Overlooked Raphael Masterpiece
A facial recognition analysis found that the faces in a mysterious painting are virtually identical to those in the artist’s “Sistine Madonna”

                Researchers have been studying the 37-inch-long de Brécy Tondo for decades.
              de Brécy Trust



When he bought the painting in 1981, art collector George Lester Winward was sure he’d stumbled upon a genuine Raphael.
The mysterious, 37-inch-long work had no known artist. Looking into the faces of the Virgin Mary and Jesus, Winward noticed an uncanny resemblance to the two figures at the center of another painting: the Sistine Madonna, a 77-inch-long Renaissance masterpiece completed by Raphael around 1513.

Winward became convinced that the same artist was behind both works. But his view was in the minority. Experts thought the painting, now known as the de Brécy Tondo, was more likely a Victorian copy of the Sistine Madonna.
Shortly before his death in 1997, Winward set up the de Brécy Trust, donating his paintings to the organization to allow researchers to continue rooting out their secrets. Scholars have been studying the de Brécy Tondo ever since.
Now, after 40 years of speculation, researchers from the University of Nottingham and the University of Bradford, both in the United Kingdom, have made a breakthrough. Using facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence (A.I.), they have concluded that the painting is “highly likely to be a Raphael masterpiece.”
“Looking at the faces with the human eye shows an obvious similarity, but the computer can see far more deeply than we can, in thousands of dimensions, to pixel level,” says Hassan Ugail, an expert on visual computing at Bradford who developed the A.I. facial recognition system used in the study, in a statement.

The tool is an algorithm trained on millions of images, and Ugail has been working on it since 2002, reports Artnet’s Sarah Cascone. It can quantify how similar one face is to another by comparing features and recognizing patterns.
“These features may be the physical attributes (e.g., shapes, colors and textures of the face) but also include a lot (potentially thousands of features) which cannot be described visually or physically,” Ugail tells CBS News’ Caitlin O’Kane. “In this sense, the analysis carried out through these facial recognition systems can compare two facial images in much greater detail and can outperform humans.”
If two faces are more than 75 percent similar, Ugail considers them identical. In this case, the tool found that the two Madonnas were 97 percent similar, while the two versions of baby Jesus were 86 percent similar.
The de Brécy Tondo is, as the London Times’ Russell Jenkins wrote in 2013, “one of the most talked-about and scientifically tested Renaissance masterpieces.” The A.I. analysis is the latest in a series of discoveries made in the decades researchers have been studying the painting.
One of these finds came about when Howell Edwards, then an expert on molecular spectroscopy at Bradford, concluded that the work was likely a Renaissance painting, not a later copy. By analyzing paint pigments, he found evidence that the work contained certain colors and chemicals that were characteristic of Renaissance art—including massicot, a yellow pigment that wasn’t used after 1700.
Now, says Edwards in the statement, those findings have been “further vindicated by the facial recognition analysis.”
The researchers presented their analysis at the Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in December. Their work will be published in an academic journal later this month.

Quantum Memories uses publicly available quantum computing research data and algorithms from Google A.I. (Artificial intelligence) to explore the possibility of a parallel world by processing approximately 200 million images of nature and landscapes through artificial intelligence.
Anadol, 37, is a digital artist known for using A.I. to turn reams of data into abstract, spectral images, often on a large scale. To do this, it has partnered with companies like Microsoft, MIT, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
His work is also currently being exhibited at MoMA in NYC in an exclusive installation in the Gund Lobby.
The work Quantum Memories that is for sale is part of the Block Art Ventures – BAV (Instagram: @blockartventures) collection.
