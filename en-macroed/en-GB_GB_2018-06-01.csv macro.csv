A number of Google employees resigned and thousands of others signed a protest petition against taking part in the Pentagon project, known as Maven. They feared it was the first step towards using artificial intelligence for lethal purposes. There has been no official statement from Google. According to company sources, top executive Diane Greene told staff on Friday there would be no follow-up after the current contract expired next March.But Kate Conger, a journalist for the technology news website Gizmodo, told the BBC that Google had not cancelled Project Maven and did not appear to have ruled out future work with the military.The contract is reported to be worth less than $10m (£7.5m) to Google but could potentially lead to more extensive cooperation with the Pentagon.Meet Norman, the psychopathic AIProject Maven involves using machine learning and engineering talent to distinguish people and objects in drone videos.In April up to 4,000 Google employees signed an open letter saying that by its involvement in the project the internet giant was putting users' trust at risk, as well as ignoring its ""moral and ethical responsibility"".A report by Gizmodo said that senior leadership at the company was deeply conflicted about the effects of the partnership with the Pentagon.Internal emails suggested that executives saw the contract as a huge opportunity while being concerned about how the company's involvement would be perceived, Gizmodo said.Google staff challenge Pentagon projectMeet Norman, the psychopathic AIPentagon uses Google tech 'for its drones'Apple hires Google's head of searchAI must be 'for common good'",Google 'to end' Pentagon Artificial Intelligence project,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C53E/production/_101849405_diane_greene_getty.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence Labs Opened by Tencent
In 2016, Tencent opened an AI lab in Shenzhen with a vision to “Make AI Everywhere.” Its focus is on research in machine learning, speech recognition, natural language processing and computer vision and to develop practical AI applications for business in the areas of content, online games, social and cloud services. The AI team behind the scenes is composed of 50 research scientists and more than 200 engineers in China and the United States.
PROMOTED
Tencent’s YouTu Lab is a leader in the field of machine learning. It’s credited with dozens of leading technologies in image, face and audio analysis. The innovative output from the YouTu Lab is integrating AI technology into cloud services, intelligent hardware and more to improve the surfing experience of the internet.






Tencent has opened up a new lab in Bellevue, Wash. and Dr. Dong Yu, a former Microsoft employee who is well-known for his work with speech recognition technologies leads the lab. The lab leverages the talented Seattle-area workforce who are primarily focused on natural language processing and speech recognition systems. The company has the finances to compete for top AI talent and the data acquisition to help train AI algorithms.
Tencent’s Artificial Intelligence Priorities
As part of the quad of companies that were identified by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology to develop the next generation of AI technologies, Tencent is forging ahead with new tech investments, research and development.

Tencent is a top investor (reported to be $120 million) in robotics start-up UBTech, a firm that focuses on humanoid robots. Quite possibly UBTech’s most famous contribution is Walker, a bipedal robot unveiled at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show that can walk downstairs. Of the Chinese tech firms known collectively as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), Tencent participated in the greatest number of AI equity deals and made the most AI investments in the United States.
In partnership with several industry players including the Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC), Tencent is invested in developing AI technologies to be used in autonomous-driving vehicles.
Healthcare AI is a main priority for Tencent, based on the company’s investments and AI partnerships. China would like to be a world leader in personalized medicine using AI. More than 38,000 medical institutions have a WeChat account and 60% of those institutions allow patients to book appointments online. Additionally, there are 2,000 hospitals that accept WeChat payment. These services allow Tencent to collect valuable consumer data that helps train AI algorithms. In a recent partnership with Babylon Health, WeChat users will have access to a virtual healthcare assistant. Pushing the envelope even further, Tencent invested in iCarbonX, a company that aims to develop a digital representation of individuals to help perfect personalized medicine.
Tencent’s internal R&D efforts resulted in the development of the Miying healthcare AI platform that launched in 2017. This platform helps healthcare professionals diagnose various types of cancers and analyze and manage healthcare records. The company also has some recent investments in pharmaceutical projects.
Tencent is a critical player in China’s ambition to be a world-leader for artificial intelligence. Since AI is expected to transform all kinds of industries, we can also expect the footprint and AI investment by Tencent will only increase as well.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Many of the company’s top A.I. researchers, in particular, worried that the contract was the first step toward using the nascent technology in advanced weapons.But it is not unusual for Silicon Valley’s big companies to have deep military ties. And the internal dissent over Maven stands in contrast to Google’s biggest competitors for selling cloud-computing services — Amazon.com and Microsoft — which have aggressively pursued Pentagon contracts without pushback from their employees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle’s self-image is different — it once had a motto of “don’t be evil.” A number of its top technical talent said the internet company was betraying its idealistic principles, even as its business-minded officials worried that the protests would damage its chances to secure more business from the Defense Department.About 4,000 Google employees signed a petition demanding “a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.” A handful of employees also resigned in protest, while some were openly advocating the company to cancel the Maven contract.Months before it became public, senior Google officials were worried about how the Maven contract would be perceived inside and outside the company, The New York Times reported this week. By courting business with the Pentagon, they risked angering a number of the company’s highly regarded A.I. researchers, who had vowed that their work would not become militarized.Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, had reached out to tech companies and sought their support and cooperation as the Pentagon makes artificial intelligence a centerpiece of its weapons strategy. The decision made by Google on Friday is a setback to that outreach.But if Google drops out of some or all of the competition to sell the software that will guide future weaponry, the Pentagon is likely to find plenty of other companies happy to take the lucrative business. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Friday.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Greene’s comments were reported earlier by Gizmodo.The money for Google in the Project Maven contract was never large by the standards of a company with revenue of $110 billion last year — $9 million, one official told employees, or a possible $15 million over 18 months, according to an internal email.But some company officials saw it as an opening to much greater revenue down the road. In an email last September, a Google official in Washington told colleagues she expected Maven to grow into a $250 million-a-year project, and eventually it could have helped open the door to contracts worth far more; notably a multiyear, multibillion-dollar cloud computing project called JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.Whether Google’s Maven decision is a short-term reaction to employee protests and adverse news coverage or reflects a more sweeping strategy not to pursue military work is unclear. The question of whether a particular contract contributes to warfare does not always have a simple answer.When the Maven work came under fire inside Google, company officials asserted that it was not “offensive” in nature. But Maven is using the company’s artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones, and some drones rely on such analysis to identify human targets for lethal missile shots.Google management had told employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the use of artificial intelligence for defense and intelligence contracting. At Friday’s meeting, Ms. Greene said the company was expected to announce those guidelines next week.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle has already said that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice and whether it would affect Google’s pursuit of the JEDI contract.Defense Department officials are themselves wrestling with the complexity of their move into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Critics have questioned the proposal to give the entire JEDI contract, which could extend for 10 years, to a single vendor. This week, officials announced they were slowing the contracting process down.Dana White, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said this week that the JEDI contract had drawn “incredible interest” and more than 1,000 responses to a draft request for proposals. But she said officials wanted to take their time.”So, we are working on it, but it’s important that we don’t rush toward failure,” Ms. White said. “This is different for us. We have a lot more players in it. This is something different from some of our other acquisition programs because we do have a great deal of commercial interest.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Greene said the company probably would not have sought the Maven work if company officials had anticipated the criticism, according to notes on Ms. Greene’s remarks taken by a Google employee and shared with The Times.Another person who watched the meeting added that Ms. Greene said Maven had been “terrible for Google” and that the decision to pursue the contract was done when Google was more aggressively going after military work.Google does other, more innocuous business with the Pentagon, including military advertising on Google properties and Google’s ad platform, as well as providing web apps like email.Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who was openly critical of the Maven work, wrote on Twitter  that she was “incredibly happy about this decision, and have a deep respect for the many people who worked and risked to make it happen. Google should not be in the business of war.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEven though the internal protest has carried on for months, there was no indication that employee criticism of the deal was dying down.Earlier this week, one Google engineer — on the company’s internal message boards — proposed the idea of employees protesting Google Cloud’s conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco in July with a campaign called “Occupy Moscone Center,” fashioned after the Occupy Wall Street protests.That engineer resigned from the company this week in protest of Maven and planned for Friday to be his last day. But he said he was told on Friday morning to leave immediately, according to an email viewed by The Times.Peter W. Singer, who studies war and technology at New America, a Washington research group, said many of the tools the Pentagon was seeking were “neither inherently military nor inherently civilian.” He added, “This is not cannons and ballistic missiles.” The same software that speeds through video shot with armed drones can be used to study customers in fast-food restaurants or movements on a factory floor.Mr. Singer also said he thought Google employees who denounced Maven were somewhat naïve, because Google’s search engine and the video platform of its YouTube division have been used for years by warriors of many countries, as well as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.“They may want to act like they’re not in the business of war, but the business of war long ago came to them,” said Mr. Singer, author of a book examining such issues called “LikeWar,” scheduled for publication in the fall.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.

Artificial Intelligence Can Identify Wildlife as Accurately as Humans


Motion-sensor cameras are increasingly being used to track wildlife across the globe, from tigers in India to aardvarks in Africa. But combing through the millions of images captured by these systems is a time-consuming task. Now, scientists have discovered that artificial intelligence is as effective as human volunteers — and much faster — at identifying species in these largely untapped photo repositories.
  
In a new study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers, led by computer scientist Mohammad Sadegh Norouzzadeh at the University of Wyoming, tested whether a type of artificial intelligence called deep neural networks could correctly identify and count species, determine animals’ ages, and classify their behaviors. They analyzed AI’s capabilities using 3.2 million images from the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, which contains photos from 225 camera traps in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park since 2011.
While it takes thousands of citizen science volunteers two to three months to label a six-month batch of images from the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, it took the scientists’ AI system just a few hours. And it did it with 96.6 percent accuracy — the same as human volunteers. The system could save more than 17,000 hours of volunteer work, the scientists estimated.
“Automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collecting such data could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into ‘big data’ sciences,” the scientists write.

In April, it appointed Santanu Bhattacharya as its chief data scientist to leverage data science capabilities and analytics to understand customer needs and develop innovative products and services at Airtel. Bhattacharya is based out of Bangalore and reports to Harmeen Mehta, global chief information officer and head of digital at Bharti Airtel.“Recognizing patterns where large numbers are involved is the core of Artificial Intelligence. Reliance Jio could use it to figure out how best to run a network, deploy capacity, what to bundle, which services to target across regions, among others. Artificial intelligence can also help a telco better monetise usage of data on its pipe and strategise its content push,” a sector expert said requesting anonymity.In May, Reliance Jio launched ‘JioInteract’, an artificial intelligence-based platform for movie promotion and brand engagement.JioInteract can listen to user questions and respond. The platform also has an auto-learning feature that helps improve the answering accuracy, the company had then said, adding Reliance Jio is also tapping the developer ecosystem to create innovative applications like virtual showrooms, product demonstrations, ordering cart for e-commerce, etc."
