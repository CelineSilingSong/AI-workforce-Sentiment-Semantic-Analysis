Intelligent Automation: How can Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) work together in healthcare?



Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are very closely related, but they aren’t always the same. Automation is the process of outsourcing tasks to technology with the goal of reducing the need for human intervention.
For example, when a patient signs in for their doctor's appointment, an automated system can log them into the electronic medical record without requiring a human to manually enter their information. This is a simple automation process that doesn't necessarily involve ‘artificial intelligence’.
AI, on the other hand, is about making technology capable of performing increasingly human-like tasks. AI systems can learn from data to make intelligent decisions. For instance, with AI, we can now decipher ancient languages, a task that requires an incredible level of intelligence. But again, this doesn’t necessarily fit the definition of automation.
The real power lies in combining Automation and AI - known as Intelligent Automation (IA). This is all about leveraging increasingly capable technology to outsource increasingly complex tasks with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for human intervention. We’re still learning what is possible with Intelligent Automation, and the capabilities are growing by the day, but there are many risks we need to be careful of. The rest of this post explores what we’ve been learning about IA in the healthcare sector.
How could Intelligent Automation work in Healthcare?
We argue that Intelligent Automation has the potential to revolutionise healthcare in two main ways.
First, it expands the scope of what can be automated. Until now, traditional automation has been limited to highly logical processes - if data is entered here, send it there; if the data is this value, do this action. This type of automation is great for manual tasks like data entry, triggering template emails, or scheduling appointments, but not for anything that requires a more complex thought process.
With AI, we can start to automate even the most complex tasks. For example, diagnosing a medical condition based on a picture of cells is something that previously only a highly trained medical person could do. But with enough data, we can teach machines to do this too (and with potentially higher accuracy). A recent example showed how AI can diagnose critical newborn conditions faster and more efficiently than humans.
Second, Intelligent Automation makes technology increasingly adaptable to work around us, saving time and effort. With simple automation technology, a doctor might have to input very specific conditions or codes into a system to trigger an automated step to alert another department. Now, technology could, in theory, transcribe a patient meeting, intelligently understand the situation, and alert the department without the need for any additional steps from the doctor.
As AI develops, we will likely see increasingly complex Intelligent Automation workflows that incorporate both AI and standard automations. The goal is to take the heat off workers and make it easier to interact with technology, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
It’s not all sunshine and rainbows
While the potential of Intelligent Automation in healthcare is exciting, it's important to be aware of the risks and challenges that come with it.
Hallucinations: AI can get things wrong, and the impacts of incorrect decisions are amplified when downstream actions in a process depend on them. Instead of relying solely on AI, we should use 'human-in-the-loop' systems, where AI outputs are checked by humans before proceeding. This approach can still significantly reduce the time taken to carry out tasks while ensuring accuracy.
Bias: AI learns from historic data, and where there is historic data, there is often bias. If we're not careful, AI systems can perpetuate or even amplify these biases, leading to worse outcomes for certain individuals and marginalised groups. It's crucial that we actively work to identify and mitigate these biases when developing and deploying AI systems in healthcare.
Explainability: When errors occur, we should be able to understand why. However, AI systems are often 'black boxes', meaning it's difficult to interpret how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of explainability can be a major issue in healthcare, where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is often critical. Significant work is being done in this area, but we're not there yet.
Privacy and Security: AI systems require data, but where there is data, there need to be privacy and security considerations. This is especially important when it comes to sensitive health records. As we develop Intelligent Automation systems for healthcare, we need to put robust data protection measures in place and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
While these challenges are significant, they're not insurmountable. By being aware of these risks and actively working to address them, we can harness the power of Intelligent Automation in healthcare in a responsible and beneficial way.
What’s next?
The risks of Intelligent Automation in healthcare are significant, and we must proceed thoughtfully and responsibly. In the near future, we can expect experimentation and pilot projects with 'human-in-the-loop' systems. Widespread adoption will require addressing challenges like bias, explainability, privacy, and security, as well as collaboration between stakeholders. The journey is complex, but the potential for a more efficient, effective, and equitable healthcare system is worth pursuing.

Will Schmitt in AtlantaMarch 19 20241Print this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.Invesco is preparing to roll out generative artificial intelligence technology to cut rising compliance costs, but would not employ it to pick stocks anytime soon, says its chief executive.In his first interview as CEO of the $1.6tn Atlanta-based asset manager, Andrew Schlossberg said Invesco would also consider deals to boost its private credit offerings.Schlossberg, who replaced veteran chief executive Marty Flanagan last year, said the group had been investigating for more than a year how teams could use generative AI to work more efficiently.“If this can help them get 75 per cent of that job done, they can focus more of their energy and time on these growth areas and opportunities,” including getting reports out to clients more quickly, said Schlossberg, who was most recently Invesco’s head of the Americas. He said the asset manager’s analysts have been using some form of AI for years, but played down the idea that the company would use the technology in investment decisions such as stockpicking. The group would take its time before extending AI tools to investments and clients, he added, citing Invesco’s fiduciary obligations and its duty to care for people’s data.Schlossberg said: “As the quantitative team starts to employ better generative AI, it’ll help them make better decisions, but turning over the portfolios to gen AI is not something I see in the near-term future for Invesco.”He said he wanted to add alternative strategies to the mix for clients, along with new products to meet the demand among wealthy investors for more personalised portfolios. He identified the Chinese retirement market as an area for possible expansion, through Invesco’s joint venture with Great Wall Securities.The group is the fourth-largest US provider of exchange traded funds and is one of the 10 largest asset managers overall in the US. Invesco reported $10.2bn in net long-term inflows in 2023 — driven largely by passive investments — reversing course after $500mn in net outflows in 2022.Schlossberg said he aimed for the group to “recharge” its actively managed strategies — which suffered outflows of $29bn in 2023 and $28.3bn in 2022, per company results — while expanding its $90bn private real estate arm and its $40bn private credit business. He cited the latter as a potential target for dealmaking, but did not give details and added “we’re not going to try to do everything in private markets”.On private credit, Invesco has focused on bank loans and structured collateralised loan obligations with more recent expansions into distressed credit and direct lending. “I think those are places where we’ll continue to grow organically, and I may even look for some places to grow inorganically,” Schlossberg said. “And I think in that space, the demand and the opportunities are still quite high in private credit.”Within the asset management industry generally, “consolidation will happen and we’ve done a number of those deals historically”, Schlossberg said. “You don’t want to just be big to be big, but size does matter. Having scale and the ability to reinvest in the business and compete matters.”Schlossberg reiterated the group’s priority would be driving organic growth to strengthen its balance sheet and improve returns for shareholders. “But I think there’s going to be more (deals), especially in the private markets space,” he said, “and we’ll be paying attention.”Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

         — 
    


            About 10% of US workers are in jobs that face the greatest risk of disruption from rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, according to a White House analysis shared first with CNN.
    

            The report represents the most in-depth analysis to date by the White House on the impact of AI on the US workforce. It finds that workers with less education and lower income are especially exposed to AI, raising the risk that the technology could amplify inequality.
    

            The findings are part of the Council of Economic Advisers’ annual Economic Report of the President, which devotes an entire chapter to AI and how policymakers should respond.

            “If we were thinking about this in health terms we would be saying: Who is most likely to catch the virus and what can we do to vaccinate them?” Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN in an interview.
    

            The report shows how White House officials are thinking deeply about AI and what can be done now to guide its development in a way that ultimately benefits workers.
    

            “There have been developments in social media and technology that governments have underattended to as they evolved. We won’t let that happen with AI,” Bernstein said.
    

            Bernstein said the White House is in discussions with labor unions — especially in the service industry but also in manufacturing — about being ready for AI.
    

            As with any kind of new technology, experts believe AI will complement the work of some people by making them more productive. Other jobs could get wiped out.
    

            The White House report contains numerous caveats, including cautioning that the ultimate impact of AI on workers may change as the technology and its capabilities evolve.

            Generative AI is already able to do some tasks that in the past only humans could, such as writing humorous stories, generating realistic images and crafting song lyrics.
    

        20% of workers are in high-exposure AI jobs


            White House economists analyzed the impact on workers by identifying 16 work activities with high exposure to AI. Researchers then tried to determine which occupations have AI-exposed activities that are central to the job itself.
    

            The report found that about 20% of workers are in these high-AI exposure occupations. That finding is similar to one from Pew Research Center that concluded 19% of American workers in 2022 were in jobs most exposed to AI.
    

            “Workers in such occupations are plausibly the ones most likely to be affected by AI, whether positively through complementarity, or negatively through substitution or displacement,” the CEA report said.
    

            But to drill down on which roles are most vulnerable to being displaced, researchers broke out jobs by how difficult the tasks are.
    

            “Labor-substitution is easiest and cheapest in situations where complexity and difficulty are low,” the report said.
    

            In other words, the more complex the job, the safer it is. And vice versa.
    

        Displacing versus complementing workers


            The researchers found that 10% of workers have high AI exposure and low performance requirements.
    

            The report said those workers “perform the tasks that are most likely to change as a result of AI.” It did not identify specific occupations or industries that fall into this category.
    

            However, researchers stressed that this does not mean 10% of workers “will inevitably lose their jobs” as the implications for workers may be “quite nuanced.”
    

            “Most jobs remain a collection of tasks of which only a portion can be automated,” the report said. “AI may allow humans to focus on other tasks, fundamentally changing their jobs without reducing the use of their labor.”
    

            As an example, the White House economists point to how even if AI eventually allows school buses to drive themselves, the school bus driver’s job won’t necessarily be killed.
    

            “Children may still need someone on the bus to watch them, ensure they behave and ensure they enter and exit safely,” the report said. “AI-led automation might fundamentally change the school bus driver’s job, but it is unlikely to eliminate the job.”
    

            The report notes that airlines still have pilots even though autopilot systems have been around for more than a century.
    

            “The wrong place to start a discussion of AI is to assume without question it will massively displace workers. That’s not the history of technology in the workplace,” Bernstein said.
    

        AI could worsen inequality


            Still, some workers are more exposed to AI than others.
    

            The White House report found that 14% of high school graduates lacking four-year degrees have jobs that have high-AI exposure but low performance requirements. By comparison, only 6% of workers with a bachelor’s degree fall into that higher risk bucket.
    

            Likewise, women are more likely to have high AI exposure with low performance requirements, the report said, “suggesting that women may be at higher risk of displacement.”
    

            Lower-income workers may also face greater risks from AI disruption.
    

            The report found that nearly 40% of workers in the third decile of earnings have high-AI exposure and low performance requirements. High-earnings also have high exposure to AI but their job requirements are more complex.
    

            The findings “suggest that AI may be a skill-biased technology, increasing relative demand for workers with high levels of education in high-earning occupations,” the report said. “They also suggest that AI could exacerbate aggregate income inequality if it substitutes for employment in lower-wage jobs and complements higher-wage jobs.”
    

            The International Monetary Fund warned earlier this year that in most scenarios, AI will “likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions.”
    

            However, the White House report stressed that it’s too early to definitively say AI will worsen inequality — in part because this risk may influence policy.
    

            Bernstein said the Biden administration wants to implement policies that will lower the risk that AI displaces workers.
    

            “There is always technology afoot, but society has the level of inequality that policymakers are willing to accept,” he said. “We’re not going to let technological developments determine inequality.”

In fact, computer programs designed to simulate human intelligence have been around since the 1940s. From the early stages, we’ve dreamed of computers doing everyday human tasks, from filing taxes to writing poetry.
We’re seeing rapid innovation in AI technologies as they’ve finally become good enough to provide broad business and personal value. Today’s AI boom results from a string of 21st-century breakthroughs that culminated with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, the first publicly available AI content creation tool to survive the testing phase.Click here to start selling online now with Shopify
Tools like ChatGPT are unique for their ability to create high-quality written and visual responses, known as generative AI. Here’s what you need to know about generative AI technology—including what it is, how it works, and how business owners use it to increase efficiency, improve products and services, and reduce costs.
What is generative AI?
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) refers to any machine learning model you can use to create new content, including text, images, video, audio, or software code.
Generative AI models differ from non-generative (or “discriminative”) models in their ability to create unique content:


Discriminative models. Discriminative models are designed to distinguish between types of information. They spot patterns that separate data classes, enabling high-quality predictions or suggestions.



Generative models. Generative models are designed to produce new content by learning from a large existing dataset. For example, they spot patterns in written works to predict the most likely sequence of words that will generate a human-like response.

An AI tool that can write a unique blog post based on user inputs is an example of generative AI technology. By contrast, a tool that analyzes inventory and sales to predict future manufacturing needs is an example of a discriminatory AI tool.

How does generative AI work?
Generative AI systems work by processing large amounts of existing data and using that information to create new content. Essentially, developers create an algorithm, feed it human-generated content, and instruct it to identify patterns in thetraining data.The result is a collection of rules that express patterns consistent throughout human-generated content, and these rules guide the AI in creating new content.
Developers of generative AI models create these systems using a specific type of machine learning known as deep learning. Machine learning models capable of deep learing use particularly complex algorithms that extract high levels of information from source data.
Historically, AI trainers have relied on supervised learning techniques, which involve feeding a generative AI model large volumes of manually labeled data. One consequential breakthrough is the development of algorithms that can self-train using unlabeled data, a process known as unsupervised learning.
Unsupervised learning eliminates the need for developers to label their own data, allowing them to train tools on larger volumes of source information. As the size of training data sets increases, AI models become more accurate and capable.

Common applications for generative AI

Text generation
Image generation
Product discovery
Research and analysis
Customer service
Marketing personalization

Generative AI tools can support a range of business processes. Here are common applications:
1. Text generation
Many generative AI models support written content creation. AI writing tools like ChatGPT can generate content including emails, social media posts, press releases, video scripts, stories—and essentially any other type of written content reflected in its training data set.
Many can also generate code and synthetic data—artificially generated information that mimics real-world data but doesn’t directly come from actual events or measurements. Some tools also include transcription and speech generation functions.
2. Image generation
You can use generative AI to create visual content. Generative AI tools like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E use natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision technologies to recognize objects and generate realistic images from text or image inputs. They can also transform image styles and edit natural images—images derived from the real world, i.e., not created by algorithms or digital art techniques).
3. Product discovery
Generative AI tools can personalize the product discovery process using conversational search functions to provide intelligent recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors. Media companies like Netflix, for example, use generative AI to provide personalized content recommendations. 
4. Research and analysis
Generative AI tools can help you more efficiently conduct research. They can provide concise summaries of reports and extract and consolidate raw data from multiple sources. They can also efficiently process unstructured data, report on findings, and uncover relevant trends.
5. Customer service
Generative AI chatbots can support customer service functions, handling basic customer queries autonomously and escalating more complex cases to a customer service agent. Integrating generative AI into your customer service program can extend your team’s capacity and boost customer satisfaction.
6. Marketing personalization
Generative AI tools can help you personalize marketing efforts at scale. These tools gather and analyze large amounts of audience information and use the findings to personalize the content of the marketing messages as well as when and where they go out.

Benefits of generative AI

Increased efficiency
Improved accuracy
Reduced costs
Better intelligence

Using generative AI  can save you time and money without requiring a compromise on product or service quality. Here are four key benefits:
Increased efficiency
Generative AI tools produce work quickly. Use them to quickly complete tasks like producing creative content or conducting marketing research so you can focus on higher-level objectives. 
Improved accuracy
Use generative AI tools to reduce human error in quantitative processes like running payroll or analyzing data. Use them to find and fix mistakes in written content and identify discrepancies in large data sets like budgets or financial information. 
Reduced costs
Generative AI tools can extend your team’s capacity, letting you do more without increasing your payroll obligations. They can also analyze and optimize business processes, like inventory management and supply chain logistics, further decreasing business expenses. 
Better intelligence
Generative AI tools can process massive amounts of complex data from a wide range of sources, helping you increase the amount of data you can analyze and improve the quality of your analysis. 
Limitations and risks of generative AI

Inaccuracies
Poor transparency
Bias
Privacy concerns
Sustainability concerns

Here’s an overview of the challenges associated with implementing generative AI in a business context:
Inaccuracies
Generative AI tools can make mistakes. Failing to verify the accuracy and quality of AI information can pose a risk to your business. (ChatGPT even includes this disclaimer under its prompt bar: “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.”)
Poor transparency
Generative AI tools don’t always disclose how they’ve arrived at a specific answer, making it difficult to vet responses.
Bias
AI tools can reproduce the biases in their training data. For example, one early AI-powered recruiting system penalized female applicants after interpreting the underrepresentation of women in technical fields as evidence that women are less suited to technical work.
Privacy concerns
Information you provide to a generative AI tool isn’t necessarily confidential or secure, so using AI tools to process proprietary data can represent a security risk.
Sustainability concerns
AI tools require massive computing power, translating to significant energy usage that can conflict with your company’s sustainability goals.

Navigating the Future of Work: Perspectives on Automation, AI, and Economic Prosperity
By Erik Brynjolfsson | Adam Thierer | Daron Acemoglu

Key Points

Experts and the media tend to overestimate technology’s negative impact on employment. Case studies suggest that technology-induced unemployment fears are often exaggerated, evidenced by the McKinsey Global Institute reversing its AI forecasts and the growth in jobs predicted to be at high risk of automation.
Flexible work arrangements, technical recertification, and creative apprenticeship models offer real-time learning and adaptable skills development to prepare workers for future labor market and technological changes.
AI can potentially generate new employment opportunities, but the complex transition for workers displaced by automation—marked by the need for retraining and credentialing—indicates that the productivity benefits may not adequately compensate for job losses, particularly among low-skilled workers.
Instead of resorting to conflictual relationships, labor unions in the US must work with employers to support firm automation while simultaneously advocating for worker skill development, creating a competitive business enterprise built on strong worker representation similar to that found in Germany.

Introduction
The Workforce Futures Initiative is a research collaboration among the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution, and the Project on Workforce at Harvard Kennedy School’s Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy. The initiative aims to develop concise and actionable reviews of existing research for federal, state, and local policymakers. Since August 2021, the group has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss policy ideas, evaluate evidence, and identify priorities for new research on the future of work and the public workforce system.
In the first report, Beyond the Turing Test: Harnessing AI to Create Widely Shared Prosperity, Erik Brynjolfsson revises his view on AI, criticizing the Turing Test for equating human mimicry with intelligence and warning against economic consequences. He argues that true technological progress lies in augmenting—not replacing—human capabilities, historically increasing the value of labor. He criticizes the current trend of developing technology that substitutes for human labor, citing misaligned incentives among technologists, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. He advocates for innovation that complements human abilities, exemplified by companies like Cresta, which uses AI to assist, not replace, human operators. Brynjolfsson emphasizes the need for policy changes—such as equal taxation of capital and labor—to encourage such human-centered technology, arguing that the future of work depends on our choices regarding technology’s role in the labor market.
In the second report, We Can’t Predict the Future of Work, Adam Thierer explores the skepticism surrounding predictions about technology’s impact on employment. Highlighting the tendency for overly pessimistic forecasts, he challenges the accuracy of such predictions with historical data. As examples of this overestimation, Thierer cites the recalibration of AI-related job loss estimates and the unexpected growth in certain job sectors. His report emphasizes the complexity of predicting future jobs and skills, advocating for flexible, adaptive workforce development rather than rigid government programs to navigate the evolving technological landscape.
In the final report, Automation, AI, and Wages, Daron Acemoglu examines the debate on automation and AI’s impact on job creation and productivity. While some, such as The Economist and the McKinsey Global Institute, view AI as a driver of new jobs and growth, others express concerns about its potential to cause job loss and exacerbate inequality. Acemoglu argues that automation has not significantly increased productivity or jobs to offset losses. He highlights automation’s limited success in creating good jobs and the growing inequality in labor markets, partly attributed to automation. He scrutinizes AI’s role in the labor market, suggesting cautious adoption to avoid negative outcomes.

The following article was originally published by AI at Wharton.
When deployed correctly, generative artificial intelligence can help employees become more innovative, free them from mundane tasks, and improve their communication skills.
That’s the message from three scholars who shared their research during the “AI Horizons” webinar, “AI and the Workforce” which streamed live on February 16. The webinar series is hosted by AI at Wharton to showcase emerging knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence.
Each panelist presented research on a distinct aspect of labor, yet the overarching theme was clear: Rather than fearing AI as a threat to human capital, it can help employees bring their best selves to work.
For example, allowing AI to perform repetitive banal tasks boosts employee morale. A co-authored study by Xueming Luo, marketing professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, found that when chatbots and voice-assisted AI handled low-level customer service calls at a telemarketing company, the employees showed greater commitment and ingenuity with callers who had complex requests.

“They have a stronger interest and motivation. They feel much better, even their pride is higher. They have more energy because they have more mental power to think about creative solutions,” Luo said.
The study also found that highly-skilled workers feel more positively about AI because it can help them achieve more, whereas lower-skilled workers feel more negatively about being limited by AI-enabled scripts.
Luo said that difference is a key takeaway: employers need to communicate clearly to employees the intended use for AI.
“Lower-skilled workers always feel threatened that the company is rolling out technology that is going to lay them off,” he said. “The company should indicate that the technology can be used to help [employees perform better].”
A co-authored study from Cedric Xingchen Xu, doctoral researcher at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business, showed how the release of ChatGPT prompted a significant decline in the number of freelance jobs posted in an online marketplace. With competition intensifying, freelancers who are incorporating large language models (LLMs) into their services are reaping the benefits.
“Instead of viewing AI as a threat to human capital, employers, employees, and gig workers should consider leveraging AI to excel at work.”— Mary Purk
“They are getting more transactions over time compared with other people, so there’s clearly opportunity,” Xu said. In the paper, the co-authors recommended that gig platforms and policymakers provide resources to help freelancers adapt and thrive in the changing market.
Some job applicants are writing better resumés with the help of LLMs. A co-authored research study from Emma Wiles, doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that candidates who utilized “algorithmic writing help” on their resumés were hired 8% more often than those who did not.
Wiles said the curve will flatten as more and more job-seekers use such tools to polish their resumes, and interviews will become more critical to the hiring process in the future.
“As AI-enhanced or generated writing materials become more common, writing is likely to become an even less reliable signal of job performance,” she said.
Mary Purk, executive director of AI at Wharton and moderator of the discussion, said the research presented by the scholars demonstrates the deep impact AI will have on hiring, retention, productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction.
“Admittedly, AI is a disruptor in the marketplace. But instead of viewing AI as a threat to human capital, employers, employees, and gig workers should consider leveraging AI to excel at work. By delegating repetitive, boring tasks to AI, we can increase morale and energy and allow individuals to focus on tasks that truly showcase their capabilities.”

Job interview analysis platform Sapia launches generative AI chatbot to explain its hiring decisions

Sapia.ai founder and CEO Barb Hyman 







 



The next time you go for a job interview at Woolies or Qantas, you may end up with generative AI not only telling you how you did, but also offering advice on how to perform better next time.
Melbourne recruitment startup Sapia.ai has launched a generative AI model it’s called SAIGE to give candidate feedback. It uses the platform’s large language model (LLM) capabilities developed over six years, to evaluate candidates using a blind chat interview, then deliver comprehensive scoring along with a set of job-related competencies, including explanations for its assessments, with the ability coach candidates as to how they can improve, or say what it was looking for to give a higher score for a particular skill or trait.
Sapia, which launched in 2018 and raised $17 million in a Series A from Woolworths and Macquarie Capital in late 2022, has used artificial intelligence (AI) to build a hiring analysis data set from more than 3.5 million job interviews spanning 15 million answers and 2 billion words.
The platform combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to build a job candidate’s HEXACO (for Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience) personality profile, alongside analysing their role-based skills, behaviours, experience and more, also sharing those findings with the person involved.
Companies, including Woolworths, Qantas,  Suncorp, Starbucks Australia, Holland & Barrett, and BT Openreach, use Sapia as part of the initial screening process for recruitment.AdChoicesADVERTISING
Sapia.ai founder and CEO Barb Hyman said SAIGE has been trained through the use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to ensure candidates are assessed accurately, fairly, and in a way that mitigates human biases.
“We have been on a mission to humanise the way people are evaluated, and SAIGE is the next step in this journey. As much as ChatGPT was a revolution in the way we interact with AI, SAIGE is a quantum leap in the way people will be assessed and coached,” she said.
“Structured interviews have been proven to lead to better hiring outcomes and reduce bias in the selection process. Now with SAIGE organisations have a way to consistently interview and evaluate at scale using a rubric set by experts, and also generate detailed interview notes. What we are really excited about is the potential SAIGE has on providing coaching to hiring managers and new employees on setting them up for success.”
Sapia.ai chief data scientist of  Dr Buddhi Jayatilleke said that as well as detecting and assessing the skills and traits employers require for various roles, the platform can adapt over time and be trained to look for particular requirements for each role and organisation.
“A unique power of these LLMs is their ability to explain themselves,” he said.
“SAIGE is bringing this level of transparency that is imperative for the responsible use of AI and especially in people decisions, such as who to hire and promote, helping to reduce the unconscious bias we see in human-led decision making.”
Every job candidate receives an individual insights report detailing their strengths, their work style, and personalised coaching. Hyman said the low-pressure chat used by Sapia gives potential hires a chance to shine and the subsequent feedback means unsuccessful candidates feel seen.

(Markus Schreiber/AP) By  Eduardo PorterMarch 19, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EDTThere is good reason to believe that artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs. That’s, after all, what information technology has been doing for decades. The tech plutocrats apparently agree that human employment will become the stuff of folklore. They probably don’t mind that all wealth in this world will accrue to the lucky few who own the AI patents. They seem willing to share some of it with regular people through some universal basic income scheme.Sign up for Democracy, Refreshed, a newsletter series on how to renovate the republic.Artificial general intelligence, the end goal Silicon Valley technologists are striving for, is defined in the charter of OpenAI, the outfit that developed ChatGPT and DALL-E, as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” Elon Musk has concluded that “there will come a point where no job is needed.”But work as we know it doesn’t have to end this way. The sense of inevitability about our technological future stems from a misunderstanding of how technologies emerge and become embedded in the economy. The process is not driven by the laws of nature. It hinges on political decisions that can lead to vastly different outcomes. North Korea devoted its nuclear knowledge to weapons; Japan deployed it to produce electric power.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSo far, the march of computers into the workplace has furthered Musk’s vision. Automation powered by information technology has spread to take over every task that could be decomposed into a defined set of precise instructions, displacing swaths of blue-collar workers.AI could feasibly push automation even further. But it could also reshuffle opportunity in a different direction. As Daron Acemoglu, David Autor and Simon Johnson of MIT have pointed out, it could be deployed not to replace human workers but to augment them, enabling them to perform more complex tasks.Follow this authorEduardo Porter's opinionsFollowExamples of this alternative abound. For instance, research by economists at Stanford University and MIT found that a generative AI conversational assistant substantially increased the productivity of customer support agents (measured in cases resolved per hour) and improved consumer satisfaction. The gains were greatest among the most novice workers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn the other end of the wage spectrum, computer programmers have also been found to benefit from AI help. In an experiment by researchers at Microsoft, GitHub and MIT, coders who used the AI tool GitHub Copilot completed programming tasks 56 percent faster.It’s hard to understate how much human enhancement via AI tools could reshape society. The vast inequalities in income and opportunity that automation has given us so far could be significantly reduced.Computers didn’t just automate routine, blue-collar work. By vastly expanding access to information, computers plugged into the internet empowered the expert white-collar workers who could profitably use it. Doctors, programmers, lawyers — broadly, workers with college degrees — reaped the rewards, leaving behind a host of less-educated workers whose jobs have progressively been taken over by the machines.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAI could narrow the opportunity gap by helping lower-ranked workers take on decision-making tasks currently reserved for the dominant credentialed elites.Consider how old-school IT tools such as electronic medical records have allowed nurse practitioners to make more complex decisions encroaching on doctors’ turf — much to the chagrin of the American Medical Association. Generative AI could take this further, allowing nurses and medical technicians to diagnose, prescribe courses of treatment and channel patients to specialized care.As Autor put it, “AI, if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization.”Story continues below advertisementCan the deployment of artificial intelligence be nudged in this direction? It would require a different approach to technology, both by policymakers and the corporate class. “The human-complementary approach is not likely to prevail based on current investments and corporate attitudes,” Acemoglu, Autor and Johnson say.AdvertisementCorporate managers today itch to bring in the robots, even when the machines often don’t do much to improve productivity. Perhaps it’s because they don’t agitate to join unions? In any event, policy could rejigger corporate incentives. Changing the tax code, which vastly favors capital investment over hiring new workers, would level the playing field and temper incentives to automate.Acemoglu, Autor and Johnson argue for giving unions a voice on how to deploy the new technologies in the workforce. Regulations could stop companies from deploying untested AI in tasks like hiring or surveillance — areas where technology already is degrading and devaluing work. Incentives could be provided to change the research agenda, which today is acutely focused on automation, to explore complementary uses of AI instead.Story continues below advertisementThis requires a conceptual challenge: a paradigm of technological development that has long focused on replacing human capabilities must cede its place to a mind-set concentrated on how to expand human potential.The stakes are high. As Stanford’s Erik Brynjolfsson wrote, AI could well generate enormous wealth and vastly enhance our understanding of the world. But if technology continues to replace people, the end game includes a working class of no economic or political power, unable to improve its lot, left to live off whatever universal basic income the Silicon Valley plutocrats are willing to provide.Share148 CommentsPopular opinions articlesHAND CURATEDOpinion|Harris has not been a great politician.

Davy Levy, vice president of AWS worldwide public sector, delivers the keynote at the Brussels Public Sector Symposium on 12 March.

On 12 March, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Sector Symposium Brussels returned to the Brussels Expo in Belgium. The no cost, in-person conference gathered cloud enthusiasts interested in the public sector for a day dedicated to deepening knowledge of how the cloud and generative artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming organizations and businesses around the world.
Central to the event were the themes of generative AI, sustainability, security, and—importantly for Europe—digital sovereignty.
Yaara Tam, head of multinational organizations, and Barbara Baeyens, head of Benelux, announced the launch of new AWS learning plans for civil servants, specifically designed for European Union (EU) government agencies to help government employees build cloud skills and accelerate digital transformation.
In his keynote, Dave Levy, vice president of AWS worldwide public sector, said, “We’re here today because of our commitment to the region, serving you with the solutions and technology you need to improve the lives of your citizens, students, customers, and constituents.” Levy highlighted how AWS is helping customers use generative AI in a responsible and flexible way, providing more options to enable digital sovereignty through the upcoming AWS European Sovereign Cloud, and showing dedication to data protection and privacy, sustainability, and social impact. Customer speakers from bpostgroup and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shared stories about how they use the cloud to drive impact for their missions.
Read this post for more key takeaways from the Brussels Symposium.
Building a strong data foundation
Secure, reliable, and scalable cloud infrastructure helps public sector organizations to innovate quickly while meeting strict security and compliance requirements. AWS enables customers to get the most value from data by providing a comprehensive set of integrated tools and robust governance capabilities that balance access and control. Customers such as Belgian broadcaster RTBF use AWS data services like Amazon Redshift and AWS Glue to power personalized content recommendations for millions of customers across its media platforms.
Wendy Joos, chief data officer of bpostgroup, spoke of the value of data and her company’s digital journey. “We wanted a platform that allowed us to do more with our data,” said Joos, who explained how bpostgroup is using data models to ensure timely delivery, and digital twins to preempt problems, such as in sorting centers, and with distribution rounds.
Generative AI opportunities and challenges
Generative AI allows anyone to leverage machine learning (ML) capabilities using natural language. When users can search, analyze, and draw conclusions in seconds—from information across their organization or the internet—they can make informed decisions at speed. This can help answer customer queries efficiently, pinpoint changes to contracts, and accurately assess risks such as fraud. A newly commissioned AWS European study, Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Workforce for Jobs of the Future, focuses on organizations rapidly adopting generative AI. This research found that almost 90 percent of employees expect to benefit from generative AI in the workplace by 2028.
AWS provides the most comprehensive set of capabilities across the three layers of the generative AI stack. The bottom layer is the infrastructure required to train and run large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs). The middle layer is where you build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models. At the top layer live the applications that leverage LLMs and other FMs so that employees can utilize generative AI at work.
At the bottom layer of the generative AI stack, it is vital to have high quality, up-to-date data for training the models. A critical step to achieving this is moving data to the cloud. The Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) worked with us to build their models. They launched Falcon LLMs, three foundational large language models, to facilitate research in healthcare, finance, education, and more.
The middle layer lets you build and scale applications using leading FMs like Anthropic’s Claude 3. Customers choose the best model for their use case, while maintaining enterprise-grade security, privacy, and access control. AWS enables government agencies and regulated industries to experiment and innovate in a secure, compliant manner.
Swindon Borough Council, a UK local authority, uses Amazon Bedrock to make government information more accessible to the learning disability community. They created a solution that makes complex documents more accessible, enabling a community where no one is disadvantaged.
And at the top of the generative AI stack is Amazon Q, for organizations who want an assistant to enhance productivity and decision-making. “When you chat with Q, it provides immediate, relevant, and actionable information and advice to help streamline tasks, speed decision-making, and help spark creativity,” said Dominic Delmolino, vice president of technology for AWS worldwide public sector, who presented a demo during Levy’s keynote. 
Responsible AI mitigating the risks
Organizations that use generative AI must build responsible AI systems that are fair, explainable, robust, secure, transparent, and safeguard privacy. Good governance is fundamental for responsible systems. It’s important to be able to justify how these process-support systems arrived at choices. AWS is committed to responsible AI development and deployment, and welcomes the overarching goal of the EU’s AI Act to ensure trust in AI products and services. We recently launched Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock (Preview), which helps customers implement responsible AI policies when building generative AI applications. AWS is focused on collaborating with regulators and the industry to support the safe, secure, and ethical advancement of AI technology.
Digital sovereignty without compromise
Globally, 82 percent of organizations are using, planning to use, or considering sovereign cloud solutions in the next two years, according to marketing intelligence firm IDC. 
AWS has always been sovereign-by-design. We committed to expanding our capabilities to allow customers to meet their digital sovereignty needs, without compromising on the performance, innovation, security, or scale of the AWS Cloud. The upcoming AWS European Sovereign Cloud will allow government agencies, regulated industries, and the independent software vendors (ISVs) that support them, to store sensitive data and run critical workloads on AWS infrastructure that is operated and supported by AWS employees located in and residents of the EU. It will be separate from, and independent of, the eight existing AWS Regions already open in Europe, and will give additional options for deployment, while providing the AWS services, APIs, and tools that customers are already familiar with. The design will help customers meet their data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs.
Sustainability in the cloud
There is increased recognition that sustainability cannot be a siloed approach within an organization. With government-mandated climate action targets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting requirements, and demands from consumers on the environmental and social impact of goods and services, sustainability should be intrinsically linked with each organization’s value proposition.
AWS offers capabilities to help customers innovate while reducing costs and carbon emissions. Amazon has a goal to reach net-zero by 2040 and is on a path to match all of our global electricity use, including AWS data centers, with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025 – five years ahead of our original 2030 target. Since 2020, we are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable in Europe and worldwide. AWS is on track to be water positive by 2030 through water replenishment projects, with a current rate of 3.9 billion liters returned to communities annually.
AWS is working with WindEurope to simplify renewable energy project permitting through an online portal called EasyPermits. In the Denmark pilot case, EasyPermits reportedly enabled concurrent processing of up to three times as many permit applications through transparency and information management, as well as a 50 percent reduction in administrative workload.
Conclusion
Throughout the day, the event provided opportunities for conversations between members of the innovative and creative public sector community. And as Francesca Duri, chief technology officer of WIPO said, “The true value of good technology unveils beyond the expected benefits.”

Apple’s work on advanced artificial intelligence integrations in its products is continuing to pick up pace, with a newly published paper from its research teams revealing the iPhone maker’s work on MM1, a suite of Multimodal Large Language Models.The paper, titled ‘MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training’ discusses “building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),” and how “pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results.”It’s a pretty jargon-filled paper, but at its essence, it describes how Multimodal Large Language Models can produce more advanced and accurate workflows for AI applications by pulling from multiple datasets at once — not just text, but imagery too, as well as potentially audio and video sources.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksBarefoot VitalityThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot VitalityBuy NowMM1 is able to interpret information across 30 billion parameters, and as a result, can

“achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks.” The researchers call MLLM “the next frontier in foundation models”, with “superior capabilities” to the large language models that have fuelled the breakthrough wave of AI tools in recent months and years.LATEST VIDEOS FROM imoreIMoreApple’s AI ambitionsHowever, MM1 remains behind closed doors for now, and there’s no guarantee it’ll ever morph into a consumer-facing product, even if the lessons learned from it find their way into other applications of AI.At present, we know that Apple is doubling down on its AI plans, following shareholder pressure that may have inadvertently led to the cancellation of its driverless Apple car project. In response to shareholder unrest, CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple will “break new ground” in AI, unlocking “transformative opportunities” for users.Its efforts so far focus on a $1 billion research and development push for a large language model named Ajax, with the company also purchasing a Canadian artificial intelligence startup called DarwinAI.Master your iPhone in minutesiMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.

Generative AI holds great promise, but must be applied safely, with strong guardrails; PDRI will share results with the industry in peer-reviewed journals

ARLINGTON, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–PDRI by Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), a workforce assessment provider that transforms evidence-based insights into talent management solutions, today announced it will be leading a new research program to explore the applications of generative AI in the development and use of assessments. PDRI will use the findings to enhance its assessment solutions and will release the results to educate industry stakeholders on best practices for the use of generative AI in assessment.

“Generative AI shows great promise to improve assessment development, quality and fairness but it’s a young, powerful technology that contains many unknowns,” said Elaine Pulakos, PhD, CEO at PDRI. “The use of generative AI in assessment needs to be based on rigorous scientific research and adhere to professional and legal standards for the development and use of assessments. We are undertaking this research program to help the industry leverage generative AI to advance our profession, but without compromising the long legacy of scientific and professional rigor that PDRI is known for.”






PDRI’s research will explore how generative AI can be used to elevate the quality and streamline the development of assessment content, improve assessment scoring methods, and diminish the potential for bias and unfairness in assessment processes. Another aspect of PDRI’s research program will investigate advanced security techniques, some of which may be powered by generative AI, to protect test content, reduce the potential for cheating (including generative AI-based cheating), and identify security vulnerabilities.

Most HR professionals believe they will fall behind if they don’t adopt AI solutions within the next 12 to 24 months, according to Gartner. But there’s also a lot of concern about incurring unknown risks and security vulnerabilities. Poor use of AI in hiring has hurt the reputations of employers, impaired their ability to attract talent, violated legal and professional guidelines, and unfairly shut out qualified candidates from jobs in which they could excel.
- A message from our partner -

PDRI believes there is significant promise and opportunity to overcome challenges associated with AI. Through new research that applies psychological and psychometric theory to the use of generative AI in assessment development and use, PDRI will help create evidence-based methods the industry can adopt to ensure organizations are implementing and adhering to the highest standards of psychological testing. This commitment aims to guide the ways in which AI is used in selection processes within the established frameworks of professional and ethical testing guidelines.

PDRI Principal Scientist Dr. Dan Segall will lead the research program. Segall is a well-regarded, expert psychometrician who previously led one of the world’s largest and most scientifically advanced employment testing programs in the U.S. Department of Defense.

Charted: The Jobs Most Impacted by AI

Large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI tools haven’t been around for very long, but they’re expected to have far-reaching impacts on the way people do their jobs. With this in mind, researchers have already begun studying the potential impacts of this transformative technology.
In this graphic, we’ve visualized the results of a World Economic Forum report, which estimated how different job departments will be exposed to AI disruption.

Data and Methodology
To identify the job departments most impacted by AI, researchers assessed over 19,000 occupational tasks (e.g. reading documents) to determine if they relied on language. If a task was deemed language-based, it was then determined how much human involvement was needed to complete that task.
With this analysis, researchers were then able to estimate how AI would impact different occupational groups.

Print        For the thousands of tech workers recently laid off in California and across the country, the future may not be as bleak as it looks right now: Many are likely to retrain fairly quickly for new jobs in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.The massive rounds of layoffs at tech giants and many smaller companies were largely the result of stricter investor demands — what managers saw as over-hiring during the pandemic and a stock market that rewarded those personnel cuts. But the industry also was clearing the way to focus on AI, which is expected to revolutionize computer-related technology and work in the years ahead — even as it displaces  jobs, previously handled by humans,  in areas as varied  as coding and background acting. Not only  is AI taking over more standard computer programming once done entirely by humans, it  is also starting to spur waves of new applications — and with them, jobs, both tech and non-tech, in a wide range of industries, including in Southern California.      “A lot of tech companies are actually monetizing the AI solution,” says Jenn Longnion, founder of See & Free Consulting.  (Michael Owen Baker / For The Times)   “What we’re seeing is a lot of tech companies are actually monetizing the AI solution,” said Jenn Longnion, the Los Angeles-based founder of See & Free Consulting, which helps businesses grow sustainably. “They’ve had AI for a very long time. But they’re finding ways now to monetize that and actually promote that and sell that as a solution to other businesses. ... Every industry is now having those conversations.”Job postings in the U.S. that specifically mention   AI, though still a tiny fraction of all openings, were up by 13% in February from a year ago, even as software development was off more than 30%, according to the employment website Indeed. Silicon Valley, where most of the AI action is today, figures to lead the way. In February, 9% of companies in the Bay Area said they already use AI, compared with a little more than  5% in the U.S. as a whole, according to the Census Bureau. The share of Los Angeles-area companies wasn’t significantly higher than the national average, but about 8% of firms in the Southland said they expected to adopt AI in the next six months. In Silicon Beach, which has emerged as a home for companies focusing on AI and augmented reality, firms are hiring for hundreds of AI-related jobs, including  content writers and software developers who will train the technology.Tom Case, a founder at Atticus Growth Partners, a tech recruiting firm in San Francisco, said the proliferation of AI entrepreneurs and startups translates into more jobs. In the last few years, companies have been hiring primarily for research labs, he said, but the industry is beginning to move from AI models to getting them into production.“We’re in an almost gold rush where everybody’s building an AI company model,” he said. “Very little AI is deployed in production. ... At the moment, it feels like the dawn of job creation.” Advertisement    After pivoting her startup from business operations software to customer service ticketing through AI,  Sophie Wyne saw interest skyrocket.“I actually have never seen this amount of interest before for a product,” said Wyne, founder and chief executive of Ariglad in San Francisco. “It’s really just combining two things which people are really caring about. One is AI — I think everyone’s really interested in how can that actually help my day-to-day in reality and not be so abstract. And the other side is, I just hate updating my knowledge base.”Among the hundreds of AI startups looking for talent is Quest Labs, a Bay Area firm co-founded by Debparna Pratiher. The 27-year-old previously worked as a product manager at Nvidia, the highly publicized Silicon Valley supplier of chips used in gaming and other high-performance computing, particularly AI.Pratiher is an alumnus of UC Davis and Carnegie Mellon University. Her firm, with seed money from Techstars and Afore Capital,  has a staff of about 20. The business has been moving quickly  to build data sets for ecommerce as Google has started to phase out third-party cookies, which  track and learn what users are doing online. “If cookies are gone, you’re blind to consumers,” Pratiher said.She said she’s had difficulty finding qualified data scientists and other AI engineers with deep experience in machine  learning. “For all the AI hype and interest, buyers need to adopt the technology, and for that, they need better data,” Pratiher said.

Some skills, such as learning  programming languages and databases to build AI models, might take a matter of weeks for IT workers.        Business   Quiet quitting. RTO. Coffee badging.

Shakil Kamran was in retail management before taking classes through online learning platform Trailhead and pivoting to a tech job. (Shakil Kamran)   He took courses through Trailhead, San Francisco-based Salesforce’s online learning platform, increased his skills and began seeing AI as the future. Today, Kamran, 37, is a Salesforce consultant and focuses on helping organizations use AI to help their business grow. “AI is going to help us. It’s going to assist us in growing and becoming more effective and efficient,” said Kamran, who lives in Connecticut. “It’s going to supercharge our lives.”Others are following Kamran’s lead. Trailhead expanded its AI curriculum last year to include 43  “badges” that are earned by completing courses. So far, users have tallied more than 1.1 million  badges, said Ann Weeby, senior vice president of Trailhead.“We’re seeing employees from every level, in every type of business ... jump in and start learning, because they want to apply generative AI to their business yesterday,” Weeby said.

More than 28,000 job cuts by tech firms nationwide were announced in the first two months of this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and research firm. Only a few hundred of those layoffs were explicitly attributed to AI, but thousands more cuts in tech and other industries were said to be the result of “updating or incorporating new technology,” Challenger said.  It noted that some of that may be companies overhauling budgets and staffing to make room for  AI work.Although AI may not be directly responsible for most of the tech sector’s job cuts, companies are realizing that greater utilization of AI could mean they don’t have to rehire for some positions, or that they can transition parts of those jobs over to the new technology, said Longnion of See & Free Consulting.Background actors expressed  fears during last summer’s strike that AI technology would be used to replace their jobs. Their new contract secured  rules to guard against that. Data from  Layoffs.fyi show that a growing number of layoffs have hit software developers, also known as coders, who — after decades of disrupting other industries and other workers’ jobs with their programs —  find themselves victims. Advertisement    In recent months, hundreds of coders and other IT specialists have been let go by tech giants  Google, Meta and Apple, as well as many smaller industry-focused digital platforms and cloud services, including Toast (restaurants), Flexport (logistics) and Block (financial services).Many of the  layoffs have come in the Bay Area, putting a pause to two decades of growth at California’s computer-systems design firms and related services. Most of the cuts probably reflect a pullback after excessive pandemic-driven hiring, due in part  to ecommerce and remote work.But the correction may be ending soon, as new tech jobs come into view and workers adjust.Ayanna Howard, a robotics expert and dean of the engineering college at Ohio State University, said it wasn’t  long ago  that coding was all the rage, and people were flocking to computer boot camps.  She remembers how hard it once was for people to create a website. Now, with AI tools,  you can build one within minutes by simply putting in blocks of information, she noted.AI can also do coding on back-end servers, the side  responsible for storing and organizing data, including  security.But Howard said not all is lost for even low-level coders. “If you’re trained to learn, you can evolve,” she said, just as those who began by using Pascal and BASIC learned to program in Assembly and Python,  used for many machine learning and AI solutions.      Alissa Marr, a product designer, was laid off in February but plans to up her business and problem-solving skills to get a new job that isn’t as affected by AI. (Sean Hayes)   Others are emphasizing the inimitable human touch that AI could never replace.  Since Alissa Marr was laid off last month from an early-stage AI startup, the product designer has mostly focused on building her business acumen and strategic problem-solving ability rather than just retooling her software skills.“Those kinds of things are not something an AI can do,” said Marr, 39, who lives in Providence, R.I. “You need to have a human with expertise and knowledge about the customer and the business problem. There needs to be someone pulling the strings, because it can’t just be automated by AI and just go out as is.”  AI may ultimately lead to a smaller tech workforce, said Howard of Ohio State. But there will also be AI-augmented jobs, as well as new jobs. One position  in high demand is prompt engineer, who designs prompts and other processes to get optimal performance from generative AI tools, whether text or images.A company buying AI conversational programs such as ChatGPT (from OpenAI) or Gemini (from Google) will still need engineers to refine and customize the tools to replicate human-like dialogue suitable for its customers.

An open backyard is like a blank canvas.But for some prospective home gardeners, it can be intimidating to know where to start.As artificial intelligence becomes ubiquitous, even matters of nature aren’t off-limits from this technology’s power. Some developers have created AI garden planners to help gardeners decide what, and how, to plant.


AdChoicesADVERTISINGBut how well do they work?To find out, we put two AI garden planners to the test, and then asked LNP | LancasterOnline’s Master Gardener columnist Lois Miklas to review them. Here’s what the planners suggested, and what Miklas liked (and didn’t like) about each option.READ: Full coverage of Progress 2024 [roundup]THE BASIC OPTION: CHATGPTDescription: This is the AI you’ve likely heard of, whether from your grandkids talking about having a conversation with a robot online, or from funny folks on Twitter giving outlandish prompts for screenplays. It’s also free, hence its popularity. We gave ChatGPT this prompt: “Plan a small garden for a beginner in Hardiness Zone 7a,” the hardiness zone that encompasses most of Lancaster County. It replied with an answer instantly.ChatGPT suggested 14 different specific varieties of plants and their benefits. It suggested placing taller plants at the back and shorter ones toward the front; grouping plants with similar water and sunlight requirements; and watering consistently. It also suggested adding a small decorative element, like a garden gnome.

A MASTER GARDENER’S OPINIONWhat it got right: I like the fact that this plan suggested a variety of plants: vegetables, perennials, herbs and shrubs. It gave the gardener a lot to choose from and suggested plants that are commonly available and easy to research. It included botanical names for the perennials, eliminating the confusion that can be caused by looking up a plant by its common name. Its suggestion to consult a gardening book or an online resource for garden planning is essential, considering that this plan is so open-ended. I experimented further, and when ChatGPT was asked for garden planning books and website recommendations, it returned a fairly useful list.What still needs work: I was amused by the plot that ChatGPT proposed for the beginning gardener, an 8-by-8-foot, mostly sunny space. Who has a perfectly square garden space ready to plant? (Well, perhaps if you rent space in a community garden.) I would have started by suggesting that the gardener measure the space that they want to plant, observe the amount of sunlight it gets and conduct a soil test. At this time, it seems beyond ChatGPT to include links to each recommended plant so that one could see a photo and read about height and spacing requirements and common problems.Final ruling: One could not really act on ChatGPT’s garden plan, given the fact that it is so vague. To receive any useful garden planning advice from ChatGPT, I suggest being as specific as possible with your prompt, perhaps even asking for suggestions for a specific type of garden. Be cautious: When experimenting, I noticed that ChatGPT readily recommended plants that are on Pennsylvania’s invasive plant list unless it was specifically asked for native plants.READ: AI a growing tool for those interested in buying, selling, investing in real estate




THE ADVANCED OPTION: AIGARDENPLANNER.COMDescription: For those looking for more involved direction, AIGardenPlanner claims to offer “detailed, personalized plans and professional advice tailored to your garden’s unique conditions.” Unlike ChatGPT, which asked no questions, AIGardenPlanner asked for lots of specifics, including gardening experience, budget, and if the gardener has any allergies. It also required specific measurements for raised garden beds, ground space and soil type. With Miklas’s input, we asked the software to create a planner for a 36-by-72-inch raised bed with loam soil type and a 48-by-120-inch ground space with primarily clay soil.The prompt costs $4.99, and a link is emailed to the user after purchase, which the site estimates to take 30 minutes. We did not receive the link promptly, but a customer service representative was friendly and helped to properly deliver it.Not only did it list plant recommendations, but expanded on specific varieties’ compatibility with other plants, when to prune, which pests they are susceptible to and more.

A MASTER GARDENER’S OPINIONWhat it got right: AIGardenPlanner returned a recommendation of five plants for each bed. A drop-down menu and sidebar included more information for each, such as why the plant was recommended, how to plant, growth habits, spacing, fertilizer, pruning, pest management and maintenance tips. The information was concisely presented with a photo of the plant and appealing graphics.What still needs work: I did not expect AIGardenPlanner to recommend almost the same slate of plants for each bed: basil, lettuce, marigolds and cherry tomatoes, with the addition of sunflowers for the raised bed and zinnias substituted for sunflowers in the long, narrow, in-ground bed. Though LNP stated its gardening goal as “food, beauty, wildlife,” the planner leaned heavily toward edibles. Surprisingly, it estimated the monetary value of each vegetable or flower when harvested, something that home gardeners are not usually concerned with. It also included a few sentences on each plant’s compatibility with other plants. I felt that much of this information was based on popular lore about companion plants, not science, and was unhelpful and misleading.Final ruling: AIGardenPlanner asked for quite a few details from the user, which is itself useful in getting the gardener to think through their goals and garden situation. A beginner could probably use the information from AIGardenPlanner to start a garden, but with a little tweaking from its designers, it could be much more useful by recommending specific varieties of each plant or suggesting a succession garden plan. For example, lettuce is a spring and fall crop that could be planted before or after some of the other plants on the list, but this was not mentioned. Finally, I was surprised by the lack of recommendations for perennials or shrubs, which are often the backbone of an in-ground garden. It would be interesting to experiment with this planner by listing wildlife or beauty as the first of the list of goals to see how the recommendations might change.READ: Free TroutSpotter app uses AI to spot trends in coldwater fish populationsA MASTER GARDENER’S CONCLUSIONAI garden planning still has a lot to learn, but with so much information available, I would not be surprised if this quickly becomes a powerful tool for gardeners, especially beginners. For now, being as specific as possible with prompts is probably the best way to make this technology useful.
