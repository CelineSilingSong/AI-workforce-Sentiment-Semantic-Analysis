AI market
The artificial intelligence market is growing, especially with the pandemic and multiple changes to business models as a result.
Companies worldwide have leaned into AI to assist with automation, workforce management, and their digital transformation efforts. 
The AI software market reached approximately $62.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a staggering rate, reaching $997.8 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. 
More on this topic: Artificial Intelligence Market
Primary job markets
AI development is still in its infancy, and many of the most pioneering and lucrative positions are in more traditional tech hubs. Some of the top job markets for AI positions right now include the San Francisco Bay Area, Austin, New York City, and Denver.
A growing number of companies are offering remote work opportunities to their technical staff, but some are hesitant to extend that flexibility for AI and machine learning (ML) roles in particular. Given the complex nature of AI development and management, many employers are not yet comfortable with the idea of AI teams working away from on-premises resources.
AI job types
These are the three most common roles for AI professionals, according to LinkedIn’s “Jobs on the Rise” report for 2021:

Machine learning researcher: The primary thinkers and developers who use data to build machine learning models. 
Machine learning engineer: They act as the developer and operational support for researchers after ML models have been initiated. Some common tasks for engineers include managing data lakes, computational clusters, and containers for continued ML optimization.
Artificial intelligence specialist: They are often researchers who have specialized in a specific industry, business model, or use case. AI specialists work closely with other staff members in a business to figure out how AI can improve anything, from HR actions to customer relationship management (CRM) to security monitoring.

There’s also a growing demand for candidates who can demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding of AI in other roles. 
In areas like operations, marketing, and sales, AI is frequently being implemented to automate tasks. It’s important that candidates in tech-facing roles not only develop an understanding of AI tools, but also enhance their other skills that AI cannot perform as well as a human.
More on AI automation in jobs: Artificial Intelligence and Automation
Education for AI positions
Artificial intelligence and machine learning specialists typically hold a bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in a relevant tech field. 
Some of the most common fields of study include computer science, engineering, mathematics, data science, physics, and information technology.
However, AI and ML candidates are unlikely to be hired unless they have applied knowledge in the field. Many hiring managers expect these candidates to sharpen their specialized skills in different programming languages, data management and database systems, and platform-specific AI models. Some of the top skills that employers are looking for include C++, Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) knowledge, according to LinkedIn’s “Jobs on the Rise” report.
AI job openings
Over 55,000 jobs are currently listed under “artificial intelligence” on LinkedIn. 
Some common AI-related job titles across listings include the following:

Project manager for AI/ML
Artificial intelligence engineer
Data scientist for ethical AI
AI and data science tech consultant
AI/ML architect
Artificial intelligence research associate
AI research intern
AIOps/MLOps engineer
AI annotation analyst

Big tech companies hire more artificial intelligence and machine learning specialists than any other industry. But a growing number of companies in sectors like manufacturing, customer service, and communications are hiring in this area as well. 
Some of the most notable companies that are currently hiring in this field include:

Facebook
Verizon

Conclusions
Practical applications of artificial intelligence have reached every industry around the world, and as a result, many companies are investing in AI development and staff. 
AI equity, also known as self-serve AI or AI democratization, is growing at a rapid rate as well, working to make it possible for the layperson to understand and operate AI technologies.
But regardless of how far AI equity advances in the coming years, companies will continue to need artificial intelligence specialists who understand the logic behind AI — and how to push past boundaries toward new AI use cases.

How AI Is Transforming The Future of Digital MarketingAdobe Stock

This is true across every industry and business function, and particularly true in marketing, where leveraging AI to put products and services in front of potential customers has been standard practice for some time, even though we may not always realize it!

In business today, the term AI is used to describe software that is capable of learning and getting better at doing its job without input from humans. This means that while we’ve become used to using machines to help us with the heavy lifting, now they can start to help us with jobs that require thinking and decision-making, too.

PROMOTED
A huge number of questions that would previously have needed human intervention to answer – such as “will this person be interested in my products?” or “what results will I get from this advertising campaign?” can now be answered by machines – if they are given the right data. And because machines can answer questions far more quickly than humans, they can easily chain together complex strings of queries to come up with predictions, such as who is most likely to buy your products and where the best places to advertise might be.

That’s the basic principle behind all business AI today – automating the processes of learning and decision-making in order to create knowledge (usually referred to as “insight”) that helps to improve performance. And marketing is one area where it’s certainly been put to good use!

Targeted marketing
The high-level use case for AI in marketing is that it improves ROI by making your marketing – often one of a company’s biggest expenses – more efficient. In the old days, before online advertising, businesses would pay huge amounts of money for TV, radio, or newspaper adverts, in the full knowledge that only a small number of the people who saw their ads would ever become customers. This was tremendously inefficient, but companies didn't have any choice if they wanted to position themselves as market leaders.

In the online age, we’ve developed the ability to learn a great deal about who is or isn’t interested in our products and services. The first breakthroughs came thanks to the likes of Amazon with their recommendation engine technology and Google and Facebook with their targeted advertising platforms. Today, each of those platforms has been augmented with machine learning technology that allows them to become increasingly effective as they are fed more data on customers and their buying habits.

AI-driven content marketing
The rise in social media marketing and our growing appetite for online content has made content-based marketing the dominant form of marketing in many industries. AI lends a hand here by helping us work out what type of content our customers and potential customers are interested in and what the most efficient ways are to distribute our content to them. Advertising creatives have always strived to find formulas for creating adverts that will get people talking and sharing the message with their friends. Now, this can be done automatically using any number of AI-powered tools. For example, headline generation algorithms that monitor how successful they are and tweak their output to achieve better metrics, such as the open rate of emails, or the share rate of social media posts.
Taking this a step further, AI is developing the ability to take care of the entire content generation process itself, creating copy and images that it knows are likely to be well-received by its audience. A huge buzzword in this space will be personalization – where individual customers are served content that’s specifically tweaked to them, perhaps using information and reference points that the AI knows are relevant to them, intertwined with the overall marketing messages.
AI will also increasingly be useful for identifying what stage of the buying process a customer is at. If it detects that they are “shopping around” – comparing products and services that are available - it can serve content designed to differentiate your product or service from those of competitors. If it detects that they are ready to make a purchase, it can target them with promotions urging them to “act now” to take advantage of a limited-time offer.
A digital marketing agency called 123 Internet has embraced the ongoing industry developments by utilizing various AI-based technologies to improve service delivery. Scott Jones, CEO said:
“We’ve been using AI tools for a while now, in particular automatically checking website designs in hundreds of screen and browser types, this speeds up our design and development process”.
Their team also use an AI generated website audit which can be downloaded from their website and runs without human interaction.
Identifying micro-influencers
Influencers are another huge trend in marketing right now, and AI algorithms are already in use to make sure the personalities that are most likely to appeal to you are appearing in your search results and social feeds.
Increasingly, advertisers will also use AI to identify smaller influencers that are most likely to gel with their brands and audiences. This has led to the emergence of “micro-influencers” – typically everyday people, rather than celebrities, who have a specialist knowledge they’ve used to build a niche audience that cares about their opinion. AI enables companies to find the micro-influencers with the right audiences for them, across a large number of niches and audience segments. AI helps establish when it makes sense to pay 100 people $1,000 each to talk about their product, rather than pay $100,000 to Justin Bieber or a Kardashian. Once again, here it is about creating efficiency by following the data, rather than simply doing what a marketer thinks or feels is the best plan.  
AI in CRM
Customer relationship management is an essential function for any marketer to master, as existing customers are often the most important source of a company’s revenue. Here, AI can be used to reduce the risk of customer “churn” – by identifying patterns of behavior that are likely to lead to customers heading elsewhere. These customers can then be automatically targeted with personalized promotions or incentives to hopefully restore their loyalty. AI-augmented marketers are also increasingly turning to chatbot technology – powered by natural language processing. This can segment incoming customer inquiries, meaning those who require a quick response can be urgently catered to, to minimize dissatisfaction. AI-driven CRM will also allow businesses to more accurately forecast sales across all the markets where a company operates, meaning stock and resources can be more efficiently distributed. Additionally, it can be used to maintain the quality of data in the CRM system, identifying customer records where errors or duplicates are likely to exist.
The future of the marketer
If you work in marketing, you would be forgiven for worrying that we’re heading for a future where humans in your role will be redundant. You can take heart, though, from current predictions that state AI will end up creating more jobs than it destroys. It’s inevitable that your job will change, though. Marketers will spend less time on technical tasks such as forecasting or segmenting customers and more time on creative and strategic tasks. Those who are competent at working with technology, and identifying new technological solutions as they become available, will be hugely valuable to their companies and are likely to have a bright future!

Around the world and particularly in the Global South, many eke out a living through ‘microwork’: tiny tasks that power existing and future technologies, from Google’s search engine to self-driving vehicles and facial-recognition software. This work is done remotely, from homes, internet cafes, even refugee camps and prisons. Workers tend to be those excluded or expelled from standard wage labour – the incarcerated, the long-term sick, and those on the sharpest edges of global inequalities and conflict. Platforms like Clickworker and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk host the tasks and act as intermediaries between contractors – including tech giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft – and workers, taking a cut from every transaction. The work is precarious and low paid, often as little as a few cents for ten minutes of work. It comes with negligible legal protections. Microworkers often work for upwards of 20 to 30 contractors per day, engaging in disparate tasks from tagging images to urban areas to posting images of their body parts. The tasks themselves are often disconnected from whatever the contractors are trying to achieve overall, and workers often have no idea about what they’re contributing to. This might mean refugees working on facial-recognition software deployed by ICE or on military technologies used in conflicts they have fled. Huck spoke to Jones about this new hidden digital abode of production and what it means for the future of work. Let’s start with the basics. What are the new technologies that form the background to the kind of work you talk about in Work Without the Worker?The kind of artificial intelligence that has become dominant over the last decade is machine learning, which is a method, a way of achieving intelligent technologies. Machine learning relies on being fed lots of specific data by people. One of the promises that is continually made by Silicon Valley is that in our automated future, we’re going to get rid of monotonous low-skill work and no-one will need to do that anymore. But in actuality, an autonomous vehicle, for example, can’t learn to drive simply by absorbing lots of unprocessed data about traffic loads and urban areas. It relies on a lot of workers to process and label that data. Or a facial recognition algorithm, for instance, relies on lots of face tagging tasks: so workers basically clicking on images of faces with labels like “nose” or “eyes” or telling the technology the specific emotions that are being portrayed on the face. Another example would be Google search, which relies on a vast army of workers to rank search results. The promise that work is somehow going to magically disappear is nonsense. Until we can create a general form of artificial intelligence, which can generalise intelligence across multiple contexts – and there’s no evidence that that will ever actually happen – then we’re going to need workers. How does microwork differ from other forms of work? In some respects, microwork is really a continuation of much longer trends in capitalism – it continues a globalised outsourcing model that has been central since the 1970s. Most of the work is done in the Global South and it looks a lot like other kinds of precarious and informal work in those countries. The sociologist, Jan Breman, has lots of really interesting things to say about informal economies in the South. He writes about what he calls “wage hunters and gatherers” in cities in like Mumbai, and Kinshasa, who, over the course of a day will do a disorienting number of jobs: hawking, petty goods, selling tissues on trains, doing bits of litter picking, just generally trying to find bits of income to survive. And more often than not, their days are spent hunting for tasks rather than actually doing paid work. In my book, I’m arguing that microwork is a digital adjunct to this form of work.The conditions are bad due to there being an oversupply of workers, not only in the countries where these platforms tend to operate, but also on the platforms themselves. The platforms will invite more workers to be on there than there are tasks available. So, there’s this continued downward pressure on wages and conditions, because there’s always another worker who can take your place.One problem you point to is that there are significant barriers to organising workers in these atomised workplaces in which workers never encounter each other and are spatially dispersed. Despite this, you argue about the potential for actions by such workers. Can you talk more about the barriers they face to organising and the tactics available to them? Microworkers find themselves in an odd position where they have a lot of potential power but it is very difficult to realise that power. A general strike across multiple microwork platforms could cause chaos: social-media feeds being suddenly swamped with traumatic and pornographic content; Google’s search functions no longer operating properly; influencers complaining because their videos were not being ranked properly. The recent outages of social media platforms – Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram – revealed something that we already suspected, which is just how dependent many of us are on social media for our communication and our sense of wellbeing (often a highly dubious and ugly form of  wellbeing). It showed that microworkers, in particular, and content moderators in countries like the Philippines, have the potential to cause all kinds of problems to these sites. But it’s really hard to organise the kind of action that would have this kind of impact because workers work remotely and they’re often existing in contexts where labour organisation is very difficult or illegal: refugee camps, prisons. Then, of course, there is the nature of the platforms themselves, which make it very difficult for microworkers to organise because they’re set up to privilege the interests of contractors. There’s basically no way for workers to communicate which means they rely on external forums, mainly Reddit threads. One strategy that I look at in the book is data sabotage, wherein workers from a number of platforms would agree to sabotage tasks at the same time, and for an extended period, like the Luddites in the 19th century. On online platforms, this wouldn’t involve smashing machines, but rather preventing the circulation of data that powers big tech companies. This strategy is quite problematic because it could lead to some workers being kicked off the platforms, or receiving low ratings for work (which ultimately would lead to them being kicked off the platforms). This is a serious disincentive to collective action. Your book gives such a clear sense of multiple crises of work: a diminished availability of full-time, secure and fulfilling work; the pandemic’s ‘great resignations’ and popular reassessments of the place of work in human life; workers being exposed to significant risk and the blurring of home and work life.  How do you see these trends developing in relation to online platform work?We’ve seen that microwork has grown over the pandemic, partly because microwork can be done from home. If you have a long-term illness or disability, you don’t have to go into a warehouse or a factory or an office. I’d also wager that microwork has grown because many have lost their jobs throughout the pandemic. Microwork was also the harbinger of the changes we saw over the pandemic. The level of surveillance, for instance, that many home workers have experienced, is a central feature of microwork. The increasing role of data extraction as well, which many of us have been exposed to by using Zoom and Teams – that’s always been central to microwork. Microwork might be seen as an experimental space, where new kinds of expropriation and capitalist management were being trialled long before the pandemic. The pandemic, then, operated as almost a bit of a shock doctrine for big tech, bringing in these methods and techniques, which have been tested out on work platforms and the gig economy, on a far broader scale. It does seem like a lot of the negative features of these kinds of platforms are now starting to be generalised to more workplaces.Where do consumers fit into this? It seems like we’re all producing data for free for companies all the time. What does this mean for power in the new digital economy and does it point to the need to democratise digital infrastructure? Democratising digital infrastructure is a really interesting idea. The fact that platforms are only profitable due to personal data I would say shows that in reality, we, as users of the sites, are key stakeholders in these businesses. But we have no say in how the sites operate, how they turn profits, how they treat their workers. Our social lives are at the whims of these eccentric billionaires. The pandemic consolidated just how central to our social existence these platforms are because we were using them more and more because we couldn’t go outside. And this consolidation and integration into our lives has been to such a degree that I would say there’s no longer a good argument for not treating them as public utilities. Is microwork the future of work? How can we fight for a better and more secure future?I think the growth of microwork is inevitable as things stand unless big tech is brought to heel. So in this sense, it is the future of work. But only one future. I think other futures are possible. The one I want to see is one where we work less. Where work is distributed more evenly, where workers have more say over the kinds of jobs they do and the purpose of their work. This will involve workers organising through institutions like unions, and workers movements will need to intersect with other kinds of movements, in particular the climate movement, which in the last five years has gone from strength to strength. Interview has been edited for length and clarity.Phil Jones’s Work Without the Worker is out now on Verso Books. Amelia Horgan’s Lost in Work is out now on Pluto Press.Enjoyed this article? Like Huck on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram. Latest on HuckPhotography17.07.2024In photos: the dogs of DogtownA new photobook documents Venice Beach’s four legged friends and their colourful cast of owners.Written by: Isaac MukActivism16.07.2024Inside the battle to stop coalAs the legal challenge against Britain’s first deep coal mine in 30 years reaches the High court, we talk to activists at the centre of the fight to stop it.Written by: Ben SmokeOutdoors15.07.2024In Photos: the highs and lows of the Euro 2024 finalFootball did not come home, but across London fans from all backgrounds came together to dream that it could.Written by: Ossi PiispanenPhotography12.07.2024A Vibrant Portrait of Afropunk in South African Townships TodayKarabo Mooki lifts the lid on Soweto’s countercultural scene, which offers a much-needed antidote to the systemic racism that endures in South Africa.Written by: Miss RosenCulture11.07.2024Dide is providing a voice for elite footballers and young people everywhereNo one knows who he is, not even his teammates, but the Premier League’s masked rapper blends cold flow and drill-informed beats to interrogate the world around him.Written by: Isaac MukPhotography09.07.2024On the Road with the Free Photographic Omnibus around 1970s BritainPhotographer Daniel Meadows took off around the UK in an old bus to capture a unique portrait of a changing nation.Written by: Miss RosenThis article has been taggedBooksActivismWork",https://www.huckmag.com/article/the-hidden-exploitation-powering-artificial-intelligence,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://tco.mutualcp.com/transforms/Huck/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none_ns/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-11.35.25.png?mtime=1679926066'}",{'@id': 'https://www.tcolondon.com#identity'},{'@id': '#creator'},The hidden exploitation powering artificial intelligence – and how to resist it,2021-10-19T00:00:00+01:00,2023-12-07T14:32:09+00:00,,The hidden exploitation powering artificial intelligence – and how to resist it,,{'@id': 'https://www.tcolondon.com#identity'},2021,{'@id': '#creator'},2023-03-27T15:07:46+01:00,en-gb,https://www.huckmag.com/article/the-hidden-exploitation-powering-artificial-intelligence,,,,,,

Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeFacebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen wrote in blog post Sunday that the prevalence of hate speech on the platform had dropped by 50 percent over the past three years, and that “a narrative that the technology we use to fight hate speech is inadequate and that we deliberately misrepresent our progress” was false. “We don’t want to see hate on our platform, nor do our users or advertisers, and we are transparent about our work to remove it,” Rosen wrote. “What these documents demonstrate is that our integrity work is a multi-year journey. While we will never be perfect, our teams continually work to develop our systems, identify issues and build solutions.”The post appeared to be in response to a Sunday article in the Wall Street Journal, which said the Facebook employees tasked with keeping offensive content off the platform don’t believe the company is able to reliably screen for it. The WSJ report states that internal documents show that two years ago, Facebook reduced the time that human reviewers focused on hate speech complaints, and made other adjustments that reduced the number of complaints. That in turn helped create the appearance that Facebook’s artificial intelligence had been more successful in enforcing the company’s rules than it actually was, according to the WSJ.A team of Facebook employees found in March that the company’s automated systems were removing posts which generated between 3 and 5 percent of the views of hate speech on the social platform, and less than 1 percent of all content that was in violation of its rules against violence and incitement, the WSJ reported.But Rosen argued that focusing on content removals alone was “the wrong way to look at how we fight hate speech.” He says the technology to remove hate speech is just one method Facebook uses to fight it. “We need to be confident that something is hate speech before we remove it,” Rosen said. Instead, he said, the company believes focusing on the prevalence of hate speech people actually see on the platform and how it reduces it using various tools is a more important measure. He claimed that for every 10,000 views of a piece of content on Facebook, there were five views of hate speech. “Prevalence tells us what violating content people see because we missed it,” Rosen wrote. “It’s how we most objectively evaluate our progress, as it provides the most complete picture.”But the internal documents obtained by the WSJ showed some significant pieces of content were able to evade Facebook’s detection, including videos of car crashes that showed people with graphic injuries, and violent threats against trans children. The WSJ has produced a series of reports about Facebook based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. She testified before Congress that the company was aware of the negative impact its Instagram platform could have on teenagers. Facebook has disputed the reporting based on the internal documents.

Late last month, people across the globe gathered online for the second Annual Artificial Intelligence for Information Accessibility Conference (AI4IA), organised by UNESCO. Fittingly for an AI conference, it was hosted on the Gather.Town platform, which allows for virtual customisable spaces to be built, mimicking physical conference spaces where attendees dip in and out of pre-recorded sessions held in “pavilions” by speakers from around the world. They could also create an online avatar and “chat” to people nearby. Imagine a video game, but one that’s an industry conference where the highest level is the chance to attend an interactive “live salon”.
Such advanced technology is usually the preserve of China or Japan or South Korea, but at AI4IA, India was a visible presence. Abhishek Singh, CEO of the Indian government’s National E-Governance Division and MyGov.in, told the conference that India was well positioned to take a leading role in AI in the future, saying that India could become the “garage of AI tech in the world”, and that the country is one of the “largest AI startup nations, building AI-based solutions for the world”.
The claims are ambitious. Certainly, India has a large population of IT-trained professionals, and a tech-savvy population. But just how poised is it to take a leading role in our robot-ruled future?
India is positioned high on global charts tracking AI industry development and technology adoption.
Rather well, it appears. India has had a national AI strategy in place for three years, and the sector is attracting record amounts of government funding. As a result, there has been a sharp increase in the number of AI patent applications: according to the tech industry trade body Nasscom, in the past five years, more than 4,000 such patents have been filed. In the previous five years, from 2011–2016, just 1,000 patents were filed. India is positioned high on global charts tracking AI industry development and technology adoption, and the private sector has already shown enthusiasm for the benefits of leaning in to the vast new possibilities that AI brings. India’s AI market is expected to reach $US7.8 billion by 2025.
In 2018, the Indian government released its National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence under the mandate of the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), a particularly forward-looking and strangely efficient government department. The strategy is laudably wide-ranging and responsive to India’s needs, focusing on economic growth and the technology needs to increase social inclusion as well as promote issues including privacy and ethics. The overarching goal is “making India the global leader in AI, ensuring responsible and transformational AI for all”. But there is heft behind the hubris: as of 2020, the sector’s funding is set at US$949 million. It’s not inconsequential, particularly compared to the United Kingdom, whose budget is US$1.3 billion – not much more, considering it’s a developed country with far higher labour and infrastructure costs.

The strategy aims to develop the AI industry in India through grants, support to startups, development of products and solutions, and working with industry. The country already has a thriving AI research industry, with work being done on data analytics and language processing, much of it driven by top-tier universities, such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), which also receive funding from global tech giants. 
India also has a thriving startup scene, and the majority of venture capital investments are now flowing towards AI-based initiatives, such as chatbots and other conversational interfaces, diagnostic screening and databases for banking and healthcare consumers. The majority of the patents being filed are in the electronics and healthcare industries.
India has taken the lead in developing a number of bilateral agreements specifically geared towards the industry.
This year’s Artificial Intelligence Index, released by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HAI), noted India’s relative prominence. Its Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which ranks each country according to research output, economy and inclusion, listed India as sixth in the world, ahead of Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. And in HAI’s 2021 annual report, India is highlighted for its various industry advancements. India is second only to Brazil in the growth in AI industry hiring, based on 2020 numbers, and topped the list for AI skills penetration – people with AI skills being hired in various industries. India also has the highest global gender parity when it comes to skills penetration rates – notable in an industry where, as a whole, women remain a minority according to a recent UNESCO report. India comes in at number eight for private investment funding of each country’s AI sector, although it is still a fraction of the leading country, the United States. Meanwhile, India has taken the lead in developing a number of bilateral agreements specifically geared towards the industry.
However, there are some shortcomings and warning signs. One is privacy. Even though the national strategy highlights the need for privacy, specific policies are not yet in place. Startups, too, need a policy framework, as well as more financial support and mentorship to develop innovations and take them to market. The patent process is longwinded, taking around four years from start to finish, and needs streamlining.
And while the success in developing India’s AI industry in such a short time should be applauded, there is one overwhelming question looming over the entire industry: for a country that so desperately needs more jobs for its ever-growing workforce, is automation and the rise of robots really the best way forward?

Tumours in breasts with dense tissue are more difficult to detect. Artificial intelligence can simplify the job, a new study shows.
The new study is based on screening using an MRI. But women with dense breast tissue who are covered by the Norwegian mammography programme are not offered this type of screening.

A woman's breasts are usually mostly fat, along with mammary glands.But some women have breasts with much more glandular tissue than others. The glandular tissue is generally called dense breast tissue. Women with this kind of breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer.It is also more difficult to detect cancerous growths in this kind of tissue using conventional mammography.Fewer helping hands in the futureMRI scans provide more detailed images than conventional mammography. At the same time, it takes a lot of time for radiologists to go through MRI images to assess them for tumours.

Now, researchers at a university hospital in the Netherlands have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can do some of this work.“We know that there will be fewer hands available per patient in the health care system in the future, which makes it important to find methods that enable us to solve our tasks with fewer resources,” Solveig Roth Hoff wrote in an email to sciencenorway.no.Hoff is a section chief physician at Ålesund Hospital and studies imaging techniques that can detect breast cancer at the hospital and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU.











The development of artificial intelligence in imaging is an important focus area, says Solveig Roth Hoff.

Pick out breasts without tumoursMore than 4,500 women participated in the Dutch MRI study. All had extremely dense breast tissue.The task for the artificial intelligence was to pick out breasts without tumours.The idea is that AI will save doctors from having to look through thousands of images of healthy breasts. That leaves them more time to concentrate on women who may have cancer.A good startArtificial intelligence, which is basically a computer program, identified 40 per cent of the healthy breasts.And none of the breasts that actually contained cancerous tumours were misclassified by the program.“The results were better than expected,” said Erik Verburg at University Medical Center Utrecht in a press release. Verburg is one of the researchers behind the new study.“Forty per cent is a good start. At the same time, we still have sixty per cent to improve,” Verburg said.Practiced on images from seven hospitalsThe intelligent computer program was set up so that it could practice with some MRI images. It had to try to use what it had learned to assess the rest.

The study included MRI images from eight hospitals.The artificial intelligence practiced recognizing normal breasts in images from seven of the hospitals.The computer program relied on the assessment of the images that doctors had made. After the artificial intelligence had trained itself, it tested itself on images from the eighth hospital.Then the whole procedure was repeated seven more times, so that each hospital was used to test the program.No MRI for dense breast tissue in NorwayBut even though this approach is a common way to create computer programs that can teach themselves, it’s not a given that it will work as well with other MRI images.“It is important that artificial intelligence programs be properly tested and validated before they are available for commercial use. This kind of program has to be tested on several different types of data sets from different hospitals, machines and populations,” Hoff said.In Norway, however, it is not common for women with dense breast tissue to be referred for an MRI examination.Applies to only five per centNataliia Moshina has investigated whether Norway’s mammography programme should be changed so that women with dense breast tissue receive more follow-up.One change could involve offering these women more frequent mammography screening or offered other kinds of screening, such as MRI.Moshina concluded in her doctoral dissertation in 2017 that it’s too early for Norway to make this change.First, doctors need a better method to figure out which women actually have dense breast tissue, she said.Her research indicates that only five per cent of women who are screened in Norway have breasts with dense tissue.Could have been useful for another groupSome women in Norway are already being offered MRI screening for breast cancer. These women generally have congenital genetic problems that give them a much higher than average risk of breast cancer.“This is not such a very large population, but a (AI) program that could enable us to use fewer resources on this patient group would be useful, of course,” Hoff said.At the same time, it is not certain that the Dutch computer program would have worked on breasts from this group.To know if this screening approach would work for women with a predisposition to breast cancer, researchers would have had to test the program on these women in their study, Hoff said.ReferenceErik Verburg et al.: Deep Learning for Automated Triaging of 4581 Breast MRI Examinations from the DENSE Trial, Radiology 10/2021

Dr. Pierre Baldi, a UCI distinguished professor of the School of Information and Computer Sciences, describes the evolving field of deep learning in his new book “Deep Learning in Science.” 
Baldi begins his book by establishing its main idea: intelligence. While many may have trouble understanding the meaning of intelligence, taking a broader approach towards the subject allows for a clearer distinction between how it is defined and applied to both brains and machines. Following this section, Baldi introduces carbon-based and silicon-based computing, systems in mechanical devices made up of carbon and silicon material. Deep learning, which is the ability to analyze data that mimics the functions of the human brain, has a long and developed history, which Baldi also briefly covers. He then goes on to explain the significant connection between deep learning and neuroscience. 
While focusing on these developmental factors of deep learning, Baldi encourages readers to reassess their conceptions of deep learning by asking scientific questions. Baldi provides a guide of exercises throughout his book so that readers can more easily absorb basic concepts. Through the rest of the book, Baldi applies such principles to physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. 
As a researcher at UCI’s Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, Baldi focuses his work on AI and machine learning. He is driven by his interest in understanding both natural and artificial. When asked about his research work in these fields, Baldi stated that much of his new book focuses on the work he has already done at UCI.
The New University had the chance to sit down with Baldi and discuss “Deep Learning in Science.” The discussion ranged from the definition of deep learning to his own research on the subject.
New University: At the beginning of this book, you pose the following research goal: “to understand intelligence in brains and machines.” Does this mean that a distinction of intelligence can be formed between both, in which they may be compared or contrasted? 
Baldi: “It is not a simple question because we don’t truly know what intelligence is. It is not something very well-defined. We are only at the beginning of understanding intelligence in many ways, so we don’t know how many different types of intelligence there are. It is very possible that there are different forms of achieving intelligence. The way in which it is achieved, like in computers, may have similarities and also differences from the way in which biology achieves intelligence in the human brain. As a researcher, one of the questions I ask myself every day is, ‘should I try to copy the brain and what we know about it, or should I go in a completely different direction?’ This is a recurrent theme for those of us who do research in this area.” 
New University: A fundamental part of this work is taking a dive into the concept of deep learning. What exactly is deep learning, for those who may not know?
Baldi: “Deep learning is a rebranding of what used to be called neurometrics. We can use either term. It is the same thing. Neurometrics are networks of very simple model neurons that we use when we do all kinds of experiments, simulations and learning. We want machines and computers to learn from data, so we use these neurometrics that are inspired by our brains. There are networks of small neurons that are connected by synaptic weights, which represent the strength of the connection between any two neurons. Learning, in this way, is the process of tweaking these weights. We change the weights so that the neurons communicate in different ways and are able to implement different functions.” 
New University: You discuss applications of deep learning in areas of the natural sciences. What were some of the most interesting findings in relation to these applications? 
Baldi: “I use it in the natural sciences. However, what is a little surprising for someone who doesn’t know the field is that deep learning can be applied so broadly. I work with physicists, chemists, biologists and medical doctors. I am not an expert of all of these disciplines, but how is it possible to work with all of these professionals? The best analogy I can give you is that deep learning is like linear regression: drawing lines with many points. If you can do linear regression, you can apply those techniques into any area since it does not matter. I can work with experts in a specific field and help understand and analyze the data they acquire. We have made many discoveries. One example [of] using these techniques is improving how we use particle colliders in high energy physics. Protons collide at a very high speed, resulting in a shower of the rise of particles. Complex detectors detect these signals, and you want to make sense of the signals to detect if a particular particle was reduced in the collision. Deep learning can be applied to these problems, showing that we can improve the accuracy of this detection by a very significant percentage. It is now used everywhere.”
New University: How do these findings connect to your own research for UCI’s Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems? 
Baldi: “To be quite honest, most of the book comes from my own research. The first part of the book is about the mathematical aspect of deep learning, where I present some of the results I have contributed and the results others also have. I try to give an overview. The chapters of application, to a larger extent, showcase applications that were done in my research group. I had to make a choice and decided to focus primarily on the things I knew best.”
New University: Finally, what are some current or upcoming projects you can share?
Baldi: “My research is divided into theory and application. On the application side, I am currently working with chemists to use deep learning to predict chemical reactions. We are working our way towards being able to apply this to atmospheric chemistry, for example, in order to assess problems like global warming. On the theory side, I work on that myself, but do so with mathematicians at UCI to understand why deep learning works so well. I am working to understand how we move forward to build systems that are more intelligent than the ones we have today.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken on many new shapes and use cases as experts learn more about what’s possible with big data and smart algorithms. 
Today’s AI market, then, consists of a mixture of tried-and-true smart technologies with new optimizations and advanced AI that is slowly transforming the way we do work and live daily life. 
Read on to learn about some artificial intelligence trends that are making experts most excited for the future of AI:
5 Trends to Watch in AI Solutions

Intelligent and hyper-automated business processes
Emphasis on responsible AI development
AI as a tool for global good
AI and IoT working together
The emergence of decision intelligence

More on the AI market: Artificial Intelligence Market
1. Intelligent and hyper-automated business processes
With its ability to follow basic tasks and routines based on smart programming and algorithms, artificial intelligence is becoming embedded in the way organizations automate their business processes. 
AIOps and MLops are common use cases for AI and automation, but the breadth and depth of what AI can automate in the enterprise is quickly growing.
Bali D.R., SVP at Infosys, a global digital services and consulting firm, believes that AI is moving toward a certain level of hyper-automation, partially in response to the unexpected changes in manual data and procedures caused by the pandemic.
“We are in the second inflection point for AI — as it graduates from consumer AI, towards enterprise-grade AI,” D.R. said. “Being exposed to an over-reliance on manual procedures, such as mass rescheduling in the airline industry, unprecedented loan applications in banks, etc., the industries are now turning to hyper-automation that combines robotic process automation with modern machine learning to ensure they can better handle surges in the future.”
Although AI automation is still mostly limited to interval and task-oriented automation that requires little imagination or guesswork on the part of the tool, some experts believe we are moving closer to more applications for intelligent automation.
David Tareen, director for artificial intelligence at SAS, a top analytics and AI software company, had this to say about the future of intelligent automation:
“Intelligent automation is an area I expect to grow,” Tareen said. “Just like we automated manufacturing work, we will use AI heavily to automate knowledge work. 
“The complexity comes in because knowledge work has a high degree of variability. For example, an organization will receive feedback on their products or services in different ways and often in different languages as well. AI will need to ingest, understand, and modify processes in real-time before we can automate knowledge work at large.”

2. Emphasis on responsible AI development
Because of the depth of big data and AI’s reliance on it, there’s always the possibility that unethical or ill-prepared data will make it into an AI training data set or model. 
As more companies recognize the importance of creating AI that conducts its operations in a compliant and ethical manner, a number of AI developers and service providers are starting to offer responsible AI solutions to their customers.
Read Maloney, SVP of marketing at H2O.ai, a top AI and hybrid cloud company, explained what exactly responsible AI is and some of the different initiatives that companies are undertaking to improve their AI ethics. 
“AI creates incredible new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world,” Maloney said. “We take the responsibility to mitigate risks as core to our work, so building fairness, interpretability, security, and privacy into our AI solutions is key.” 
Maloney said the market is seeing an “increased adoption of the core pillars of responsible AI,” which he shared with Datamation:

Explainable AI and interpretable ML: The ability to explain a model after it has been developed and providing transparent model architectures, which allows human users to both understand the data and trust results.
Ethical AI: Provides sociological fairness in machine learning predictions (i.e., whether one category of person is being weighted unequally and eliminating historical human bias).
Secure AI: Debugging and deploying ML models to keep security and privacy at the forefront.
Human-centered AI: Where AI learns from human input and collaboration. Systems are continuously improving because of human input and bridging the gap between human and machine.
Compliance: Ensuring AI systems meet the relevant regulatory requirements or regulations.

Companies are exploring several ways to make their AI more responsible, and most are starting with cleaning and assessing both data sets and existing AI models.
Brian Gilmore, director of IoT product management at InfluxData, a database solutions company, believes that one of the top options for model and data set management is distributed ledger technology (DLT).
“As attention builds around the ethical and cultural impact of AI, some organizations are beginning to invest in ancillary but important technologies that utilize consensus and other trust-ensuring systems as a part of the AI framework,” Gilmore said. “For example, distributed ledger technology provides a sidecar platform for auditable proof of integrity for models and training data. 
“The decentralized ownership, distribution of access, and shared accountability of DLT can bring significant transparency to AI development and application across the board. The dilemma is whether for-profit corporations are willing to participate in a community model, trading transparency for consumer trust in something as mission critical as AI.”

3. AI as a tool for global good
Up to this point, AI has most frequently been used to optimize business processes and automate some home routines for consumers. 
However, some experts are beginning to realize the potential that AI-powered models can have for solving global issues.
Read Maloney at H2O.ai has worked with people from a variety of industries to brainstorm how AI can be used for the greater good.
“We work with many like-minded customers, partners, and organizations tackling issues from education, conservation, health care, and more,” Maloney said. “AI for good is fundamental to not only our work, including current work on climate change, wildfires, and hurricane predictions, but we are seeing more and more AI for good work to make the world a better place across the AI industry.”
Some of the most exciting applications of altruistic AI are being implemented in early education right now.
For instance, Helen Thomas, CEO of DMAI, an AI-powered health care and education company, offers an AI-powered product to ensure that preschool-aged children are getting the education they need, despite potential pandemic setbacks:
“On top of pre-existing barriers to preschool education, including cost and access, recent research findings suggest children born during the COVID-19 pandemic display lower IQ scores than those born before January 2020, which means toddlers are less prepared for school than ever before. 
“DMAI DBA  Animal Island Learning Adventure (AILA) is changing this with AI. [Our product] harnesses cognitive AI to deliver appropriate lessons in a consistent and repetitious format, supportive of natural learning patterns
“Recognizing learning patterns that parents might miss, the AI creates an adaptive learning journey and doesn’t allow the child to move forward until they’ve mastered the skills and concepts presented. This intentional delivery also increases attention span over time, ensuring children step into the classroom with the social-emotional intelligence to succeed.”

4. AI and IoT working together
Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become incredibly widespread among both enterprise and personal users, but what many tech companies still struggle with is how to gather actionable insights from the constant inflow of data from these devices. 
AIoT, or the idea of combining artificial intelligence with IoT products, is one field that is starting to address these pools of unused data, giving AI the power to translate that data quickly and intelligently.
Bill Scudder, SVP and AIoT general manager at AspenTech, an industrial AI solutions company, believes that AIoT is one of the most crucial fields for enabling more intelligent, real-time business decisions.
“Forrester has noted that up to 73% of all data collected within the enterprise goes unused, which highlights a critical challenge with IoT,” Scudder said. “As the volume of connected devices — for example, in industrial IoT settings — continues to increase, so does the volume of data collected from these devices. 
“This has resulted in a trend seen across many industries: the need to marry AI and IoT. And here’s why: where IoT allows connected devices to create and transmit data from various sources, AI can take that data one step further, translating data into actionable insights to fuel faster, more intelligent business decisions. This is giving way to the rising trend of artificial intelligence of things or AIoT.”
5. The emergence of decision intelligence
Decision intelligence (DI) is one of the newest artificial intelligence concepts that takes many current business optimizations a step farther, by using AI models to analyze wide-ranging sets of commercial data. These analyses are used to predict future outcomes for everything from products to customers to supply chains.
Sorcha Gilroy, data science team lead at Peak, a commercial AI solutions provider, explained that although decision intelligence is a fairly new concept, it’s already gaining traction with larger enterprises because of its detailed business intelligence (BI) offerings. 
“Decision intelligence is a new category of software that facilitates the commercial application of artificial intelligence, providing predictive insight and recommended actions to users,” Gilroy said. “It is outcome focused, meaning a solution must deliver against a business need before it can be classed as DI.
“Recognized by Gartner and IDC, it has the potential to be the biggest software category in the world and is already being utilized by businesses across a variety of use cases, from personalizing shopper experiences to streamlining complex supply chains. Brands such as Nike, PepsiCo, and ASOS are known to be using DI already.”

                            10/20/2021

                        
Contact for media: Nancy Cicco, Nancy_Cicco@uml.eduLOWELL, Mass. – UMass Lowell researchers are among the scientists behind a new initiative to develop robotics and artificial-intelligence systems designed to improve the quality of life for senior citizens.Established through a $20 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the new NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Intervention for Networked Groups (AI-CARING), which launches today, will develop artificial-intelligence systems that work with caretakers and older adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, to help seniors manage their medication schedules, prepare their meals safely and perform other activities of daily living.The institute also seeks to grow employment opportunities in order to diversify the AI-robotics workforce and expand educational programs to inspire and teach the next generation of robotics experts and computer scientists.UMass Lowell’s Distinguished University Prof. Holly Yanco, a computer scientist who directs the New England Robotics Validation and Experimentation (NERVE) Center at UMass Lowell, is co-leading AI-CARING with Sonia Chernova, associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology.At UMass Lowell, which received a $2.4 million share of the total funding, the research will focus on building trust in human-robot interaction, evaluating the performance of the AI systems being developed, creating educational programs in artificial intelligence and robotics for K-12 students and fostering ways to increase diversity, equity and inclusion in the AI workforce.“AI-CARING has a tremendous potential to impact how we live, helping people to stay at home as they age and reducing the caregiving load on family and friends. This NSF AI Institute increases the educational and research opportunities for UMass Lowell students, both at the graduate and undergraduate level,” Yanco said. “At UMass Lowell, we have been pioneering computer science and robotics-driven initiatives to increase diversity in the workforce for years. Now, we look forward to advancing our work on a national stage, collaborating with fellow researchers across the country.”Other partners in the effort include Carnegie Mellon University, Oregon State University and Oregon Health & Science University, with Amazon and Google as industry sponsors.“This new NSF AI Institute is an example of how UMass Lowell researchers are partnering with other leading universities and major companies to enhance quality of life through better understanding of human interactions with technology. Our NERVE Center, led by Distinguished University Prof. Holly Yanco – with expertise from computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering, physical therapy and many other disciplines – is at the forefront of new standards and evaluation methods for exoskeletons, assistive technology, autonomy, AI and human-machine interfaces,” said Julie Chen, UMass Lowell’s vice chancellor for research and economic development.Much of UMass Lowell’s research for AI-CARING will take place at the university’s NERVE Center, located at 110 Canal St., Lowell. Along with Yanco, UMass Lowell’s team will include:Computer Science Assistant Prof. Reza Ahmadzadeh, an expert in the technologies that allow AI systems to “learn” and interact with people;Electrical and Computer Engineering Assistant Prof. Paul Robinette, an authority on building trust between AI systems and people;Computer Science Prof. Fred Martin, associate dean for teaching, learning and undergraduate studies, an expert in developing computer science curricula for K-12 students; andAdam Norton, the NERVE Center’s associate director, an expert in the evaluation of robot systems.Once developed, the new robotics and AI systems will be tested by seniors and families identified by the AI-CARING team.AI-CARING is one of 11 new NSF National AI Research Institutes, hubs for academia, industry and government that are pioneering advances in artificial intelligence and robotics.UMass Lowell is a national research university located on a high-energy campus in the heart of a global community. The university offers its students bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in business, education, engineering, fine arts, health, humanities, sciences and social sciences.

– Computer Scientist Wins $1 Million Artificial Intelligence PrizeTOPICS:Artificial IntelligenceDuke University By Duke University October 17, 2021The AAAI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity recognizes the positive impacts of artificial intelligence to protect, enhance, and improve human life in meaningful ways with long-lived effects.






 Duke professor becomes second recipient of AAAI Squirrel AI Award for pioneering socially responsible AI.Whether preventing explosions on electrical grids, spotting patterns among past crimes, or optimizing resources in the care of critically ill patients, Duke University computer scientist Cynthia Rudin wants artificial intelligence (AI) to show its work. Especially when it’s making decisions that deeply affect people’s lives.While many scholars in the developing field of machine learning were focused on improving algorithms, Rudin instead wanted to use AI’s power to help society. She chose to pursue opportunities to apply machine learning techniques to important societal problems, and in the process, realized that AI’s potential is best unlocked when humans can peer inside and understand what it is doing.

Now, after 15 years of advocating for and developing “interpretable” machine learning algorithms that allow humans to see inside AI, Rudin’s contributions to the field have earned her the $1 million Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Founded in 1979, AAAI serves as the prominent international scientific society serving AI researchers, practitioners and educators.Rudin, a professor of computer science and engineering at Duke, is the second recipient of the new annual award, funded by the online education company Squirrel AI to recognize achievements in artificial intelligence in a manner comparable to top prizes in more traditional fields.She is being cited for “pioneering scientific work in the area of interpretable and transparent AI systems in real-world deployments, the advocacy for these features in highly sensitive areas such as social justice and medical diagnosis, and serving as a role model for researchers and practitioners.”“Only world-renowned recognitions, such as the Nobel Prize and the A.M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery, carry monetary rewards at the million-dollar level,” said AAAI awards committee chair and past president Yolanda Gil. “Professor Rudin’s work highlights the importance of transparency for AI systems in high-risk domains. Her courage in tackling controversial issues calls out the importance of research to address critical challenges in responsible and ethical use of AI.”






Rudin’s first applied project was a collaboration with Con Edison, the energy company responsible for powering New York City. Her assignment was to use machine learning to predict which manholes were at risk of exploding due to degrading and overloaded electrical circuitry. But she soon discovered that no matter how many newly published academic bells and whistles she added to her code, it struggled to meaningfully improve performance when confronted by the challenges posed by working with handwritten notes from dispatchers and accounting records from the time of Thomas Edison.“We were getting more accuracy from simple classical statistics techniques and a better understanding of the data as we continued to work with it,” Rudin said. “If we could understand what information the predictive models were using, we could ask the Con Edison engineers for useful feedback that improved our whole process. It was the interpretability in the process that helped improve accuracy in our predictions, not any bigger or fancier machine learning model. That’s what I decided to work on, and it is the foundation upon which my lab is built.”Over the next decade, Rudin developed techniques for interpretable machine learning, which are predictive models that explain themselves in ways that humans can understand. While the code for designing these formulas is complex and sophisticated, the formulas might be small enough to be written in a few lines on an index card.Rudin has applied her brand of interpretable machine learning to numerous impactful projects. With collaborators Brandon Westover and Aaron Struck at Massachusetts General Hospital, and her former student Berk Ustun, she designed a simple point-based system that can predict which patients are most at risk of having destructive seizures after a stroke or other brain injury. And with her former MIT student Tong Wang and the Cambridge Police Department, she developed a model that helps discover commonalities between crimes to determine whether they might be part of a series committed by the same criminals. That open-source program eventually became the basis of the New York Police Department’s Patternizr algorithm, a powerful piece of code that determines whether a new crime committed in the city is related to past crimes.“Cynthia’s commitment to solving important real-world problems, desire to work closely with domain experts, and ability to distill and explain complex models is unparalleled,” said Daniel Wagner, deputy superintendent of the Cambridge Police Department. “Her research resulted in significant contributions to the field of crime analysis and policing. More impressively, she is a strong critic of potentially unjust ‘black box’ models in criminal justice and other high-stakes fields, and an intense advocate for transparent interpretable models where accurate, just and bias-free results are essential.”Black box models are the opposite of Rudin’s transparent codes. The methods applied in these AI algorithms make it impossible for humans to understand what factors the models depend on, which data the models are focusing on and how they’re using it. While this may not be a problem for trivial tasks such as distinguishing a dog from a cat, it could be a huge problem for high-stakes decisions that change people’s lives.






“Cynthia is changing the landscape of how AI is used in societal applications by redirecting efforts away from black box models and toward interpretable models by showing that the conventional wisdom—that black boxes are typically more accurate—is very often false,” said Jun Yang, chair of the computer science department at Duke. “This makes it harder to justify subjecting individuals (such as defendants) to black-box models in high-stakes situations. The interpretability of Cynthia’s models has been crucial in getting them adopted in practice, since they enable human decision-makers, rather than replace them.”One impactful example involves COMPAS—an AI algorithm used across multiple states to make bail parole decisions that was accused by a ProPublica investigation of partially using race as a factor in its calculations. The accusation is difficult to prove, however, as the details of the algorithm are proprietary information, and some important aspects of the analysis by ProPublica are questionable. Rudin’s team has demonstrated that a simple interpretable model that reveals exactly which factors it’s taking into consideration is just as good at predicting whether or not a person will commit another crime. This begs the question, Rudin says, as to why black box models need to be used at all for these types of high-stakes decisions.“We’ve been systematically showing that for high-stakes applications, there’s no loss in accuracy to gain interpretability, as long as we optimize our models carefully,” Rudin said. “We’ve seen this for criminal justice decisions, numerous healthcare decisions including medical imaging, power grid maintenance decisions, financial loan decisions and more. Knowing that this is possible changes the way we think about AI as incapable of explaining itself.”Throughout her career, Rudin has not only been creating these interpretable AI models, but developing and publishing techniques to help others do the same. That hasn’t always been easy. When she first began publishing her work, the terms “data science” and “interpretable machine learning” did not exist, and there were no categories into which her research fit neatly, which means that editors and reviewers didn’t know what to do with it. Cynthia found that if a paper wasn’t proving theorems and claiming its algorithms to be more accurate, it was—and often still is—more difficult to publish.As Rudin continues to help people and publish her interpretable designs—and as more concerns continue to crop up with black box code—her influence is finally beginning to turn the ship. There are now entire categories in machine learning journals and conferences devoted to interpretable and applied work. Other colleagues in the field and their collaborators are vocalizing how important interpretability is for designing trustworthy AI systems.






“I have had enormous admiration for Cynthia from very early on, for her spirit of independence, her determination, and her relentless pursuit of true understanding of anything new she encountered in classes and papers,” said Ingrid Daubechies, the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering, one of the world’s preeminent researchers in signal processing, and one of Rudin’s PhD advisors at Princeton University. “Even as a graduate student, she was a community builder, standing up for others in her cohort. She got me into machine learning, as it was not an area in which I had any expertise at all before she gently but very persistently nudged me into it. I am so very glad for this wonderful and very deserved recognition for her!”“I could not be more thrilled to see Cynthia’s work honored in this way,” added Rudin’s second PhD advisor, Microsoft Research partner Robert Schapire, whose work on “boosting” helped lay the foundations for modern machine learning. “For her inspiring and insightful research, her independent thinking that has led her in directions very different from the mainstream, and for her longstanding attention to issues and problems of practical, societal importance.”Rudin earned undergraduate degrees in mathematical physics and music theory from the University at Buffalo before completing her PhD in applied and computational mathematics at Princeton. She then worked as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at New York University, and as an associate research scientist at Columbia University. She became an associate professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining Duke’s faculty in 2017, where she holds appointments in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and statistical science.She is a three-time recipient of the INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award, which recognizes creative and unique applications of analytical techniques, and is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.“I want to thank AAAI and Squirrel AI for creating this award that I know will be a game-changer for the field,” Rudin said. “To have a ‘Nobel Prize’ for AI to help society makes it finally clear without a doubt that this topic—AI work for the benefit for society—is actually important.”

Machine learning (ML), a commonly used type of artificial intelligence (AI), is one of the fastest-growing fields in technology. 
Especially as the workplace, products, and service expectations are changing through digital transformations, more companies are leaning into machine learning solutions to optimize, automate, and simplify their operations. 
So what does ML technology look like today and where is it heading in the future? Read on to learn about some of the top trends in machine learning today.
5 Trends to Watch in Machine Learning

Automation through MLOps
ML democratization and broadening access
Achieving scalability through containerization
APIs and wider availability of prepackaged tools
ML and time series solutions for future planning

More on the ML market: Machine Learning Market
1. Automation through MLOps
Many businesses are investing significant time and resources into ML development because they recognize its potential for automation. 
When an ML model is designed with business processes in mind, it can automate a variety of business functions across marketing, sales, HR, and even network security. MLOps and AutoML are two of the most popular applications of machine learning today, giving teams the ability to automate tasks and bring DevOps principles to machine learning use cases.
Read Maloney, SVP of marketing at H2O.ai, a top AI and hybrid cloud company, believes that both MLOps and AutoML strategies eliminate several traditional business blockers. 
“Scaling AI for the enterprise requires a new set of tools and skills designed for modern infrastructure and collaboration,” Maloney said. “Teams using manual deployment and management find they are quickly strapped for resources and after getting a few models into production, cannot scale beyond that. 
“Machine learning operations (MLOps), is the set of practices and technology that enable organizations to scale and manage AI in production, essentially bringing the development practice of DevOps to machine learning. MLOps helps data science and IT teams collaborate and empowers IT teams to lead production machine learning projects, without having to rely on data science expertise.
“AutoML solves a few of the biggest blockers to ML adoption, including faster time to ROI and more quickly and easily developing models. AutoML automates key parts of the data science workflow to increase productivity, without compromising model quality, interpretability, and performance. 
“With AutoML, you can automate algorithm selection, feature generation, hyper-parameter tuning, iterative modeling, and model assessment. By automating repetitive tasks in the workflow, data scientists can focus on the data and the business problems they are trying to solve and speed time from experiment to impact.”
Automation through ML is desirable in theory, but in practice, it’s sometimes difficult for business leaders to envision how ML tools can optimize their business operations.
Amaresh Tripathy, SVP and global business leader at Genpact, a digital transformation and professional services firm, offered some common examples of how MLOps and MLOps-as-a-service help businesses in various industries.
“One [MLOps] example is using AI models to efficiently direct sales teams to identify the next best customer,” Tripathy said. “Another is optimizing pricing and revenue management systems using dynamic demand forecasting.”

2. ML democratization and broadening access
Machine learning is still considered a niche and complex technology to develop, but a growing segment of tech professionals are working to democratize the field, particularly by making ML solutions more widely accessible.
Jean-Francois Gagne, head of AI product and strategy at ServiceNow, a workflow management software company, believes that ML democratization involves creating easier access to develop and deploy ML models as well as giving more people access to useful ML training data.
“Good training data is often scarce,” Gagne said. “Low-data learning techniques are helping in enterprise AI use cases, where customers want to adapt pre-trained out-the-box models to their unique business context. In most cases, their own data sets are not that big, but methods such as transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and few-shot learning help minimize the amount of labeled training data needed for an application.”
ML democratization is also about creating tools that consider the backgrounds and use cases of a more diverse range of users.
Brian Gilmore, director of IoT product management at InfluxData, a database solutions company, believes that more users and developers are starting to recognize the benefit of a diverse team for developing ML solutions.
“Ignoring the technical for a moment, we must focus on the human aspects of AI as well,” Gilmore said. “There seems to be a trend building around the democratization of the ML ecosystem, bringing more diverse stakeholders to the table no matter where in the value chain.
“Bias is probably the single greatest obstacle to ML efficacy, and leading companies are learning to combat bias and build better applications by embracing diversity and inclusion (D&I).
“ML needs additional variety in training data, for sure. Still, we should also consider the positive impact of D&I on the teams that design, build, label, and deliver the ML-driven applications — this can genuinely differentiate ML products.”

3. Achieving scalability through containerization
ML developers are increasingly creating their models in containers. 
When a machine learning product is developed and deployed within a containerized environment, users can ensure that its operational power is not negatively impacted by other programs running on the server. More importantly, ML becomes more scalable through containerization, as the packaged model makes it possible to migrate and adjust ML workloads over time.
Ali Siddiqui, chief product officer at BMC, a SaaS company with a variety of ITOps solutions, believes that containerized development of machine learning is the best way forward, particularly in the case of digital enterprises incorporating autonomous operations.
“It’s trending to use machine learning workloads in containers,” Siddiqui said. “Containers allow autonomous digital enterprises to have isolation, portability, unlimited scalability, dynamic behavior, and rapid change through advanced enterprise DevOps processes. 
“ML workloads are typically spiky and require high scalability and in some cases, real-time stream processing. For instance, when you take a look at ML projects, they typically have two phases: algorithm creation and algorithm execution. The first involves a lot of data and data processing. The second typically requires a lot of compute power in production. Both can benefit from container deployment to ensure scalability and availability.”

4. APIs and wider availability of prepackaged tools
In another trending effort toward ML democratization, a number of ML developers have perfected their models over time and found ways to create template-like versions, available to a wider pool of users via API and other integrations.
Bali D.R., SVP at Infosys, a global digital services and consulting firm, believes that prepackaged ML tools, particularly via APIs and digital storefronts, are some of the most common and useful applications of machine learning today:
“API-fication of ML models is another key trend we are seeing, whether it is GPT3, CODEX, or even Hugging Face, where they train and deploy state-of-the-art NLP models and make them available as web APIs or Python packages for inferencing,” DR said. “[There’s also] AI stores with pre-trained models exposed via APIs, which provide a drag-and-drop option for AI development across enterprises.”

5. ML and time series solutions for future planning
Machine learning models can only improve their functionality over time if they are consistently fed new data in intervals. Since so many ML models rely on timeline-based updates, a number of ML solutions are using a time series approach to improve the model’s understanding of the what, when, and why behind different data sets.
Read Maloney of H2O.ai explained why time series solutions are necessary for truly predictive ML:
“On a long enough horizon, all problems eventually become time series problems,” Maloney said. “ML is a phenomenal method for predicting events in real-time, and as we observe these predictions over time, we need more and more time series solutions. 
“Every business needs to make predictions, whether forecasting sales, estimating product demand, or predicting future inventory levels. In all cases, data is necessary as well as specific techniques and tools to account for time.”
