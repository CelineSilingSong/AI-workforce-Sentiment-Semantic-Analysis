[+] The DEUCE: Digital Electronic Universal Computing Engine, was the first commercially produced digital model and was developed from earlier plans by Alan Turing. 30 were sold and in 1956 one cost ú50,000. The DEUCE took up a huge space compared to modern computers and worked from 1450 thermionic valves which grew hot , blow outs were frequent. However the DEUCE proved a popular innovation and some models were working in to the 1970s.

When computers were still in the nascent stages, Alan Turing published his legendary paper, “Computing Machinery And Intelligence,” in the Mind journal in 1950. In it, he set forth the intriguing question: Can machines think?


At the time, the notion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) did not exist (this would not come until about six years later at a conference at Dartmouth University). Yet Turing was already thinking about the implications of this category.

In his paper, he described a framework to determine if a machine had intelligence. This essentially involved a thought experiment. Assume there are three players in a game. Two are human and the other is a computer. An evaluator—who is a human—then asks open-ended questions to the players. If this person cannot determine who is the human, then the computer is considered to be intelligent.

PROMOTED
The Turing Test was quite ingenious because there was no need to define “intelligence,” which is fraught with complexities. Even today this concept is far from clear-cut.

Keep in mind that Turing thought the test would ultimately be cracked by 2000 or so. But interestingly enough, this turned out to be way too optimistic. The Turing Test has remained elusive for AI systems.
“If Alan Turing was alive, he might be shocked that given 175 billion neurons from GPT-3 we are still unable to pass his test, but we will soon,” said Ben Taylor, who is the Chief AI Evangelist at DataRobot.

So why has it been so difficult to beat the test? A key reason is that it can be tricked. If you ask a nonsensical question, the results will often be non-human like. Let’s face it, people are very good at detecting when something is not quite right.

“When you ask a GPT-3 system how many eyes the sun has, it will respond that there is one and when asked who was the president of the U.S. in 1600, the answer will be Queen Elizabeth I,” said Noah Giansiracusa, who is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Data Science at Bentley University. “The basic problem seems to be that GPT-3 always tries in earnest to answer the question, rather than refusing and pointing out the absurdity and unanswerability of a question.”

But over time, it seems reasonable that these issues will be worked out. The fact is that AI technology is continuing to progress at a staggering pace. 
There may also be a need for another test as well. “Since the Turing test, humans have actually discovered much more insight into our own minds through fMRI and what makes us superior in our own intelligence,” said Taylor. “This insight into our own brains justifies changing the goals of a test beyond mimicking behavior. Defining a new test might help us get out of the deep-learning rut, which is currently insufficient for achieving AGI or Artificial General Intelligence. The Turing test was our moonshot, so let's figure out our Mars-shot.”
Over the years, other tests have emerged. According Druhin Bala, who is the CEO and co-founder of getchefnow.com, there are:


The Marcus Test: In which a program watches a television show and is asked meaningful questions about the show's content.
The Lovelace Test 2.0: Where you detect AI through an ability to create art.
Total Turing Test: Where the questioner can also test perceptual abilities as well as the ability to manipulate objects.


But my favorite is the Wozniak Test (yes, this is from the co-founder of Apple). This is where a robot can enter a stranger’s home and make a cup of coffee!
Now of course, all these tests have their own issues. The fact is that no test is fool-proof. But in the coming years, there will probably be new ones and this will help with the development of AI. 
“The Turing Test is brilliant in its simplicity and elegance, which is why it's held up so well for 70 years,” said Zach Mayer, who is the Vice President of Data Science at DataRobot. “It's an important milestone for machine intelligence, and GPT-3 is very close to passing it. And yet, as we pass this milestone, I think it's also clear that GPT-3 is nowhere near human-level intelligence. I think discovering another ‘Turing Test’ for AI will illuminate the next step on our journey towards understanding human intelligence.”

Photograph: DeepMind/PADeepMind This article is more than 3 years oldDeepMind AI cracks 50-year-old problem of protein foldingThis article is more than 3 years oldProgram solves scientific problem in ‘stunning advance’ for understanding machinery of lifeIan Sample Science editorMon 30 Nov 2020 10.58 ESTLast modified on Mon 30 Nov 2020 12.41 ESTShareHaving risen to fame on its superhuman performance at playing games, the artificial intelligence group DeepMind has cracked a serious scientific problem that has stumped researchers for half a century.With its latest AI program, AlphaFold, the company and research laboratory showed it can predict how proteins fold into 3D shapes, a fiendishly complex process that is fundamental to understanding the biological machinery of life.Independent scientists said the breakthrough would help researchers tease apart the mechanisms that drive some diseases and pave the way for designer medicines, more nutritious crops and “green enzymes” that can break down plastic pollution.DeepMind said it had started work with a handful of scientific groups and would focus initially on malaria, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease.“It marks an exciting moment for the field,” said Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s founder and chief executive. “These algorithms are now becoming mature enough and powerful enough to be applicable to really challenging scientific problems.”Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, called the work “a stunning advance” that had occurred “decades before many people in the field would have predicted”.DeepMind is best known for its run of human-trouncing programs that achieved supremacy in chess, Go, Starcraft II and old-school Atari classics. But superhuman gameplay was never the primary aim. Instead, games provided a training ground for programs that, once powerful enough, would be unleashed on real-world problems.Protein folding has been a grand challenge in biology for 50 years. An arcane form of molecular origami, its importance is hard to overstate. Most biological processes revolve around proteins and a protein’s shape determines its function. When researchers know how a protein folds up, they can start to uncover what it does. How insulin controls sugar levels in the blood and how antibodies fight coronavirus are both determined by protein structure.Scientists have identified more than 200m proteins but structures are known for only a fraction of them. Traditionally, the shapes are discovered through meticulous lab work that can take years. And while computer scientists have made headway on the problem, inferring the structure from a protein’s makeup is no easy task. Proteins are chains of amino acids that can twist and bend into a mind-boggling variety of shapes: a googol cubed, or 1 followed by 300 zeroes.To learn how proteins fold, researchers at DeepMind trained their algorithm on a public database containing about 170,000 protein sequences and their shapes. Running on the equivalent of 100 to 200 graphics processing units – by modern standards, a modest amount of computing power – the training took a few weeks.DeepMind put AlphaFold through its paces by entering it for a biennial “protein olympics” known as Casp, the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction. Entrants to the international competition are given the amino acid sequences for about 100 proteins and challenged to work them out. The results from teams that use computers are compared with those based on lab work.AlphaFold not only outperformed other computer programs but reached an accuracy comparable to the laborious and time-consuming lab-based methods. When ranked across all proteins analysed, AlphaFold had a median score of 92.5 out of 100, with 90 being the equivalent to experimental methods. For the hardest proteins, the median score fell, but only marginally to 87.Hassabis said DeepMind had started work on how to give researchers access to AlphaFold to help with scientific research. Andrei Lupas, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, said he had already used the program to solve a protein structure that scientists had been stuck on for a decade.Janet Thornton, a director emeritus of EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, said she was excited to hear the results. “This is a problem that I was beginning to think would not get solved in my lifetime,” she said. “Knowing these structures will really help us to understand how human beings operate and function, how we work.”John Jumper, a researcher on the team at DeepMind, said: “We really didn’t know until we saw the Casp results how far we had pushed the field.” It is not the end of the work, however. Future research will focus on how proteins combine to form larger “complexes” and how they interact with other molecules in living organisms.Explore more on these topicsDeepMindBiologyArtificial intelligence (AI)AlphabetnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealI’m from Appalachia.

Yes,...",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,Investments,N/A,"   Investments  Machine Learning for Investment Management in 2021 Published 4 years ago on  November 30, 2020 By  Helen Kovalenko  Table Of Contents Investing is an integral part of banking, and it is also the riskiest part. Is there a way to protect your assets from unjustified risks and increase the efficiency of each new investment? Yes, machine learning and artificial intelligence in banking are pushing its boundaries, making it even more promising, profitable, smart, and secure. In this article, we will look at the future of these technologies for the fintech sector and focus on the use of AI and machine learning for investment management.Artificial Intelligence in Banking 2021 – What to ExpectTo date, artificial intelligence in banking is one of the most promising technologies to utilize for different purposes. Because of the great opportunities for customization, data analysis, and different tasks solving capabilities, as well as the affordable price to implement, the use of AI and machine learning in banking is one more fintech trend that is evolving, according to this  infographic.Machine Learning in Banking BenefitsThis rapid, and most importantly, pervasive rise in the value of artificial intelligence and machine learning for banking has strong foundations, as these technologies promise completely new and highly effective benefits.Advanced data analysis. Previously, banks were forced to analyze data with limited access to information. For example, when a client comes with a request to issue a loan, the decision was made only on the basis of statements of income, current assets and liabilities of the client, and his credit history. At the moment, artificial intelligence in banking allows you to analyze huge amounts of information, up to the user's request in social networks, in order to make more competent and less risky decisions.The cutting edge advantage. Machine learning in banking may make you more competitive depending on the task you want to solve with its help. Further, we will dwell on artificial intelligence in banking case studies so you will be able to find the task that is relevant for your business and solvable with AI at the same time. Costs cut. Depending on the way you use AI and ML for your financial institution, it may cut you some costs. For example, using robo-advisors as a part of your support team may lower the cost of staff maintenance. Better security. Artificial intelligence in banking can be applied in different ways if you want to achieve more security. For example, credit card fraud detection using machine learning has become a fairly standard application of the technology, while innovative cameras with face recognition can determine if a client's intentions are false judging by their facial expressions.Artificial Intelligence in Banking Case Studies ExamplesAs for the practical application of these innovations in the sphere of baking and finances, AI and ML may be successfully used for:Customer service improvement. For example, a chatbot may help the customers navigate the bank’s website and application, suggest making regular payments, and notify users in the case of overspendings. Even more advanced chatbots already help customers with their budget planning, money-saving, and investment management. Risk assessment. Making money out of money is always a risky process so AI and ML can help correctly assess the risks when issuing a loan, and make sure that the customer isn’t engaged in money laundering and terrorist financing. What’s more, machine learning for investment management and risk evaluation is quite useful as well. Fraud detection with AI and machine learning. Credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not the only example of utilizing this technology for security purposes. In addition, artificial intelligence can protect your employees ‘inboxes from phishing emails, as well as keep your customers' data safe in mobile banking applications. Alternatively, you can use a ready-made security solution, or partner with a company with fraud detection expertise like SPD Group to create your own fraud prevention system based on the core threats you face. Investment management. As for machine learning for investment management, below are more insights into this topic. What Is Meant by Investment Management?As defined by Investopedia, “Investment management refers to the handling of financial assets and other investments—not only buying and selling them. Management includes devising a short- or long-term strategy for acquiring and disposing of portfolio holdings. It can also include banking, budgeting, and tax services and duties, as well.”How ML and AI Can Benefit Investment Management?If we take one more look at the infographics above, we will discover that machine learning for investment management can be helpful with all of the core aspects of this process. Make new forms of data subjected to an accurate analysis. You can never be sure that you are taking into account all the information you know. In turn, AI is able to dig deeper and find invisible relationships that directly affect investment benefits.Decrease the influence of human biases in the decision-making process. AI has no emotions and is totally indifferent to which decision you will make. Its task is to only suggest a better deal with an unbiased look. Clarify the possible risks and opportunities. As we said, risk assessment is a competent machine learning advantage for investment management. Thanks to this opportunity, you will be able to make the soundest investment decisions.Make accurate predictions. Artificial intelligence for investment management may also be powered by a predictor which will allow you to get as accurate predictions as possible taking into account the real-time and historical data. Suggest the best decision being guided by certain parameters. For example, if you are looking for the opportunity to invest in real estate in a certain region, there are already two parameters the model may be guided by when looking for the best options. What Are the Main Types of Investing Strategies and How ML Can Be Useful for EachHere is how machine learning and artificial intelligence may work to make different investment strategies safe and beneficial. Strategy definitionThe way to apply ML and AIValue InvestingThis strategy means investing in undervalued but promising securities.ML and AI can search for such stocks using data analysis predictive abilities.Income InvestingThe purpose of this strategy is to get a constant flow of passive income. The task of AI and ML will be analyzing different markets and current trends with the goal of finding the most passive income promising deals. Growth InvestingThe goal of this strategy is to increase capital. The simplest example is a deposit with an interest capitalization option.An AI-powered system may analyze different options, calculate the possible capital increase for a given period, and suggest the best solution from all the available. Small-Cap InvestingThis is the strategy of investments in the stocks of the companies with a small market capitalization. AI and ML may search and suggest stocks from the most promising small-cap companies. Socially Responsible InvestingThis strategy suggests investing in green and/or socially promising projects.The ML model may research the current social trends to find out which projects are the most promising to invest in. ConclusionAs you can see, machine learning and artificial intelligence are quite promising for banking and finance, especially in an environment of increased risk and lack of guarantees, that is, in investment management and countering banking fraud. In 2021, you should focus on these challenges, and leverage fintech innovation to gain an additional edge as well.

They begin as strings of chemical compounds, before twisting and folding into three-dimensional shapes that define what they can do — and what they cannot.For biologists, identifying the precise shape of a protein often requires months, years or even decades of experimentation. It requires skill, intelligence and more than a little elbow grease.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Seattle, Microsoft and the field of artificial intelligence come in for their share of the spotlight in “Superintelligence” — an HBO Max movie starring Melissa McCarthy as the rom-com heroine, and comedian James Corden as the world’s new disembodied AI overlord.
But how much substance is there behind the spotlight? Although the action is set in Seattle, much of the principal filming was actually done in Georgia. And the scientific basis of the plot — which involves an AI trying to decide whether or not to destroy the planet — is, shall we say, debatable.
Fortunately, we have the perfect team to put “Superintelligence” to the test, as a set-in-Seattle movie as well as a guide to the capabilities of artificial intelligence.
The Seattle area is one of the world’s hottest AI hotspots, thanks to Microsoft, Amazon, the University of Washington, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and dozens of AI startups.
We enlisted Oren Etzioni — the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI2 — and Carissa Schoenick, AI2’s senior program manager and communications director, to do a reality check on the movie’s depiction of AI. Kurt Schlosser, who covers the Geek Life beat at GeekWire, weighed in on the movie’s depiction of Seattle tech culture.

AI pros and cons
Right off the bat, Etzioni said Melissa McCarthy fans are likely to take a liking to “Superintelligence,” regardless of any AI faux pas.
“It’s always great to see her,” he said. “It’s actually fun for the whole family. My 10-year-old and my wife joined me, and so clearly that says something for it as a movie — although it’s not a classic masterpiece or as funny as when she was playing a James Bond character in ‘Spy.'”
“Superintelligence” goes heavy on the stereotypes — including the classic tale of rekindling romance with an old boyfriend, the high-tech situation room filled with world leaders, and hilarity from a hapless pair of FBI agents (one of whom is played by Ben Falcone, the film’s director and McCarthy’s husband).
Corden’s disembodied AI follows a stereotype as well, Etzioni said.
“The AI is omniscient and basically omnipotent, so long as it has internet, right?” he said. “There’s no real separation from the notion of highly intelligent and knowing every little fact about you, whereas we think of it at AI2 as very different things.”
In a way, the AI stereotype as portrayed in “Superintelligence” is “almost more pernicious than the Terminator,” Etzioni said: “The Terminator … you know it’s a monster, right? But here, it’s a comedy. It’s this guy’s voice, and of course, the AI knows everything. But that’s a stereotype.”

Even though it’s lighthearted, “Superintelligence” comes with a scary premise, Schoenick said.
“The movie presents this AI as coming into existence suddenly, and it arrives with a built-in agenda of evaluating humanity for potential destruction,” she said. “That’s a pretty impossible, scary way to portray AI technology, though not uncommon in Hollywood.”
Schoenick noted that the AI could find its way into any device, ranging from a Tesla to a toaster, but couldn’t break in on the movie’s characters while they were working on secret plans to foil its scheme. “It’s exactly as powerful or not as it needs to be at any given point in the movie,” she said.
In one of Schoenick’s favorite over-the-top tech scenes, a Microsoft researcher points to the ups and downs of a worldwide neural network on a giant display screen. “I don’t think the audience would buy that as something that we could just dial up and say, ‘Oh, let me check the neural network activity today around the world. It’s really high, I wonder what that means?'” she said. “Also, why would Microsoft be the one coordinating the global response to a rogue AI?”
Etzioni said the movie gets at least one thing about AI right. “Emotions, interactions, the little contradictions that make us decide who to love and who not to love are very difficult for people to understand — and completely unfathomable for machines,” he said.
Etzioni noted that Yejin Choi, a researcher at UW and AI2, is working on a project that’s aimed at giving AI programs more common sense.
“We actually have benchmarks and metrics around social common sense, and it’s extremely opaque to a machine,” he said. “That’s the one part the movie really got right: Machines don’t ‘get it’ in that emotional sense.”
Seattle clips and slips
Like most movies that are ostensibly set in Seattle (such as Netflix’s recently released “Love, Guaranteed”), parts of “Superintelligence” were actually filmed somewhere else. Most of the Microsoft scenes were done at Georgia Tech, for example. In one such scene, a futuristic sculpture in Georgia Tech’s Clough Building takes center stage.
To be sure, there are the standard establishing shots of the Space Needle, the Monorail and other Seattle landmarks. “The first aerial zoom into a ‘tech office’ from Elliott Bay is actually the Zillow HQ or Russell Investments Center building,” Schlosser said.
There’s also the obligatory fish toss at Pike Place Market, although the filmmakers commit what Schlosser calls “the most egregious non-Seattleite mistake” by labeling it as Pike’s Place Market in a satellite-shot graphic. (We should note that we were watching a pre-release version of the movie, and there’s a chance that the graphic was corrected for final release.)

Sharp-eyed Seattleites might notice a couple of inconsistencies that outsiders would miss. For example, McCarthy moves into a Pioneer Square penthouse that seems to have a view of the Great Wheel and the Seattle waterfront — but that’s a perspective that could be seen in reality only from Pike Place Market, farther north.
Schlosser said “Superintelligence” capitalizes on the spirit of the Seattle startup scene when McCarthy’s character, named Carol Peters, looks for a job at a down-and-dirty matchmaking site called BaDunkaDunk.com  (Sorry, geeks, that domain name was taken three years ago.)
“BaDunkaDunk goes all in on normal startup cliches, including absurd beanbag furniture and the use of ‘we need a rock star’ when interviewing Carol,” he said.
Another Seattle twist has Carol and her old flame, played by Bobby Cannavale, meeting Ken Griffey Jr. at a Mariners game. The Mariners get almost as much of the spotlight as Microsoft. “At one point, Carol’s boyfriend offers a toast to ‘another Mariners victory,’ which we all know doesn’t happen very often,” Schlosser quipped.
At least one Seattle icon is missing, however. “Why is Microsoft still the go-to tech representation for the Seattle area, in an age when Amazon has risen to such prominence?” Schlosser asked. “I don’t think I saw any Amazon clues in the film.”
Final grades
We asked each of our reviewers to grade “Superintelligence” on an A-to-F academic scale, for pure entertainment and for science.

Etzioni: Hollywood’s depictions of AI — ranging from “Terminator” and “Westworld” to “Her” and “Ex Machina” — typically don’t come close to the mark, in Etzioni’s view. And “Superintelligence” is a typical AI movie. “It did get me to chuckle, and I love Melissa McCarthy regardless. As a movie, I would give it a B. As an AI depiction, I would give it a C-minus. The only reason I give it a C-minus is because I’m grading on the curve, and the other students didn’t do very well.”
Schoenick: C-minus for entertainment, F for science. “Suspend all your disbelief for this one, because pretty much nothing the AI does makes sense, and the buzzword usage is sloppy, too. They even misused the term ‘Turing Test,’ which is pretty unforgivable in a movie starring an AI.” Her recommendation for a far more realistic (albeit far less funny) AI movie: “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix.
Schlosser: “I have laughed quite a bit at Melissa McCarthy in other roles, including ‘Bridesmaids’ and on SNL, but I did not like this movie. I thought it was just loaded with clichés, weird references and out-of-touch stuff. So I give it a low C or a D. I’m glad I got to watch it for free while I was working.”
Boyle: C for entertainment — with the “C” standing for a common cable movie. D for the science — with the “D” standing for “Don’t you dare take it seriously.” And B for serving as a parlor game to spot Seattle tie-ins — with the “B” standing for BaDunkaDunk.

HBO Max has launched a “20 Days fo Kindness” campaign on behalf of “Superintelligence,” with HBO Max donating $20,000 to a different good cause daily for 20 days. AT&T helped kick things off with a $1 million contribution to Girls Who Code, and there’s a Prizeo charity sweepstakes as well.
