Editor’s note: In this ongoing series for IT job hunters, we'll explore in-demand roles, necessary skills, and how to stand out in an interview. Here, Ashwin Bharath, co-founder and CEO of Revature, shares insights on getting a job as an AI developer.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) developer salary range:
$85,662 - $102,435 per year. Source: Salary.com.
In a nutshell: What is an AI developer?
Artificial intelligence developers build AI functionality into software applications. The role is generally focused on integrating and implementing AI algorithms and logic into the deliverables of an IT project.
Typically a full-stack developer position, this role requires creating, testing, and deploying code. These developers also assist in converting machine learning APIs so that other applications can use them.

What skills are needed?
Successful AI developers tend to be natural programmers, and job seekers should be prepared to showcase their knowledge of Java, Python, and R. However, applicants often mistake complex programming logic as AI – which it is not.
Developers need to be able to teach the machine to solve problems the way a human would through the use of programming. This position requires soft skills too – problem-solving (both autonomously and as part of a team), logic, and the ability to successfully collaborate are a few qualities that are critical to success in this role.
Finally, it’s also important to demonstrate cloud experience. Many companies rely on this infrastructure, and it shows a well-rounded skill set. 
How to stand out in an AI developer interview
Prospective candidates can stand out by proving that they can do more than write code. While it is a highly technical role, real success requires creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, and in-depth problem solving.
Share examples of previous work experience or projects that focused on a challenge where AI was used or could have been used. Additionally, candidates should remain informed on current trends within the industry, know how AI is being applied, and be ready to discuss case studies and solutions with the interviewer. 
Bonus: Sample AI developer interview question
Question: How would you describe artificial intelligence in a way that would make sense to a non-technical person?
Answer: Artificial intelligence is training a computer to simulate human intelligence. A common example of AI that you may have already interacted with is a chatbot; they typically can be found on the front pages of websites that people visit every day. The bot can respond to a user’s questions because it was programmed with answers to commonly asked questions that a developer programmed into it initially, along with previous interactions that it has had with prior users.
[ How is AI like learning to ride a bicycle? Read How to explain AI in plain English. ]
As the bot continues to respond to more questions, it becomes better at interpreting questions and can provide more accurate answers. The goal is for the AI to take the place of what traditionally would be a human, at scale and with perfect accuracy.

For many entrepreneurs, starting their startup is the most significant thing they do. For Rana el Kaliouby, it’s one achievement in a series of unpredictable things that this self-described “nice Egyptian girl” has accomplished in her life.  


In her remarkable book Girl Decoded, el Kaliouby shares her inspiring academic and professional journey.  Alongside this, it is an intimate meditation about what it took from her personally to accomplish all that she has. 

Born in Egypt to conservative Egyptian parents, the family spent several years in Kuwait and eventually fled back to Cairo when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Raised by her parents and grandparents, she ultimately got her Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, barely pausing while giving birth to her first child. “I practically coded my way into the delivery room,” she said in her book. From there she was invited to the MIT Media lab to do her post-doc. She started Affectiva, an Emotion AI company, with cofounder Rosalind Picard stemming from their research, in 2009. 

PROMOTED
I asked her why she wrote the book. “It was a journey of self-reflection,” she told me. “I realized that my own personal story of overcoming the inner voice of doubt and reconciling my culture and who I want to be is a story of inspiration to many people out there.” 

Her startup Affectiva, where she is now the CEO, creates artificial emotional intelligence (Emotion AI) software that detects “nuanced emotions, complex cognitive states, behaviors, activities, and interactions.” The technology is used by  25% of the Fortune Global 500 companies and is in 90 countries.

El Kaliouby said that the mentors she had throughout her life were invaluable in helping push her when she needed it and overcome self-doubt. Her academic advisor Peter Robinson helped her navigate challenging experiences and her mentor at MIT Rosalind Picard became her cofounder of Affectiva.

After the success of her TED talk (which has 1.6 million views) and receiving the 2015 Ingenuity Award from the Smithsonian Institute she spoke to another key mentor who told her directly “You need to become the CEO.” Initially she couldn’t take that in, but he encouraged her to visualize the path she would need to take to get there and see herself as CEO in the mind’s eye. 
“You have to find people that you look up to, that you trust, who you can have these really open conversations with, and that you know believe in you,” she told me. “I had never voiced ever that I wanted to be CEO. But I could with him.” 
El Kaliouby added that she didn’t always understand the importance of relationships.  “I have a strong work ethic,” she said. “I always worked really hard and I thought the solution to everything was to just work more. And I realized in the last few years that relationships really matter. Making time to have coffee with this mentor even though he was never going to invest in Affectiva turned out to be so important.” 
Building those kinds of relationships takes time, so you have to invest in them and cultivate them. It’s not always easy to do but it pays off.
Don’t be somebody else’s idea of a CEO
As she describes in her book, el Kaliouby was raised in a family that stifled emotions. She learned in her family not to complain, and that hard work would solve all problems.  
As the cofounder and now CEO of her own company she had to find her own leadership style. 
“I’m very empathetic,” she said, “and I’ve decided to own that as opposed to try to be another Nick (the former CEO). He was the archetype picture of what a CEO is like. I wanted to do it my own way and I let my intuition be my guide.” 
In this time of the pandemic, el Kaliouby feels even more committed to this leadership style. Her advice to other CEOs is to start with empathy and be flexible. “Make extra time to check in on people,” she said. “I said early on that physical health is important but mental health is just as important, so I asked people to block out time for themselves.” 
She also used technology to pair people to have coffee breaks together to replicate the organic connections people build at the office. And she uses deadlines to create camaraderie.  “People want to feel they are productive and doing meaningful work, and so when we take the time to connect everyone they turn around and rally to hit deadlines.”
Stand by your core values
Early on el Kaliouby and her cofounder decided on a set of core principles that were important to them. El Kaliouby told me that as CEO she has kept coming back to those values to guide her decisions. 
“For example, we don't do any work in surveillance and security because that's not in line with our core values of respecting people's privacy.” At one point Affectiva had an opportunity to raise about $40 million with the condition that they would sell to surveillance and security companies. “It was scary,” she said. “Literally we didn't know if we were going to make payroll in a couple of months. I was thinking, okay, when do we tell the team? And who could cover if we need to? At the same time, I couldn’t reconcile this investment offer with our core values. We had to walk away. But then we hunkered down when we were able to raise money from investors that shared our vision and values and they're still very engaged. It worked out. It was powerful because you see you can do it your way.”
Eradicate imposter syndrome
El Kaliouby has dealt with imposter syndrome – feelings of being a fraud or that she would fail –regularly throughout her career. When she began to see herself as the CEO she had to “negotiate with the voice in my head telling me ‘Don’t do it Rana. You will fail and bring the company down with you.” 
When she wrote her book she had a similar critic in her head. “I thought that nobody is going to want to read my book or people are going to hate it. I had to say ‘wait a second. People liked it, reviewed it, blurbed it.’ I have to come up with data points as a rebuttal to my self doubt.” 
El Kaliouby told me that she thinks this self-doubt is always present because she is always pushing herself outside of her comfort zone. She’s learned to have a dialogue with herself and use her journal to navigate the negative voices in her head and build conviction in her own capability. 
Ultimately we all have to decode ourselves, to identify our personal obstacles and  overcome them. As el Kaliouby says in her book: “The voice in my head was filled with self-doubt. It whispered ‘you can’t. you shouldn’t. you won’t’ For the longest time I listened to that voice. But the journey that has taken me from ‘nice Egyptian girl’ to strong ‘woman in charge’ has been one of finding my own voice.”
Everyone who reads this book will be inspired to take on the rewarding journey of finding their own voice.

More than a decade ago, Nicholas Carr, in his work Does IT Matter, suggested that the widespread availability and low prices of technology made it more of a utility like electricity or water, versus a competitive differentiator.  This may be happening with artificial intelligence to some degree.


“It appears that AI’s early adopter phase is ending; the market is now moving into the ‘early majority’ chapter of this maturing set of technologies,” write Beena Ammanath, David Jarvis and Susanne Hupfer, all with Deloitte, in their most recent analysis of the enterprise AI space. “Early-mover advantage may fade soon. As adoption becomes ubiquitous, AI-powered organizations may have to work harder to maintain an edge over their industry peers.”

Seventy-four prevent of 2,727 executives responding to a Deloitte survey agree that AI will be integrated into all of their enterprise applications within three years. “Although adopters are still bullish on AI, their advantage may wane as barriers to adoption fall and usage grows, Ammanath and her co-authors state. “Organizations are finding it easier and easier to employ AI technologies. Data science and machine learning platforms have proliferated; AI-optimized hardware is providing greater compute power. It is now easier to train algorithms through self-service data preparation tools, synthetic data, small data, and pretrained models.”

PROMOTED
It is increasingly clear that “we are on the path toward an era of pervasive AI,” they add. The challenge now is leveraging AI in innovative ways to maintain its advantages, the study finds. For example, much of the work with AI is still confined to managing IT systems. In addition, there still isn’t enough AI talent to go around.

At least 26% of the companies surveyed can be considered “seasoned” AI adopters, meaning they “have undertaken a large number of AI production deployments and have developed a high level of AI expertise across the board. These AI leaders are still seeing competitive advantage — 45% of this group said that AI technologies have enabled them to establish a significant lead over their competitors, versus 26% of the entire sample.

Still, this means a majority of even the most advanced AI companies, 55%, still aren’t seeing competitive advantage. Part of this may be due to the fact that AI is still confined to IT departments and functions, including cybersecurity Forty-seven percent of respondents indicated that IT was one of the top two functions for which AI was primarily used, the survey shows.

“This could mean that companies are using AI for IT-related applications such as analyzing IT infrastructure for anomalies, automating repetitive maintenance tasks, or guiding the work of technical support teams,” Ammanath and her co-authors note. Tellingly, business functions such as marketing, human resources, legal, and procurement ranked at the bottom of the list of AI-driven functions.
An area that needs work is finding or preparing individuals to work with AI systems. Fewer than half of executives (45%) say they have “a high level of skill around integrating AI technology into their existing IT environments,” the survey shows. “This could include data science and machine learning platforms, enterprise applications powered by AI, tools for developing conversation interfaces, and low-code or no-code tools. Across all these different technology areas, 93% are using cloud-based AI capabilities, while 78% employ open-source AI capabilities.
Ammanath and her team offer some suggestions for keeping the edge with AI:
Pursue creative approaches.  “Take inspiration from inventive use cases to develop solutions that are both useful and novel.”
Push boundaries. “Expand your view of what may be possible to accomplish with AI technologies. Try to pursue a more diverse portfolio of projects that could potentially enhance multiple business functions across the enterprise.”
Create the new. “Look to develop new AI-powered products and services that take advantage of the technologies’ ability to learn and solve problems that humans can’t.”
Expand the circle. “Move AI beyond the IT department by involving more of the business in AI efforts. Look for new vendors, partnerships, data sources, tools, and techniques to advance your efforts.”
Leverage a diverse team. “Include both technical and business experts in selecting AI technologies and suppliers. Having a broad perspective from developers, integrators, end users, and business owners can help ensure organizational alignment and a focus on business outcomes.” Along with any vendor support consider using working groups, dedicated leaders, or communities of practice.
Actively address risks. “Developing a set of principles and processes to actively manage the range of AI risks can help build trust within your business and with customers and partners.”
Challenge vendors. “While it is important to build trust and transparency with providers of your AI-powered systems, it can be equally essential to ensure that what they provide is aligned with your organization’s ethical principles.”

With major companies banning the sale of facial recognition technology for law enforcement, this may be a good time to examine the applications of facial analysis in recruitment and whether recruiters really need it. 
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology is only going to become more pervasive in recruitment and other HR functions. And why not? It promises to improve efficiency and accuracy and allow human recruiters to spend more time where it matters – in building relationships with candidates and ensuring they have a positive candidate experience. 
Taking a data-driven approach to recruitment is now the norm. But how much data is necessary, and what are the guidelines for its interpretation? When facial recognition technology has been created with a seemingly large data set – albeit one that is still limited – does it simplify a recruiter’s job? It possibly can, or can it perpetuate more bias? 
The aim of using facial recognition in recruitment, or as some experts call it – facial analysis or facial expression recognition – is to capture a candidate’s emotions because of the gap in what candidates may say and what they express through their face. But reading emotions is hard. And getting a machine to do it – while in theory seems like the most practical idea – is not without its challenges. 
Facial recognition is part of a growing subset of artificial intelligence technology called emotion AI. When applied in recruitment, the technology goes a step further and becomes facial analysis or facial expression recognition technology. It deciphers facial expressions, even micro-expressions like eye movements, the curve and the corners of the mouth, and the body gestures. It also assesses tone of voice, for example, the enthusiasm in the voice, and helps recruiters evaluate whether a candidate may be a good fit for a job or organization. This begs a serious question.

Are We Using Facial Analysis Technology in Recruitment to Eliminate Bias, or Can It Perpetuate Bias Further? 
Facial analysis is applied in different ways in recruitments. Some companies use providers that allow candidates to record their responses to a predefined set of questions. Following this, facial analysis tech is applied to identify a candidate’s suitability for the job. In other cases, the technology may be used in a live interview, where it assesses candidates as they respond to the interview questions. 
This brings up serious concerns. Does the facial analysis software account for the context of a facial expression – for instance, the cultural significance of expressions, fear, awkwardness, inability to make contact in the case of perhaps a neurodiverse candidate? 
One studyOpens a new window  found that two separate facial recognition algorithms consistently highlighted black professional basketball players as having more negative emotions than white players, with one interpreting ambiguous facial expressions of black players as contemptuous. However, when all players smiled, regardless of race, the disparity between negative emotions reduced. 
Consider the ramifications of such analysis in the workplace, where an algorithm consistently identifies individuals from certain groups as exhibiting negative emotions and, therefore, ineligible candidates for a job. AI algorithms pick up on micro-expressions, and if a candidate was in distress during the interview, those expressions might be captured differently from a smile of politeness or friendliness. 
The growing use of AI in video assessments has led to a whole series on YouTube on how employees can prepare for such interviews. In South Korea, applicants are learningOpens a new window  how to use AI bots that use facial analysis for assessments. Experts conduct talks that teach candidates to master AI interviews that assess them for “fear” and “joy.” 
Some video AI assessments remove the human checker from the process entirely and may not even allow videos that don’t pass its checks to be reviewed by humans. And the real question to ask here is what the candidate is being assessed against? What is the standard that they are expected to meet? Has that been established anywhere? Does your own organization have it? And what does that person look like? 
If all employees were to meet this standard, would it culminate in a company that has the same type of employee in the guise of a “cultural fit”? What does that do to eliminate bias in recruitment? Some expert opinions believe that the technology is too nascent to have a real impact and may result in increasing the divide rather than closing it. 

A3 Facial recognition in recruitment to screen candidates is not a tested solution and companies should not be using it.#AXSChatOpens a new window  – Most startups don’t have the resources or experts to create such solutions. Using them is a risk.

The application of facial analysis, particularly in recruitment, can result in the perpetuation of bias, but the promise is that it can alleviate it, too. Human biases play out at a very subconscious level, and sometimes recruiters may just not like the “the look” or the “vibe” of a person if it doesn’t conform with their idea of what the ideal candidate should be. In such cases, a supposedly unbiased software can eliminate the initial layer of bias and possibly present a candidate for what they are. 
Facial analysis software may prove useful for companies that need to hire for customer-facing roles. For instance, HireVue’s – a popular name in AI-powered recruitment video assessments – biggest clients are Hilton and Unilever, and they claim to have minimized their hiring timeOpens a new window  from weeks to days. In 2019, HireVue also started training neurodiverse candidatesOpens a new window  to ace video interviews. However, the company has received some negative publicity for its facial analysis technology for some of the reasons mentioned above.

So, How Much Does Facial Analysis Help a Recruiter?
Not enough data exists to assess whether facial analysis perpetuates bias or eliminates it. It demonstrates the potential for both.
The challenge with facial recognition and analysis is not just that the data is limited, but that AI is a field that already has a diversity crisisOpens a new window . Not enough women and other marginalized groups work in the field. So, the concern is that not enough diversity is translating into rigid outcomes from running AI algorithms. Facial recognition or any form of AI is not just as weak/strong as its data set, but also as weak/strong as who is preparing, creating, cleaning, and streamlining these data sets. 
Facial analysis may not be most effective when applied in isolation. It will have to be combined with multiple methods and points of assessment. Human interviewers need to handhold technology as much as they are helped by it to make the right decisions. Spurred by the Black Lives Matter movement, diversity concernsOpens a new window  are causing major upheaval in companies world over with prominent HR leaders stepping down from their positions. 
And until facial analysis reaches an advanced level – or until we have enough data about its effectiveness – adopting a blind hiring + skills-based hiring approach may prove to be most effective in finding the right candidate for the job.

Previously I explained how the team at byteLAKE took their first steps into the world of CFD somewhat 10 years ago. I summarized how we tried different approaches as we progressed and delivered projects focused on both GPU and FPGA adaptation work. While moving to heterogeneous computing seemed like the right and the only choice at that time to speed up the calculations, we always knew something was missing in the equation. Nevertheless, we listened to the voice of our clients and partners and eventually decided to start building a cross-platform solution with the option for extra benefits offered by heterogeneous architectures rather than build a solution that is tied to any particular hardware. Also, having completed several research projects, we saw a great and at the same time uncharted potential for applying AI (Artificial Intelligence) in one more area, this time HPC (High-Performance Computing) industrial simulations.Based on all of these experiences we always asked the following question within the byteLAKE team: could AI enable tremendous acceleration of calculations across the CFD industry? Well, it seems that AI has a lot to offer for CFD. Follow this blog post series to stay up to date with byteLAKE’s CFD Suite development work.byteLAKE’s AI for CFD, CFD Suite is a cross-platform solution and is not tied to any particular hardware. It can work on CPU-only as well as heterogeneous architectures though. We designed in a way that our partners can use CFD Suite in their existing environments and so that no adjustments are needed.So what is byteLAKE’s CFD Suite? It’s a collection of innovative AI Models for CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). We believe we are on our way to offer, through AI, the level of calculations acceleration that is beyond what’s achievable with hardware upgrades or algorithms adaptation to hardware accelerators alone. Needless to say, that the latter approach comes at a huge cost which we aim to eliminate.Trending AI Articles:1. Natural Language Generation:The Commercial State of the Art in 20202.

The models will be generalized so that they can work across various use cases or geometries. We have already reached a milestone where the same model can be successfully used when simulation input parameters change.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite is a collection of innovative AI Models for CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). Ultra-fast results, radically lower TCO. Explore new possibilities. One model even if simulation parameters change.One can say that byteLAKE’s CFD Suite is a collection of plug & play modules or add-ons for your existing CFD software or a collection of tools that can work in parallel to your existing toolchain or simulation workflow. There is no need to make any adjustments to your existing infrastructure. It can work on CPU-only architectures, CPU+GPU, FPGAs being on the roadmap as well, on your laptop/PC, on-premises data center, will be available through our Cloud Computing partners and what have you. In other words, when byteLAKE says you will eventually get an AI model that is trained to handle your simulation(s), you will get a tool that:takes input data which is the same as you now provide to your existing CFD toolsoutput generated will also be compatible with what you are getting through your existing toolchain, meaning can be directly used for visualization purposes in your tools.Artificial Intelligence JobsBottom line is that byteLAKE’s CFD Suite has been designed as a cross-platform solution to address your CFD acceleration needs. Full compatibility with existing environments makes the learning curve as short as possible.AI Models within byteLAKE’s CFD Suite work as plug & play modules or tools, fully compatible with your existing toolchains or infrastructure (no hardware-specific requirements). Their ultimate purpose is to generate CFD simulation results much faster than their counterpart CFD solvers.How does the CFD Suite work? Although it is still a work-in-process with the first product being scheduled for launch in November 2020, let me tell a few words about the underlying architecture as of July 2020. High level view is as illustrated below.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite (High Level)You typically create a line-up of input data describing the phenomena, objects, and related characteristics like i.e. velocities. Such data is then transferred into CFD solvers which produce results sequentially, each iteration or a time step becoming an intermediate result of your simulation. All such intermediate results wrap up into what’s called the simulation result. Then such a result is becoming a foundation for further analysis (and calculations) to answer the designer’s questions, dispel doubts and establish optimal configurations.Process-wise this is unchanged in the case of AI. Only the results (both simulation result, intermediate results if needed, and further calculations) can be produced much faster. It must be noted that AI is just a tool here, used to accelerate the calculations. Thus, there is again no need for any adjustments on your side and it really does not matter if your organization is ready for AI or not. It does not matter whether you have already considered AI within your roadmaps or strategies either. AI is a hidden layer within byteLAKE’s CFD Suite, designed to work seamlessly. As mentioned, its only purpose is to accelerate the calculations and not generate any requirements in terms of organizational changes, infrastructure upgrades, etc.On the inside, you will find byteLAKE’s proprietary combination of various CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), the latter mostly being LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. For time being we are mostly simulating the results for 2D and 3D meshes of sizes respectively from 32x32(x32) to 128x128(x128). The algorithm we are starting with is the general advection algorithm (which is MPDATA in our case; used i.e. in weather simulations as part of the COSMO Model). So far (July 2020) we have successfully predicted the next 8, 16, and 32 steps. Regarding the accuracy, example results are as follows:Pearson’s correlation: 0.75–0.98MSE: 0.03–0.6Relative error: 0.2–15%Depending on scenarios, our neural networks consist of 2–14 layers and we usually train ~10 epochs for quick testing and 100 for general usage. To ensure that the AI Models are not overfitted or under fitted we have also designed a dedicated software auto-tuning mechanism (machine learning) that allows us to optimize the hyperparameters automatically. Software automatic tuning (auto-tuning) is a paradigm enabling software automatic adaptation to a variety of computational conditions.byteLAKE’s software autotuning mechanism, powered by Machine Learning is another tool that ensures optimal configuration and maximum performance of the AI Models within the byteLAKE’s CFD Suite.As pictured below, auto-tuning analyzes the neural networks and for instance, ensures that the AI Models produce accurate results optimally.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite — training history (July 2020)X-Axis: epochsY-Axis: MSEBlue: loss (MSE for training dataset)Red: val-loss (MSE for validation dataset)Currently, the main challenge is to increase the accuracy of predictions of time steps that are based on already predicted intermediate results.Thank you for reading another blog post in the series!

ADVERTISEMENT               What's the news — In a study published this week in the journal Science Robotics, mechanical engineers from the University of Utah designed a way to control the movement of prosthetic limbs that allow for more natural interaction with new environments like balls bouncing into your path or stepping over rocks. Previous work with powered prosthetics relied on preprogrammed behaviors based on the movements of non-amputee individuals, but the authors write that this approach -- while effective -- limits the use of the prosthetic to pre-mapped areas and obstacles. This would work great if you were only walking to the same places every day, but it's not practical to retrain your prosthetic every time you want to go someplace new.See also: Smart, made-to-order limbs are the future of prostheticsInstead of relying on preprogrammed movements to drive their prosthetic, the team turned to an adaptive A.I. that could better learn in the moment how to move.In this study, the researchers used a prosthetic dubbed the ""Utah Lightweight Leg.""Mendez et al., Sci. Robot. 5, eaba6635 (2020)How it works — Coauthor and assistant professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Utah, Tommaso Lenzi, tells Inverse that their A.I. works by collecting information about the user's hip movements and using that to reinterpret the motion of the residual limb. ""When we walk, no two steps are the same,"" says Lenzi. ""If we encounter an obstacle, we lift our foot up and then forward to cross over it without stumbling. All these movements may look very different but have one thing in common: our joints move in synchrony and maximize smoothness... [This is the] principle that our AI system uses. One thousand times a second, the AI looks at the movement of the residual limb (i.e., the user’s biological hip, above the amputation) and plans new movements of the bionics joints that optimize smoothness, mimicking the biological leg.""See also: Soft robotics learned to mimic limb function, changing lives for amputeesThe team recruited three amputee participants and three non-amputee participants to test the A.I. limb in several different scenarios, including walking continuously on a treadmill with obstacles of varying sizes being tossed at them (the smallest being 4 in by 31 in by 2 in and the largest being roughly 1 foot by 2.5 feet by .6 feet) or walking across a short stretch of lab and stepping over obstacles.Using an A.I. powered prosthetic, users were able to clear obstacles with ease.What were the results — In a video released along with the study, the researchers show that participants wearing this A.I. prosthetic were able clear obstacles of increasing size much easier than other participants using passive (or, non-powered) prosthetics. From the video, you can see that the prosthetic limb anticipates the distance needed to clear the obstacle and purposefully bends its knee to accommodate.See also: Researchers just developed a way for prosthetic hands to ""feel""Having the ability to intelligently bend the prosthetic knee can help users' avoid using potentially damaging compensating actions, like swinging their whole leg over the obstacle, as the authors explain in the video.Lenzi tells Inverse that amputee participants were able to traverse obstacles with a similar success rate to their non-amputee counterparts -- though a little bit slower. In theory, Lenzi says their no reason a prosthetic limb like this couldn't be used to help somebody dance at their wedding in the future.What's next — That said, Lenzi tells Inverse that there's still a long path ahead for this research.""[E]very day, we are one step closer to viable bionic legs but we are not there yet,"" says Lenzi. ""Moving from the lab to real-life is not only a scientific challenge but also an engineering challenge. AI and neural interfaces are fundamental but are not going to succeed without strong, efficient, and lightweight designs for these bionic legs. There is still a lot we need to do for the latter.""Going forward, Lenzi says he's excited about working with next-generation prosthetics that users can take home with them as well as developing neural controls that will let users more intimately control their prosthetic.Abstract: Powered prostheses aim to mimic the missing biological limb with controllers that are finely tuned to replicate the nominal gait pattern of non-amputee individuals. Unfortunately, this control approach poses a problem with real-world ambulation, which includes tasks such as crossing over obstacles, where the prosthesis trajectory must be modified to provide adequate foot clearance and ensure timely foot placement. Here, we show an indirect volitional control approach that enables prosthesis users to walk at different speeds while smoothly and continuously crossing over obstacles of different sizes without explicit classification of the environment. At the high level, the proposed controller relies on a heuristic algorithm to continuously change the maximum knee flexion angle and the swing duration in harmony with the user’s residual limb. At the low level, minimum-jerk planning is used to continuously adapt the swing trajectory while maximizing smoothness. Experiments with three individuals with above-knee amputation show that the proposed control approach allows for volitional control of foot clearance, which is necessary to negotiate environmental barriers. Our study suggests that a powered prosthesis controller with intrinsic, volitional adaptability may provide prosthesis users with functionality that is not currently available, facilitating real-world ambulation.Learn Something New Every DaySubscribe for free to Inverse’s award-winning daily newsletter!SubmitBy subscribing to this BDG newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyMore Like ThisRelated TagsHealthBiologyA.I.",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', 'headline': 'Artificial intelligence: Engineers reveal a prosthetic leg with a mind of its own', 'description': '""Every day, we are one step closer to viable bionic legs.""
