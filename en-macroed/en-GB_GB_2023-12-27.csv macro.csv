In many cases, it's become a part of their daily routines.AI has gone from feeling like an abstract idea to a familiar tool that can streamline workflows and generate new ideas. But not everyone has welcomed the technology, and instead see it as a threat to their very careers. It's a push-and-pull that's defined this year.The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it. They also give us a peek into how AI might shape 2024, as the technology continues to evolve at lightning pace.Workers are already depending on AIMany employees have grown accustomed to using AI in their daily jobs for time-saving administrative tasks, particularly rudimentary writing and basic ideation. This is especially the case in knowledge-work positions, where AI shows potential to free up workers to do creative, more sophisticated tasks. (Some workers are even using the technology to write resumes and cover letters to get those jobs in the first place.)But as more workers utilise AI, some employers are responding by curbing the technology's use in the workplace. This has included tacitly suppressing or outright banning access to tools like ChatGPT, with organisations worried about potential misuse or data leaks, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US. Yet some employees who've come to heavily rely on the tools, whether for increased productivity or to get a leg up on colleagues, have had to backchannel to retain access. Social-media communities have even offered tips on how to secretly access the technology at work.AlamySome skilled jobs workers considered shielded from generative AI are now facing threats with evolving technology (Credit: Alamy)AI is evolving to target some office jobs Many people assumed AI would most likely replace humans in roles that are easily automated: think the customer service chatbots and grocery-delivering robots already busy at work.But as it has evolved in the past year, it's clear that it could impact more complex knowledge work roles once considered ""safe"". Some creative jobs are already being threatened. For example, text-to-image generative AI programs like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create dazzling illustrations and photorealistic renders in moments – work that's typically reserved for highly skilled commercial art teams.Data shows there's validity to workers' worries. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans – equating to 300 million jobs lost across Europe and the US.""This isn't somebody else's problem now. It's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at US economic think tank organisation the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, DC. ""We don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""But some jobs won't be replaced – yetFor all the fear, however, there are many roles and tasks that AI won't be capable of performing in the near future. That's particularly the case with jobs that demand soft skills, such as emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything, believes workers whose job it is to come up with new business strategies may be relatively safe from automation. He also predicts roles that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships – for example, nurses and business consultants – are hard for machines to replace. These are jobs, he says, that require ""a very deep understanding of people. I think it'll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships"".Additionally, trade jobs that far pre-date digital work environments – such as electricians, plumbers and welders – are among the ""hardest of anything to automate"", says Ford. These jobs are less reliant on language-based tasks and typically require greater problem-solving ability, mobility and dexterity in unpredictable environments that machines cannot currently mimic.AlamyExperts say there are still jobs that require a human touch, such as doctors, that are not yet vulnerable to AI replacement (Credit: Alamy)We're also going to work with AIAs AI becomes more ubiquitous, some experts believe the technology is actually more likely to augment – rather than replace – human talent. Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, cites medical diagnoses as an example. While a robot may be able to detect cancer, for instance, most patients would prefer a qualified medical professional to break the news.Workers are already utilising ChatGPT as a personal assistant, using it to draft emails, plan itineraries and project costs and timelines. More broadly, professionals are already using AI to help eliminate bias in decision making – some large corporations are already employing data-driven recruitment to test candidates' qualities, with behavioural insights matching them with the right vacancy.And while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones; for example, data engineers, governance specialists and a host of ""training"" roles. Alongside much fear and uncertainty, there's optimismAI may be the technology of the day, but it's far from the first to disrupt the workforce. Technology has advanced exponentially over the decades, from the rise of automation in mechanics, to office computers and wireless internet. ""Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, it has the potential to automate or streamline work processes,"" says Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at PwC, based in Austin, US. ""However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements.""Experts recommend that rather than worry about the threat of AI, it's more useful to think of it as a tool. The best tactic? Adapt, learn and lean into the technology, says Likens. ""Education and training [are] key for employees to learn about AI and what it can do for their particular role, as well as help them develop new skills. Instead of shying away from AI, employees should plan to embrace and educate.""Artificial intelligenceWork cultureYear in review 2023FeaturesHow we work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Updated: Dec 29, 2023




The rise in sophistication and availability of generative AI tools has opened up immense potential for humans to make their lives easier by shifting some of their tasks to such tools. And that potential certainly extends to the workplace where many employees have discovered generative AI can do a lot of their work for them, as Alex Christian discusses in an article for BBC Worklife. These AI applications range from writing assistance to more complex problem-solving tools.




While these tools can significantly enhance efficiency and creativity, their clandestine use raises several concerns for employers.



AI’s Accuracy Issues
AI, particularly in its generative forms, is not always accurate or reliable. Employers should be concerned about the potential for AI to produce erroneous results or suggestions, which could lead to flawed decision-making or inaccurate work outputs. The lack of oversight on AI-generated content could result in significant errors going unnoticed until they cause substantial problems.

	



Risk of Intellectual Property Violation
Generative AI may inadvertently produce content that violates intellectual property (IP) rights. This is particularly risky when AI tools are used to generate marketing materials, reports, or creative content. The AI could replicate or slightly modify existing copyrighted material without proper attribution or permission, potentially leading to legal issues for the company.



Sensitive Information at Risk
When employees use AI tools, especially those hosted on external platforms, there’s a risk of inputting sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information into these systems. This could lead to unintentional data breaches or unintended sharing of sensitive information, where sensitive company information is exposed or compromised. Employers need to be aware of the types of data being fed into AI tools and ensure that confidential information is adequately protected.



The secret use of AI tools by employees in the workplace is a multi-faced issue. While it can lead to increased efficiency and innovation, it also poses significant risks in terms of accuracy, intellectual property rights, and data security. Employers need to be proactive in addressing these issues, potentially by setting clear policies on AI tool usage and ensuring that employees are trained on the responsible and safe use of these technologies. By doing so, companies can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.

Starting with ChatGPT’s release in November 2022, this space has evolved so quickly that it’s hard to believe that it’s been just one year in which all these advancements have come out.While the results are quite amazing, the underlying complexity has led a lot of people to publicly speculate on how these large language models (LLMs) work. Some people have speculated that these models are pulling from a preformulated database of responses, and some have gone as far to speculate that these LLMs have gained a human-level of sentience. These are extreme stances, and as you might guess, both are incorrect.You may have heard that these LLMs are next-word predictors, meaning that they use probability to determine the next word that should come in a sentence. This understanding is technically correct, but it’s a little too high level to sufficiently understand these models. In order to build a stronger intuition, we need to go deeper.

The prompt asked for a 1,200 word article (a number it undercut by quite a margin) that explored both the potential negative and positive outcomes of the technology. We then asked it to include real world examples, which is apparently beyond its capabilities. We also asked it to include a section on the recent Sam Altman debacle which, as you will soon read, was also not a topic it was particularly capable at describing. Below is the unedited output with light changes for formatting.Navigating the future of Generative AI: Balancing exciting possibilities and potential pitfallsGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful force, reshaping the technological landscape with its ability to create content autonomously. From language models like GPT-3 to image-generating algorithms, generative AI holds immense promise for the future. However, this promising future is not without its challenges. In this article, we will explore the potential negative outcomes and the most exciting possibilities of generative AI, aiming to strike a balance between optimism and caution. Additionally, we'll address the recent leadership shift involving Sam Altman at OpenAI, shedding light on the ethical considerations associated with AI development.Sam Altman's Leadership Shift: Lessons in ethical AIIn recent months, the AI community witnessed a significant leadership shift at OpenAI involving Sam Altman. The CEO, known for his influential role in steering OpenAI's initiatives, faced a period of controversy surrounding his firing and subsequent re-hiring. This incident underscored the challenges associated with ethical considerations in AI development and management.Addressing ethical concerns: Sam Altman's leadership shift prompted a reevaluation of ethical considerations in AI development and organizational decision-making. The incident raised questions about transparency, accountability, and the need for robust ethical frameworks to guide the development and deployment of AI technologies.Transparency and accountability: The leadership transition emphasized the importance of transparency in organizational decision-making, especially in contexts where AI technologies with widespread implications are involved. It highlighted the necessity of holding leaders and organizations accountable for their actions and ensuring that ethical guidelines are followed.Community involvement: The controversy surrounding Sam Altman's leadership shift also brought to light the significance of involving the wider community in decisions related to AI development. The call for more inclusive decision-making processes gained momentum, reinforcing the idea that diverse perspectives are crucial in navigating the ethical challenges associated with AI technologies. Photoshop (AI prompt: ""The future of generative AI in manga style"")The potential negative outcomesEthical concerns and biasOne of the primary concerns with generative AI lies in its susceptibility to biases present in training data. If the data used to train these models reflects societal biases, the AI may inadvertently perpetuate and amplify those biases in its generated content. Addressing this issue is crucial to prevent AI systems from unintentionally reinforcing and spreading harmful stereotypes.Security threats and DeepfakesThe ability of generative AI to produce highly realistic and convincing content raises serious security concerns. Deepfakes, for instance, are AI-generated images or videos that manipulate and superimpose content onto real footage. This technology can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating fake news, impersonating individuals, or spreading misinformation. As generative AI becomes more sophisticated, the challenge of distinguishing between real and fake content becomes increasingly difficult.Privacy invasionThe advancements in generative AI also raise concerns about privacy invasion. The ability to generate realistic images and videos of individuals who never participated in such content creation poses a risk to personal privacy. Protecting individuals from the unauthorized use of their likeness in AI-generated content will be a pressing issue in the coming years.Unemployment and Economic DisruptionThe automation capabilities of generative AI may lead to workforce displacement in certain industries. Jobs that involve routine and repetitive tasks, such as content creation, could be at risk. Striking a balance between technological advancement and societal well-being will be a challenge to ensure that AI complements human labor rather than replaces it.Moral and Ethical DilemmasAs AI systems become more proficient in generating content that mimics human creativity, ethical questions arise. For instance, who owns the rights to AI-generated art or literature? Determining the legal and moral implications of creations produced by non-human entities challenges our conventional understanding of authorship and intellectual property. Photoshop (AI prompt: ""futuristic AI utopia"")The Most Exciting PossibilitiesEnhanced Creativity and ProductivityGenerative AI has the potential to amplify human creativity and productivity by automating mundane tasks, allowing individuals to focus on more complex and strategic aspects of their work. In fields like content creation, design, and marketing, AI can assist and inspire, leading to a surge in innovation and efficiency.Revolutionizing HealthcareThe future of generative AI promises breakthroughs in healthcare, from drug discovery to personalized medicine. AI models can analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and propose novel solutions, significantly accelerating the pace of medical research and improving patient outcomes.Customized User ExperiencesAs generative AI continues to evolve, it can provide highly personalized and tailored experiences for users. From adaptive learning platforms to content recommendations, AI systems can understand individual preferences and behaviors, offering a more seamless and engaging user experience.Human-AI CollaborationInstead of replacing human roles, generative AI is likely to enhance collaboration between humans and machines. AI tools can serve as creative partners, aiding professionals in various fields to achieve outcomes that wouldn't be possible with traditional methods alone. This collaborative approach can lead to unprecedented levels of innovation.Innovations in Art and EntertainmentGenerative AI is already making waves in the art world, creating unique pieces that challenge traditional notions of creativity. In the entertainment industry, AI-driven content creation can open new avenues for storytelling, virtual worlds, and interactive experiences, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in these fields.ConclusionThe future of generative AI is a double-edged sword, offering both exciting possibilities and potential pitfalls. As we navigate this technological landscape, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the ethical concerns and negative outcomes associated with generative AI.

The New York Times Sues OpenAI and Microsoft for Training Generative AI Models With Copyrighted Work



Eric Hal Schwartz  on December 27, 2023 at 12:00 pm

The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement for using millions of Times articles without permission to train their generative AI models. Court documents filed this week in Manhattan’s Federal District Court contend that OpenAI and Microsoft copied substantial portions of the Times’ archive of articles without permission to develop the large language models powering products like ChatGPT and Copilot.
Times Training
The newspaper claims that OpenAI and Microsoft’s acts constitute willful copyright infringement under federal law. The Times is seeking an injunction that would require Microsoft and OpenAI to stop using its content, along with monetary compensation potentially in the billions of dollars based on the widespread use of the companies’ AI services. That use, according to the complaint, harmed the Times by allowing the AI systems to provide Times content for free.
“[OpenAI and Microsoft] seek to free-ride on the Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products without permission or payment,” the lawsuit states. “If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill. Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”
The core issue is whether web scraping done by generative AI companies to obtain training data from news sites and other sources qualifies as fair use under copyright law. Tech firms argue it does, while publishers contend their content cannot legally be copied at scale without permission or payment. Hundreds of media organizations, including The Times, have implemented technical measures to block their sites from being scraped without consent.
Access Allegations
The Times alleges OpenAI and Microsoft copied millions of articles dating back to the 1980s before those measures were implemented as a way to train LLMs and writing tools like that directly compete against its journalism. In addition, the hallucinations that the models produce can include made-up quotes and facts attributed to The New York Times, which might damage the factual integrity of its reporting. The lawsuit cites several such instances from Microsoft’s Bing generative AI chatbot.
“We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from AI technology and new revenue models. Our ongoing conversations with The New York Times have been productive and moving forward constructively, so we are surprised and disappointed with this development,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.”
This isn’t the first lawsuit OpenAI has faced over where it obtained generative AI training data. That has prompted the partnerships the company referenced in its statement. For instance, the Associated Press and OpenAI have struck a deal to allow OpenAI access to the AP’s archive of text, images, and video for training ChatGPT. OpenAI has also just announced a deal with Berlin-based publishing giant Axel Springer to integrate articles from its publications into ChatGPT, providing answers to users and a data pipeline for training OpenAI’s LLMs.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Video game companies are dipping their toes into the rapidly-evolving world of generative AI with behind-the-scenes development. It may soon be applied to actual gameplay. 
A recent example came earlier this month from the Seattle-based creators of the popular social app Rec Room, which debuted Fractura, an in-game room created as a “research project” to demonstrate how players can use generative AI to create their own content for Rec Room.
The Seattle startup evaluated more than 20 different tools in the process of designing Fractura, such as ChatGPT to develop and iterate on their ideas, including the creation of a “bible” for Fractura’s backstory. It visualized ideas via Midjourney and DALL-E, and turned the resulting images into 3D assets with CSM and Shap-E. Finally, Fractura’s alien skies were built out with Skybox, an AI tool from Blockade Labs.
“Despite some challenges,” Rec Room wrote in a blog post, “the future for 3D GenAI looks bright, and the team looks forward to further explorations!”
Like anywhere else in tech, the debate over AI has been one of the running themes of 2023 in the games industry. Much of that debate, however, has been crowded out of the limelight by other concerns, such as a year-long wave of layoffs that has cost roughly 10,000 developers their jobs since January. 
When work in the field is already unstable, no developer that I’ve spoken to has been enthusiastic about the advent of technology that could be (read: inevitably will be) used to automate and eliminate somebody’s position.
However, generative AI is already helping some studios behind the scenes.

By giving ChatGPT access to the code base for its free-to-play arena shooter RoboSquad Revolution, New York-based Zollpa has turned it into a useful assistant for playtesting, training, code analysis, and integrating new programs.
Zollpa also trained AI to go through its recorded gameplay footage and pick out particular clips based upon recognizable keywords, such as “bug” or “Steam Play.” The AI can then organize a list and assign the potential issue to the most relevant members of the team.
“It’s definitely helped with our productivity in general, so we don’t have to watch and rewatch our gameplay videos,” said Joey Thigpen, co-lead developer.
There is an important distinction to be made between using generative AI to accelerate development processes, and using the technology to make a game with content generated by AI, said David Ryan Hunt, CEO of Noodle Cat Games in Salt Lake City.
“We’ve put a lot of attention on, ‘Oh, I made a cool picture by typing a few words!’” said Hunt. “But the reality of game development is that the majority of the work that goes into making a product is unseen.”
As Hunt notes, AI art and prose are what get all the attention in this conversation, and they also carry legal and ethical challenges.
Plagiarism stew
Generative AI tools are trained on data, much of which is scraped from publicly available online sources, which can include identifiable snippets from copyrighted work. Despite how it looks, and how it’s sold, publicly available AI isn’t creating anything; it’s grabbing everything it can find and boiling it for soup.
Professional artists such as Greg Rutkowski have discovered their online portfolios have been “harvested” by AI tools, which has flooded the internet with artwork that vaguely resembles their own styles. Some have gone so far as to fight back with tools like Nightshade, which “poisons” online artwork in ways that disrupt AI models using it as training data.
Several companies have preemptively banned AI tools for use in related projects. Valve Software made a few headlines in June when it rejected a game that was submitted for publication via its online storefront Steam, on the basis that it had been made using AI.
The game developer took to Reddit to complain on the subject, which spurred a public statement from Valve in response. According to Valve, it wasn’t the AI tools themselves, but rather, the significant risk that material produced with those tools has likely violated someone’s copyright.
“The introduction of AI can sometimes make it harder to show a developer has sufficient rights in using AI to create assets, including images, text, and music,” a Valve representative told GeekWire in July.
Valve continued: “In particular, there is some legal uncertainty relating to data used to train AI models. It is the developer’s responsibility to make sure they have the appropriate rights to ship their game. …While developers can use these AI technologies in their work with appropriate commercial licenses, they can not infringe on existing copyrights.”
Bellevue, Wash.-based Valve has consistently taken a zero-tolerance stance on any new technologies that could cause legal issues. It previously banned “play-to-earn” games on Steam in 2021, in which users could generate small amounts of cryptocurrency or collect special NFT drops by playing games.
Meanwhile, one of Steam’s competitors, the Epic Games Store, has stepped in as a storefront that will take Web3 projects, and as of September, may also be open to hosting AI-developed games.
AI content generation

It’s worth restating: the problem with generative AI in video games, at least for the time being, isn’t inherent to the tools. It’s typically with the data that’s been used to train those tools, and how the tools regurgitate that data. An AI that’s simply trained using whatever data it can find can pose some serious risks, up to and including the possibility of having illegal material in its dataset.
If best practices are pursued, though, generative AI has a number of potential applications in game design, particularly in the field of content created by users. 
Microsoft made headlines earlier this fall through its partnership with Inworld.AI, which promises to bring unspecified “AI-powered” upgrades to future Xbox games. In theory, AI could remove certain current limitations in game narrative, such as removing the need for generic NPC dialogue. Instead of having a few scripted lines and coded behaviors, AI-driven characters could react realistically to whatever happens to or around them.
For a more specific example, there’s Adventure Forge, scheduled for release on Steam Early Access in early 2024. It’s a no-code toolset by Seattle-area company Endless Adventures, which players can use to create their own original games, ranging from dungeon crawlers to visual novels.
This includes a built-in Stable Diffusion system by Scenario.GG that has only been trained on art assets that were created for the project by Endless Adventures. Everything that could be created for Adventure Forge with its built-in generative AI, such as new maps or in-game props, would thus fall under Endless Adventures’ copyright.
Adventure Forge will ship with over 1,500 environmental assets for players to use in their games, such as floors, walls, and furniture. In previous generations of homebrew software, those assets would be all users had to work with for the duration. With Scenario.GG’s system, though, players can simply create new Adventure Forge assets on the spot.
“This is not technology for technology’s sake,” Endless Adventures CEO Jordan Weisman told GeekWire. “This is from people whose whole lives have been about storytelling, and we want to empower storytelling, but we want to do it in a responsible way.”
Reality check

The advancements from generative AI for game studios, for now, may not be massive. 
“A lot of the capabilities that we have now are not very far removed from procedural generation and various types of algorithms that we’ve been using in games for decades,” said Hunt. 
You’ve likely played a video game that uses procedural generation. These are created with a number of handcrafted assets, which are assembled algorithmically into a randomized order. The most famous example may be the dungeons in Blizzard’s action-RPG series Diablo, which are different every time you play the game.
The distinction between procedural generation and generative AI may seem academic from a player’s perspective, but under the hood, they’re doing two very different things. If you picture game design as a set of building blocks, then procedural generation rearranges building blocks according to a pre-programmed algorithm. Generative AI tries to create new blocks there on the spot, based on the data it’s accumulated on how blocks are supposed to work.
“We automate all sorts of different pieces of development,” said Hunt, who previously worked on Fortnite at Epic Games. “It’s not specific to AI. It’s just how the industry works.”
Current generative AI, from Hunt’s perspective, is a more advanced version of automated technologies that have already been in use in game development. Under the hood, many of the use cases for AI in game development are a simple step up from understood best practices, he said. 
“There’s a big gap to me,” Hunt said, “between the discourse around AI and the practical reality of what it’s likely to look like over time.”
Over the course of the last year, bad actors have used various AI/LLM tools to create everything from quick cash-grabs, such as churning out nonsensical children’s books or flooding a sci-fi magazine with submissions, to scams that involve cloning someone’s voice in order to extort money out of their relatives.
In the games industry, there are already stories of people using the same tools to turn out simple games in a week or less. The concern is that we’re on the verge of a dark age of auto-generated machine garbage, in a business where many open storefronts already have real issues with “troll games.”
It’s likely that as its usage increases, many of the problems with AI will get worse before they get better. In the meantime, that only makes it more important to find ways to filter the signal from the noise.

Grynbaum and Ryan MacDec. 27, 2023Leer en españolThe New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.” It also calls for the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from The Times.In its complaint, The Times said it approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to raise concerns about the use of its intellectual property and explore “an amicable resolution,” possibly involving a commercial agreement and “technological guardrails” around generative A.I. products. But it said the talks had not produced a resolution.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAn OpenAI spokeswoman, Lindsey Held, said in a statement that the company had been “moving forward constructively” in conversations with The Times and that it was “surprised and disappointed” by the lawsuit.“We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from A.I. technology and new revenue models,” Ms. Held said. “We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.”Microsoft declined to comment on the case.The lawsuit could test the emerging legal contours of generative A.I. technologies — so called for the text, images and other content they can create after learning from large data sets — and could carry major implications for the news industry. The Times is among a small number of outlets that have built successful business models from online journalism, but dozens of newspapers and magazines have been hobbled by readers’ migration to the internet.At the same time, OpenAI and other A.I. tech firms — which use a wide variety of online texts, from newspaper articles to poems to screenplays, to train chatbots — are attracting billions of dollars in funding.OpenAI is now valued by investors at more than $80 billion. Microsoft has committed $13 billion to OpenAI and has incorporated the company’s technology into its Bing search engine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” the complaint says, accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of “using The Times’s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it.”The defendants have not had an opportunity to respond in court.Concerns about the uncompensated use of intellectual property by A.I. systems have coursed through creative industries, given the technology’s ability to mimic natural language and generate sophisticated written responses to virtually any prompt.The actress Sarah Silverman joined a pair of lawsuits in July that accused Meta and OpenAI of having “ingested” her memoir as a training text for A.I. programs. Novelists expressed alarm when it was revealed that A.I. systems had absorbed tens of thousands of books, leading to a lawsuit by authors including Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham. Getty Images, the photography syndicate, sued one A.I. company that generates images based on written prompts, saying the platform relies on unauthorized use of Getty’s copyrighted visual materials.The boundaries of copyright law often get new scrutiny at moments of technological change — like the advent of broadcast radio or digital file-sharing programs like Napster — and the use of artificial intelligence is emerging as the latest frontier.

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.“A Supreme Court decision is essentially inevitable,” Richard Tofel, a former president of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to the news business, said of the latest flurry of lawsuits. “Some of the publishers will settle for some period of time — including still possibly The Times — but enough publishers won’t that this novel and crucial issue of copyright law will need to be resolved.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMicrosoft has previously acknowledged potential copyright concerns over its A.I. products. In September, the company announced that if customers using its A.I. tools were hit with copyright complaints, it would indemnify them and cover the associated legal costs.Other voices in the technology industry have been more steadfast in their approach to copyright. In October, Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm and early backer of OpenAI, wrote in comments to the U.S. Copyright Office that exposing A.I. companies to copyright liability would “either kill or significantly hamper their development.”“The result will be far less competition, far less innovation and very likely the loss of the United States’ position as the leader in global A.I. development,” the investment firm said in its statement.Besides seeking to protect intellectual property, the lawsuit by The Times casts ChatGPT and other A.I. systems as potential competitors in the news business. When chatbots are asked about current events or other newsworthy topics, they can generate answers that rely on journalism by The Times. The newspaper expresses concern that readers will be satisfied with a response from a chatbot and decline to visit The Times’s website, thus reducing web traffic that can be translated into advertising and subscription revenue.The complaint cites several examples when a chatbot provided users with near-verbatim excerpts from Times articles that would otherwise require a paid subscription to view. It asserts that OpenAI and Microsoft placed particular emphasis on the use of Times journalism in training their A.I. programs because of the perceived reliability and accuracy of the material.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMedia organizations have spent the past year examining the legal, financial and journalistic implications of the boom in generative A.I. Some news outlets have already reached agreements for the use of their journalism: The Associated Press struck a licensing deal in July with OpenAI, and Axel Springer, the German publisher that owns Politico and Business Insider, did likewise this month. Terms for those agreements were not disclosed.The Times is exploring how to use the nascent technology itself. The newspaper recently hired an editorial director of artificial intelligence initiatives to establish protocols for the newsroom’s use of A.I. and examine ways to integrate the technology into the company’s journalism.In one example of how A.I. systems use The Times’s material, the suit showed that Browse With Bing, a Microsoft search feature powered by ChatGPT, reproduced almost verbatim results from Wirecutter, The Times’s product review site. The text results from Bing, however, did not link to the Wirecutter article, and they stripped away the referral links in the text that Wirecutter uses to generate commissions from sales based on its recommendations.“Decreased traffic to Wirecutter articles and, in turn, decreased traffic to affiliate links subsequently lead to a loss of revenue for Wirecutter,” the complaint states.The lawsuit also highlights the potential damage to The Times’s brand through so-called A.I. “hallucinations,” a phenomenon in which chatbots insert false information that is then wrongly attributed to a source. The complaint cites several cases in which Microsoft’s Bing Chat provided incorrect information that was said to have come from The Times, including results for “the 15 most heart-healthy foods,” 12 of which were not mentioned in an article by the paper.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill,” the complaint reads. It adds, “Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”The Times has retained the law firms Susman Godfrey and Rothwell, Figg, Ernst & Manbeck as outside counsel for the litigation. Susman represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation case against Fox News, which resulted in a $787.5 million settlement in April. Susman also filed a proposed class action suit last month against Microsoft and OpenAI on behalf of nonfiction authors whose books and other copyrighted material were used to train the companies’ chatbots.Benjamin Mullin contributed reporting.Michael M.

Will artificial intelligence kill jobs and businesses?
 by Alisa Nelson | Dec 29, 2023Sadie St. Lawrence (Photo courtesy of the Missouri School Boards' Association)


A report by an international consulting firm says businesses who adopted artificial intelligence early on experienced a 100% cash flow increase. According to a McKinsey & Company report, if businesses don’t adopt AI, they will see a 20% cash flow decline.
One of the country’s leading artificial intelligence experts, Sadie St. Lawrence, said if businesses start using AI, they will still see a cash flow increase.
“The key message is just start, right? Just start because this wave is coming and it’s going to take you no matter what,” St. Lawrence told Missourinet.
Whether artificial intelligence will be a job killer is a question popping up by some people in the business world. St. Lawrence said a study by Open AI and a few other collaborators shows artificial intelligence cannot replace a worker’s entire job.
“What it did is it could do a few of the tasks within their job,” said St. Lawrence. “And that’s why I think it’s so important for individuals to realize it’s here to augment you. And that’s where those efficiency gains are given, right? It’s by having your employees work alongside it, work with it, but it can’t do everything that they do.”
AI has ranked in the 98 percentile of IQ tests. It has passed almost every AP, science, history, and writing exam, along with medical board exams and the LSATs. 
Artificial intelligence is making its way in the classroom, the workplace, the battlefield, and likely the 2024 elections. St. Lawrence said to protect your privacy, stay away from the free AI tools.
“Do I have concerns about, you know, my own privacy and then the privacy of others? But finally, how is it using that information? Is it spreading misinformation? So I think we’re about to really enter a privacy and information almost war than we’ve never seen before,” said St. Lawrence.

Generative AI has sparked a tremendous backlash across the internet, as the early promise of the technology has been overshadowed by the wide range of problems it has introduced.

Here are some of the reasons why the public is pushing back against AI in the arts:


Generative AI Is Impractical
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, and image generators like Midjourney and Dall-E, have introduced a new copyright conundrum, and provoked multiple lawsuits alleging copyright infringement.

PROMOTED
It’s true that no artist was asked if their work could be used to train these models. But even if the courts rule in favor of the machines, the practical application of the technology doesn’t seem worth the cost.

Generative AI is incredibly energy-intensive, surprisingly labor-intensive, and requires constant input — annotation — from human workers to keep it functional, lest it spiral into hallucinogenic nonsense.

Using ChatGPT for a playful Q&A session consumes an absurd amount of water; exchanging a mere 20 questions with the text generator is akin to pouring a 500ml bottle of clean freshwater down the drain.

Even with all this human effort to keep the technology anchored in reality, AI is predicted to damage itself when it inevitably starts consuming its own output, like a species inbred to extinction.
Not to mention, the constant slurry pouring out of the image generators are clogging up Google Image search.
In the future, children will learn about our era of climate catastrophe, and struggle to understand why we burned energy with such reckless abandon; billionaire space tourism, celebrity private jets, NFT minting, and now, generative AI.
What’s it all for?
What’s The Point of AI Art?
Generative AI has given the public the means to instantly create an image, or piece of writing, that looks as though it took time and effort. Art can now be manifested via the touch of a button, a prompt or two, as effortless as ordering fast food.
The technology is a solution to a problem that never existed. Artists, as much as they like to complain about the struggle of the creative process, enjoy making things. The creative process is incredibly rewarding, even if the final piece doesn’t match up to the original vision.
Artists are watching the skills that they have spent their life sharpening being devalued before their eyes.
Worse, their work was absorbed into the dataset without their knowledge or consent; they have been used to train their own replacement, and no one asked for permission.
Generative AI threatens the livelihood of artists, pitting their labor against the cheap slop produced by dead machines. The technology only benefits those who wish to produce content as quickly and cheaply as possible, by removing artists from the creative process.
If you think pop culture has become too bland and algorithmic nowadays, just wait until the content is being produced by actual algorithms — in hindsight, we probably shouldn’t have let the word “content” catch on.
AI-generated media will likely not result in thoughtful, imaginative, and groundbreaking stories; the concern is that the hype cycle will last long enough to damage the career prospects of working creatives.
AI Is Not Learning Like A Human
Many AI enthusiasts argue that machine learning is analogous to human learning, that stealing the work of artists to fill datasets is the same as humans taking artistic inspiration from others.
Generative AI, however, is not conscious. It’s not even close.
There’s a widely held belief among AI enthusiasts that the technology will only grow more intelligent as the years pass. Some have even been possessed with a kind of evangelical zeal, under the impression that AI will eventually evolve into a fully conscious being, AGI, that will lead humanity to the singularity.
Noam Chomsky and his co-authors argued against this reductive worldview in a NYTimes Op-Ed, writing:
“The human mind is not, like ChatGPT and its ilk, a lumbering statistical engine for pattern matching, gorging on hundreds of terabytes of data ... it seeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to create explanations.”
Credulous billionaire Elon Musk is a good example of a high-profile figure who firmly believes the AI hype. Musk spends much of his time repeating the wildest predictions of science fiction authors — that is, when he’s not endorsing the Great Replacement theory on “X,” the bot-riddled website formally known as Twitter.
Ironically, the decline of “X” shows the corrosive effects of generative AI; the technology has created an ocean of spam that clogs every post, turning replies into mindless mush. LLMs have given bots the ability to imitate human speech, but not to make interesting human conversation.
They never say anything worth listening to. How can they, when they have no ability to understand context, no perspective from which to view the world?
This lack of understanding results in boring output.
AI Art Is Boring
Have you ever seen generative AI create anything even remotely interesting, beyond grotesquely amusing memes? That might just be the best use for them; the uncanny, plastic sheen of AI imagery is perfect for the weird world of memes.
The most intriguing element of AI art is surely the mistakes — crowds with melted faces, hands with withered fingers, extra digits, and limbs sprouting from places they simply shouldn’t.
Zooming into AI images often reveals unsettling elements, evidence that the image was created by a dead machine, with none of the intent of a human creator.
When we immerse ourselves in art, we experience a touch of the unique perspective that an artist brings to their work, the smeared fingerprints that makes art worth talking about.
It is telling that AI can be used to write an essay, but never a good story; it has no perspective to speak from, no odd fixations, perversions or eccentricities that a person injects into their art. It’s just a bland amalgamation of what has come before.
AI could perhaps write a forgettable, formulaic superhero movie, but it could never surprise us with a fresh spin on a familiar genre — the dead machine can only reconstruct art from tattered pieces it has already eaten.
AI will not surprise us, or produce work that inspires a range of imitators; it will never mimic the insight of The Sopranos, the boundless imagination of One Piece, or even the lighthearted political commentary of Barbie — it certainly could never create something as wonderfully enigmatic as Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron.
In fact, when Miyazaki first encountered AI-generated art, he reacted with visceral disgust. A now-famous clip shows the legendary animator watching a presentation on Artificial Intelligence in animation, and being told that the intent is to create a machine that can “draw like a human.”
Miyazaki replied, ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.""
