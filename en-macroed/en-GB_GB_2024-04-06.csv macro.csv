I’ve been in the business of helping major, multinational companies build workforce resilience for more than a decade. Now, a once-in-a-generation change is upon us. With generative AI, we will soon surmount one of the biggest obstacles to improving how people work and live: making vast, complex workforce well-being data accessible, understandable, and actionable.


The power of resilient workforces for business growth is undeniable. As AON research shows, organizations that improve well-being increase company performance by up to 55%. In my company, we’ve helped our customers lower turnover, decrease burnout, and save millions of dollars by building the resilience of their workforce.

PROMOTED
This work begins with methodologically rigorous data collection on core psychological factors that influence workforce performance. For example, which departments have strong problem-solving skills, or lack a sense of trust? Which division shows emotional signs of stress, such as anger or frustration?

Data collection is non-negotiable. You can’t fix what you can’t see. At the same time, we are more motivated to fix what we can see, especially when we understand why performance and engagement problems are occurring and how to address them.

Getting to that “why” is the hard part. A tremendous amount of complex information comes out of the data collection. Leaders typically do not have the skills or the staff to analyze it, let alone operationalize it. Training up or hiring new staff isn’t affordable for most businesses. In an era of scarce labor, finding the right talent is itself a problem.

We turn the lights on with generative AI.
Pair thorough psycho-cognitive data collection with the astounding analytic capacity of generative AI, and we get sophisticated workforce insights faster, more efficiently, and in ordinary language. We will not need Ph.D.-level analyst support to understand what the information’s telling us. We’ll be able to enhance and advance our well-being and resilience data in a snap. With generative AI, we can be the data professionals who truly know what’s going on in our companies.
With this analysis, C-suite leaders and managers alike will also be able to see clearly which actions best foster resilience in their people. The clarity will in turn equip us to take swift, accurate, and effective action.
What’s more, as we build our generative AI tools to speak in natural language, we’ll be able to share our data insights with colleagues and supervisors simply and persuasively. The all-important “why” that drives engagement—from individual employee behavior change for greater resilience to CHRO sign-off on a resilience initiative—will be at our fingertips.
With generative AI tools, business and HR leaders will be able to:


Be more connected to our businesses. AI will help us identify, with unprecedented speed, which specific business units are struggling with resilience and in which ways. If sales has low confidence, or a shipping unit has high anxiety, we’ll be able to pinpoint those trends precisely.
Understand how motivational and behavioral factors drive performance. These tools will show how underlying psychosocial factors drive engagement, i.e., how lack of confidence relates to burnout rates, or how poor emotion control can drive low productivity.
Operationalize our knowledge. Generative AI will help us connect data analysis with action. Which resilience-based interventions are proven to best improve chronic frustration? What’s our most effective path to greater problem-solving skill? Then we’ll be able to deploy those plans.
Share insights across departments and job roles. No longer will we struggle to convey what we’ve learned to our customers and colleagues. With precise insights delivered in ordinary language, generative AI lets all stakeholders see how key psycho-cognitive factors impact performance and how to most effectively address them. We’ll be able to see the likely upside of taking action, as well as the risk of doing nothing


Generative AI to build resilience in the workforce may well be revolutionary technology. Let’s be clear, though. AI is not the endgame. It is only a tool, and one that needs strong, ethical standards to govern our use of it. But as we develop this tool, as it helps us see and solve problems better and faster, it will accelerate our power to build exceptional workforces, grow our businesses, and know what it takes to help people work and live at their best.

  What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?  
 Artificial intelligence (AI) technology allows computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving tasks. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take action to achieve a specific goal. AI research began in the 1950s and was used in the 1960s by the United States Department of Defense when it trained computers to mimic human reasoning.1 


 A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), a concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without human assistance.


Key Takeaways
Artificial intelligence technology allows computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.Algorithms are part of the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence technology is apparent in computers that play chess, self-driving cars, and banking systems to detect fraudulent activity. 
  How Artificial Intelligence (AI) Works  
 Artificial intelligence commonly brought to mind the implementation of robots. As technology evolved, previous benchmarks that define artificial intelligence became outdated. Technologies that enable Artificial Intelligence include:1



Computer vision enables computers to identify objects and people in pictures and photos.
Natural language processing (NLP) allows computers to understand human language.
Graphical processing units are computer chips that help computers form graphics and images through mathematical calculations. 
The Internet of Things is the network of physical devices, vehicles, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, that collect and share data.
Application programming allows two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other.





Algorithms often play a part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.
  Types of Artificial Intelligence  
 Narrow AI: Also known as Weak AI, this system is designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games like personal assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Users ask the assistant a question, and it answers it for you.

 General AI: This type includes strong artificial intelligence systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. They tend to be more complex and complicated and can be found in applications like self-driving cars or hospital operating rooms.



Super AI is a strictly theoretical type of AI and has not yet been realized. Super AI would think, reason, learn, and possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings.
  Using Artificial Intelligence  
 Artificial intelligence can be applied to many sectors and industries, including the healthcare industry for suggesting drug dosages, identifying treatments, and aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room.


 Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. AI has applications in the financial industry, where it detects and flags fraudulent banking activity. Applications for AI can help streamline and make trading easier.


 In 2022, AI entered the mainstream with applications of Generative Pre-Training Transformer. The most popular applications are OpenAI's DALL-E text-to-image tool and ChatGPT. According to a 2024 survey by Deloitte, 79% of respondents who are leaders in the AI industry, expect generative AI to transform their organizations by 2027.2


 What Is Reactive AI?
Reactive AI is a type of Narrow AI that uses algorithms to optimize outputs based on a set of inputs. Chess-playing AIs, for example, are reactive systems that optimize the best strategy to win the game. Reactive AI tends to be fairly static, unable to learn or adapt to novel situations.


 What Are the Concerns Surrounding the Use of AI?
Many are concerned with how artificial intelligence may affect human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs with intelligent machinery, there is a concern that employees would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills obsolete.


 How Is AI Used in Healthcare?
In healthcare settings, AI is used to assist in diagnostics. AI can identify small anomalies in scans to better triangulate diagnoses from a patient's symptoms and vitals. AI can classify patients, maintain and track medical records, and deal with health insurance claims.


  The Bottom Line  
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an evolving technology that tries to simulate human intelligence using machines. AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which allow systems to learn and adapt in novel ways from training data. It has vast applications across multiple industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. While AI offers significant advancements, it also raises ethical, privacy, and employment concerns.

Nearly Half of High School Students Say Generative AI will Significantly Change the Future Workforce, Global Survey Reveals

Most U.S. and U.K. 16- to 18-year-olds polled are looking to schools to help them prepare for the new AI landscape
Philadelphia, PA, April 3, 2024 — With the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), nearly one in two high school students polled think the workforce as we know it today will undergo a major transformation, a new global survey shows.
More than 48% of those queried believe that hard skills will become less important and soft skills, such as reasoning and creativity, will increase in demand, according to the survey, conducted in March by the Philadelphia-based Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).
As a result, 28% of the students said workers will need to acquire new skills to thrive in the new AI workplace, and more than two-thirds are looking to their schools to help position them for future success.
The survey polled 825 11th and 12th-grade students from across the U.S. and sixth-form students in England and Wales to get their insights on the impact of generative AI on their academics and future careers. The 16- to 18-year-old students queried are participants in this year’s MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge (M3 Challenge), an annual internet-based, intensive math modelling contest organized by SIAM.
When asked what best reflects their thoughts about generative AI, the majority (47%) stated they worry that it will be difficult for students of the future to reach their full potential in a generative AI world, relying on technology more than their own capabilities. About 40% said generative AI will change the world as we know it today, impacting almost every industry and career, and that it will be increasingly important to master generative AI tools to succeed academically and in the future workforce.
Nearly half of the students polled expressed some degree of concern about the potential loss of jobs in the future workforce due to certain roles becoming automated or obsolete. Only 19% think the AI workforce of the future will deliver greater productivity as people work faster and smarter.
Dr. Karen Bliss, Senior Manager of Education and Outreach at SIAM said:
“The survey demonstrates that many students feel that they need to take steps now to prepare for an evolving workplace,”.
Schools can do more
To that end, Bliss explained that most survey respondents are looking to their schools for help and guidance, with 68% saying their school isn’t doing enough to prepare students for the future world of AI.


How can high schools prepare students for the future world of AI? The majority (62%) of those queried suggested that schools offer guidance on the ethics of using AI, including boundaries related to AI content creation, misuse, and plagiarism.
Other recommendations included having schools provide practical training on how to most effectively use generative AI tools for academics (58%), teach the limitations of AI as it relates to academics (41%), and help identify careers that may be – or are less likely to be – disrupted by AI so students can plan their future academics accordingly (38%).
“Interestingly, one in five students would like to see schools offer extracurricular activities to boost their AI skills and experience, while almost as many think it would be helpful if teachers make using generative AI tools mandatory in assignments,” Bliss said.
Other survey findings
With many mathematics teachers grappling with the place of generative AI in math class, the survey asked respondents for their thoughts on this topic. Almost half (46%) said they think mathematics skills will become more important with the growth of generative AI, while 26% stated that they don’t think it will have much effect.
Of the students who predicted mathematics skills will increase in importance in the future, 68% explained that effective use of AI still requires human reasoning and those with a good grasp of math are more apt to succeed. Others said that as the AI field continues to grow, there will be more demand for mathematicians to develop AI tools and systems (56%) and that data analysis is an important part of using AI, a skill honed by mathematics studies (52%).
Dr. Kathleen Kavanagh, Director of the Institute for STEM Education at Clarkson University and an M3 Challenge judge said:
“With the fast emergence of AI tools, these are exciting times in mathematics and computer science since we will be able to tackle a broader range of problems more efficiently,”
“AI can certainly help with some tasks, but it cannot replace critical thinking, logical reasoning, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Now more than ever, students need to pay attention in math classes and build those skills so that they can successfully navigate in a complex, rapidly changing world.”
Now in its 19th year, the M3 Challenge involves high school juniors, seniors, and sixth-form students, working in small teams for 14 consecutive hours to devise a solution to a real-world problem using mathematical modelling. Of the hundreds of participating teams, nine finalist teams were selected from across the U.S., England, and Wales, after having their submissions judged by an international panel of Ph.D.-level mathematicians. Finalist teams will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City to participate in the competition’s final judging event, which will take place on April 29.

Bonnie Moss



					Founder & President, Moss Networks				




April 8, 2024




 








Bonnie Moss, president and founder of Moss Networks navigates through the haze of sensationalism, revealing the true capabilities, implications, and potential pitfalls of Generative AI. From its impact on employment to its role in safeguarding privacy.
Generative AI is one of the more exciting technologies to hit the market in a long time. But at times, it’s also one of the most misunderstood. This is a shame because the confusion and hype surrounding it isn’t doing anyone – providers, users, and potential beneficiaries – any favors.
The sooner we clear things up, the sooner we reap its true benefits.
Generative AI is Not Going to Wipe Out Humanity
I recognize that the Center for AI Safety warned that AI could lead to societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war. The Center’s statement made headlines for days. The many voices of reason were lost in those sensational headlines, specifically the numerous experts who rightly countered that generative AI was far from that capability.
The fact is that generative AI needs humans to train it on things humans have created. Take ChatGPT as an example, which essentially predicts what someone might say based on what people have said in the past. Generative AI can’t make the kind of colossal leap required to enslave humanity – a scenario so profoundly unique it would require massive amounts of human-labeled data to execute. 
At that point, who is doing the evil deed, the data scientists who curate and label the data or the AI itself? Maybe someday, there will be a technology capable of enslaving humans without our input, but it won’t be AI, given its dependence on humans.
It does seem to me, however, that this warning is an attempt to deflect attention away from the real challenges of AI, namely discrimination and potential violations of privacy – precisely the things the regulators are warning us about.

Generative AI, like All AI, Will Change Work, Not Eliminate Workers
AI has scared the American workforce ever since I can remember. Back in 2016, a survey conducted by KRC Research found that 82% of workers feared that AI was coming for their jobs.
In April 2023, a Goldman Sachs report warned generative AI could eliminate up to 300 million jobs – if it lived up to its touted capabilities. Hollywood writers went on strike partly due to a fear of ChatGPT writing television and movie scripts. After all, entertainment studios did have open job recommendations for generative AI specialists. Those job descriptions described different tasks, such as deploying it to make better content recommendations to end users.
But writers need not fear – at least not yet. Research from Freelancer.com found that AI wasn’t equal to the creativity of humans. Freelancer.com looked at 280,000 jobs posted to its site and found that in the second quarter of 2023, while the writers’ strike began, creative writing jobs were up 58%.
“AI can’t replace creativity yet. While workers and businesses are benefiting from productivity gains offered by generative AI, the data suggests that the technology in its current form isn’t able to replace creative work. We saw a similar trend occur in the first quarter of the year, as creative design jobs were flourishing despite interest for generative AI tripling,” Matt Barrie, Chief Executive at Freelancer.com, says in the report. What’s more, many freelance writers are earning serious money. CNBC found writers on the site who charge a rate of $250 per hour.
But generative AI, like all AI, is changing work for the better by eliminating the drudgery of repetitive tasks and enabling workers to focus on their jobs’ strategic and creative aspects. For instance, OpenWeb’s 2024 Media Trends ReportOpens a new window  notes that publishers see generative AI as allowing them to reimagine critical roles, such as revenue and ad operations.
The Real Benefits of Generative AI
Hallucinations and inaccuracies aside, generative AI offers tangible benefits, mostly by helping internal experts speed up their work. 
Take the healthcare industry as an example.  Trenholm Ninestein in Medical EconomicsOpens a new window  writes, “Large language models can help internal data analysts within a hospital find ways to optimize revenue and ensure compliance by asking the model specific questions in natural language about billing codes, insurance regulations, reimbursement guidelines, or any other billing-related queries. The model can help retrieve relevant information and provide insights to support decision-making.”
He continues, “It can also help reduce billing errors by providing real-time suggestions and recommendations to coding staff during the coding process. It can help ensure accurate and compliant coding by offering insights into appropriate codes, modifiers, or documentation requirements based on industry-standard coding guidelines.” 
This is the kind of game-changing efficiency that the OpenWeb publishers discussed. By eliminating the grunt work of formatting questions into language computers can understand, practitioners can get to the information they need to glean strategic insights and make decisions faster and more easily. This is a key benefit of generative AI.
Another is the ability of generative AI to solve some of the privacy challenges that consumer data poses. Rather than use consumer data to train critical customer service-oriented models, generative AI can create synthetic data that acts like real-life data but is privacy-compliant. If this seems far out to you, rest assured that companies like Nurdle are doing just that.
If 2023 was the year of generative AI hype and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), let’s hope that 2024 is a year of realistic awareness of what this incredibly powerful tool can do for workers. While I don’t see it poised to cause massive layoffs or extinctions any time soon, it can make a lot of jobs more efficient and even more satisfying for many people.

In Large Language Models (LLMs), reasoning involves dissecting a problem’s logical structure and turning it into a sequence of logical steps that lead to a solution. For LLMs, this procedure has proven difficult, particularly in algorithmic reasoning where intricate logical patterns must be interpreted and transformed into a series of processes.
Understanding patterns inside an issue and decomposing them into a series of logical stages to arrive at a solution are key components of algorithmic thinking. Although a variety of reasoning tasks have demonstrated the potential of LLMs, algorithmic reasoning remains difficult because of its complex structure.

In order to convey the reasoning required to solve a particular instance or topic, recent studies have tried to address this challenge by employing programming languages like Python. It is challenging to write executable code that faithfully captures the reasoning in a single inference call and does it in real-time. Even if two instances need the same logic, the code created for one cannot be utilized for another.
In recent research, a team of researchers from Yonsei University and KAIST AI has presented THINK-AND-EXECUTE, a unique architecture that splits the language model reasoning process into two parts to get over the limitations. The two parts are as follows.

THINK: The framework looks for a task-level logic in this phase that is shared by all instances of a certain task. Next, pseudocode, which offers a more adaptive and flexible representation than programming languages like Python, has been used to express the shared logic. 


EXECUTE: The framework adapts the task-level logic to each unique instance after it has been defined and stated in pseudocode. Subsequently, it emulates the pseudocode execution for every occurrence, efficiently utilizing the found logic to resolve the issue.

The effectiveness of THINK-AND-EXECUTE has been shown through comprehensive trials on seven algorithmic thinking tasks. The framework beats multiple robust baselines, including Program-of-Thought (PoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which rely on instance-specific reasoning techniques. This implies that learning task-level logic can help LLMs become more proficient reasoners. Even though these models have been trained to follow instructions in regular language, the results have demonstrated that pseudocode is a more useful tool for directing LLM thinking than natural language. 
The team has summarized their primary contributions as follows.

A new and unique thinking paradigm known as THINK-AND-EXECUTE has been suggested. This framework encapsulates the common logical structure of a given job using pseudocode. The method allows for more efficient reasoning in LLMs by utilizing pseudocode, which provides flexibility and adaptability. 


The team has shown that THINK-AND-EXECUTE outperforms well-established baselines like Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting, based on substantial research on a variety of algorithmic tasks inside the Big-Bench Hard dataset. This demonstrates how well the system works to improve reasoning abilities in a variety of issue domains.


Utilizing THINK-AND-EXECUTE, the team has demonstrated the effectiveness of the method by effectively transferring the pseudocode produced by an LLM to smaller language models. This indicates that the approach is both generalizable and scalable, meaning it can be applied to a variety of model topologies and sizes.

HR is fundamentally about managing humans – so how will the job change in a future where powerful generative AI tools are everywhere?

Empathy, emotional intelligence and an understanding of human nature are essential when it comes to managing a human workforce. Not exactly qualities that machines – even ones as human-like as ChatGPT – are renowned for!


So are we going to see widespread replacement of human HR departments with cold, calculating chatbots that only care about measuring human efficiency and weeding out weakness?

Well, hopefully not. Instead, I think that HR professionals will use generative AI to automate routine and repetitive elements of their work, freeing time for them to nurture and develop the human-to-human skills needed for their more high-value tasks.

Here’s my overview of how I believe the work of HR departments will change – and, in many cases, already is. I'll also take a look at the wider implications for how the place of these essential professionals in society is likely to evolve over the next five to 10 years.

Recruitment And Talent-Hunting
Finding talented people is always a challenge, but generative AI tools will help out with the routine and administerial work. Not just by doing it more quickly, but by finding more efficient and personalized ways to reach out to prospective hires and advertise a workplace.
At the start of the process, it will be used to generate ideas around ideal candidate personas, creating overviews of the skills, qualities and personality traits that might make an applicant right for the job. Then, it can create dynamic, personalized job descriptions aimed at encouraging a wider pool of applicants.
For companies that hire thousands every year, it will be used to carry out initial assessments to ensure candidates meet basic criteria. After that, it can offer simulated interviews and roleplays to help candidates prepare for their application. Rather than used as a form of screening, it should be thought of as a tool that will help recruiters and other HR professionals to get a better understanding of candidates as unique human beings, before meeting them face-to-face.

Workforce Development 
Businesses are going to need to ensure their workforces are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the AI era, and this responsibility falls on the shoulders of HR workers.

Generative AI is great for training – it can create anything from complex technical manuals to simple step-by-step walkthroughs. Public models like ChatGPT already capable of doing this, but businesses will increasingly invest in training their own private AI models tailored to their needs.
These reports can be personalized to individual learners, taking into account their unique skills and learning requirements.
As we move forward, we will find generative video and even world simulation tools becoming available. These will be used to create even more engaging, personalized training experiences. Language models will provide feedback in real-time, just as if the trainee had an instructor standing with them.
There are some risks here – we know generative AI doesn’t always get things right, which could lead to dangerous misinformation or mistakes. So, there will always be a need for transparency about how these systems operate, as well as human oversight.
Workplace Management And Analytics
Rather than spending hours studying metrics and statistics, generative AI tools can quickly analyze data and compile reports highlighting key workforce trends.
It can identify future staffing needs and highlight areas and causes of high staff turnover. It will provide quick, relevant insights into factors like employee sentiment and satisfaction. It will also be used to create narrative and visual projections around the impact of strategic HR decisions.
All of these will make it simpler for HR professionals to understand the underlying human element driving the success or failure of a business.
Of course, we have to be careful when it comes to converting human activities and emotions into numbers. Bias in the way data is collected or the way it’s analyzed can lead to unfair outcomes, and overly-intrusive data gathering or AI initiatives can create unhappy employees. Risks in all of these areas must be carefully assessed and guarded against.
Employee Experience
It’s the job of HR departments to create inclusive, positive experiences for workers throughout the business. Ensuring employees are able to carry out their duties effectively without being hindered or held up by internal processes is a critical task.
Here, generative AI will be used for creating onboarding material that’s relevant to individual new hires, providing answers to common HR queries in a personalized and relevant way through chatbots, and gathering and interpreting employee feedback.
Here, quality of service is of utmost importance. Few things are as irritating as talking to bad chatbots. At the same time, more people are coming to accept that when used well, they can be a very efficient way of getting information.
This all helps HR departments to understand “pain points” that employees go through on a day-to-day basis, as they carry out their work as well as navigate their own career pathways.
The Changing Role Of HR Professionals 
With generative AI taking on the routine and administrative elements of their work, the perception of HR professionals in the workplace will change dramatically. The higher level of visibility given to the human-centric elements of their work will mean they are less likely to be perceived as “back office” or even “faceless” functions, instead becoming more deeply ingrained in the working lives of their colleagues. The role of HR professionals in staff wellness and the development of healthy work/life balance, as well as promoting inclusion and diversity, will come to the front.
This means that the strategic value of HR professionals will grow exponentially. Moving beyond being facilitators of operational efficiency, they will have the chance to become champions of positive organizational change, ethical application of technology, and curators of healthy, caring workplace culture.

The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to pilot several applications of generative AI, a spokesperson for the agency told FedScoop. As part of a “generative AI meta pilot,” the agency plans to test the technologies on open-source large language models that have now been brought into the VA’s already authorized-to-operate platforms. 
Generative AI applications are in “high demand” at the agency, VA spokesperson Gary Kunich told FedScoop. Amid that interest, the department now plans to test the use of generative AI to summarize feedback from VA.gov users and employee surveys run by the Veterans Experience Office, assist employees in human resources and the Veterans Benefits Administration with reading through internal policies, and draft contracting documents, including statements of work and descriptions of jobs. 
There are other generative AI projects, too. The agency is pursuing an ongoing pilot with GitHub Copilot, a generative AI-powered code-completion tool, as well as a generative AI “meta pilot” focused on search, summarization, and content drafting. Current AI tech sprints within the agency related to ambient dictation for clinical encounters and community care document processing also involve generative AI. 
These use cases have not yet been listed on the agency’s public AI inventory, which agencies are required to produce annually by an executive order. As FedScoop reported earlier this year, agencies still vary widely in their approach to generative AI.

But the VA has also ditched at least one generative AI pilot. Last year, the agency experimented with using generative AI in the form of a chatbot but later decided to abandon the project, according to Kunich. The current chatbot used by the agency remains rules- and retrieval-based, though it takes advantage of natural language understanding and processing. 
Current guidance for the technology at the agency, which FedScoop obtained through a public records request, states that no “web-based, publicly available generative AI service has been approved for use with VA sensitive data.” Department staff are also instructed to limit the sharing and saving of data on these systems and to check the output of large language models for accuracy. You can read that document here.

A recent survey conducted by staffing firm Adecco Group sheds light on this growing concern, revealing that 41% of executives at large companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforce due to AI in the next five years.Generative AI, a technology that can create realistic text, images, and videos, is gaining traction in various industries. While some view it as a tool to eliminate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency, others worry about the potential obsolescence of entire job roles.According to Denis Machuel, the CEO of Adecco Group,  AI will inevitably impact nearly all jobs in some way or another. It has the potential to both create and eliminate jobs, acting as a double-edged sword. However, he also believes that the impact will be balanced, as the digital revolution of the past decade has shown that new jobs can emerge from technological advancements.The survey included executives from 18 different industries across nine countries, encompassing a wide range of white-collar and blue-collar jobs. The results paint a more alarming picture compared to a previous poll conducted by the World Economic Forum, which revealed that half of the companies believed  AI would generate new jobs rather than eliminate them.Recent layoffs within the tech industry further validate these concerns. Companies like Google and Microsoft are redirecting their focus towards AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini, which has resulted in job cuts. Even non-tech companies like Dropbox and Duolingo have attributed downsizing to the implementation of AI technologies.Economists at Goldman Sachs have previously warned that generative AI has the potential to eliminate or significantly impact approximately 300 million jobs globally, with white-collar workers being the most vulnerable. The findings of the Adecco survey align with this prediction, indicating that this reality may materialize within the next five years.Frequently Asked Questions:1. What is  AI?AI, or  artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, problem-solving, and decision-making.2. What is generative AI?Generative AI is a specific branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the creation of new content, such as text, images, and videos, that is indistinguishable from content created by humans. It utilizes algorithms and deep learning techniques to generate original and realistic outputs.3. How will AI impact the job market? AI is expected to have a significant impact on the job market, with some jobs becoming obsolete and new ones emerging. While AI has the potential to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity, it may also lead to job displacements in certain industries. The ultimate impact will depend on how organizations adapt to and integrate AI technologies.(Source: Adecco Group’s survey on the impact of AI on jobs)In addition to the insights provided in the article, it is worth noting that the impact of AI on jobs extends beyond the fear of job cuts and obsolescence. The rise of AI technology also presents new opportunities and challenges within industries.The growth of generative  AI in various sectors can be attributed to its ability to streamline processes, improve efficiencies, and enhance productivity. Industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and customer service are among those that have embraced AI technologies to optimize their operations.For example, in healthcare, AI-powered algorithms can analyze medical images and patient data to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. In finance, AI algorithms can analyze market trends and make predictions to aid investment strategies. In customer service, AI-powered chatbots can handle routine customer inquiries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex customer issues.Market forecasts support the idea of significant growth in the  AI industry. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI market is projected to reach $733.7 billion by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% from 2020 to 2027. This indicates a strong demand for AI technologies across various sectors.However, there are also concerns regarding the ethical implications and potential biases associated with AI. The algorithms used in AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, often collected from real-world scenarios. If the data used to train these algorithms is biased or lacks diversity, it can lead to discriminatory outcomes in AI applications, perpetuating existing inequalities.To address these concerns, organizations and policymakers are advocating for responsible  AI development and deployment. Initiatives such as the development of ethical AI guidelines, algorithmic transparency, and diversity in AI teams are being promoted to ensure that AI technologies are fair, unbiased, and accountable.In conclusion, while the fear of job losses due to AI is valid, it is essential to consider the broader impact of AI on industries and the potential for new job opportunities. The market forecast reflects the growing demand for AI technologies, and the industry is continually evolving to address concerns related to ethics and biases in AI applications.For more information on the impact of AI on industries and the job market, you can visit the following link: Grand View Research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After watching a video on TikTok, she found a side hustle: training artificial intelligence models for a website called Data Annotation Tech.For a few hours every day, Ms. Becker, 33, who lives in Schwenksville, Pa., would sit at her laptop and interact with an A.I.-powered chatbot. For every hour of work, she was paid $20 to $40. From December to March, she made over $10,000.The boom in A.I. technology has put a more sophisticated spin on a kind of gig work that doesn’t require leaving the house. The growth of large language models like the technology powering OpenAI’s ChatGPT has fueled the need for trainers like Ms. Becker, fluent English speakers who can produce quality writing.ImageMs. Becker playing with her son and daughter at their home in Schwenksville, Pa.Credit...Hannah Yoon for The New York TimesIt is not a secret that A.I. models learn from humans. For years, makers of A.I. systems like Google and OpenAI have relied on low-paid workers, typically contractors employed through other companies, to help computers visually identify subjects. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, on claims of copyright infringement.) They might label vehicles and pedestrians for self-driving cars or identify images on photos used to train A.I. systems.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut as A.I. technology has become more sophisticated, so has the job of people who must painstakingly teach it. Yesterday’s photo tagger is today’s essay writer.There are usually two types of work for these trainers: supervised learning, where the A.I. learns from human-generated writing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, where the chatbot learns from how humans rate their responses.Companies that specialize in data curation, including the San Francisco-based start-ups Scale AI and Surge AI, hire contractors and sell their training data to bigger developers. Developers of A.I. models, such as the Toronto-based start-up Cohere, also recruit in-house data annotators.It is difficult to estimate the total number of these gig workers, researchers said. But Scale AI, which hires contractors through its subsidiaries, Remotasks and Outlier, said it was common to see tens of thousands of people working on the platform at a given time.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut as with other types of gig work, the ease of flexible hours comes with its own challenges. Some workers said they never interacted with administrators behind the recruitment sites, and others had been cut off from the work with no explanation. Researchers have also raised concerns over a lack of standards, since workers typically don’t receive training on what are considered to be appropriate chatbot answers.To become one of these contractors, workers have to pass an assessment, which includes questions like whether a social media post should be considered hateful, and why. Another one requires a more creative approach, asking contracting prospects to write a fictional short story about a green dancing octopus, set in Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX offices on Nov. 8, 2022. (That was the day Binance, an FTX competitor, said it would buy Mr. Bankman-Fried’s company before later quickly backing out of the deal.)Sometimes, companies look for subject matter experts. Scale AI has posted jobs for contract writers who hold master’s or doctoral degrees in Hindi and Japanese. Outlier has job listings that mention requirements like academic degrees in math, chemistry and physics.“What really makes the A.I. useful to its users is the human layer of data, and that really needs to be done by smart humans and skilled humans and humans with a particular degree of expertise and a creative bent,” said Willow Primack, vice president of data operations at Scale AI. “We have been focusing on contractors, particularly within North America, as a result.”Alynzia Fenske, a self-published fiction writer, had never interacted with an A.I. chatbot before hearing a lot from fellow writers who considered A.I. a threat. So when she came across a video on TikTok about Data Annotation Tech, part of her motivation was just to learn as much about A.I. as she could and see for herself whether the fears surrounding A.I. were warranted.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s giving me a whole different view of it now that I’ve been working with it,” said Ms. Fenske, 28, who lives in Oakley, Wis. “It is comforting knowing that there are human beings behind it.” Since February, she has been aiming for 15 hours of data annotation work every week so she can support herself while pursuing a writing career.Ese Agboh, 28, a master’s student studying computer science at the University of Arkansas, was given the task of coding projects, which paid $40 to $45 an hour. She would ask the chatbot to design a motion sensor program that helps gymgoers count their repetitions, and then evaluate the computer codes written by the A.I. In another case, she would load a data set about grocery items to the program and ask the chatbot to design a monthly budget. Sometimes she would even evaluate other annotators’ codes, which experts said are used to ensure data quality.She made $2,500. But her account was permanently suspended by the platform for violating its code of conduct. She did not receive an explanation, but she suspected that it was because she worked while in Nigeria, since the site wanted workers based in only certain countries.ImageEse Agboh, a University of Arkansas computer science master’s student, helped a chatbot with coding projects.Credit...Alyssa Pointer for The New York TimesThat is the fundamental challenge of online gig work: It can disappear at any time. With no one available for help, frustrated contractors turned to social media, sharing their experiences on Reddit and TikTok. Jackie Mitchell, 26, gained a large following on TikTok because of her content on side hustles, including data annotation work.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I get the appeal,” she said, referring to side hustles as an “unfortunate necessity” in this economy and “a hallmark of my generation and the generation above me.”Public records show that Surge AI owns Data Annotation Tech. Neither the company nor its chief executive, Edwin Chen, responded to requests for comments.It is common for companies to hire contractors through subsidiaries. They do so to protect the identity of their customers, and it helps them avoid bad press associated with working conditions for its low-paid contract workers, said James Muldoon, a University of Essex management professor whose research focuses on A.I. data work.A majority of today’s data workers depend on wages from their gig work. Milagros Miceli, a sociologist and computer scientist researching labor conditions in data work, said that while “a lot of people are doing this for fun, because of the gamification that comes with it,” a bulk of the work is still “done by workers who actually really need the money and do this as a main income.”Researchers are also concerned about the lack of safety standards in data labeling. Workers are sometimes asked to address sensitive issues like whether certain events or acts should be considered genocide or what gender should appear in an A.I.-generated image of a soccer team, but they are not trained on how to make that evaluation.“It’s fundamentally not a good idea to outsource or crowdsource concerns about safety and ethics,” Professor Muldoon said. “You need to be guided by principles and values, and what your company actually decides as the right thing to do on a particular issue.”Yiwen Lu reports on technology for The Times.

Like many global organizations, German logistics company DHL had career sites for almost every country in which the company operates — nearly 200 of them. Most of the  sites, however, lacked brand consistency and none of them were leveraged to attract new hires. They were merely a place to fill out a job application.
DHL’s country-centric career sites also had limited integrations across a multitude of applicant tracking systems — this at a time when skills-based hiring had been growing to meet digitization and other business transformation efforts.
That prompted DHL to turn to generative artificial intelligence (genAI) to fix its talent recruitment problem by consolidating its 200 disparate sites into one site that parsed job seekers into ranked lists to match the company’s needed skillsets, and to which recruiters could quickly respond.
 
 
 













 
 

To create its unified site, DHL put together its own internal AI team and partnered with Phenom, a Philadelphia-based HR tech startup that sells a SaaS-based platform offering genAI and automation tools.

Though the company now has just one career site, each of its national locations can maintain their own identities with real-time customization capabilities. For example, in Prague, DHL created a site specifically to attract frontline workers for the peak holiday shopping season. (The low unemployment rate in the Czech Republic had made finding talent a challenge.)
 Since the revamped site went live, the number of job seekers per job increased by 25%, 800,000 job searches found a relevant job within 5 milliseconds using AI-enabled features, and more than 200,000 job seekers became applicants in less than 14 minutes of the site’s launch.

Meredith Wellard, vice president of Group Talent Acquisition, Learning and Growth at DHL, oversaw the AI project from the HR side. DHL’s Express division had recently launched the Phenom Intelligent Talent Experience platform and saw early wins, piquing Wellard’s interest. So, she decided to expand it to the entire company. The results were almost immediate. Wellard said the new AI-based career site produced a spike in candidate traffic, greater overall engagement, and faster hires. The shift to a more engaging career site was particularly good at attracting frontline workers, especially truck drivers, delivery people, and warehouse workers.
Wellard spoke with Computerworld about the genAI HR project, and offered insights into how the project rolled out and what other companies should look out for when executing their own genAI-based tech plans. The following are excerpts from that interview:
Tell me about your job at DHL. “I’ve been with DHL for 18 years. Over the last five years, I’ve been working in our corporate center, looking after the group topics when it comes to everything from employer, brand, the way we position ourselves in the markets, attracting and recruiting team members, building their skills, building them into internal talents and then, in principle, also offboarding them in a respectful way. Although we don’t do a whole lot of that.”
 
 
 













 
 

When did you start the project and what hurdles were you facing? “We started the project around 2019. That’s when all of this tech was quite new. We were only just starting to hear about this cool thing called Machine Learning or AI. They were trying to get their heads around what it meant and whether it would really be useful. So probably for the first 12 months, it was about us learning.
“I think that’s an important part for any team venturing out on new technology — learn before you get distracted by the shiny things, you know, that great sales pitch that many companies can do. So, we did a lot of learning, and we were cleaning up our applicant tracking system landscape at that same time — that’s the sort of back end of the recruiting process. Then at one of our divisions — our Express Division — they had actually done quite a lot of work and found Phenom and they had decided to try using Phenom and see if it worked for them. That was quite successful. So, off the back of their success, we thought, ‘You know what? I think this could work for the whole globe.’

“AI is not going to get rid of our jobs. Our jobs are not going to be taken by AI. Our jobs are going to be taken by people who know how to use AI.”
Meredith Wellard
“We set up what we called our Skydiver project. The reason we called it Skydiver was because it was fast, and it was like a jump out of a plane — kind of risky. It worked. We partnered with Phenom and over a six-month period we got the career site up and running. After six months, I think we had like maybe five languages on the site and 70 career sites [consolidated on it]. After about 18 months, we were down to about 11 career sites [that weren’t on it] and up to 21 languages. As of today, which is three years on, we’re on about 40 languages and we’ve got one career site.”
 
 
 













 
 

DHL had 200 career sites. First of all, can you explain that? Why did you have 200 career sites? “So, as you know, we have [about] 600,000 employees, and we’re in basically every country in the world — so, 220 countries. We do operate in a decentralized model, so the power is in the hands of the countries. They need to be really relevant to the local markets. We’re in a service industry, so it’s super important that you know the local environment is reflecting who they are very well when it comes to our recruiting activities.
“We also have a ‘global as necessary, as local as possible’ mindset, and we probably we missed a bit of the global part when we allowed whichever country that wanted to to set up a career site. And a lot of them did. By the time we started to think about partnering with some [of] these great career site tech companies or talent experience platform companies, we realized that we had quite some work to harmonize the landscape and bring together all of those career sites. Some of those sites had a lot of love and care put into creating them on a local level, but they had no [click-throughs] because they were turning up on page 17 of a Google search.
“And so it was quite important for us at the beginning to take those 200 or so career sites and figure out how to bring those together so that the local environments don’t lose what they need in terms of the localization. And it’s way more than language. It’s also things like the way the visuals appear, the way the jobs are presented, how users can click on them.
 
 
 













 
 

“We did a lot of research in the early days, looking at what would someone in Denmark expect from a career site versus someone in Japan, and from a user experience point of view those two are so different…culture-wise — even the visuals like the real estate usage expectations in a country like Japan versus Denmark, where it’s rather more sparse, and you know, spacious. It’s a cultural preference.
“So, we had to take care of all of those things and at the same time really take care to communicate and educate our business around how it wouldn’t be a natural thing for an HR professional — who knows everything about HR, legal aspects, recruiting, what a good interview looks like — it wouldn’t naturally be that they should know what it means to create a good SEO. Or how they could become more transparent on Google search. Or what would it take to have the right words, or the right visuals, or the right number of interactions in order to bring yourself up higher on a search result. This is not something that HR people know necessarily. Some do for sure, but not all of them do.”
What other issues were you facing? “I think the biggest one was definitely, because of those disconnected sites, it was definitely our visibility. The second one is around our brand. We have an amazing consumer brand. Everyone knows DHL — the red and the yellow. It’s bright. It’s engaging. It means a lot to every employee, and…our customers and the partners that we work with.
 
 
 













 
 

“Unfortunately, whilst the consumer brand is still is incredibly powerful, our employer brand was somewhat ad hoc. You know, people were creating things that they thought look nice that they thought represented. But there was no standardization and if you looked at one brand in in Germany, it might not look the same as one in South America. It just didn’t work. So that was the second big thing. We needed to align our brand to be more visible. As an employer, we want to be this great place to work for everyone. We’re this great company to work for, but how can you ensure everyone knows that if you can’t even tell a coherent story out into the market?
“A third thing is we wanted to take care that we minimized the likelihood of things like the fraudulent use of our brands. You hear these things in the market where companies had fraudsters say, ‘Pay me $50 and I’ll get you a job interview here or there.’ We just wanted to make sure that we weren’t exposed to that, because when you’ve got so many different sites, it does increase the risk of that type of activity. So, with that sort of compliance topic, as a company that really values good business practices like compliance, it is important to us. So that was the other thing that we had to address.
“The fourth thing we had to address was just bringing the recruiting audience together. When we have all of us looking together at our talents and saying, ‘OK, well you know if I’m recruiting out of our supply chain division and I’ve picked my gold medalist, but geez, there was three really strong silver medalists.’ We were just letting them go back into the market. We needed to be directing them go into other potential jobs in our company, not back into the market — especially nowadays.”
 
 
 













 
 

What are some of the talent challenges you’re facing, particularly with some of the digital technologies that you’re rolling out. “I don’t think we’re unique in this. There is obviously a huge demand for tech talent across the globe at the moment. And, the demand changes, I feel like it’s changing every six months. We started with everyone wanting blockchain specialists. Then there’s this whole push on project managers and some cloud architects. And they have moved on to the cybersecurity space. Now, most recently, we’ve got the whole generative AI and AI technicians and data analysts and so forth. It’s a constant churn of changing demand, and it’s sort of pulsing.

Of course, because we’re DHL and we’re a logistics company, you [as a job applicant] may wonder why would we need technical people. We realized that our reputation as an employer of technical people — IT-type people — wasn’t that it was a bad reputation. There was literally no reputation. Technical people were not thinking, ‘I can’t wait to get my degree and work for DHL.’
“So we had to really get the story out there why we are a good match for someone who wants to work in that space. We really have that type of technology that is cutting edge in terms of what you do as a technical contributor, it manifests in our business immediately. Whether it’s a proof of concept or a pilot, whether you’re working on Google glasses or Internet of Things, you can actually see how your work impacts customers and the business — and quite quickly. And, I think there are a lot of technical people who want to see the impact of their coding or their design or their project management or whatever on the customer or the business.”
 
 
 













 
 

You partnered with Phenom to help you roll out the genAI for your career site, but did you also build an internal team to roll out this technology? What kind of people were on that? “We have a really good internal team. Phenom became our partner, and we learned a lot from them. They had a lot of expertise about this very new technology. Internally, though, we have a really great coherent team working in a sort of agile working mode. That was also new to us, a working mode being in a scrum-based environment. That team’s made up of a set of HR professionals who know recruiting and who know what it means to bring and attract people onto our business but who also had the ability to translate those HR needs into technical language, if you like. They could talk then to another group of people who we worked with internally, IT professionals who were willing to talk to HR and ask them, ‘What does it mean to transform HR into this technical world?’ 
HR was one of the late adopters of technology. And I think that we found a really great group of IT professionals who were fascinated at how technology manifests to enable our people in a way very different from, say, the operations of finance.”
Did you also include folks from legal, finance, and compliance and others? “We call them our product owners. They’re the ones from the HR and from the business side. They describe what’s needed. They work with our actual operators out in the field, the recruiters and so forth. And they understand what’s required. They talk to IT in the language of IT, and IT says, ‘Here’s what we can provide as a solution.’ Then we say that’s an interesting solution — now let’s talk to compliance about how this will work from a compliance perspective? You know, we can’t be a company that says you can trust us completely unless that trust extends to candidates, applicants and so forth.
 
 
 













 
 

“We also talked to the compliance people. Then we have our procurement partners. They’re  talking about how our relationships are set up and how we can get the most out of these really powerful contracts that we have in place across the globe. And then of course there’s finance, which is looking after all those financial things. And then the managers. And the employees — everyone providing some insights from a personal perspective on how it should work for them. What would they want from your product like this? It’s really the whole company coming together.”
So how far down did you go on the management rung to get input? “All the way to our frontline supervisors in terms of testing it, trying it out, and giving us some feedback on how it looks and feels. We involved everyone…who is actually someone who needs to click the buttons to say, ‘Yes, I approve of this.’
“At the same time…, we spent a lot of time on our employer brand. Looking at what our brand looks like if we want consistency. It’s not just having the technology to do it, but you’ve got to have the right attributes. It’s a reflection of who we are internally. So, we talked, interviewed, surveyed, and ran workshops with literally 3,000 or 4,000 employees — maybe even more — to understand what their experience was working for us. What do they love about us? What should we talk about and not talk about? And through that we created this story around where we are as a company, and about how we’re a great team. And, once you’re in here, you bleed red and yellow. That’s the truth.”
 
 
 













 
 

Can you explain how your new, consolidated jobs site works to direct job seekers to the right open positions? “The nice thing about some of these new technologies is that AI is part of the experience, but it doesn’t feel somehow tricky. [Employees] will say I use ChatGPT to do this or that, and I’m like, it’s OK that you used it for that, just as long as you didn’t present it as your own work. On the career side, AI makes the whole thing super easy. It’s much simpler as part of the search experience. If I want to search for a job in Vietnam, I start to write ‘Vietnam,’ and the AI immediately recognizes where you’re located. It then triggers a set of jobs that start to come to you in the language that you’re writing in. This is very simple algorithm in the end, but it feels very personalized, very relevant.
“The second thing that happens is that you get the job recommendations. We have a Phenom-branded chatbot called Larry that allows customers to personalize it. He pops up and says, ‘Do you want more information?’ You start to enter in things and Larry will say things like, ‘Would you like to apply for a job or are you just browsing?’ He’ll tackle some of the first compliance questions like ‘Would you give permission for us to record some of your data?’ And as it does this, it starts to understand what sort of jobs the applicant or interested person might be a match for through one answer-type questions.

“Then once you get into the platform and start looking at the jobs, of course, it gets a little more intense — not so much for the candidate themselves, but more so for the recruiter who will immediately start to see people recommended for specific roles if they’ve given their consent for that. The [job seeker] didn’t apply for that, but let’s see if he’s interested, because this could be suitable for him.
 
 
 













 
 

“This type of matching AI is very useful for helping us bring to the surface the right people for the right jobs. In the past, it would have required recruiters to go through lists and lists and lists of [resumes] to try and find the right people for the right jobs. So, for me, that’s a super powerful use of the machine learning technology that we just didn’t have access to before.
“And then there’s about a million other things that it does. For example, once you find someone, you can send them an e-mail and the recruiter can click on a little AI helper in that email and choose to send an e-mail to the [job seeker] asking if they’re interested in talking about another opportunity we might have. So, it really makes the job easier.”
So give me an example like before and after, since rolling out the new AI-powered site. So back when you had 200 sites as opposed to now. “Let’s say I’m in South Africa on DHL’s career site. I’m hoping like crazy that someone’s going to find the career site and click on it. Maybe they go there and maybe they see some nice pictures and a statement from some of our employees on how they like the company. Then they might click on a job, and then that might get to a recruiter that information along with all the other people that have clicked on that job. But mostly what happened is that people would put [resumes] in there and probably not hear back, if I’m being honest.
 
 
 













 
 

“Now what happens on our career site is South Africa is in bold, and so they still have a very localized site, but it’s fully integrated with the global site. It’s the same global URL; it’s just that the page would have some local references, probably some local visuals, maybe some of the local employees talking about their experience working at some in South Africa with our company. The real difference is that as a candidate, now I go in and I get guided to the right sort of jobs based on my [resume]. The system parses the [resume], finds my skills and tells me there’s some jobs that might suit me. And then the recruiter who’s looking for someone with those skills doesn’t have to search through hundreds and hundreds of [resumes]. They get presented the ones that have the matching skills to the top of the list.

“So recruiters still have the list of 100 [applicants] if they want to look at them, but the ones that are matching what they’re looking for are at the top of the list. And that list [of applicants] could come not just from my unit…, but also includes DHL’s Express supply chain and our Freight Forwarding units in different parts of the country. They get to see it all now, not just that singular entry point.”
What’s the most unexpected benefit from the genAI-assisted, unified career site? “The unexpected things? This last couple of weeks, we’ve discovered that we are the most visible career platform in Germany. That means if you go searching for a job in Germany, you will find DHL before any other site, and we’re very close to being the number one job site in a lot of other countries as well. That is because it takes a good [career] site platform and it takes a good understanding of how you use that platform. We’ve reached the point where those two things have become really congruent. So we have some great people doing wonderful things with the content, continually updating our tags and the language alignment.
“But we also, of course, have a platform that allows us to do that fast and efficiently and we’ve set up a really nice process where we have people who are responsible for administering the content. In Costa Rica, in Malaysia, and in the Netherlands, it’s 24 hours a day those updates are made. So, for example, if the administrator in a particular company comes to us today and says something like, ‘We’ve just heard that XYZ company is closing down and we immediately want to get something onto the career site so that we can bring their employees to our site,’ we have someone somewhere in the world that can get that content on to the system. We didn’t realize that this would even be possible when we brought the product on.
 
 
 













 
 

“The expected things? Our reputation is improving, particularly with technical talent and young talent. Our ability to customize and really target content to appeal to certain [talent] audiences…has been quite rewarding.”
In what other ways has DHL used generative AI technology other than the career site? “We have what we call our Career Marketplace, which is an internal marketplace recommending people not only for jobs, but also learning networks and mentoring and these types of experiences. We’re in the middle of rolling that out at the moment. That will also include some very nice AI capabilities.
“We use a generative AI chatbot specifically for creating some of our internal marketing content, so, short videos and…training videos and things like that. The chatbot is called GAIA, which stands for Generative AI & Intelligent Automation.
“Internally, it has been super for those things also, because it doesn’t have to be done by a specialist, it can be done by people who have the right tools now. The company has been very wise and very fast, but at the same time cautious in setting up an internal generative AI tool that our employees can use, and that’s safe, and that’s compliant, and that’s able to be accessed by…everyone. Anyone who is the least bit interested in accessing it can. That has had two benefits: one, it gives people an awareness of what generative AI is and that it’s an actually something valuable if you use it well. And two, it also helps those who may have some fear or concerns understand that it’s not a monster. It is just a tool.
In what ways did DHL train its full-time employees in the use of AI? “We have a group within our company that took a more proactive role in informing and educating [employees], running workshops and webinars and inviting people to information sessions that were a bit more formal than our previous sort of soft rollout. And, there also people who are responsible for using AI or creating algorithms or machine learning or data analysts, who have had very formal education, and they’re using some of our learning partners to provide them with proper education on AI.”
Who are your learning partners? Are they universities in the various countries you’re located or online course providers? “We use Coursera a lot, for example. Also, Skillsoft Percipio. We also do have partnerships with universities…and other places that provide us with super advanced levels of education.”
Can you offer any tips for other organizations who are considering rolling out AI? What should they avoid? “I think they should avoid hysteria. I think what our company has done super well is I have never felt scared of AI. It was explained to us that this technology was just something that’s coming. It’s going to help us. It’s not going to cause problems if you get on board. There’s a quote that we’ve kind of thrown around in our business a bit. I can’t remember who it comes from, but it says something like, ‘AI is not going to get rid of our jobs. Our jobs are not going to be taken by AI. Our jobs are going to be taken by people who know how to use AI.’
“It’s not about replacing your job or being something you should be afraid of. It’s about getting your arms around it and learning how it’s going to help you be better at what you do.”

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are no longer just buzzwords but realities reshaping our daily lives, the future of work stands at the brink of a significant transformation. This evolution promises to redefine not just how tasks are accomplished but also the very nature of jobs, posing both opportunities and challenges for the workforce.
The Wave of Change
The advent of AI and automation has heralded unprecedented efficiency and innovation across various sectors. From manufacturing lines where robots assemble products with precision to software algorithms that manage complex data analytics, these technologies are setting new standards for productivity. In the service industry, AI-driven tools are enhancing customer experience through personalized interactions, while in healthcare, they assist in diagnosing diseases with remarkable accuracy.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 1.02%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

However, this wave of technological advancement brings with it concerns of job displacement. Routine and manual jobs are most at risk, as machines can perform these tasks faster and without fatigue. Even certain cognitive roles are being automated, as AI systems develop capabilities to handle tasks requiring analysis and decision-making.
The Undiminished Value of Human Skills
Despite these disruptions, the human element remains irreplaceable in many aspects of work. Skills such as creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving stand out as uniquely human strengths that AI and automation cannot replicate. For instance, while AI can aid in diagnosing patients, the empathy and care provided by healthcare professionals are crucial for patient recovery. Similarly, in creative industries, AI tools may assist in the creative process, but the original vision and emotional depth of art come from human imagination.
The future of work, therefore, is not about humans versus machines but about how humans can leverage these technologies to enhance their capabilities and explore new opportunities. The emphasis is now on enhancing human capabilities through AI and automation, paving the way for more fulfilling and significant job roles.
Preparing for the Future
As the job landscape evolves, so too must the workforce. Preparing for the future involves embracing lifelong learning and adapting to new roles that emerge as technology advances. Here are key strategies for individuals and organizations:


Skill Development: Continuous learning to acquire new skills or upgrade existing ones is vital. Emphasis should be on digital literacy, technical skills related to AI and automation, and uniquely human skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and interpersonal communication.


Flexibility and Adaptability: The ability to adapt to changing job roles and industries will become increasingly important. Workers may need to transition across different career paths during their lifetime, requiring flexibility and resilience.


Collaborative Workspaces: Organizations should foster environments that promote collaboration between humans and AI. By designing roles that combine the strengths of both, businesses can unlock innovation and efficiency.


Ethical Considerations and Job Creation: As automation displaces certain jobs, societies and economies must consider the ethical implications and focus on creating new employment opportunities in emerging sectors. This includes investing in education and training programs that prepare the workforce for future demands.


Looking Ahead
The future of work is not a distant concept but a rapidly unfolding reality. AI and automation are set to enrich the work environment with efficiencies and innovations, yet the essence of what makes work meaningful — creativity, empathy, and human interaction — remains firmly in the domain of humans. By embracing change, focusing on lifelong skill development, and leveraging the strengths of both humans and machines, individuals and organizations can navigate the future of work with optimism and resilience.
In conclusion, the narrative of the future of work is complex, marked by challenges of adaptation and opportunities for growth. It is a future that calls for a collaborative effort between technology and humanity, ensuring that as we stride into new horizons of work, we carry forward the irreplaceable value of human creativity, empathy, and ingenuity. The journey ahead is not just about adapting to changes but about shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential, making the world of work not only more efficient but also more human.
