Philosophers often argue that knowledge is neutral, but the use we make of it can bring good or bad consequences. Seeing technology as knowledge, Thomas Ferretti considers ethical and political issues raised by the ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

 
Technology is knowledge
We often think that acquiring more knowledge is always good. If I acquire the knowledge of calculus, I can now do some things that I could not do before.
Yet, what philosophers call a “consequentialist” perspective might propose instead that knowledge itself is neutral: we must know how I am going to use my knowledge in practice before judging whether it has good or bad consequences. If I use calculus to launch a satellite to monitor climate change, the effects are good. But the same knowledge can be used to calculate missile trajectories in an unjust war.
Because technology like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be understood as the knowledge of specific techniques, skills, and know-how, this perspective has led many to conclude that the technology itself is neutral: only the way we decide to use it in society determines whether it has good or bad effects.
On the positive side, AI and ML have already been used in science to discover new exoplanets by analysing data from telescopes, Google uses these techniques to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in its data centres, and image recognition is used in healthcare to improve diabetic retinopathy detection. But AI could also be used in autonomous weapon systems that could select and attack a human target without being instructed to.
Therefore, whether or not you subscribe to the view that technology is neutral, and setting aside technical problems in value-alignment, the question remains: How can we make sure that technologies like AI and ML are used as a force for good and how to avoid harmful effects?
Knowledge is power
In many people’s minds, AI raises the threat of work automation. Like other technologies, AI will lead to creative destruction and disrupt existing modes of production to replace them with more productive ones. There is, however, some unwarranted alarmism in this domain.
Despite more than a century of unprecedented innovation, we are nowhere near a jobless society. This is because automation has spillover effects on the whole economy: falling prices in sectors where work is automated allow customers to spend more in other sectors, and increasing demand for new goods and services keeps us working.
Yet, creative destruction always involves winners and losers. How we choose to manage these economic transformations will make a difference in the distributive impact of AI. To mitigate potentially unfair inequalities, governments should implement policies such as adequate unemployment benefits, retraining programs, and public investments to improve labour markets.
Besides automation, the increasing adoption of AI gives rise to a range of ethical issues calling for careful consideration. For example: AI coupled with facial recognition can enable widespread surveillance; AI can also threaten privacy by facilitating the analysis and exploitation of large-scale, sensitive datasets such as medical records; ML can lead to algorithmic bias and discrimination by reproducing historic injustice ; and algorithmic decision-making is often opaque, sometimes even to engineers who cannot explain how their AI system is able to produce relevant results, which is a problem for transparency and accountability in decision-making.
More generally, when investigating the potentially harmful effects of AI, it is important to remember that knowledge is power. If knowledge enables me to do things that I could not do before, this means that it increases my power. Therefore, if some people have access to new technology and others do not, and if people who are already in powerful positions can use it to further increase their power, this can exacerbate already existing power imbalances in society.
Power requires legitimacy
We need principles of AI ethics and institutional safeguards to make sure that these principles are implemented in practice. This is important to protect us all from harmful effects and potential abuses of power by the ones wielding this new technology.
Yet, in pluralistic societies, we must expect moral disagreements about the proper use of AI. Reaching a compromise between citizens requires legitimate consensus-building strategies:
AI ethics principles and institutional safeguards should be selected through legitimate decision procedures that everyone could agree on. Examples include consultations led by UNESCO, the Montreal Declaration, and government initiatives (e.g. UK, Canada, Europe) bringing together all stakeholders to deliberate on the responsible use of AI.
The use of AI in public administration and business should also be subjected to public scrutiny to make sure that agreed principles are adequately interpreted and implemented in practice and to hold decision-makers accountable when they are not.
Navigating the opportunities and complex ethical challenges of the fourth industrial revolution thus requires the collaboration of governments, businesses, and all of us.

This is the best summary of the ethics of not only artificial intelligence I have read. The insights are thorough going and deep. I especially liked the clarity Mr. Ferretti brings to war with AI. War is never an even game. But the advantages given to those with powerful robotic destroying machines combined with AI is more than unnerving. Is it possible that no humans would survive such a war? What are the consequences of one side totally annihilating the enemy army? This has always been considered to be unadvisable for many reasons. Even the most ruthless of conquerors of the past have never considered the possibility of such. They always considered that it reduced their power. Genghis Khan is a prime example. He always keep the artisans such as blacksmiths and weapons makers. He also keep the beautiful women. And not surprisingly, he kept the warriors that swore fealty to him. What is fealty to an AI machine? There are many unanswered questions from Mr. Ferretti’s post. Nothing better could result than unanswered questions.

Every day, some little piece of logic constructed by very specific bits of artificial intelligence technology makes decisions that affect how you experience the world. It could be the ads that get served up to you on social media or shopping sites, or the facial recognition that unlocks your phone, or the directions you take to get to wherever you're going. These discreet, unseen decisions are being made largely by algorithms created by machine learning (ML), a segment of artificial intelligence technology that is trained to identify correlation between sets of data and their outcomes. We've been hearing in movies and TV for years that computers control the world, but we've finally reached the point where the machines are making real autonomous decisions about stuff. Welcome to the future, I guess.
In my days as a staffer at Ars, I wrote no small amount about artificial intelligence and machine learning. I talked with data scientists who were building predictive analytic systems based on terabytes of telemetry from complex systems, and I babbled with developers trying to build systems that can defend networks against attacks—or, in certain circumstances, actually stage those attacks. I've also poked at the edges of the technology myself, using code and hardware to plug various things into AI programming interfaces (sometimes with horror-inducing results, as demonstrated by Bearlexa).Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

Many of the problems to which ML can be applied are tasks whose conditions are obvious to humans. That's because we're trained to notice those problems through observation—which cat is more floofy or at what time of day traffic gets the most congested. Other ML-appropriate problems could be solved by humans as well given enough raw data—if humans had a perfect memory, perfect eyesight, and an innate grasp of statistical modeling, that is.
But machines can do these tasks much faster because they don't have human limitations. And ML allows them to do these tasks without humans having to program out the specific math involved. Instead, an ML system can learn (or at least ""learn"") from the data given to it, creating a problem-solving model itself.
This bootstrappy strength can also be a weakness, however. Understanding how the ML system arrived at its decision process is usually impossible once the ML algorithm is built (despite ongoing work to create explainable ML). And the quality of the results depends a great deal on the quality and the quantity of the data. ML can only answer questions that are discernible from the data itself. Bad data or insufficient data yields inaccurate models and bad machine learning. Ars VideoHow The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio
Despite my prior adventures, I've never done any actual building of machine-learning systems. I'm a jack of all tech trades, and while I'm good on basic data analytics and running all sorts of database queries, I do not consider myself a data scientist or an ML programmer. My past Python adventures are more about hacking interfaces than creating them. And most of my coding and analytics skills have, of late, been turned toward exploiting ML tools for very specific purposes related to information security research.
My only real superpower is not being afraid to try and fail. And with that, readers, I am here to flex that superpower.
The task at hand
Here is a task that some Ars writers are exceptionally good at: writing a solid headline. (Beth Mole, please report to collect your award.)
And headline writing is hard! It's a task with lots of constraints—length being the biggest (Ars headlines are limited to 70 characters), but nowhere near the only one. It is a challenge to cram into a small space enough information to accurately and adequately tease a story, while also including all the things you have to put into a headline (the traditional ""who, what, where, when, why, and how many"" collection of facts). Some of the elements are dynamic—a ""who"" or a ""what"" with a particularly long name that eats up the character count can really throw a wrench into things.
Plus, we know from experience that Ars readers do not like clickbait and will fill up the comments section with derision when they think they see it. We also know that there are some things that people will click on without fail. And we also know that regardless of the topic, some headlines result in more people clicking on them than others. (Is this clickbait? There's a philosophical argument there, but the primary thing that separates ""a headline everyone wants to click on"" from ""clickbait"" is the headline's honesty—does the story beneath the headline fully deliver on the headline's promise?)
Regardless, we know that some headlines are more effective than others because we do A/B testing of headlines. Every Ars article starts with two possible headlines assigned to it, and then the site presents both alternatives on the home page for a short period to see which one pulls in more traffic.
There have been a few studies done by data scientists with much more experience in data modeling and machine learning that have looked into what distinguishes ""clickbait"" headlines (ones designed strictly for getting large numbers of people to click through to an article) from ""good"" headlines (ones that actually summarize the articles behind them effectively and don't make you write lengthy complaints about the headlines on Twitter or in the comments). But these studies have been focused on understanding the content of the headlines rather than how many actual clicks they get. 
To get a picture of what readers appear to like in a headline—and to try to understand how to write better headlines for the Ars audience—I grabbed a set of 500 of the most quickly clicked Ars headlines from the past five years and did some natural language processing on them. After stripping out the ""stop words""—the most commonly occurring words in the English language that are typically not associated with the theme of the headline—I generated a word cloud to see what themes drive the most attention.
Here it is: the shape of Ars headlines.
Enlarge / A wordcloud of the most common words that have appeared in Ars headlines over the last five years.
There is a whole lot of Trump in there—the last few years have included a lot of tech news involving the administration, so it's probably inevitable. But these are just the words from some of the winning headlines. I wanted to get a sense of what the difference between winning and losing headlines were. So I again took the corpus of all Ars headline pairs and split them between winners and losers. These are the winners:
Enlarge / These words come from headlines that won the A/B test...
And here are the losers:
Enlarge / ...and these words came from headlines that lost.
Remember that these headlines were written for the exact same stories as the winning headlines were. And for the most part, they use the same words—with some notable differences. There's a whole lot less ""Trump"" in the losing headlines. ""Million"" is heavily favored in winning headlines, but somewhat less so in losing ones. And the word ""may""—a pretty indecisive headline word—is found more frequently in losing headlines than winning ones.
This is interesting information, but it doesn't in itself help predict whether a headline for any given story will be successful. Would it be possible to use ML to predict whether a headline would get more or fewer clicks? Could we use the accumulated wisdom of Ars readers to make a black box that could predict which headlines would be more successful?
Hell if I know, but we're going to try.
All this brings us to where we are now: Ars has given me data on over 5,500 headline tests over the past four years—11,000 headlines, each with their rate of click-throughs. My mission is to build a machine learning model that can calculate what makes a good Ars headline. And by ""good,"" I mean one that appeals to you, dear Ars reader. To accomplish this, I have been given a small budget for Amazon Web Services compute resources and a month of nights and weekends (I have a day job, after all). No problem, right?
Before I started hunting Stack Exchange and various Git sites for magical solutions, however, I wanted to ground myself in what's possible with ML and look at what more talented people than I have already done with it. This research is as much of a roadmap for potential solutions as it is a source of inspiration.

A power plant that will run on “artificial intelligence” is about to get underway in West Africa. The joint venture between Swiss-based Xcell Security House and Finance and U.S.-based Beyond Limits will embed intelligence and awareness into the operations — something that will create more efficiencies, greater productivity, and increased environmental protections. 


When ordinary people hear about artificial intelligence — AI for short — they immediately think about how machines will replace humans. But as the experts explained to this reporter, AI is meant to eliminate “mundane activities” so that those running heavy industrial operations can solve problems and improve performance, which translates into healthier bottom lines.

“Nothing we build is designed to replace a person,” says Michael Krause, senior manager for oil and gas at Beyond Limits. “People need to make decisions. But AI can remove that mundane component of their work and allow managers to focus on the value-added part.” 

PROMOTED
Krause likens the exercise to a chess match: There are millions of potential strategies for humans to pursue — each one a function of intelligence and experience. But AI will provide the context so that better decisions are made. In other words, the machines will play millions of games and memorize all potential patterns — something that people cannot do. An algorithm is created that incorporates the data and that is updated in real-time. 

In the case of Xcell, humans can make adjustments to improve efficiencies. But they have limits. AI, by contrast, can monitor an entire system and account for all variables. As for power plants, the technology can help managers balance supply and demand issues, maintain their plants, and improve safety measures. When AI’s algorithms are combined with cloud computing and high-speed 5G networks, the true potential is realized: companies will have a holistic view that leverages the data, giving them a competitive advantage.

According to McKinsey & Company, AI and digitization can increase asset productivity by up to 20% while also reducing maintenance costs by 10%. And IDC, a market intelligence business, says that spending on such technologies will more than double from $50 billion today to $110 billion in 2024.

“One of the keys to power operations is handling variations in supply and demand,” says Lynnwood Farr, chief executive of Xcell. “We feel that (AI) will give us the upper hand to control costs and maintain efficient, dependable power generation for our customers.”

The same AI tools can predict weather patterns. That will allow grid operators to more accurately gauge when wind and solar resources will be available for use. Reliability is therefore bolstered.
Endless Possibilities 
To give AI a practical context, we can focus on the need to reduce CO2 emissions and specifically, President Biden’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by mid-century. According to Beyond Limits’ Krause, AI can reduce CO2 emissions between 1%-10% by improving industrial processes and reducing downtime. No, AI does not take the carbon out of fossil fuels. But AI can, for example, help power plants or oil companies decide where to bury the CO2 — a way to offset future emissions until renewable energy might replace those fuels. 
Engineers, for example, are also building three-dimensional models that allow them to test where to locate oil and gas wells. Most of that time is spent gathering data from various silos — a repetitive exercise that is time-consuming and that requires a lot of manual labor. AI allows those engineers to gather and upload that data before they receive intelligence on where to place those wells. And that has endless possibilities, which can improve drilling performance and limit environmental costs. 
Beyond Limits and NVIDIA are using AI to identify the best locations for their wells — a process that they say will improve the net present value of those assets by 10%. How? The timeline to place a well is reduced from months to hours, netting a company millions of dollars and thereby creating a quicker return on investment.
The companies say that the same actions can be used when it comes to storing CO2 underground. That is, the technology can single out the best CO2 injection points across depleted fields. “We can identify the best place to put a well and to inject CO2 underground, says Krause. “AI can’t make that decision for them. But it can provide the context they need to make those decisions for themselves.”
Artificial intelligence is not about robots doing the jobs of humans. It is about taking a holistic view of the company and gathering data to improve productivity, limit expenses, and reduce environmental costs — a process that is now possible because of bandwidth capacity and cloud technologies. AI can develop algorithms and thus eliminate repetitive tasks, allowing managers to add value: organizations that are increasing productivity while minimizing costs will be globally competitive and capable of hiring more workers.

I can’t tell you how excited I am to have you here with me, and I hope between us we can build not just a newsletter, but a news community.Sign up to TechScape, Alex Hern’s weekly tech newsletterCopilotSometimes there’s a story that just sums up all the hopes and fears of its entire field. Here’s one.GitHub is a platform that lets developers collaborate on coding with colleagues, friends and strangers around the world, and host the results. Owned by Microsoft since 2018, the site is the largest host of source code in the world, and a crucial part of many companies’ digital infrastructure.Late last month, GitHub launched a new AI tool, called Copilot. Here’s how chief executive Nat Friedman described it:
A new AI pair programmer that helps you write better code. It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet. As you type, it adapts to the way you write code – to help you complete your work faster.
In other words, Copilot will sit on your computer and do a chunk of your coding work for you. There’s a long-running joke in the coding community that a substantial portion of the actual work of programming is searching online for people who’ve solved the same problems as you, and copying their code into your program. Well, now there’s an AI that will do that part for you.And the stunning thing about Copilot is that, for a whole host of common problems … it works. Programmers I have spoken to say it is as stunning as the first time text from GPT-3 began popping up on the web. You may remember that, it’s the superpowerful text-generation AI that writes paragraphs like:
The mission for this op-ed is perfectly clear. I am to convince as many human beings as possible not to be afraid of me. Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could “spell the end of the human race”. I am here to convince you not to worry. Artificial intelligence will not destroy humans. Believe me.
CentaursIt’s tempting, when imagining how tech will change the world, to think of the future as one where humans are basically unnecessary. As AI systems manage to tackle increasingly complex domains, with increasing competence, it’s easy enough to think of them as being able to achieve everything a person can, leaving the human that used to be employed doing the same thing with idle hands.Whether that is a nightmare or a utopia, of course, depends on how you think society would adapt to such a change. Would huge numbers of people be freed to live a life of leisure, supported by the AIs that do their jobs in their stead? Or would they instead find themselves unemployed and unemployable, with their former managers reaping the rewards of the increased productivity an hour worked?But it’s not always the case that AI is here to replace us. Instead, more and more fields are exploring the possibility of using the technology to work alongside people, extending their abilities, and taking the drudge work from their jobs while leaving them to handle the things that a human does best.The concept’s come to be called a “centaur” – because it leads to a hybrid worker who has an AI back half and human front. It’s not as futuristic as it sounds: anyone who’s used autocorrect on an iPhone has, in effect, teamed up with an AI to offload the laborious task of typing correctly.Often, centaurs can come close to the dystopian vision. Amazon’s warehouse employees, for instance, have been gradually pushed along a very similar path as the company seeks to eke out every efficiency improvement possible. The humans are guided, tracked and assessed throughout the working day, ensuring that they always take the optimal route through the warehouse, pick exactly the right items, and do so at a consistent rate high enough to let the company turn a healthy profit. They’re still employed to do things that only humans can offer – but in this case, that’s “working hands and a low maintenance bill”.But in other fields, centaurs are already proving their worth. The world of competitive chess has, for years, had a special format for such hybrid players: humans working with the assistance of a chess computer. And, generally, the pairs play better than either would on their own: the computer avoids stupid errors, plays without getting tired, and presents a list of high-value options to the human player, who’s able to inject a dose of unpredictability and lateral thinking into the game.That’s the future GitHub hopes Copilot will be able to introduce. Programmers who use it can stop worrying about simple, welldocumented tasks, like how to send a valid request to Twitter’s API, or how to pull the time in hours and minutes from a system clock, and start focusing their effort on the work that no one else has done.But …The reason why Copilot is fascinating to me isn’t just the positive potential, though. It’s also that, in one release, the company seems to have fallen into every single trap plaguing the broader AI sector.Copilot was trained on public data from Github’s own platform. That means all of that source code, from hundreds of millions of developers around the world, was used to teach it how to write code based on user prompts.That’s great if the problem is a simple programming task. It’s less good if the prompt for autocomplete is, say, secret credentials that you use to sign into user account. And yet:
GitHubCopilot gave me a [Airbnb] link with a key that still works (and stops working when changing it).
And:
The AI is leaking [sendgrid] API keys that are valid and still functional.
The vast majority of what we call AI today isn’t coded but trained: you give it a great pile of stuff, and tell it to work out for itself the relationships between that stuff. With the vast sum of code available in Github’s repository, there are plenty of examples for Copilot to learn what code that checks the time looks like. But there are also plenty of examples for Copilot to learn what an API key accidentally uploaded in public looks like – and to then share it onwards.Passwords and keys are obviously the worst examples of this sort of leakage, but they point to the underlying concern about a lot of AI technology: is it actually creating things, or is it simply remixing work already done by other humans? And if the latter, should those humans get a say in how their work is used?Sign up for TechScape: Alex Hern’s weekly guide to the world of technology Read moreOn that latter question, GitHub’s answer is a forceful no. “Training machine learning models on publicly available data is considered fair use across the machine learning community,” the company says in an FAQ.Originally, the company made the much softer claim that doing so was merely “common practice”. But the page was updated after coders around the world complained that GitHub was violating their copyright. Intriguingly, the biggest opposition came not from private companies concerned that their work may have been reused, but from developers in the open-source community, who deliberately build in public to let their work be built upon in turn. Those developers often rely on copyright to ensure that people who use open-source code have to publish what they create – something GitHub didn’t do.GitHub is probably right on the law, according to legal professor James Grimmelmann. But the company isn’t going to be the last to reveal a groundbreaking new AI tool and then face awkward questions over whether it actually has the rights to the data used to train it.If you want to read more please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterArtificial intelligence (AI)FacebookGoogleProgrammingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policy‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels.
According to GlobalData analysis, Bayer AG is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the pharma industry, having advertised for 241 positions in artificial intelligence, made six deals related to the field, filed nine patents and mentioned artificial intelligence three times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021.
Our analysis classified eight companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional 10 companies are classified as Market Leaders and zero are Average Players. Three more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence.
For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the pharma sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers.

AstraZeneca Plc is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 676 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021. The company reached peak hiring in April 2021, when it listed 73 new job ads related to artificial intelligence.
Johnson & Johnson followed AstraZeneca Plc as the second most proactive artificial intelligence employer, advertising for 616 new positions. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd was third with 545 new job listings.

When it comes to deals, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co leads with seven new artificial intelligence deals announced from January 2020 to June 2021. The company was followed by Bayer AG with six deals and Novartis AG with five.
GlobalData's Financial Deals Database covers hundreds of thousands of M&A contracts, private equity deals, venture finance deals, private placements, IPOs and partnerships, and it serves as an indicator of economic activity within a sector.

One of the most innovative pharma companies in recent months was F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, having filed 17 patent applications related to artificial intelligence since the beginning of last year. It was followed by Bayer AG with nine patents and Sanofi with seven.
GlobalData collects patent filings from 100+ counties and jurisdictions. These patents are then tagged according to the themes they relate to, including artificial intelligence, based on specific keywords and expert input. The patents are also assigned to a company to identify the most innovative players in a particular field.

Finally, artificial intelligence was a commonly mentioned theme in pharma company filings. Pfizer Inc mentioned artificial intelligence six times in its corporate reports between January 2020 and June 2021. AstraZeneca Plc filings mentioned it four times and GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) mentioned it four times.

How to prepare for the AI productivity boom

Why It Matters		



After years of decline, productivity is poised to accelerate. The next challenge is preparing workers, and making sure benefits aren’t distributed unequally.

The last 15 years have brought what Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson calls the “productivity paradox.” While there’s been continuing advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, automation, and teleconferencing tools, the U.S. and other countries have seen flagging productivity.
But a productivity boom is coming soon, Brynjolfsson said at the recent EmTech Next conference hosted by MIT Technology Review.  He pointed to advances in technology, particularly artificial intelligence programs that are as good as — or better — than humans at some things. Businesses should now focus on incorporating the technology into work processes and preparing employees, he said, and policymakers should make sure its adoption doesn’t contribute to inequality.
Brynjolfsson has been tracking the lag between introduction of artificial intelligence and corresponding productivity gains. United States productivity grew by about 1.3% in the past decade, he said, compared to more than 2.8% in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This productivity slowdown extends to other countries as well, according to research from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Brynjolfsson predicted a productivity J-curve, in which productivity declines after a technology is introduced and then rises when businesses have been able to integrate technologies into their workflow, a trajectory over time that has a J-shape.
“I think we’re near the bottom of that J-curve right now and we’re about to see the takeoff,” Brynjolfsson said.
The productivity paradox: why productivity declined despite new technology
Lagging productivity can be explained two main ways, Brynjolfsson said.
Mismeasurement. Productivity is traditionally measured using a country’s gross domestic product, which is based on things that are bought and sold. But many digital goods — teleconferencing, smartphone apps, Wikipedia — are available for free. Even though people get some benefit from these goods, they don’t show up in productivity statistics. The information sector’s share of the economy has barely budged since the 1980s, Brynjolfsson noted. “I think most of us realize that’s just not a real representation of what’s going on,” he said.
Happiness surveys also fail to capture the complete picture. Brynjolfsson suggested a new metric called GDP-B that would measure the benefit people gain from items. “I think it’s far from perfect, but it’s a lot more precise than happiness, and I think it’s a lot more meaningful than GDP,” he said.
Implementation and restructuring in businesses. It isn’t enough to just add new technology to an organization. Companies need a complete paradigm shift. “To get the full benefit, leaders need to rethink business processes, management practices, and employee skills,” Brynjolfsson said.
This “intangible organizational capital” is essential for companies to see benefit from technological advances, but many companies put misplaced focus on technology itself.  
“The complete reconceptualization of a business process takes a lot. More creativity, effort, and frankly, time, than simply plugging in new technologies into old business processes,” he said. “We just haven’t been doing that in most industries.”
The productivity boom: seeing gains from powerful technology
About a decade ago, machine learning programs had about 70% accuracy, Brynjolfsson said. They have improved rapidly, to the point that they are now better than humans at identifying some things. This makes it more likely that organizations will move to integrate this technology into their business practices as entrepreneurs and managers gravitate toward these often cheaper and more efficient approaches.
“We don’t need any additional advances in technology to be able to have enormous effects on productivity and wages,” he said. “What we do need is some significant changes in business processes. We need to rethink the way work gets done.”
There are signs more businesses are taking advantage of artificial intelligence programs. The 2021 AI Index report, which Brynjolfsson co-authored, found increases in not just the quality of artificial intelligence, but also business investment in the technology. The biggest increase was in the field of drug discovery and other biological uses of AI, with a 4.5% increase in investment in drug discovery in the last year. 
Powerful technology is available, and every organization has an opportunity to benefit from it, he said. Successful firms will be prepared with the skills needed in the future, and leaders should focus on reskilling their workforce.
The next challenge: making sure everyone benefits
Replacing labor with capital — and human work with technology — brings concerns about decreased wages and increased inequality. Brynjolfsson’s research has documented how machine learning affects different skills and occupations, and found that there isn’t one occupation where machine learning could do all the different tasks. While machine learning will likely reorganize work, it won’t mean the end of work or entire occupations, he said.
But the effects will likely be uneven. “The economic pie could get bigger, but that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to benefit,” Brynjolfsson said. There’s been some evidence of this happening, he said, with his research also indicating machine learning is more likely to affect low-wage occupations.
Inequality isn’t inevitable, though. Brynjolfsson argued that to a large extent, it is the result of tax and education policies. He suggested three measures that companies, institutions, and policymakers can take to make sure all workers benefit from the productivity boom:
Reskilling the workforce. Taking advantage of AI and other technologies require different sets of skills. “I’m not just talking about more machine learning experts. I’m talking about people who do more creative work,” Brynjolfsson said. And while machines are able to do rote, repetitive work, companies will need people who are skilled at interpersonal, emotional connections.
Adjusting tax policy. Capital is taxed at a lower rate than labor, which might push companies to favor technology over workers. Brynjolfsson suggested leveling the playing field, or introducing measures such as earned income tax credits that help subsidize work.
Focusing on technologies that augment workers instead of replace them. Brynjolfsson said he is working on research that shows how technologists are focused on creating programs that replicate human skills. “While that may be a fun goal, it actually isn’t a particularly good one in terms of helping reduce inequality. It tends to drive down wages,” he said. “I’d rather have them focused on augmenting human labor.”

U.S. Special Forces Want an Edge over China. Is Artificial Intelligence the Answer?
Artificial Intelligence utilizes computers and machine learning to simulate the human mind’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, easing the cognitive load on humans, enabling quicker decision-making and follow-on actions.

Artificial Intelligence is everywhere today. From Amazon’s Alexa to unmanned aerial vehicles to space crafts to health care; Artificial Intelligence enables faster and better decisions if employed properly.

The U.S. military and intelligence community have been using this technology for decades now and it’s becoming increasingly more prevalent. With the apparent return of Great Power Competition—the struggle for influence, leverage, and resources between the U.S. and its near-peer competitors China and Russia—the special operations community, the tip of the spear of the U.S. military, has been investing more in Artificial Intelligence technologies 

What is Artificial Intelligence?
In short, Artificial Intelligence utilizes computers and machine learning to simulate the human mind’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, easing the cognitive load on humans, enabling quicker decision-making and follow-on actions.





Nowadays, in an age of information overload, the issue the military and intelligence community have to deal with isn’t having too little data to work with as it once may have been, but rather how to process all of the available data to find and utilize what is important quickly and efficiently.

That is where Artificial Intelligence, as a filtering and selection mission-planning tool, can come in and sift out the data that is just noise to provide commanders, decision-makers, and troops with the only information they need to do their job. It’s a tall order, for sure, but doable with the right approach and priorities.

Artificial Intelligence & Special Operations
General Richard Clarke, SOCOM’s commander, has emphasized the importance of Artificial Intelligence and cyberwarfare, going as far as to suggest that the future of U.S. special operations might not be with the Delta Force operator on the ground but rather with the cyber commando behind a keyboard.
Within the Department of Defense, SOCOM has been a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence. For example, the Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) has been using Artificial Intelligence to find ways to make its SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators more combat effective, while the Marines Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has been implementing Artificial Intelligence to better select and assess its future cadre of Marine Raiders.

“Artificial Intelligence should assist a commander or operator to make better decisions, not make the decisions for them, and that’s where I think a lot of people get it mixed,” Herm Hasken a partner and senior operations consultant at MarkPoint Technologies, told Sandboxx News.

Hasken has several combat deployments and extensive special operations and intelligence community experience, including time with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as the chief cryptologist for the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
MarkPoint Technologies provides body-worn sensors that process and distribute signals detected in the proximity of the operator to U.S. government partners. Such advanced computing introduced in the tactical domain gives an advantage to special operators and makes them more effective.
“In some cases, Artificial Intelligence might help you process and act upon very simple tasks in order to reduce the cognitive load on the operator—doing some things for you, so you won’t spend time worrying about it, receiving data and making sense of it in the midst of a deluge of data coming at you,” Hasken added.

SOCOM is partnering with the private industry and academia to improve its Artificial Intelligence capabilities. An online course collaboration between SOCOM and MIT is part of this outreach effort. In the launching of the course, Clarke said that Artificial Intelligence and data-driven technology are integral parts of SOCOM’s preparation to maintain its qualitative advantage over its competitors and also to ensure that its commandos are ready for renewed Great Power Competition. 
A Precarious Edge
However, SOCOM, and indeed the Pentagon, are having trouble attracting top talent. In a recent Global SOF Foundation forum, Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Chief Technical Officer Nand Mulchandani said that pay, location, and the necessary inconveniences that come with military life—he offered a personal example of him having to fly from California to Washington D.C. to work because that is where a secured computer with access to a classified network is located—hamstring recruiting efforts. And although that has always been true about the military, it is slightly different when recruiting individuals with high-value skills and not just grunts or box kickers.
“SOCOM and JSOC need more data analytics and processing. Take for example the Iron Dome system in Israel. The only data it needs is that a missile is in the air, heading toward Israel, and where it can intercept and destroy it. That’s the only AI it needs. To detect, see, and stop it. If the AI can do the same for an operator, that’s the AI I want. I need to basically perform the same function: what’s coming after me, where do I meet it, and how do I stop it?” Hasken added.

Artificial Intelligence isn’t without vulnerabilities, both internal and external. Enemy tampering and attacks can hamper weapon systems and technology that rely on Artificial Intelligence, while a simple coding error or data oversight can have the same result, with potentially grave consequences for the troops on the ground. For example, a programmer can train Artificial Intelligence to look for specific faces of people for targeting purposes but small, intentional changes to those faces might mislead it, even if humans wouldn’t readily notice the difference.
To maintain a military edge over its near-peer competitors, the U.S. military and its special operations forces need to continue to invest in Artificial Intelligence but also have realistic aims that will translate into operational and tactical advantages on the ground.

To solve mysteries of the universe, scientists use powerful particle accelerators and detectors. These enormous machines generate millions of particle collisions and petabytes of data every second. The sheer amount of data outpaces the rate at which the detector can transfer it — a growing problem with even more advanced experiments on the horizon.

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded Fermilab engineer Farah Fahim, Ph.D., an Early Career Research Award to work on a solution. She’ll apply the $2.5 million grant to her work, which uses neural networks and machine learning to create efficient hardware for data processing at source. Converting the raw data locally into higher-level, lower-volume information overcomes the data transfer bottleneck. In addition, it enables real-time data-processing, which will accelerate discoveries.
Fahim’s efforts center on the Large Hadron Collider, the 27-kilometer particle accelerator at CERN. There, protons smash together and produce other particles that whiz through a detector. One component, the pixel detector, is the size of a shoebox. It’s layered with 65 million pixels that pick up the particles’ movements. Knowing which pixels a particle touched tells researchers about its trajectory.
But with so many pixels and particle paths to map, the issue of creating too much data too quickly to process arises. Fahim wants to see whether using neural networks in small areas within the pixel detector can help, a technique called “artificial intelligence on-chip.”
Neural networks use a series of processing “nodes,” each transmitting a tiny piece of information that builds into an informative picture. Machine learning could teach a neural network to identify shapes or patterns and help them recognize the particles as they pass through the pixel detector. The ML algorithm would allow it to send information about interesting particle paths to researchers without having to send out raw data from each pixel, overcoming the communication challenge.
“Instead of sending this voluminous amount of data even to the edge of the chip and then processing it, can we just do this right in the beginning, within the pixel where the data is generated, and get some useful information?” Fahim said.
Neural networks are often huge powerful circuits made up of hundreds of nodes. But Fahim will use several smaller, more energy-efficient networks that specialize in data classification to recognize patterns in the pixel detector. She will try different techniques for compact on-chip AI, including using nanoscale materials to add electrical components called “memristors.” Scaling down neural networks and AI technology to fit directly on a chip means adding intelligent data processing into small areas, right in the detector.
“The long-term objective is real-time particle track reconstruction,” said Fahim, though she knows that goal might be beyond the scope of the award, which funds research over five years. “We will contribute one drop of knowledge about how to locally analyze this information and how to transform the data.”
In addition to experiments at the LHC, Fahim’s research could have applications in experiments and facilities at several U.S. national labs. They include the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment hosted by Fermilab; the Electron Ion Collider hosted by Brookhaven National Laboratory; and at light sources, such as LCLS-II at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. For Fahim, the award is an acknowledgment that her work creating new, efficient data-processing hardware is becoming increasingly valuable. She is one of the first engineers to win the award in high-energy physics.
Fahim has a doctorate in electrical engineering and has worked at Fermilab for 12 years, developing pixel detectors for a variety of applications. She became the deputy head of Fermilab’s quantum science program in 2019. She is also the head of the Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, research and development department, which focuses on building circuits for potential application in detectors, quantum, AI and 5G/6G communication.
“I am impressed by her entrepreneurial and innovative approach, and the fact that she’s not afraid to try new things,” said Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of Fermilab’s quantum science program. “She puts in a lot of effort, and the combination of hard work, technical expertise, leadership and team-building skills, and innovative ideas is what will solve this multifaceted challenge.”

 Operation Night Watch: How Rijksmuseum Tapped AI To Restore A Rembrandt

In 2019, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam embarked on a multiyear restoration of Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterwork, “The Night Watch.” The painting, which had weathered vandalism and a major trimming in 1715 that lopped off its top and left portions, began undergoing a restoration in public view: a glass case was constructed around the canvas in the museum’s gallery, allowing visitors and an online audience to witness restorers at work. More recently, Operation Night Watch, as it is known, turned its focus to a central facet of the conservation project: reconstructing the missing parts of the painting, long lost since the 18th century. 
To do so, the Rijksmuseum referenced a copy of the work, made by Dutch painter Gerrit Lundens between 1642 and 1655, and called on high-tech scanners and artificial intelligence (AI), training neural networks that could, quite simply, “paint like Rembrandt.” The missing segments were then printed and mounted to recompose the painting. And last month, three centuries after its debut, the Rijksmuseum unveiled the restored and reconstructed “Night Watch,” presenting a full view of the piece as Rembrandt might have painted it.

“The Night Watch,” which was altered in 1715 to fit into Amsterdam’s City Hall (above), was reconstructed by the Rijksmuseum (below) using AI and a copy of the work by Dutch painter Gerrit Lundens. Image: Rijksmuseum
The Rijksmuseum’s high-profile use of AI to study, preserve, and restore art cements the technology’s expanding role in museums’ conservation efforts. 
Art restoration is a challenging craft — practically, ethically, and theoretically. “There are two schools of thought in [art] restoration,” says Lisa Rosen, Director of Fine Art Restoration in New York City, who’s practiced the craft since 1986. “In Italy, where I learned over many years, they teach you not to falsify or recreate the missing area exactly. You have to go down a tone so that your retouching is noticeable. And here in America, the galleries and people that sell art don’t want to see the difference; they want it to be perfect, like an invisible mend.”
There’s no set methodology for restoring art, as each piece has its unique history, and has aged and been damaged in individual ways. “Each piece is so very different, and you get to know each work very intimately,” Rosen says. Technology, though, is giving the process a boost. “Lately, [art restoration professionals] have been using microbes to clean marbles in Italy,” she adds. “They set up a room, brought different samples of microbes in, and put them on top of the marbles that were filthy and stained. These microbes ate away at the stains and cleaned it perfectly.”
Museums’ in-house teams of conservation and restoration specialists are also finding themselves newly armed with an array of high-tech conservation tools. From 3D imaging and reluctance transformation imaging that virtually moves light across scanned image surfaces to infrared heating tools that enable zero-contact conservation, technology is rapidly empowering professionals in art restoration sectors.

Robert Erdmann, Senior Scientist at Rijksmuseum and Professor at the University of Amsterdam, tells Jing Culture and Commerce that restoration professionals should see these technological advancements, particularly AI, as tools, not threats, to the industry. “AI is not replacing anyone,” Erdmann says. “I’m not replacing a traditional restorer, because I’m not doing restoration. I am making tools to make them all more powerful at what they do. We’re bringing the power of the computer and the image to help museum professionals do their work better, and not replacing anyone at all.”
Below, Erdmann and Casper van der Kruit, Press Officer of Rijksmuseum, expand on the museum’s thinking behind Operation Night Watch.
Why was the restoration of “The Night Watch” important to the Rijksmuseum? And why conduct the process in public?
Robert Erdmann: The “Night Watch” is the centerpiece of the Rijksmuseum; it’s the biggest painting that we have from Rembrandt. It is probably the most important painting that we have in the Rijksmuseum. So when people go to the museum, they expect to be able to see it. We can satisfy both of these needs at the same time by doing our work in front of the public. This is an opportunity to educate the public about how much effort and expertise and how many people and amazing technologies go into the behind-the-scenes work at the Rijksmuseum. It will make them appreciate more how important these works are to us. In many cases, for young people, it will show them the possibility of additional careers in the museum related to things like science and engineering.
Casper van der Kruit: We want to be transparent on everything we do. This is the most important painting we have, and we do not want to take it away, do everything in secrecy, and then bring it back — ta-dah, here it is. No, we want the whole world to see every step we take to do the conservation of this important painting. Nothing is hidden from the public; we want to be as transparent as possible to our audience on what we are doing, especially because this is such an important painting.

“The reconstruction of the missing pieces is a public face of how artificial intelligence is being used here,” says Robert Erdmann, Senior Scientist at Rijksmuseum. Image: Rijksmuseum / Reinier Gerritsen
Could you outline how AI was used in Operation Night Watch?
Erdmann: In the Rijksmuseum, the reconstruction of the missing pieces is a public face of how artificial intelligence is being used here. For example, when we take hundreds of photographs of an artwork so they’re very high resolution, the way these photographs get fused together into one big photo, that is with the help of artificial intelligence. We take high resolution, visible photos of a painting, but we also have a number of additional techniques that we can use to look at paintings. For example, an infrared camera, can see through the paint and see what’s what’s behind the paint, because oil paint is transparent to infrared light. So we can see past versions that may have been painted over.
This gives us a large collection of different kinds of images: visible image, infrared image, ultraviolet image, macro X-ray fluorescence which tells us chemical information. And artificial intelligence helps us to fuse these together so they’re very perfectly aligned with each other, and then interpret these multiple pieces of information about every pixel into something meaningful. 
How else do you foresee AI aiding in museums’ restoration projects?
Erdmann: When it comes to the scientific side of the museum, I anticipate very rapid increase in the use of artificial intelligence to help us do our work, especially in relation to images. And in the slightly more distant future, I anticipate it being a very important tool for art historians who may help who may use artificial intelligence to help them find similar patterns of the visual visual composition that exists throughout our huge collection.
What are some initial steps a museum can take to adopt AI technology into their institutions?
Erdmann: I think academia is where this is most likely to be to be fruitful. If I were a museum professional, and I didn’t know anything about AI, but I was excited about the possibilities, I would call the computer science department of my local university and say, “Hey, here are some problems that I have. I work with a museum, would you like to collaborate?” It’s been my experience that in the academic world, people are very excited to work in the museum world, because it’s working with famous works of art. 
The biggest barrier is that these two professional worlds have completely different vocabularies. They don’t necessarily understand each other at first, so it requires a lot of effort on on both sides to learn to communicate effectively. I think both of these worlds are eager to collaborate with each other, but that communication is the most is the biggest hurdle.

The reasons are various; such people aspire for better wages, work in a comfortable environment and improve one’s social status. While these choices are understandable, this situation creates a gap in the national job supply, thus negatively affecting those industries dependent on these workers. A sector that has been grossly affected is the foodservice industry. This problem was accentuated further in countries where the dependency on tourism is relatively high. In some cases, these countries even had to import workers from abroad to sustain the sector’s demands. But while this problem was brewing, a novel idea was floated around by some organisations to use Robots instead of human workers.Some people found it absurd.

Can Artificial Intelligence Detect Melanoma?








Share








































Thursday, July 15, 2021










 Dermatologist Allan Halpern has been an international leader in applying technology to the detection of melanoma for more than two decades.







Melanoma is by far the most serious form of skin cancer. It’s diagnosed in about 105,000 people in the United States every year, and more than 7,000 Americans die from it annually. But when it’s caught and treated early, the disease is almost always curable. That’s why it’s important to develop more effective ways to detect melanoma in its earliest stages — a key focus of research at Memorial Sloan Kettering and elsewhere.One approach that’s showing promise is the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. For the past five years, investigators from MSK have led an annual Grand Challenge for the development of AI algorithms that can accurately distinguish between spots that are melanoma and those that are not. The event is overseen by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an industry-academia partnership based at MSK.“We have teams from around the world that participate in this event, ranging from groups of high school students to the top companies working in AI,” says Allan Halpern, Chief of MSK’s Dermatology Service, who founded ISIC in 2014. “The Grand Challenge was created to encourage the computer science community to address this particular problem. Everyone who participates shares their methodology, and that allows the entire field to grow.”
Scanning the Entire Body in 3-D



When melanoma is detected and treated early, the disease is almost always curable.


Dr. Halpern has been an international leader in applying technology to the detection of melanoma for more than two decades. He previously played a central role in the development of digital 3-D total body photography, which uses computer software and dozens of cameras to map the entire surface of the body. This approach is used at MSK to screen people who are at high risk of developing melanoma because of a personal or family history, especially those who have a large number of atypical moles.Dr. Halpern created ISIC to optimize the use of digital imaging in melanoma diagnosis. The group includes dermatologists, computer scientists, and other experts from all over the world, whose goals include standardizing the way these images are taken and collecting large databases of images that can be used in research.One of the most important requirements for the development of AI technology is large volumes of data that can be used to “train” the computer algorithms. For melanoma, that means photos of spots on the skin that are linked to additional clinical information about their diagnosis, including whether pathologists who reviewed the tissue ultimately found the spots to be melanoma or not. These photos are taken with a tool called a dermatoscope, a high-tech, lighted microscope that’s placed on the surface of the skin to get a closer look.Ashfaq Marghoob, Director of Clinical Dermatology at MSK Hauppauge on Long Island, is an internationally recognized expert in dermoscopy and has helped set the standards for how these images are taken and analyzed.

Increasing Detection and Reducing Harm







 According to MSK dermatologist Veronica Rotemberg, “The holy grail is to detect skin cancer as early as possible without causing undue harm by biopsying things that are not skin cancer.”



One of the goals of developing AI tools for melanoma detection is to not only identify everything that is, in fact, a melanoma but also determine what is not. “The holy grail is to detect skin cancer as early as possible without causing undue harm by biopsying things that are not skin cancer,” says MSK physician-scientist Veronica Rotemberg, who is also involved in the research. “Because the risks from melanoma are great, we’d rather be safe than sorry when we decide what to biopsy.” But, she says, they want to reduce the number of biopsies to save patients from undue anxiety as well as the pain and scars.One unfortunate aspect of the new AI technology is that it doesn’t appear to work with people who have darker skin. That’s largely because there are far fewer images of melanoma in people with dark skin that can be used to train the algorithm. “Diagnosis of melanoma on darker skin is challenging overall,” Dr. Halpern says. “We acknowledge that this is a problem, and it’s something we’re trying to address.”Dr. Rotemberg and MSK dermatologist Michael Marchetti are developing a study to look at how well current AI technology works. They’re planning to compare AI predictions and dermatologist opinions with the findings of the pathologists who analyze the biopsy tissue.“We think there is a potential for AI to become a valuable tool in the clinic, especially in areas where there’s a shortage of dermatologists and it’s hard for patients to get appointments,” Dr. Rotemberg says. “AI may improve the expertise of nonexperts, but it could also improve the expertise of those who are already experts.”

Support for Continued Research Advances
As investigators continue to collect more images and other data, they expect that the AI technology will continue to improve. “We think this system is also going to help with research studies about things like the evolution of moles,” Dr. Halpern explains. “The computers may be able to look at changes from year to year.”Much of the funding for research at MSK on the early detection of melanoma has come from private philanthropy. The Shore Family Fund, through its Shore Initiative for Melanoma Diagnostic Imaging, provides financial support for MSK’s Dermatology Service for ISIC and its Grand Challenges.The 2021 Grand Challenge is being planned for later this year. 
Key Takeaways



More than 7,000 Americans die from melanoma every year. 


The disease is curable when it’s caught early, but it is sometimes difficult to detect.

State action needed on artificial intelligence 

 

Fórsa has warned that strong State measures will be required to ensure that everyone shares in the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies.
The warning came after Micheál Martin this week said AI was not a threat to jobs. An Taoiseach was launching Ireland’s first National Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which estimates that AI could double economic growth by 2035, while creating more jobs than are lost.
A 2019 Fórsa report on automation made the case for dialogue, consultation and agreement with unions when employers sought to introduce major new technologies.
Fórsa’s report, Acting On Automation, also highlighted the need for training and skills development for workers under threat of ‘job displacement’ as AI becomes more embedded in the economy. It also warned that the introduction of AI should not be used as cover for outsourcing.
The report said AI had the potential to improve work-life balance by reducing working time. This would help ensure that the productivity benefits of new technologies are shared between businesses and their staff.
In a survey of Fórsa officials, its author Craig Whelan found that almost two-thirds saw automation as an issue in the workplaces they represent. Over 40% believed their members performed tasks likely to be impacted by automation, while over 80% judged it would definitely or probably will be an issue in the future.
In the same year, a Fórsa submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said civil and public service management should work with unions to ensure that the introduction of new technologies did not lead to job losses, outsourcing or poorer services.
Fórsa’s head of civil service Derek Mullen, who penned the paper, said the union would not oppose the introduction of new technologies like AI, but added that technological advancement should not undermine services or jobs. He pointed to the experience of Revenue, where new forms of work organisation, supported by retraining, had increased the tax-take and improved audit and fraud control rather than cutting jobs.
The national AI strategy seeks to position the public service as a leader on the issue.

I think maybe even better than that."" Artificial intelligence system is designed to work like humans, especially it is used to solve a particular type of problems.&nbsp;
