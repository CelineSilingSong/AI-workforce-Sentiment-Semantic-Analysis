5 Reasons Why Artificial Intelligence Really Is Going To Change Our WorldAdobe Stock

Chances are you’ve read a lot about AI in recent years – particularly how it’s going to save the world and/or end civilization as we know it. It’s certainly true that AI attracts a lot of hype and, shall we say, colorful predictions. But, unlike some technology trends, much of the hype surrounding AI is entirely justified. It truly is a transformative technology – one that will dramatically alter our lives in very real ways.

Not quite convinced? Here are five reasons why I believe AI is going to change the world in 2020 and beyond.

1. AI is everywhere

PROMOTED
Ever asked Alexa for the morning weather report, or passed through a public space that uses facial recognition technology, or paid for something using your credit card, or bought a product recommended to you by Amazon, or browsed potential love matches on a dating app? Of course, you have. Most of us have done one or all of these things, probably in the last week. Probably in the last 24 hours.
And, you guessed it, all of these everyday processes are underpinned by AI and data. AI allows your credit card company to determine – in the blink of an eye – that your latest transaction fits your spending pattern and isn’t fraudulent. Mastercard, for example, uses AI algorithms to assess the 75 billion transactions a year processed on its network. So, to put it bluntly, AI is already deeply embedded in your everyday life, and it’s not going anywhere.

2. AI isn’t just infiltrating everyday life, it’s going to transform entire industries
The impact of AI is already being felt in a wide range of industries, from banking and retail to farming and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI is being used to identify (and, in some cases, even predict) disease, helping healthcare providers and their patients make better treatment and lifestyle decisions.

AI systems can even outperform human experts when it comes to identifying disease; in January 2020, clinical trials of AI software developed by Google Health confirmed that the software was better at spotting signs of breast cancer in mammograms than radiologists. The system also flagged fewer “false positive” results than the experts.

3. AI will make us more human, not less
As machines become more intelligent, they can carry out more and more tasks – leading to rising automation across most industries. With this rise in automation comes valid concerns about the impact on human jobs. But, while there’s no doubt that automation will lead to the displacement of many jobs, I believe it will also create new jobs – jobs that value our uniquely human capabilities like creativity and empathy.
AI will also make our working lives better. Journalism is one industry that’s undergoing an AI revolution, and there are many AI tools that help journalists identify and write stories. At Forbes, for example, an AI-driven content management system called Bertie is used to identify real-time trending topics, suggest improvements to headlines, and identify relevant images. This reduces some of the behind-the-scenes legwork for human journalists, leaving them to focus on telling the story.
4. AI is becoming more affordable for the masses
It used to be that to work with AI you’d need expensive technology and a huge team of in-house data scientists. That’s no longer the case. Like many technology solutions, AI is now readily available on an as-a-service basis – with a rapidly growing range of off-the-peg service solutions aimed at businesses of all sizes.
As an example, in 2019, Amazon launched “Personalize,” an AI-based service that helps businesses provide tailored customer recommendations and search results. Incredibly, Amazon says no AI experience is needed to train and deploy the technology.
5. AI fuels other technology trends
Finally, as if we needed any more evidence that AI really is going to change the world, let’s end with this simple fact: AI is the foundation on which many other technology trends are built.
Essentially, this means that, without AI, we wouldn’t have achieved the amazing recent advances seen in areas like virtual reality, chatbots, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and robotics (and that’s just to name a few). Think of almost any recent transformative technology or scientific breakthrough, and, somewhere along the way, AI has played a role. For example, thanks to AI, researchers can now read and sequence genes quickly, and this knowledge can be used to determine which drug therapies will be more effective for individual patients.

Artificial Intelligence: Turbocharging European industry

AI and advanced robotics are opening new horizons in all sectors of industry, in terms of both developing novel manufacturing techniques, as well as overhauling the interaction between human workers and automated tools. This CORDIS Results Pack presents the first innovative results of 13 ongoing (or recently finished) Horizon 2020 projects that are leading the way in embedding AI applications into industry.

‘Industry 5.0’ is a term that has been gathering pace over the past few years, with its broad definition being a major shift within industrial production towards a much closer and intertwining state of cooperation between humans and machines. It promises the creation of a new symbiotic environment between a workforce comprising both human operators and increasingly autonomous and intelligent mechanical colleagues. This transition is being heavily influenced by the phenomenal growth in advanced robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and consequently offers many golden opportunities for Europe.
Harnessing the benefits of AI
Manufacturing and industrial production have remained a constant backbone to Europe’s economic prosperity and growth for more than two centuries. And it’s here on the factory floor where some of the first major AI-based innovations are being pioneered and rolled out. 

The infusion of AI processes into manufacturing offers many positive benefits, such as the development of novel industrial processes for both existing as well as newly-emerging industries, enhancing production efficiencies and redefining the role of human workers as they take on new roles and responsibilities to collaborate with and supervise the (often repetitive) tasks of their AI-powered machine co-workers. Importantly, the use of AI/Augmented Reality techniques in factories promise to make human roles less hazardous, less monotonous and less physically exhausting.
Supporting the spread of AI in European manufacturing
However, there is still much work to be done to completely overhaul and adapt European industry to these new technologies and, by extension, these new opportunities. This is regardless of the fact that Europe is already one of the world’s major leaders in the development of AI. 

Therefore, the European Commission is dedicated to enhancing Europe’s leadership in the field of AI, viewing it as an area of strategic importance and a crucial source of future economic growth. The European Commission has been working hard with Member States to foster a genuinely collaborative AI strategy, embodied in the 2018 Communication ‘Artificial Intelligence for Europe’, which also emphasises the importance of AI in European manufacturing. The Commission has also massively increased its funding of AI research through the Horizon 2020 programme, with EUR 1.5 billion having been pledged for the period 2018-2020, and will keep funding AI research and applications through Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programmes.
13 pioneering projects
This CORDIS Results Pack showcases 13 projects that have been pioneering the way forward with AI technologies geared towards industry and manufacturing.

Some of the featured projects, such as COROMA  and  MONSOON look into the ways in which the use of AI tools and advanced manufacturing robots, equipped with sensors and capable of adapting to the manufacturing environment, can increase the productivity of production, whilst others including Factory2Fit, MANUWORK and THOMAS, look into the complementarity and interaction potential of human-robot and robot-machine collaboration.

Meanwhile, some projects, such as GO0D MAN and SERENA, also explore the potential of using AI-based tools for optimising the production process in terms of more efficient maintenance (e.g. predictive maintenance in connected industrial work sites) and zero-defect manufacturing. Finally, others, such as ResiBots have focused their work on customised production and even making robots capable of recovery.

People and robots




It wasn’t that long ago that robots and artificial intelligence (AI) were considered a major threat to our workforce. The press was awash with reports that they would take over our jobs and lead to widespread unemployment.Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously warned that AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don't know how to react, because it seems so ethereal,” he told attendees at the National Governors Association summer meeting in 2017.In just a few short years, opinions have changed considerably. Research conducted by Automation Anywhere in 2019 revealed that our global workforce is eager to adopt AI and automation. In fact, 72% of workers believe that AI and automation will help them do their jobs better, not replace them. This is opposed to just 8% of respondents who strongly feel the opposite.“AI’s greater potential lies in leveraging the technology to enhance collaboration with humans,” says James Wilson, managing director of information technology and business research at Accenture Research, and co-author of Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.  “This dynamic combines human talent and oversight with the nearly limitless capacity of intelligent machines to explore new possibilities.”LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProIn other words, humans and machines have divergent skill sets. “People perform better in complex, unpredictable environments, which is why we’re better at work that involves social interaction, creativity and navigating the physical world,” explains Jeff Grisenthwaite, vice president of product at automation software provider Catalytic.Machines, meanwhile, outperform people when faced with narrowly defined challenges that can be solved through precise repetition or rapid computation. “Robots are good at repetitive tasks – they don’t get bored – and they deliver speed and accuracy,” says Waseem Malik, executive managing director for claims at AXA Insurance.IT Pro Panel: Can AI help CIOs do their jobs better? Machine learning vs AI vs NLP: What are the differences? I thought I didn’t like robots, bot what would I know?Towards a new way of workThis collaborative approach has the potential for new, previously unimagined benefits. Rather than merely streamlining how businesses currently do work, it allows AI systems to serve as an agent for change across organisations, transforming what businesses do and how they do it. “Those companies that successfully facilitate this collaboration will be able to reimagine their organisations from the ground up,” says Wilson. “Human-AI collaboration has the potential to transform the way businesses are structured, the way they design products and even how they hire and train employees.”Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

In retail, for example, online grocery solutions provider Ocado Technology uses robots to process over 80,000 orders every week. A proprietary 4G network acts as ‘air traffic control’ for more than 1,500 bots as they move around the warehouse. “Bringing together the best of human and machine ability is a key component to our technical success, offering a combination that far exceeds the sum of its parts,” Dr Graham Deacon, robotics research fellow at Ocado Technology, tells IT Pro.Ocado Technology is experimenting with a number of systems which combine the best of human and machine intelligence. This includes an augmented reality system for warehouse engineers that overlays information with the physical world and helps them teleoperate complex robotic devices to fix systems in a different part of the world. “This has major benefits in terms of allowing new levels of collaboration,” says Deacon. “One single technician will be able to fix multiple systems not just remotely, but simultaneously, massively amplifying the impact of a single person.”In financial services, meanwhile, global insurance firm AXA uses various named robots to help out in different teams. Harry keeps customer records up to date for household claims. Lenny, Como and Bert do the same for liability claims, commercial motor and commercial property; they attach incoming and outgoing messages to customer files. In the commercial lines intermediary, Clive transfers data between complex systems and spreadsheets. Meanwhile at AXA PPP Healthcare, Poppy texts customers their authorisation code for treatment while they’re on the phone with their human personal advisor. Poppy also helps with customer referrals by taking on much of the copying and pasting involved.Malik believes that AXA’s success is a result of their understanding that there’s a time and a place for robot assistance. “In insurance, you also need the human touch,” he says. “Customers get in touch with us when they have a claim; they need to be reassured and understood. When you’re stranded abroad, or when your car needs to be fixed, you want a person to look after you, not a computer. However, you also want that person to be as efficient as possible – and that’s where machines make the difference.”Collaborative intelligence is facilitating more effective fraud prevention too. Australian firm TrafficGuard, for example, uses machine learning to complement the skills of its analysts and data scientists. “We are capitalising on human expertise by augmenting it with machines to create a solution that neither could achieve on its own,” says Luke Taylor, the firm’s founder and chief operating officer. “Collaborative intelligence is achieved by understanding the values of both machines and people. Using machine learning, we can validate advertising engagements in milliseconds and detection can be based on immense volumes of data.”RELATED RESOURCEThe IT Pro Podcast: Can AI ever be ethical?As AI grows in sophistication, how can we make sure it’s being developed responsibly?FREE DOWNLOADThe manufacturing industry is also benefiting from the combined power of humans and machines. “Agriculture is just one example,” says Nick Grove, founder of social economy platform Peazzy. “In the slow drive towards Industry 4.0, benefits will be made with seed to sale solutions impacting incubation, growing (watering and nutrients), harvesting, production, packaging and shipping direct to end customer. This is providing access to food for certain countries that was previously impossible to achieve.”And this is just the start. “When machines and humans collaborate together they can succeed in areas like medicine, by helping with patient diagnosis through image recognition; accounts payable, by processing thousands of invoices in a shorter amount of time and reducing potential errors on transcriptions; and legal, by reviewing thousands of contracts for specific clauses that may not comply with company policies,” adds Agustin Huerta, vice president of technology for the AI studio at digital transformation enabler Globant.Be aware of the pitfallsBut it’s not all plain sailing. Experts are quick to warn that human-machine collaboration will present a number of risks.Security makes the top of the list. “Connecting an increasing number of technologies opens up the possibility of a global distributed denial-of-service attack. If this were to happen at say the same time as the Coronavirus lockdown, then the world would be held to ransom within minutes. With the advancement of technology and machines comes huge responsibility,” says Grove.Employers also need to ensure they prepare their workforce appropriately. By bringing in machines, employees might have new responsibilities within an existing role, or an entirely new job function. Those in existing non-technical roles will need to upskill to take on those that require critical thinking and learn to harness AI-assisted technologies for increased efficiency and quality. Meanwhile, workers performing routine tasks will need to cross-skill and prepare for roles that depend on uniquely human traits. “As these changes are implemented, it is important that leaders work with their HR teams to ensure that workers feel empowered, rather than threatened, by future AI developments,” says Wilson.This is a challenge that AXA has already had to address. “At the beginning, some employees were worried that automation might destroy their jobs,” says Malik. “However, we’ve always said it is not about replacing people, but about freeing up their time so they can do what they’re good at and add real value. That can be about customer service, broker relations or anything that requires good old human intuition. The way we overcame initial worries was to engage with the teams and listen to their ideas.”Success here depends on fostering the right culture. “A good understanding of employees’ needs and how to create a culture that embraces this new way of collaboration is what makes these programmes successful,” says Huerta. “We have seen tides change when we have been allowed to create a proper culture that fosters this kind of collaboration and works on reducing uncertainty and fear of the unknown.”James Manderson, general manager for EMEA at customer engagement firm Braze likens this to when commercial flights first started. “A pilot’s job was very manual from take-off to landing. Today, the process of flying is mostly automated so that pilots can focus on making sure the flight is optimised and safe. The parallel with AI and machine learning is clear – innovation always pushes humans to adapt and improve. The benefits should be explained to employees in this way.”It’s not just employees who need to be educated, it’s the whole population – and this is where the media has a crucial role to play. While in the west we often see scare stories about automation, it’s very different in Asia. “The narrative in countries such as Japan is much more positive, and often highlights the benefits of the integration of robots,” says Héctor González-Jiménez, professor at ESCP Business School. “The media should offer a more balanced narrative, which would then help firms manage this shift.”Building a better futureBreakthroughs in areas like natural language interfaces and task understanding will also lead to a better acceptance of collaborative robots and will enable them to be used in a more natural way.“This is an important building block that will contribute to the emergence of true collaboration between humans and cobots,” says Ocado Technology’s Deacon.To this end, Ocado Technology is working as a project coordinator as part of the EU Horizon 2020 SecondHands Consortium to pioneer the development of a collaborative robot which can proactively offer useful support and assistance to humans in maintenance tasks. This ‘cobot’ is trained in task-understanding, to predict when and how it can usefully provide help. Safety and efficiency are clearly key drivers here. “Eventually these collaborative robots will be key for solving many societal challenges - both as assistive robots in industry, and out in the wider world such as robots for healthcare and assisted living in the home,” Deacon says.Advances in conversational AI - the capability to truly understand what someone has said and what that means – will also expedite advances in human-machine collaboration. “Conversational AI is only now becoming really achievable, and a key part of collaborative intelligence,” says Al Cook, vice president and general manager of artificial intelligence at cloud communications firm Twilio. “Chatbots are just the tip of the iceberg of what this technology can do. It’s a good starting point for most companies, but there’s a lot more to come.”Ultimately, Grisenthwaite believes that firms that fail to adopt these new technologies are risking their very survival. “Companies that do not fully embrace these technologies and push aggressively toward wide-scale adoption will inevitably lose to competitors,” he says. “The productivity gains of collaborative intelligence are exponential, rather than incremental, which puts early adopters at an insurmountable advantage.

AI-powered background checks could stand in the way.by  Rebecca HeilweilMay 11, 2020, 7:00 AM EDTFacebookLink James Bareham for Vox/RecodeRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.FacebookLinkUnemployment in May reached its highest levels since the Great Depression, but companies like Postmates and Uber have continued to hire new workers during the pandemic. If you’re interested in this kind of gig, however, there’s a good chance you’ll need to pass an AI-powered background check from a company like Checkr. This might not be as easy as it sounds.Checkr is on the forefront of a new and potentially problematic kind of hiring, one that’s powered by still-emerging technology. Those hoping to quickly get extra work complain that Checkr and others using AI to do background checks aren’t addressing errors and mistakes on their criminal records reports. In these cases, a glitch in the system can cost someone a job.But this isn’t exactly a new problem. In recent years, Checkr has faced a slew of lawsuits for making mistakes that have cost people much-desired opportunities to work, according to legal records. One complaint from a man hoping to drive for Uber alleged that he was wrongly linked to a murder conviction that actually belonged to someone with a similar name. Another person hoping to work for the ride-share giant complained that he was erroneously reported to have committed several misdemeanors — including the possession of a controlled substance — crimes that belonged to another person with the same name.Checkr is one of many companies automating aspects of the hiring process and cutting down on costs. Some of these companies are using artificial intelligence to scan through resumes, analyze facial expressions during video job interviews, compare criminal records, and even judge applicants’ social media behavior. And in a pandemic, where the companies still hiring are likely already seeing a surge in applications and eager to find ways to streamline the recruiting process, technology that makes hiring quicker and easier sounds appealing.But experts have expressed skepticism about the role that AI can actually play in hiring. The technology doesn’t always work and can exacerbate bias and privacy problems. Inevitably, it also raises bigger questions of how powerful AI should become.AI can help companies study your criminal recordWhen you’re being considered for a job, background check companies typically use personal information, provided by you, to learn more about your criminal record and other information about your identity. That can involve collating all types of data, including but not limited to information from sex offender registries, global watch lists, state criminal records databases, and the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. Sometimes, a background check provider will need to consult a courthouse to search for more records, a process that might not be possible right now due to pandemic-required closures.In recent years, using artificial intelligence to speed up the process of analyzing these records has been pioneered by Checkr, though other startups, like UK-based Onfido and Israeli-based Intelligo, have worked or are working on similar systems. Meanwhile, more traditional background check companies are also making use of AI. GoodHire, for instance, has used machine learning to verify the identity of people completing an online background check.Checkr has become a favorite of gig economy firms, including Uber, Instacart, Shipt, Postmates, and Lyft. On its website, Checkr argues that AI can ultimately drive down the cost of bringing on a new hire by helping process background-checks in two ways. First, the technology helps verify that a given criminal record belongs to the person whose background is being checked. Second, the AI assists in comparing the names of criminal charges that have different names in different places. What might be reported as “petty theft” in one locale could be reported as “petit larceny” somewhere else.But as lawsuits against Checkr suggest, these services can make mistakes, even with the use of AI. Many of these complaints allege that the company matched people to criminal records belonging to others with the same or similar names.Related:Artificial intelligence will help determine if you get your next job“The threshold question is, did we even match the right person,” explains Aaron Rieke, the managing director of the digital rights group Upturn. “If you have a common name, that’s a non-trivial thing to do, and the last 20 years are rife with database matching problems just at that very basic level.”Other complaints against Checkr say out-of-context or outdated records also end up getting included in their reports.Checkr did not comment on the lawsuits specifically, but Kristen Faris, the company’s industry strategy vice president, told Recode that humans are involved in both the review and quality assurance process to ensure the accuracy of the reports.“In the traditional world, where you’re using offshore labor to apply this criteria, you have a much lower accuracy rate just because of the manual processes involved,” Faris said.AI can also screen your social media and anything else that’s public on the webMost background checks tend to focus on criminal records, but some services have started to include information about a person that’s available online, including their social media presence. Some managers already look up social media activity of prospective hires, but companies like Good Egg sell social media background checks, while others like Intelligo can use AI to screen these platforms.“I think when people use their real name in public fora online, the reality is that that information could be sucked into a background check process,” Rieke, the digital rights advocate, said.This is what happened to Kai Moore earlier this year, when their employer switched payroll systems and required employee background checks to be run again. Moore expected a review of what’s typically included in this process: information about their criminal records and confirmation of their identity. But what they didn’t expect was a 300-page report from Fama Technologies on their social media history, which included documentation of their tweets, retweets, and “Likes.”Even more worrisome was how their online activity was graded. A post Moore had “Liked” with the phrase “Big Dick Energy” was flagged for “sexism” and “bigotry.” Tweets they’d favorited about alcohol were flagged as “bad,” while one mentioning “hell” in discussing LGBTQ identity and religion was flagged for “language.”Moore’s employer assured them that their job was not at risk, but it also noted that Fama’s algorithms had ultimately deemed them a “consider,” rather than an outright “clear,” for the position in which Moore had already been working. And to Moore, this signified the absurdity and inaccuracy of artificial intelligence.“I think it’s really dangerous to give these kinds of algorithms so much authority,” Moore told Recode. “It’s such a terrible algorithm. It’s a keyword search.” Fama founder and CEO Ben Mones told Recode that the company claims to be able to identify problematic behavior, like sexism and bullying, as well as the risk that someone might commit insider trading or intellectual property theft. Fama primarily analyzed Twitter activity in Moore’s case, but the technology can also pick up information about applicants from news sites and other webpages. Since Moore’s report was performed, Fama has stopped labeling these posts as “good” or “bad.” Now, it simply flags content, leaving employers to make their own judgments.Fama isn’t the only company that’s attempted such a business model. Other companies are looking for ways to report what prospective applicants share online, a process that some background check companies say they can expedite with the help of AI. Faris, the Checkr VP, said her company has talked about offering social media screenings but has yet to see significant demand from its existing customer base.It’s also unclear if social media companies themselves will tolerate this use of their data. Predictim, a company that used AI to score potential babysitters based on their social media, attracted enough negative attention back in 2018 that it was ultimately blocked by Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Predictim’s website is no longer active.Fama, for one, has found a way around some social media companies’ policies. Twitter told Recode that it suspended Fama’s API access around the same time Moore’s story about their background check went viral. Twitter said that its API policies ban the use of the platform for “background checks or any form of extreme vetting,” as well as “surveillance.” Fama maintains that it still has some form of access to Twitter data for its services.The use of artificial intelligence doesn’t mean your rights are forfeitedBackground check companies are generally considered credit reporting agencies, and there are state and federal laws that regulate how these agencies operate. Chief among them is the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law passed in 1970 to protect consumers that’s regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Just last month, the agency shared best practices for working with artificial intelligence and algorithms.Currently, the Fair Credit Reporting Act law requires potential employers to inform and get a person’s permission before running a background check. If the employer thinks the results of the background check will factor into rejecting an applicant for a job, they have to let the applicant know and give them a chance to contest any information in the report. If that happens, the credit reporting agency enlisted by the employer has to reinvestigate its findings. There is no guarantee, however, that any corrections will be made in time for a person to remain in consideration for a particular position.Background check companies can make significant errors, and those errors can impact whether or not someone is ultimately offered a job. According to Ariel Nelson, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, these firms do have a legal obligation to have “reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information.” There’s still a pervasive problem of mistakes being included in background checks, Nelson explained, even when AI is not involved. So when you find yourself applying for a new job, consider that your application could be subject to an AI-powered background check, especially if you’re looking for work in the gig economy. You do have control over some aspects of this process. You can make your social media accounts private or delete your data from these platforms entirely. Basically, if you can see information about you online while you’re not logged into a platform, a future employer — or a hired AI — can probably see it, too. Clarification: This post has been updated to clarify that Checkr has automated features, but the service does not use AI to scan through resumes, analyze facial expressions during video job interviews, or judge applicant’s social media behavior.Open Sourced is made possible by the Omidyar Network.

We need a new education system to make sure we stay competent in the age of artificial intelligence. (Image credit: Depositphotos)
Welcome to AI book reviews, a series of posts that explore the latest literature on artificial intelligence.
Advances in artificial intelligence in the early 2010s, particularly in deep learning, triggered a new wave of panic and fear about technological unemployment. Further intensifying those fears were a host of sensational articles about the magical capabilities of AI algorithms and ambiguous statements by company executives creating the impression that human-level AI is just around the corner.
But the past few years have only highlighted the limits of current AI technologies. At the turn of the decade, as the world locked down to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, we got to see whether the promises of artificial intelligence and robots replacing humans would materialize.
They didn’t.
But while AI isn’t ready to replace humans, there’s no denying that it will change the employment landscape, including areas that were previously considered to be off-limits for technology and automation. AI will not eliminate humans, but it will redefine the economy, creating many new jobs and making some of the old jobs obsolete or less dependent on human intelligence.
Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, a book by Northeastern University president Joseph E. Aoun, discusses how the universities and higher education institutions will have to adapt as “any predictable work—including many jobs considered ‘knowledge economy’ jobs” come within “the purview of machines.”
Aoun’s message: “to stay relevant in this new economic reality, higher education needs a dramatic realignment.” And in Robot-Proof, he provides a roadmap for developing a lifelong education system that will enable future generations to engage in not one but many professional careers throughout their lives.
What makes artificial intelligence different?

AI is not the first technology to change the way we work. The steam engine, electrical power, the telephones, railroad, automobile, airplane—these are some of the technological advances that brought fundamental change to human life and labor. In every case, human labor was replaced by a medium that could get the job done faster and more accurately.
In every instance, old jobs were destroyed as new ones were created. And while we humans are usually reluctant to embrace change, as history shows, we’ve always done what we’re good at: adapt. Within a generation or two, humans changed their habits and learned skills to harness the new technology and make their lives more efficient. The people of the mid-19th century couldn’t imagine a world lined with millions of miles of asphalt roads and fast-moving cars—we can’t imagine a world without them. In the 1960s, there was little trust for the first ATM machines. Today, there are millions of ATMs worldwide. Twenty years ago, there was no sign of Facebook and Twitter. Today, they’ve become fundamental pieces of the socioeconomic puzzle across the world.
But what makes artificial intelligence different is the pace of change it will bring. AI itself is not a product, but an infrastructural technology that will help accomplish a wide range of tasks. Stanford University professor and Coursera Founder Andrew Ng describes AI as the “new electricity.”
Robot-Proof, a book by Joseph E. Aoun
“It is clear that the current digital revolution is different from previous technological leaps because machines now seem to have no limit to their potential processing power—no limit to their intelligence,” Prof. Aoun observes in Robot-Proof. “In any predictable task, computers have humans at a cognitive disadvantage. And because software is cheap to copy, any digital advance can be instantly replicated throughout the world.”
“Any predictable task” is an overstatement. There are still plenty of tasks where current AI algorithms perform very poorly, especially when the real world deviates too much from their training examples. But Aoun is right in that there are many areas that deep learning algorithms perform than humans, especially when there’s enough annotated data to train deep neural networks that can perform precise classification and prediction tasks. And the domains that AI algorithms excel at continue to expand as scientists develop new methods and structures to overcome their shortcomings.
I would also contest computers having humans at a “cognitive disadvantage.” A more accurate term would be that computers have humans at a, well, “computational” disadvantage. Thanks to advances in computer hardware, AI algorithms can peruse through massive amounts of data and find relevant patterns in a fraction of the time it would take humans to do the same thing. As long as the answer lies in the data, whether through search or pattern matching, the right AI algorithm (naturally, created by a human) will outperform the human mind.
This brings us to an important conclusion: While AI will not probably not replace humans altogether anytime soon, it will complement humans and amplify their speed and accuracy in performing tasks.
In many fields, this means we’ll finally be able to meet the growing demand for human expertise. An example is cybersecurity, where there’s a huge skills gap as the industry needs more and more security experts to secure our increasingly digitized world. But in other fields where the supply already meets demand, it might reduce the need for human experts. For instance, a radiology expert equipped with the right deep learning tools might be able to double or triple the number of x-ray scans she sees every day.
The third point Prof. Aoun makes, “any digital advance can be instantly replicated throughout the world,” is also very important and lies at the heart of the AI disruption. Software-only solutions do not rely on expensive production chains. And with cloud computing and internet connectivity becoming ubiquitous, they will quickly become accessible to everyone. This is why changes brought by AI will be much faster than previous technological revolutions.
How to stay competent in the age of AI?

In Robot-Proof, Prof. Aoun argues that the changes brought by AI will require universities and learners to rethink their approach to education. For learners, a key goal will be to find ways to distinguish themselves from machines.
“The fact remains that machines will keep getting better at performing skilled work. Consequently, many people are recognizing that education needs to transform into a lifelong pursuit that enables them to upskill and retrain continuously as they try to stay a step ahead of the job-eating robots,” Aoun says.
Many of the jobs today’s learners will occupy in the next 20-30 years do not even exist today. This means universities must repurpose themselves to serve learners throughout their working lives. Prof. Aoun calls for a new education model that is different in delivery method, content, and context.
The key change is to shift toward education that strengthens creativity, the one area where humans will continue to excel. AI algorithms are very efficient at retrieving patterns and making predictions based on data. But when it comes to abstract thinking, common sense and transfer learning, humans still have the edge.
This is why humans only need a few hours to learn a new computer game while it takes a deep learning algorithm thousands of hours’ worth of playtime to reach novice level. Meanwhile, humans can quickly apply abstract concepts learned from one domain to another, while for AI, every new task is a fresh new challenge that must be learned from scratch.
“Creativity combined with mental flexibility has made us unique—and the most successful species on the planet,” Prof. Aoun writes in Robot-Proof. “They will continue to be how we distinguish ourselves as individual actors in the economy. Whatever the field or profession, the most important work that human beings perform will be its creative work.”
The robot-proof education model
How does the education system reinvent itself to nurture creativity?
“A robot-proof model of higher education is not concerned solely with topping up students’ minds with high-octane facts,” Prof. Aoun says. “Rather, it refits their mental engines, calibrating them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or otherwise produce something society deems valuable… Instead of training laborers, a robot-proof education trains creators.”
Higher education should adopt a model that puts more emphasis on “experiential learning,” Prof. Aoun stresses, which removes the boundaries between the classroom and real life.
“Typically, students engage in experiential learning through internships, co-ops, work-study jobs, global experiences, and original research opportunities,” Aoun says.
Experiential learning replaces the passive absorption of information with the integration of knowledge and real-world experience. This enables learner to practice “far transfer”
“Transfer occurs when skills or knowledge are learned in one context and the student successfully applies them to another,” Aoun says. Near transfer happens when the contexts are similar, such as poetry and drama. But when the contexts are largely disparate, such as poetry and public relations, the transfer is far. “The students are encountering an entirely novel situation but are able to step back and understand how, embedded in the context, they can use their knowledge to solve a problem,” Aoun says.
By applying their classroom learning to workplace tasks, students in co-ops repeatedly practice far transfer, cementing their cognitive capacities—critical and systems thinking, entrepreneurship, and cultural agility.
Efforts in AI transfer learning have so far been limited to very narrow tasks, such as tuning a trained image classifier on a new set of images. For humans, being to apply abstract concepts from one domain to another will be key to constantly learning new skills as AI transforms the world around us.
History shows that we’re very bad at predicting the future, and we don’t know know exactly how the future of AI will unfold. But what’s for sure is that the current and next generations of learners will have be very versatile and flexible in their acquiring new skills as algorithms become smarter and smarter.
“Our potential to master far transfer is our competitive advantage over intelligent machines,” Aoun writes in Robot-Proof.

Published: May 07, 2020 11:11 AM ESTTrevor English4 years ago0ShareI, Robot (2004)I, Robot/IMDbAs engineers and researchers work on developing and perfecting their machine learning and AI algorithms, the end goal is ultimately to recreate the human brain. The most perfect AI imaginable would be able to process the world around us through typical sensory input but leverage the storage and computing strengths of supercomputers. 
With that end goal in mind, it’s not hard to understand the ways that AI is evolving as it continues to be developed.  Deep learning AI is able to interpret patterns and derive conclusions. In essence, it’s learning how to mimic the way that humans process the world around us. Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

That said, from the onset, AIs generally need typical computer input, like coded data. Developing AIs that can process the world through audio and visual input, sensory input, is a much harder task. 
In order to understand artificial intelligence in the context of a perception-based interface, we need to understand what the end goal is. We need to understand how the brain is modeled and works.
Our brain from a computer’s perspective
Our brains are essentially the world’s most powerful supercomputers, except for the fact that they’re made out of organic material, rather than silicon and other materials.
Our right brain is largely perception-based, it’s focused on the interpretation of environmental inputs like taste, feel, sound, sight, etc. Our left brain, on the other hand, is focused on rational thought. Our senses provide patterns to our right brain, and to our left brain, those senses provide the rationale for decision making. In a sense, we have two AIs in our head that work together to create a logical, yet also emotionally swayed machine.

Human intelligence and our definition of what an intelligent thing is all drawback to how we ourselves process the world. In order for artificial intelligence to truly succeed, that is to be the best version of itself that it can be, then it needs to be intelligent from a human perspective.
All this draws back to modern AI in a simple way, AI is programmed in how to make a decision. Machine learning algorithms allow code to be pseudo-organically generated so that algorithms can “learn” in a sense. All of this programming is based on reasoning, on “if, then, do this.”

Arguably, our brain’s decision-making process is just as much based on emotions and feeling as it is reason. Emotional intelligence is a significant portion of what makes intelligence. It’s the ability to read a situation, to understand other human’s emotions and reactions. In order for AIs to evolve and be the best possible algorithm, they need to be able to process sensory input and emotion.
Integrating emotional & human intelligence into modern AI
Most artificial intelligence systems are primarily created on the foundation of deep learning algorithms. This is the means of exposing a computer program to thousands of examples and AI learning how to solve problems through this process. Deep learning can be boiled down to teaching a computer how to be smart. 

After any given deep learning phase for an AI, the system can perceive the inputs that it was trained on and make decisions therein. The decision-making tree that the AI forms from traditional deep learning mimics the way the right side of our brain works. It is based on the perception of inputs, of pseudo-senses.

Deep learning is a way of getting computers to reason, not just with if-then statements, but through the understanding of the situation. That said, the current situations AI are being trained on aren’t as complex as interpreting a conversation with Becky to see if she’s into you. Rather it’s more along the lines of is this a dark cat, a black bag, or the night sky. Primitive, but still sensory perception…
While deep learning is currently heavily focused on one pathway, meaning AIs are developing specialties, eventually it won’t be too far fetched to start training AIs on multiple things at once. Just like a toddler might learn colors and numbers at the same time. Expanding this out, as computer processing power grows, perhaps accelerated by practical quantum computing, there’s no question that AIs will evolve to become more human. 
Understanding what this all means
Advanced AI will continue to deal with understanding and processing patterns from the world around us. Through this, it will develop more complex models on how to process that information. In a sense, AIs are like toddlers, but soon they’re going to be teenagers, and eventually, they may graduate with a doctorate. All figuratively of course… though, an age where an AI graduates a university probably isn’t that far off. 
RELATED: ELON MUSK AND OPEN AI WANT TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WON’T SPELL DOOM FOR HUMANITY
When we think about intelligent humans, we usually think of the most rationally minded people. Yet, we miss out on what is so unique about human intelligence – creativity. In a sense, we take for granted our creativity, yet it is the thing that makes us the most intelligent of living beings. Our ability to process situations, not just understand what the sum of two numbers is, is what makes us uniquely intelligent. So uniquely intelligent that we can design and create artificially intelligent beings that will soon be able to match our human intelligence. 
While modern AIs are primarily focused on singular strands of intelligence, whether that be finding which picture contains a bicycle or which email is spam, we’re already training AIs to be all-around smart, humanly smart. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

IBM's Top 35 Women Leaders Shaping the Future of Artificial Intelligence





May 7, 2020













IBM, at its Think Digital conference, unveiled its list of Women Leaders in AI, recognizing 35 exceptional female business leaders from 12 countries who are using artificial intelligence to drive transformation, growth and innovation across a wide variety of industries.  According to IBM, these leaders were chosen because they and their companies are demonstrating the power of AI to help improve business and work for their customers and employees. From understanding and deriving insights from tens of millions of financial documents, to improving new employee onboarding experiences, to helping women have a better experience buying intimate apparel, these women leaders are shaping innovative AI use cases. Their AI efforts, says IBM, helped to increase customer satisfaction, improvements in employee retention, faster response times, significant cost savings, and more efficient processes.Many honorees are demonstrating how the power of Watson's Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to improve efficiency in business processes and drive greater customer and employee experiences, says IBM. They are leveraging AI tools to build AI and supplement the data science skills shortage and they are proving, through a variety of AI applications, that human and machine collaboration can truly help improve how people work, adds the company. ""Artificial intelligence will be at the center of business transformation over the next decade, and for us to mitigate bias moving forward, we need women and diverse teams at the forefront of AI. That's why we are proud to share the stories of 35 remarkable women who are driving progressive use of AI using Watson,"" said Michelle Peluso, IBM's Senior Vice President for Digital Sales and Chief Marketing Officer, who also serves as the global leader for IBM's Women's Initiative. ""Their accomplishments are an inspiration to all of us.""To shed more light on diversity in AI, IBM recently teamed up with Morning Consult to conduct a new global study of more than 3,200 AI professionals. Notable findings of that study include:
85 percent of AI professionals believe the industry has become more diverse over the past few years; of those, 91 percent think that shift is having a positive impact. 74 percent of AI professionals believing diversity hasn't improved say the industry must become more diverse to reach its potential.
While men and women working in AI were equally likely to be interested in math and hard sciences growing up, men working in AI were more likely to be told they had a natural talent for mathematics and hard sciences than women, while women were more likely to be told they had a natural talent for the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts.
Two in five AI professionals facing hurdles in implementing AI reported challenges in building AI tech or getting their organization to adopt AI.
Women in AI globally were nearly five times as likely as men to say their career advancement was negatively impacted by their gender.

Donna Dodson’s last day as chief cybersecurity adviser for the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Information Technology Laboratory will be Friday, the agency announced.
Dodson also will be leaving behind her job as director of the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence at NIST, a title she has held since 2012. She joined the agency in 1987 and held a range of technology leadership positions.
For her work in cybersecurity and IT she earned several awards, including a FedScoop 2018 top women in tech award. Her latest portfolio as top cybersecurity official was massive, ranging from work on artificial intelligence to “baking” security into the growing Internet of Things.
“The most critical part of my job is looking strategically at the changes we’re seeing across the digital infrastructure, the changes in the threat environment and the existing vulnerabilities,” she told FedScoop in 2017.

It’s unclear where Dodson’s next move will be.
In her work to enhance cybersecurity, Dodson worked to incorporate elements beyond technology and have the people and policy behind the technology be a part of the equation.
“Cybersecurity is really about people, policy, process and technology. And I think we need to look at all of those, not just the coolest new technology,” she said.
