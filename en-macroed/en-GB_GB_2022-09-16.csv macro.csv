One is what I call blue-sky visionaries who speculate about the future possibilities of the technology, invoking utopian fantasies to generate excitement. Blue-sky ideas are compelling but are often clouded over by unrealistic visions and the ethical challenges of what can and should be built.In contrast, what I call muddy-boots pragmatists are problem- and solution-focused. They want to reduce the harms that widely used AI-infused systems can create. They focus on fixing biased and flawed systems, such as in facial recognition systems that often mistakenly identify people as criminals or violate privacy. The pragmatists want to reduce deadly medical mistakes that AI can make, and steer self-driving cars to be safe-driving cars. Their goal is also to improve AI-based decisions about mortgage loans, college admissions, job hiring and parole granting.As a computer science professor with a long history of designing innovative applications that have been widely implemented, I believe that the blue-sky visionaries would benefit by taking the thoughtful messages of the muddy-boots realists. Combining the work of both camps is more likely to produce the beneficial outcomes that will lead to successful next-generation technologies.While the futuristic thinking of the blue-sky speculators sparks our awe and earns much of the funding, muddy-boots thinking reminds us that some AI applications threaten privacy, spread misinformation and are decidedly racist, sexist and otherwise ethically dubious. Machines are undeniably part of our future, but will they serve all future humans equally? I think the caution and practicality of the muddy-boots camp will benefit humanity in the short and long run by ensuring diversity and equality in the development of the algorithms that increasingly run our day-to-day lives. If blue-sky thinkers integrate the concerns of muddy-boots realists into their designs, they can create future technologies that are more likely to advance human values, rights and dignity.Blue-sky thinking started early in the development of AI. The literature was dominated by authors who pioneered the technology and heralded its inevitable transformation of society. The “fathers” of AI are usually considered to be Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy from MIT and Allen Newell and Herb Simon from Carnegie Mellon University. They gathered at meetings, such as the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, generating enthusiasm exemplified by Simon’s 1965 prediction that ""machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.”There have been many other contributors to AI, including the three Turing Award winners in 2018: Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun. Their work on deep-learning algorithms was an important contribution, but their continued celebrations of AI’s importance and inevitability included Hinton’s troubling 2016 quote that “people should stop training radiologists now. It’s just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.” A more human-centered view is that deep-learning algorithms will become another tool, like mammograms and blood tests, that empower radiologists and other clinicians to make more accurate diagnoses and offer more appropriate treatment plans.Recommended StoriesArtificial Intelligence Will Let Humanity Talk to Alien CivilizationsFranck Marchis & Ignacio G.

Expert Players Don’t Always Use ItJack MurtaghThe theme of robots replacing people, thereby creating widespread unemployment, was legitimized by a 2013 report from Oxford University, which claimed that 47 percent of all jobs could be automated. Futurist Martin Ford’s 2015 book Rise of the Robots latched on to this idea, painting a troubling picture of low- and high-skilled jobs becoming so completely automated that governments would have to supply a universal basic income because there would be few jobs left. The reality is that well-designed automation increases productivity, which lowers prices, raises demand and brings benefits to many people. These changes trigger a parallel phenomenon of vigorous creation of new jobs, which has helped lead to the current high levels of employment in the U.S. and some other nations.Yes, there were authors who offered cautionary tales and a different vision, such as MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason, but these were exceptions.The muddy-boots pragmatists started a new wave of thoughtful AI critiques. They shifted the discussion from blue-sky optimism to clearly identifying the threats to human dignity, fairness and democracy. Op-Ed pieces and a 2016 White House symposium were helpful initiatives, and mathematician Cathy O’Neil’s 2016 book Weapons of Math Destruction broadened the audience. She focused on how opaque AI algorithms could be harmful when applied at scale to decide on parole, mortgage and job applications. O’Neil’s powerful examples promoted human-centered thinking.Other books, such as Ruha Benjamin’s Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, followed on how algorithms needed to be changed to increase economic opportunities and decrease racial bias.Social psychologist Shoshanna Zuboff’s 2019 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism showed the change from Google’s early motto of “Don’t be evil” to calculated efforts “to obfuscate these processes and their implications.” Zuboff’s solution was to call for a change in business models, democratic oversight and privacy sanctuaries. Scholar Kate Crawford delivered another devastating muddy-boots analysis in her 2021 book Atlas of AI, which focused on the extractive and destructive power of AI on jobs, the environment, human relationships and democracy. She refined her message in a captivating lecture for the National Academy of Engineering, describing constructive actions that AI researchers and implementers could take, while encouraging government regulation and individual efforts to protect privacy.Muddy-boots activists are gaining recognition for their positive research contributions, which offer clever designs that benefit people. In October 2021, Cynthia Rudin received the $1 million prize for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Her work on interpretable forms of AI was a response to the bewildering complexity of opaque black box algorithms, which made it hard for people to understand why they were rejected for paroles, mortgages or jobs.Many of the muddy-boots thinkers are women, but men have also spoken up about the need for humane oversight. Technology pioneer Jaron Lanier also raises concerns in his Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, which identifies the harms from social media and suggests users take more control over their use of it. Legal scholar Frank Pasquale’s New Laws of Robotics explains why AI developers should value human expertise, avoid technological arms races and take responsibility for the technologies they create. However, ensuring human control by way of human-centered designs will take substantial changes in national policies, business practices, research agendas and educational curricula.The diverse workers of this camp—including women, nonbinary people, people with disabilities and people of color—have important messages to ensure that the blue-sky dreams can be channeled into realizable products and services that benefit people and preserve the environment.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.Rights & PermissionsBen Shneiderman is an emeritus professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and author of the recently published book Human-Centered AI (Oxford University Press).More by Ben Shneiderman",Artificial Intelligence Needs Both Pragmatists and Blue-Sky Visionaries,https://www.scientificamerican.com/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/22E97650-2BE9-415C-AA563D9DAA3589B0_source.jpg?w=1200,False,"{'@id': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/#publisher', 'name': 'Scientific American'}",https://www.scientificamerican.com/#publisher,Scientific American,SciAm,"Scientific American, a Division of Springer Nature America, Inc.",1845-08-28,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/static/sciam.svg'}",https://www.scientificamerican.com/masthead/,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39379', 'https://www.jstor.org/publisher/sciamerican', 'https://x.com/sciam', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/SciAmerican', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@scientificamerican', 'https://www.threads.net/@scientific_american', 'https://www.facebook.com/ScientificAmerican/']","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': '1 New York Plaza', 'addressLocality': 'New York', 'addressRegion': 'NY', 'postalCode': '10004', 'addressCountry': 'US'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commercial airlines and other travel and transportation leaders are facing significant challenges in managing pricing, demand, and logistics in today’s volatile environment. This summer’s travel disruptions have laid bare the potential for intermittent hiccups in post-pandemic operations to have drastic effects on customer satisfaction and revenue opportunities.
With travelers’ patience wearing thin, airlines need to reinforce their people, processes, and technologies. By building artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into processes across their organizations, airlines can leverage their data, analysts, and revenue management opportunities to take advantage of new business fundamentals in this changing environment.
“Artificial intelligence isn’t replacing the airline data analyst’s job,” said Alex Mans, founder and CEO of FLYR Labs, a technology company driving commercial optimization for airlines. “But it is changing their role and hopefully unlocking their potential to drive revenue and improve operational efficiencies.”
Intelligence on Demand
Airline data can be difficult to parse, but artificial intelligence makes it easier. It’s impossible for humans to manually process all the information airlines are collecting from digital sources, but deep learning neural networks can provide effective forecasts that give analysts the confidence to make better decisions.
“Historically, the leading forecasting type has been linear, regression-based models, where analysts look at very concentrated year-over-year patterns,” Mans said. “The problem is that there’s just not enough data on any single flight for a given point in time to drive accurate forecasts in a volatile environment. Legacy systems are really bad at determining whether booking one seat on a given flight has a meaningful impact on the outcome.”
To power deep learning algorithms, airlines feed neural networks vast amounts of historical data — such as bookings, searches, events, promotions, and competitive prices — resulting in forecasts that keep analysts better informed on revenue and load-factor performance into the future.
“They can compare how the actual performance builds against the forecast data as the departure date approaches,” Mans said. “The real value comes when, with a platform such as ours, analysts come to trust the forecast and can start using it to inform strategic decisions instead of viewing it as a loose guideline.”
Unlocking the Full Potential of Analysts
According to Mans, artificial intelligence should be thought of as an airline data analyst’s smart sidekick — it’s not replacing the analyst’s job, but rather enhancing the analyst’s ability to make coordinated operational decisions in areas where automation alone is insufficient.
“In the past, analysts have not had accurate forecasts, so most of their decisions were based on instinct,” Mans said. “On top of that, they haven’t had good user interfaces for consuming that data. We generate much better forecasts, enable smarter workflows, and provide a dedicated user interface where analysts can easily access and filter the data and then use the resulting information. With better load and revenue forecasts at any level of granularity across the network, they can do amazing things.”
For example, if an analyst sees a cluster of flights months into the future with a 99-percent forecasted load factor, they can alert colleagues in charge of scheduling and suggest adding capacity. At most airlines, where functions across the organizations are typically siloed, this kind of cross-functional collaboration between commercial teams isn’t common.
“All it takes to start breaking down those silos is for other teams to have access to the same information that the revenue management team has access to,” Mans said. “At the end of the day, different departments are trying to achieve the same results: maximize revenue and contain costs.”
In addition to playing gatekeeper of that information, the analyst’s role will evolve to support a variety of critical functions across the organization.
“For one thing, they can look around corners that the data itself can’t see,” Mans said. “The analyst might know that a schedule change is coming, but unless that information is passed to our system, we have no awareness. Artificial intelligence doesn’t know everything. Another thing to note is that optimizing for maximum revenue isn’t always the goal. An airline entering a new market may want to follow a non-revenue-optimal strategy focused on market control or market share, so the analyst is needed to fine-tune that strategy. Or consider promotions — every airline runs tons of promotions throughout the year, whether tied to their credit card program, certain destinations, or other variables that require the analyst to actively work with our platform and their marketing team to achieve the best results.”
Leveraging New Business Fundamentals
For airlines to weather the storm of today’s unprecedented industry disruptions, dynamic pricing powered by deep learning algorithms is essential. FLYR was built to provide a singular platform that helps airlines manage data, break past data silos with consistently accurate forecasts that can be accessed by anybody in the organization, and achieve total revenue management across all of their products.
“Our job is to help airlines effectively price everything they want to sell, including ancillaries like seat selection, extra baggage, priority boarding, and other upsells,” Mans said. “FLYR’s operating system provides a vertically integrated SaaS platform across data management, forecasting, pricing, automation, business intelligence, and reporting — which includes simulation and scenario evaluation — while also removing constraints within e-commerce and fulfillment thanks to acquisitions such as Newshore so airlines can get stuff done faster and more efficiently. That’s what we’re building as a company, and that’s the future of work within this industry.”

After the celebrated victory of AlexNet at the LSVRC2012 classification contest, deep residual network (ResNet) was arguably the most groundbreaking work in the computer vision and deep learning community in the last few years. ResNet makes it possible to train up to hundreds or even thousands of layers and still achieve a compelling performance.
What Is a Residual Network (ResNet)?ResNet is an artificial neural network that introduced a so-called “identity shortcut connection,” which allows the model to skip one or more layers. This approach makes it possible to train the network on thousands of layers without affecting performance. It’s become one of the most popular architectures for various computer vision tasks.
Taking advantage of its powerful representational ability, the performance of many computer vision applications — other than image classification — have been boosted, including object detection and facial recognition.
Since ResNet blew people’s minds in 2015, many in the research community have dived into the secrets of its success, and several refinements have been made in the architecture. In the first part of this article, I am going to give a little bit of background knowledge for those who are unfamiliar with ResNet, and in the second half, I will review some of the papers I read recently regarding different variants and interpretations of the ResNet architecture.
 
What Is ResNet?
According to the universal approximation theorem, given enough capacity, we know that a feedforward network with a single layer is sufficient to represent any function. However, the layer might be massive, and the network is prone to overfitting the data. Therefore, there is a common trend in the research community that our network architecture needs to go deeper.
Since AlexNet, the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is going deeper and deeper. While AlexNet had only five convolutional layers, the VGG network and GoogleNet (also codenamed Inception_v1) had 19 and 22 layers respectively.
However, you can’t simply stack layers together to increase network depth. Deep networks are hard to train because of the notorious vanishing gradient problem. As the gradient is backpropagated to earlier layers, repeated multiplication may make the gradient infinitely small. As a result, the deeper the network goes, the more its performance becomes saturated or even starts rapidly degrading.
Before ResNet, there had been several ways to deal with the vanishing gradient issue. For instance, GoogleNet adds an auxiliary loss in a middle layer for extra supervision, but none of those solutions seemed to really tackle the problem once and for all.
The core idea of ResNet is that it introduced a so-called “identity shortcut connection” that skips one or more layers.
The authors of the study on deep residual learning for image recognition argue that stacking layers shouldn’t degrade the network performance because we could simply stack identity mappings — a layer that doesn’t do anything — on top of the current network, and the resulting architecture would perform the same. This indicates that the deeper model should not produce a training error higher than its shallower counterparts. They hypothesize that letting the stacked layers fit a residual mapping is easier than letting them directly fit the desired underlying mapping. And the residual block above explicitly allows it to do precisely that.
As a matter of fact, ResNet was not the first to make use of shortcut connections. The authors of a study on Highway Network also introduced gated shortcut connections. These parameterized gates control how much information is allowed to flow across the shortcut. A similar idea can be found in the report on long short-term memory (LSTM) cell, in which there is a parameterized forget gate that controls how much information will flow to the next time step. Therefore, ResNet can be thought of as a special case of highway network.
However, experiments show that the highway network performs no better than ResNet, which is unusual because the solution space of highway network contains ResNet. Therefore, it should perform at least as good as ResNet. This suggests that it is more important to keep these “gradient highways” clear than to go for a larger solution space.
Following this intuition, the authors of deep residual learning for image recognition refined the residual block and proposed in a study on identity mappings in deep ResNets a pre-activation variant of residual block, in which the gradients can flow unimpeded through the shortcut connections to any other earlier layer. In fact, using the original residual block in image recognition study, training a 1202-layer ResNet resulted in a worse performance than its 110-layer counterpart.
The authors of identity mappings in deep ResNets demonstrated with experiments that they can now train a 1001-layer deep ResNet to outperform its shallower counterparts. Because of its compelling results, ResNet quickly became one of the most popular architectures for various computer vision tasks.

ResNet Architecture Variants and Interpretations
As ResNet gains popularity in the research community, its architecture is getting studied heavily. In this section, I will first introduce several new architectures based on ResNet, then introduce a paper that provides an interpretation of treating ResNet as an ensemble of many smaller networks.
 
ResNeXt
The authors in a study on aggregated residual transformations for deep neural networks proposed a variant of ResNet that is codenamed ResNeXt.
It is very similar to the inception module that the authors from the study on going deeper with convolutions came up with in 2015. They both follow the split-transform-merge paradigm, except in this variant, the outputs of different paths are merged by adding them together, while in the 2015 study, they are depth-concatenated. Another difference is that in the study on going deeper with convolutions, each path is different (1x1, 3x3 and 5x5 convolution) from each other, while in this architecture, all paths share the same topology.
The authors introduced a hyper-parameter called cardinality — the number of independent paths — to provide a new way of adjusting the model capacity. Experiments show that accuracy can be gained more efficiently by increasing the cardinality than by going deeper or wider. The authors state that compared to inception, this novel architecture is easier to adapt to new data sets and tasks, as it has a simple paradigm and only one hyper-parameter needs to be adjusted.  Inception, however, has many hyper-parameters (like the kernel size of the convolutional layer of each path) to tune. This novel building block has three equivalent forms.
In practice, the “split-transform-merge” is usually done via a pointwise grouped convolutional layer, which divides its input into groups of feature maps and performs normal convolution respectively. Their outputs are depth-concatenated and then fed to a 1x1 convolutional layer.
 
Densely Connected CNN
Another team of researchers in 2016 proposed a novel architecture called DenseNet that further exploits the effects of shortcut connections. It connects all layers directly with each other. In this novel architecture, the input of each layer consists of the feature maps of all earlier layer, and its output is passed to each subsequent layer. The feature maps are aggregated with depth-concatenation.
Other than tackling the vanishing gradients problem, the authors of “Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks” argue that this architecture also encourages feature reuse, making the network highly parameter-efficient. One simple interpretation of this is that, in the studies on deep residual learning for image recognition and identity mappings in deep ResNetts the output of the identity mapping was added to the next block, which might impede information flow if the feature maps of two layers have very different distributions. Therefore, concatenating feature maps can preserve them all and increase the variance of the outputs, encouraging feature reuse
Following this paradigm, we know that the l_th layer will have k * (l-1) + k_0 input feature maps, where k_0 is the number of channels in the input image. The authors used a hyper-parameter called growth rate (k) to prevent the network from growing too wide. They also used a 1x1 convolutional bottleneck layer to reduce the number of feature maps before the expensive 3x3 convolution. 
 
Deep Network with Stochastic Depth
Although ResNet has proven powerful in many applications, one major drawback is that a deeper network usually requires weeks for training, making it practically infeasible in real-world applications. To tackle this issue, the researchers for a study on “Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth” introduced a counter-intuitive method of randomly dropping layers during training and using the full network in testing.
The authors used the residual block as their network’s building block. Therefore, during training, when a particular residual block is enabled, its input flows through both the identity shortcut and the weight layers, otherwise the input only flows through the identity shortcut. In training time, each layer has a “survival probability” and is randomly dropped. In testing time, all blocks are kept active and re-calibrated according to its survival probability during training.
Formally, let H_l be the output of the l_th residual block, f_l be the mapping defined by the l_th block’s weighted mapping, b_l  be a Bernoulli random variable that can only be a one or zero (indicating whether a block is active), during training:

When b_l = 1, this block becomes a normal residual block. And when b_l = 0, the above formula becomes:

Since we know that H_(l-1) is the output of a ReLU, which is already non-negative, the above equation reduces to an identity layer that only passes the input through to the next layer:

Let p_l be the survival probability of layer l during training, during test time, we have:

The authors applied a linear decay rule to the survival probability of each layer. They argue that since earlier layers extract low-level features that will be used by later ones, they should not be dropped too frequently. The resulting rule therefore becomes:

Where L denotes the total number of blocks, thus p_L is the survival probability of the last residual block and is fixed to 0.5 throughout experiments. Also note that in this setting, the input is treated as the first layer (l = 0) and thus, is never dropped. The overall framework over stochastic depth training is demonstrated in the figure below.
Similar to Dropout, training a deep network with stochastic depth can be viewed as training an ensemble of many smaller ResNets. The difference is that this method randomly drops an entire layer while Dropout only drops part of the hidden units in one layer during training.
Experiments show that training a 110-layer ResNet with stochastic depth results in better performance than training a constant-depth 110-layer ResNet, while also dramatically reducing the training time. This suggests that some of the layers (paths) in ResNet might be redundant.

ResNet as an Ensemble of Smaller Networks
In the study on deep networks with stochastic depth, the researchers proposed a counter-intuitive way of training a very deep network that involved randomly dropping its layers during training and using the full network in testing time. The researchers of the study, “Residual Networks Behave Like Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks” had an even more counter-intuitive finding. We can actually drop some of the layers of a trained ResNet and still have comparable performance. This makes the ResNet architecture even more interesting, as the study authors also dropped layers of a VGG network and degraded its performance dramatically.
This study first provides an unraveled view of ResNet to make things clearer. After we unroll the network architecture, it is quite clear that a ResNet architecture with i residual blocks has 2^i different paths (because each residual block provides two independent paths).
Given that finding, it is quite clear why removing a couple of layers in a ResNet architecture doesn’t compromise its performance too much. The architecture has many independent effective paths and the majority of them remain intact after we remove a couple of layers. On the contrary, the VGG network has only one effective path, so removing a single layer compromises this one. As shown in the study’s extensive experiments.
The authors also conducted experiments to show that the collection of paths in ResNet have ensemble-like behavior. They did so by deleting different numbers of layers at test time, and checked to see if the performance of the network smoothly correlated with the number of deleted layers. The results suggested that the network indeed behaves like an ensemble.
Finally, the authors looked into the characteristics of the paths in ResNet.
It is apparent that the distribution of all possible path lengths follows a binomial distribution. The majority of paths go through 19 to 35 residual blocks.
The authors also conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between path length and the magnitude of the gradients flowing through it. To get the magnitude of gradients in the path of length k, the authors first fed a batch of data to the network and randomly sampled k residual blocks. When backpropagating the gradients, they propagated through the weight layer only for the sampled residual blocks. Their graphs show that the magnitude of gradients decreases rapidly as the path becomes longer.
We can now multiply the frequency of each path length with its expected magnitude of gradients to get a feel for how many paths of each length contribute to training. Surprisingly, most contributions come from paths of length nine to 18, but they constitute only a tiny portion of the total paths. This is a very interesting finding, as it suggests that ResNet did not solve the vanishing gradients problem for very long paths, and that ResNet actually enables training very deep networks by shortening its effective paths.
In this article, I revisited the compelling ResNet architecture and briefly explained the intuitions behind its recent success. I hope it helps strengthen your understanding of this groundbreaking work.

 As AI art generators take the world by storm, some people wonder if it should count as art at all. The technology is still evolving and has some wrinkles to iron out, which means there are indeed flaws to consider alongside the incredible artwork a good artificial intelligence can produce. 







 Let’s explore the issue by breaking down the definition of art and whether or not AI-based work fits within that umbrella. 


 What Is Art? 
 Starting with the etymology of the word, Merriam-Webster’s definition states that “art” stems from the Latin word “ars”, which means, among other things, acquired skill, craftsmanship, and artistic achievement. 

 Today, there’s little consensus between philosophers and artists as to what real art is. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains regarding modern interpretations, there are two conventionalist definitions: 

 An artwork is an artifact made for the public to experience.  It is an evolution of works that came before.  

 At the same time, traditionalism values an artwork’s functionality, while hybrid theories see something as art if it meets certain conditions, such as embodying a function of a central art form of a particular time, whether it was intentional or not. 






 

 Besides several definitions of art, an important lesson to take away is that even experts have different opinions as to what “real” art means. The matter is clearly subjective, so you can’t definitively classify the works of AI engines. 



 How Is AI Art Created? 
 A major part of AI-generated art and its technology was the development of artificial neural networks (ANN) from the mid-1900s onwards. 

 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were then invented in 2015, which led to Google’s Alexander Mordvintsev putting them to work in his DeepDream algorithm alongside convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a type of ANN. 






 According to The MIT Press Reader’s article on DeepDream, ConvNets are fed millions of images and their descriptions until the networks can effectively recognize, for example, faces, dog breeds, and patterns in data. 

 Mordvintsev kept training his models of algorithms with a range of datasets and text-to-image prompts until DeepDream started producing beautiful and mind-bending images. This is at the heart of AI art generators: streams of information, from pictures to dates and alt text, that help them classify different visuals and then reproduce them as directed by a written prompt. 

 The technology evolved further thanks to companies like OpenAI and its Dall-E program, one of the best platforms for creating images using AI. We also have Midjourney pushing the boundaries of digital art, as well as mobile apps like Wombo Dream’s AI art creator. 







 

 At the end of the day, AI art generators use deep learning to absorb pre-existing information and understand what different objects, textures, or concepts look like. 



 Why AI-Generated Art Is Not Considered Real Art 
 With a basic understanding of the technology behind AI art generators and definitions of real art, we can work out where these digital creations fit in the art world. It’s an important task that can benefit other mainstream fields of artificial intelligence like text-to-video AI generators and social media features like TikTok’s AI greenscreen filter. 

 Artificial Intelligence Lacks Emotions That Fuel Art 
 Ultimately, art is classed as the product of imagination, skill, experience, and emotion, usually meant to represent something and for the public to enjoy. 






 But there are human creations that don’t tick any of these boxes and yet are considered art because people made them. They spent time and effort putting their inner worlds onto that canvas, sculpture, or composition. 

 Machine intelligence also puts a lot of work into sorting through tons of data, linking someone’s prompt to datasets, and trying to represent it as best as possible. The difference is that the AI is compelled by commands, not an emotional need to express itself. 

 AI Art Isn’t Original 
 Then, there’s the matter of originality. AI generators use pre-existing images and often merge them to illustrate a requested subject, concept, artistic form, and so on. Even among manmade artworks, some experts consider true art as that which is unique and emotive in a way never encountered before. 

    





 Unfortunately, although complete originality does happen in human art, much of it is a recurrence of existing styles—not that different from what artificial intelligence does. So, “originality” is as subjective as “real art”. 

 And it’s not just artistic patterns throughout history that inspire people, but also things like memories, symbols, language, and cultural themes, all multisensory data that the brain—an organic neural network—processes. 

 Looking through TEDxMileHigh’s list of research on imagination confirms that this essential part of creativity comes down to cognitive association, using the complex computer in your head to form links between what you know and what you want to express or experience. 

 AI-Generated Art Complicates Copyright 
 AI art involves a program mimicking the work of existing artists to create a new piece as per the request of a human, but who didn’t use that all-important emotive creativity discussed above. 





 So, who made the artwork, the machine or its user? And can the original artists sue for copyright violation? Such questions complicate the merging of artificial intelligence and the art industry, while fuelling arguments against recognizing AI-generated art as marketable artistic products. 

 This problem does show that the art world needs a more careful infrastructure when it comes to incorporating AI art, but it doesn’t diminish the aesthetic merit of such artwork. 



 Why AI-Generated Art Is Real Art 
 It’s true that human artists bring more original and emotive expression to the table. AI-based generators, however, can produce images that are just as impressive. Here are the best reasons why they should count as real art. 

 Machines Develop Artistic Skills Like Humans Do 
 An algorithm can’t immediately create art that accurately represents a prompt. It needs to collect data and learn from it, improving its understanding like a human would. 






    

 Users’ approval and rejection of created images also affect some models, so they improve their skills even more through trial and error. The more they’re used, the better they’re able to satisfy prompts. 

 In other words, AI artwork can be seen as craftsmanship and artistic achievement, something these programs and their developers should be proud of. 

 AI Art Can Move and Inspire 
 It can take a few tries to get the art you imagined, but use one of the best AI text-to-image generators like NightCafe and you’ll often end up with outstanding results. 

 Whether it’s exactly what you wanted or not, AI art creators can surprise you with images that are beautiful, surreal, chilling, or hyperrealistic. In a way, the machine uses its imagination and can often exceed your expectations. 





 So, even though emotions don’t motivate programs and their art, these creations can draw emotions out of you and even give you ideas for further expression. Isn’t that a key function of real art? 

 AI-Generated Artworks Are an Evolution of Art and Society 
 Finally, digital art is a modern medium and form of expression, as well as a reflection of contemporary society. It is relevant and impactful, whether it’s a person or a machine creating it. 

 Additionally, the works of art that AI generators produce come from millions of data sources, old and new. Even if your results only combine a few pre-existing images or styles, they are a blend of art history. 

 At the same time, they serve as a mirror of society, considering all the data an AI learns from to create pictures, text, and other materials, comes from what people say, do, and post online. It's one of several risks of artificial intelligence to keep in mind. 








 Real Art Is Subjective 
 Artificial intelligence is meant to make people’s lives better. Instead of hiring an expensive graphic designer or learning to draw yourself, for example, a program can create stunning art for you. 

 You can edit photos, write articles, and more with the help of AI tools, but they’re never perfect. There are still limits to their capabilities, which simply demands that you pay attention when using them, not completely avoid them. 

 Similarly, the flaws of AI art generators aren’t enough to justify not considering their creations real art. As a new part of the art world, they just need better integration.

If so, what did you make, and what was the experience like?If not, try it out here. Just type any combination of words into the prompt field, choose an art style and click “create.”What’s your reaction to the generator’s creation?In your opinion, how do A.I.-generated pictures like these compare to an original piece of artwork that an artist might draw, paint, sculpt or photograph? Are they the same? Do you think A.I.-generated images are art?In “An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy.” Kevin Roose writes about the controversy behind A.I.-generated images, which was front and center at a recent art competition:This year, the Colorado State Fair’s annual art competition gave out prizes in all the usual categories: painting, quilting, sculpture.But one entrant, Jason M. Allen of Pueblo West, Colo., didn’t make his entry with a brush or a lump of clay. He created it with Midjourney, an artificial intelligence program that turns lines of text into hyper-realistic graphics.Mr. Allen’s work, “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,” took home the blue ribbon in the fair’s contest for emerging digital artists — making it one of the first A.I.-generated pieces to win such a prize, and setting off a fierce backlash from artists who accused him of, essentially, cheating.Reached by phone on Wednesday, Mr. Allen defended his work. He said that he had made clear that his work — which was submitted under the name “Jason M. Allen via Midjourney” — was created using A.I., and that he hadn’t deceived anyone about its origins.“I’m not going to apologize for it,” he said. “I won, and I didn’t break any rules.”A.I.-generated art has been around for years. But tools released this year — with names like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion — have made it possible for rank amateurs to create complex, abstract or photorealistic works simply by typing a few words into a text box.These apps have made many human artists understandably nervous about their own futures — why would anyone pay for art, they wonder, when they could generate it themselves? They have also generated fierce debates about the ethics of A.I.-generated art, and opposition from people who claim that these apps are essentially a high-tech form of plagiarism.The article goes on to explain the ethical dilemma:Controversy over new art-making technologies is nothing new. Many painters recoiled at the invention of the camera, which they saw as a debasement of human artistry. (Charles Baudelaire, the 19th-century French poet and art critic, called photography “art’s most mor­tal enemy.”) In the 20th century, digital editing tools and computer-assisted design programs were similarly dismissed by purists for requiring too little skill of their human collaborators.What makes the new breed of A.I. tools different, some critics believe, is not just that they’re capable of producing beautiful works of art with minimal effort. It’s how they work. Apps like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney are built by scraping millions of images from the open web, then teaching algorithms to recognize patterns and relationships in those images and generate new ones in the same style. That means that artists who upload their works to the internet may be unwittingly helping to train their algorithmic competitors.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:What is your reaction to Mr. Allens artwork? Do you think it is prize-worthy? Do you think it is “cheating”?Should pictures created with artificial intelligence be considered art — equal to what an artist might create with a pen, a brush or a lump of clay? Why or why not?New art-making technologies have long been the subject of controversy in the art world. Do you think fears about A.I. are overblown? Or are artists rightfully worried about how the technology how might affect their own livelihoods and art itself?Mr. Allen claims, “Art is dead, dude. It’s over. A.I. won. Humans lost.” What do you think of this statement? Do you agree? Is A.I. the future of art?What is the value of visual art in our world? What role does it play in your own life?

In recent years, digital transformation – the transformation of business operations and models using digital technology – has disrupted nearly every industry, resetting consumer expectations and changing the way businesses deliver products and services.
For organizations large and small, this trend is an opportunity to both modernize business processes and reinvent customer experiences.  
Cheryl Foulkes, senior vice president of team member experience and IT strategy at Dell Technologies, underscores the pace at which new technologies are taking hold.
“Digital transformation changes people’s expectations for the future. There’s now an even greater imperative to transform,” Foulkes says.

How COVID-19 Affected Digital Transformation 
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation, as businesses turned to technology to adapt to limited in-person transactions.
A Dell survey of 4,300 leaders of midsize and large enterprises in 18 countries found that 80% of businesses fast-tracked at least some digital transformation programs in 2020. Likewise, 72% of 2,030 small businesses surveyed by global market intelligence firm IDC in its “2020 Small Business Digital Transformation” report said the pandemic drove them to accelerate digitalization. 
What is Digital Transformation?


The focus of digital transformation is not simply on implementing technology, says Sri Manchala, chairman, founder and CEO of Trianz, a Silicon Valley digital transformation research, strategy, and implementation company.
“Digital transformation is about reimagining a company’s portfolio or products and services,” says Manchala. “You have to try to understand what appeals to customers today and to the customers of the future – and rethink your products and services in ways that the customer imagines value.”
Benefits of Digital Transformation 
For businesses, digital transformation can offer many benefits. Some of them include reduced costs, increased speed and flexibility, greater market reach and more intelligent decision-making, says Andrew Nelson, PhD, professor of management and the Randall C. Papé chair in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Oregon’s Lundquist College of Business.
“It can make the business more efficient, automating processes and reducing some of their pains, so they can focus more on the value-added aspects of their business,” Nelson says.
This includes small businesses. The 2020 Small Business Digital Transformation survey found that small businesses that prioritize digital transformation saw double revenue growth compared to those just starting digital transformation efforts – and eight times higher revenues than those with none.


“Digital transformation unlocked a lot of new opportunities for us to be much more relevant to a growing customer base,” says Clark Twiddy, president of North Carolina vacation rental business Twiddy & Company, which employs an average of 150 people – and up to 500 during peak season. “It has allowed us to move much more rapidly to meet the needs of our customers.”
One example of that transformation is the company’s communication with customers, which in the past was primarily in person or over the phone. To automate and speed up some of the customer inquiries, such as restaurant recommendations or simple troubleshooting, the company now relies heavily on text messaging as primary communication tool.
How Does Digital Transformation Work?
Just about any area of a business can benefit from digital transformation, including customer service, operations, marketing, and human resources.
According to a 2021 survey by market research and consulting firm SMB Group (sponsored by Dell Technologies, Acumatica, and Xero), the top five priorities for automation were customer service (38%), internal IT (34%), financials and accounting (31%), business planning and analytics (31%), and sales (30%).  
At the core, digital transformation entails a change in business processes, says Ali Reza Montazemi, PhD, professor of information systems at the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University in Canada.
“Businesses have to identify what they’re doing right now and what are the best practices, what the leaders in field are doing,” he says.

There are different scales to measure your digital transformation maturity, based on aspects such as digital strategy, digitalization, digital processes (e.g., automation) and digital workforce.
Dell’s Index, for example, identifies five categories, ranging from “digital laggards” (businesses that have no digital plan, as well as limited initiatives) to “digital leaders” (businesses with digital transformation embedded in their DNA).
Foulkes, of Dell Technologies, says fewer and fewer companies have remained in the laggards category in the last few years.
“Business leaders understand that they can’t sit back for a few more years, [or] their companies will be left behind,” she says. ""The best-prepared organizations are already thinking digital-first and reimagining how to differentiate their products and services with technology.""
Elements of Digital Transformation
Digital Transformation is encompassed by different elements that provide a way to improve processes and workflows and help businesses to better understand their customers and markets. 
Data Analytics: The Key to Faster, Better Decisions
Data analytics is perhaps one of the most important technologies driving digital transformation.
“Data analytics enables you to use the data you have to make the customer experience better,” Foulkes says.
Also referred to as 'big data analytics,' this broad term describes a combination of advanced techniques and processes used to examine very large and diverse sets of data that come from different sources. The purpose of data analytics is to extract insights that aid in decision making.

German engineering company ProGlove says it takes ""a human-centric approach to innovation."" 

“Many small businesses have more data than they realize, even if they haven’t systematically collected it or reflected on it,"" Nelson notes.
One type of data analytics is predictive analytics, which uses machine learning algorithms, historical data, and predictive modeling to forecast or make predictions about future outcomes. For example, Twiddy & Company relies on predictive and other data analytics to apply dynamic pricing to the rentals and ensure pricing meets revenue targets.
Like many businesses in the travel industry, the company’s cash flow plummeted to zero during the pandemic and all in-person customer contact ceased. With its business disrupted, the technology-forward, family-owned business had to reinvent a business model previously rooted in personal interactions. As a result, Twiddy & Company expanded its data scientists team to nine people.

Biotechnology firm Innerplant says farmers are able ""to hear what their crops are saying,"" thanks to its live plant sensors.
With 44 years in business, the company had millions of transactional records, which the data scientists can contextualize with other factors, such as location, web traffic and competitive market analysis, and run simulations on potential revenues for each property. Before that, property owners had to approve rental prices for each week.
""We’re automating everything we can because the more we automate, the faster the processes get, and the more we can focus on relevance,” Twiddy says.
Artificial Intelligence: The Path to Automation
One of the technologies that’s relevant at every step of digital transformation is artificial intelligence (AI), according to Ash Fontana, author of The AI-First Company: How to Compete and Win with Artificial Intelligence.
“AI can be used to transpose, clean and organize the data itself, analyze the information, and ultimately help you make decisions and automate things,” Fontana says.
A branch of computer science, AI refers to computers’ ability to perform human tasks, such as making intelligent decisions. The most widely applied subset of AI currently is machine learning, which refers to applying computer algorithms and models to historic data to “learn” and make predictions. In the SMB Group survey, the respondents identified artificial intelligence and machine learning as the second top technology most critical to future growth.

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, is helping simplify credit card application reviews, a traditionally complex and manual process.
“Machine learning are statistical models that are repeated over and over again and applied in meaningful ways, reliably and consistently, to help you do all sorts of things,” Fontana explains. It can help businesses gain a competitive advantage.
AI automates processes, such as managing supply chains, categorizing expenses to make accounting faster or gathering financial information so you can quickly create reports. It also powers everything from virtual assistants and chatbots to predictive analytics.

SaaS vendor Drift's conversational AI helps companies engage website visitors in real-time, personalized conversations.
Chatbots is one of the AI-powered technologies Twiddy & Company has adopted. This may seem unusual for a business that relies heavily on in-person interaction, but it became necessary during the pandemic, Twiddy explains.   
“We added the chatbot to our website within days of the pandemic shutdown, and found it had an enormous level of interactions,” he says. ""We worked very hard to increase the quality of those interactions.”
Cloud Computing: The Foundation for Change
Another core part of digital transformation, cloud computing not only modernizes processes and powers digital-first disciplines, but also drives down costs for small businesses.
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, such as servers, applications and storage, on demand via the internet. “The cloud” is distributed among multiple servers, often at different locations. In the case of the public cloud, the computing resources are shared among the cloud provider’s customers.
“By using the cloud, businesses can process data in very high volumes because the computing power of the cloud is stronger than what you can do with your own infrastructure,” says Manchala. ""They are able to make storage of data and the applications cheaper because that infrastructure is shared.”

Three cloud delivery models:  

Software-as-a-service (SaaS), which are applications that run on cloud infrastructure and can be accessed from any device, anywhere, either through a web browser or a dedicated app (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Office 365, Google G-Suite, Zendesk)
Platform-as-a-service (PaaS), which is cloud infrastructure that enables businesses to deploy third-party or their own applications (e.g., SAP Cloud, VMware Tanzu, Red Hat OpenShift, Salesforce Lightning)
Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which includes the storage, network and computer resources for running operating systems and applications (e.g., Amazon AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, Dell Technologies APEX Cloud Services)  


Upstarts like Frayt, AxelHire and Roadie use cloud-based tech to fill gaps in the delivery supply chain for consumer goods.  
“Our data (from over 5,000 companies globally) shows very clearly that when the cloud is adopted at scale, it creates a competitive advantage demonstrated by an acceleration of product-solution cycle times, customer focus and validation, and steep cost reductions in IT infrastructure, applications and analytics,” Manchala says. “For example, companies that are using the cloud to develop applications, apply analytics, build next-generation portals, and so on are able to do it two times faster.”

Oregon-based Instashowing helps real estate professionals streamline residential showings.
Overcoming Barriers to Adoption
Data privacy and security, lack of digital skills, and cultural resistance were some of the top barriers and challenges that the Dell Technologies, IDC and SMB Group surveys identified.


Small businesses may have an advantage when it comes to quick adoption of digital tools, Foulkes says.
“The cultural change may be the hardest part of digital transformation. But in a small business, that may not require as big of an investment because you have fewer people to rally behind your vision,” she says.    
Montazemi says small businesses that lack in-house experts should lean on outsourcing to implement their strategies. He recommends reaching out to small business development centers and university business schools, many of which offer resources and support for businesses of all sizes.
“First, know where you’re going, and then take advantage of all the free resources,” he says.
The Takeaway
The technology powering digital transformation continues to evolve. The Internet of Things, blockchain, 5G, augmented reality, and virtual reality are just some of the emerging trends that will usher in the next transformation era and may be entering the mainstream next.
Small businesses can’t afford to wait until the next technology shows up, according to Montazemi.
“You need to be prepared with the state of the art, and when the new one comes in, you’ll be able to implement it more easily because the learning curve will not be as steep,” he says.
Whatever the next stage brings, digital transformation is an opportunity now for small businesses to level the playing field with larger enterprises – and to continue to stay relevant in the market well into the future.

A recent study found that almost two-thirds of government employees are experiencing burnout, a much higher rate than seen in the private sector. Furthermore, almost half of respondents are considering leaving their government jobs within the next year due to increased burnout and stress.One immediate solution to help this potential crisis is the responsible implementation of artificial intelligence. AI can mitigate the impact of burnout by removing repetitive and time-consuming tasks and streamlining processes, reducing the overall burden and repetitive nature of government work. However, effective AI investments demand more than just funding and technology.Agencies must balance efforts to scale investment in AI while responding to the unique needs and challenges of the many diverse teams that make up the federal workforce.Currently, there is a lack of cohesive guidance leading government efforts around AI. While organizations such as NIST have released basic AI framework for RMF, organizations without any AI experience may struggle to build the necessary foundation for a mature, agile AI posture. To lay the groundwork for a long-term AI strategy while generating short-term gains to support the federal workforce quickly, agencies must consider three guideline components of AI.Ensuring acceptable levels of data maturityDedicated funding for AI is only one component of an effective AI strategy. Before implementing new technologies, agencies must start with their existing processes –– beginning with their level of data maturity.If an agency does not have enough historical data to analyze, or the data they do have is not organized, implementing AI can create extra work on the front end for federal workers who could find themselves sorting through inaccurate or incomplete data processed by AI. For example, in response to this challenge, the Department of Defense stood up the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) to lead the deployment of AI across DoD, including the Department’s strategy and policy on data.Once agencies realize a baseline of data maturity, they can pilot basic AI applications such as automating basic tasks, empowering agencies to gather high-quality data and provide analysis and insight around that data, providing the information needed to create a scalable AI roadmap that can integrate with other IT modernization technologies.But having a roadmap alone is not enough to ensure that AI-driven technologies are useful for the federal workforce.Understand federal employees’ needsTo implement AI that truly supports federal workers, agencies need to understand the main pain points and challenges facing federal employees. For most private enterprises looking to implement new technology, user experience surveys would be a core part of the pilot program to ensure an analytics-driven understanding of the technology’s successes and gaps.However, although employee input is a crucial part of the AI planning process, government surveys are often expensive and can take months or years to consolidate into actionable data.One way to combat this difficulty is utilizing existing AI to inform AI investments. For example, instead of sending out a survey where the results may take months to receive, an AI dashboard may provide a real-time view of overall work showing what areas need more support or automate a simple response survey where employees can provide input.Using relatively basic AI to evaluate implementation allows agencies to gain insight into the needs of the workforce more sustainably and effectively than surveys, showing IT leaders where to implement AI for the most impact.Using AI to enhance the employee experienceOnce agencies have an AI baseline and understand worker needs, the last step to implementing employee-focused AI is creating a robust AI-empowered employee experience program.There are many ways that AI can help agencies with experience management, from automating timesheets to streamlining business decisions. When AI is designed with these improvements in mind, AI’s tangible benefits support both broader organizational goals and the humans working to achieve them.Scaling AI beyond pilot programs remains a challenge. One of the primary responsibilities of the CDAO is to develop processes for AI-enabled capabilities to be developed and fielded at scale across the defense space.CDAO addressed this issue by selectively scaling only proven AI solutions for enterprise and joint use cases. Prioritizing proven solutions ensures that the AI they are implementing runs smoothly, is easy to use and –– most importantly –– is familiar to the workforce. As AI solutions become more sophisticated, agencies can continue to expand until they have a fully scalable AI network designed by and for humans.Contrary to much of the conversation around AI, people are the most essential component of successful artificial intelligence programs. For implementation to be successful, agencies need a human-centered AI mindset. Following these three guidelines to create human-centered AI creates space for the federal workforce to be exponentially more creative, productive and ultimately more effective in furthering agency missions, equipping leaders to elevate the full potential of their teams.Dr. Allen Badeau is the chief technology officer for Empower AI, as well as the director of the Empower AI Center for Rapid Engagement and Agile Technology Exchange (CREATE) Lab.Have an Opinion?This article is an Op-Ed and the opinions expressed are those of the author.
