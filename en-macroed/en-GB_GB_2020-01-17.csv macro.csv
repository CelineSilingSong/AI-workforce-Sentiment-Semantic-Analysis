The rapid growth in artificial intelligence in Japan

January 17, 2020

Agnieszka Kuczynska from EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation, details the current rapid growth in artificial intelligence in Japan
Current rapid growth in artificial intelligence (AI) is fuelled predominantly by the rediscovery of deep learning. When it first surfaced 15 years ago, the concept was met with unfavourable conditions and largely abandoned in the aftermath. Nowadays, deep learning is back, circumstances are right and the field flourishes.
The described third boom in artificial AI and subsequent tightening technological and economic competition sent ripples through various aspects of the social realm, including policymaking. Many countries began working on national AI strategies, including current leaders – China and U.S. – and Japan also followed suit.
Society 5.0.
However, what distinguishes Japan from other countries is a consistent concept underlying all introduced regulation – the vision of Society 5.0. This new form of society is saturated with AI-related technology, which not only improves the lives of its members, but also creates new aspects and new values. Individual needs are met in a timely and proportionate manner allowing for fulfilled and contented lives. With society 5.0 as a targeted outcome, the recently updated AI Strategy 2019 contains a wide spectrum of necessary actions comprising both facilitating the development of AI and utilising it for the advancement of industry and society.
The strength of the strategy lies in its emphasis on the practical application of AI, Japanese policymakers correctly recognised the versatility of AI and its potential to pervade and transform any given field, employing it to improve and lower costs of various processes, perform tasks beyond human capabilities and gain insight where human-operated analysis didn’t reach.
The strategy aims not only to improve situation on a national level, targeting five designated priority areas (manufacturing, transportation and logistics, health and medical care, agriculture and disaster response) but also globally – by helping solve major societal problems like ageing society or labour shortage, diversification of energy sources, GHG reduction or more efficient waste management, which lines up perfectly with achieving Sustainable Development Goals. According to the strategy, the solutions developed in Japan would then be made available for the world and if realised successfully, it might just be the advantage that Japan needs to win over its competitors.
Still, reaching the targets mentioned above requires major efforts in at least three vital areas: R&D, data and human resources.
At the moment, Japan along with the rest of the world struggles with a lack of educated professionals capable of handling AI-related technologies. The short-term relief could be brought by encouraging more women to participate in the job market and attracting skilled resources form overseas. In the long-term perspective, Japan is preparing for major educational system reform, introducing AI into curricula and making it obligatory part of the university entrance exam, creating a learning inducive environment for students (sufficient network infrastructure and access to communication devices) and facilitating lifelong learning for the existing workforce.
Data
Recognising data as the sine qua non for the development of AI, the Japanese Government is making considerable effort to facilitate data circulation while maintaining its quality. Notable examples include The Basic Act on the Advancement of Utilising Public and Private Sector Data and The Act on the Protection of Personal Information. It is also worth mentioning, that all the practical applications of AI planned in the new AI Strategy are designed as two-way data flows – one direction is technology and data deployment into the industry area and the other is the data gathered from users feeding further development of AI. To organise and structure the exchange, the Japanese Government plans to construct a data linkage infrastructure.
R&D programmes
Finally, a lot of effort is also directed at the R&D area, with establishing a network of centres of excellence as the first step. In the search for disruptive innovation, the Japanese Government initiated many R&D programmes, the last of which – Moonshot R&D – positively surprises with scale and forwardness and also offers many opportunities for international collaboration for European partners.
Japan and EU
Japan certainly seems determined to embrace and take advantage of AI’s potential in transforming its own society and reinforcing its global position. It would, therefore, be beneficial for European companies to closely follow Japan’s next movements, as the two have a lot in common. With a shared approach to technology and related values (confirmed recently by the European Union’s (EU) welcoming Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI) and common rivals, Japan and EU are natural allies and its high time to capitalise on cooperation potential.

He has held policy roles in the Blair and Cameron governments. His new book, A World Without Work, explores how society should respond to the increasing automation of employment.This isn’t an unexplored topic, so why did you write this book? 
 My view is that this is one of the greatest questions of our time. And in spite of everything that has been written, I didn’t feel like we had done the question justice. I don’t think we’re taking seriously this idea that there might not be enough well-paid work for everyone to do because of technological advances that are taking place.Is that partly because of the way the question is framed, that “robots are stealing our jobs” when that’s not how these changes are happening? 
 Yes. There are two mistakes there. One is the sort of anthropomorphisation of technology – these robots exist but they are often gimmicks. The technologies that are really very powerful don’t look, think or reason like us. The second mistake is to think of entire jobs being replaced. These technologies tend to displace people from tasks – what I call task encroachment.Many of the boundaries economists and computer scientists developed in the second part of the 20th century for thinking about what machines could and couldn’t do have been crossed. For example, driving a car, making a medical diagnosis or identifying a bird from a fleeting glimpse. All these tasks can be accomplished by software now.And machines are often performing these tasks using strategies that are new to humans?
 We thought many of these tasks would be difficult to automate because humans couldn’t articulate how they performed them. They relied on experience, intuition and gut reaction – so how could you write a set of instructions for a computer to follow? But by using lots of data and computing power, machines are creating new strategies.In the light of this technological change, what career path would you advise a 16-year-old to follow? 
 Very crudely, I’d say, there are two strategies: either you learn to be good at the sorts of things these systems and machines cannot do or you try to build the machines.But forecasting which jobs and tasks will be automated is hard. Should people bother training to be doctors or lawyers when automation is already encroaching on these careers? 
 For young professionals, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, I say the best thing to do is pursue the traditional path. But be far more agnostic and open minded along the way about opportunities that come up. Because what’s interesting is that if you look at these technologies – take the systems developed by DeepMind or the ones that recognise melanomas by Sebastian Thrun’s team at Stanford – these teams contain lots of domain experts, such as trained doctors.Technological unemployment appears be growing alongside rising inequality – is there a direct relationship between the two? 
 Work is our traditional way of distributing income, so one of the great challenges of a world with less work is how we slice up the pie. The labour share of income is falling in many parts of the developed world.Should robots be taxed and that money funnelled back to the victims of automation? 
 There are various problems with this idea. What do we mean by a robot? A driverless car isn’t driven by an android. How do we do a robot headcount? We do need to tax capital, the owners – however that has a branding problem.But the owners of the these technologies are often quite good at avoiding tax. 
 If the trends in inequality continue, focusing on how we resolve that problem is going to become more pertinent.You advance the idea of a “conditional” universal basic income. 
 I think the challenge in a world with less work is how you maintain that sense of social solidarity. At the moment, that comes from a sense that everyone is paying into the collective economic pot through their taxes or, if they’re not in work, they are actively looking for work or training for work.I think one of the problems of a universal basic income [a payment made to the entire population regardless of employment status] is that too many people take offence at the idea that you give something and don’t expect anything in return.But perhaps we can introduce conditions to a UBI, for example that you undertake some valuable voluntary work in return. There are something like 15 million people doing a hugely valuable set of voluntary activities in the UK – why not recognise that? The UBI solves the distribution problem – how do you share income if the labour market doesn’t do it very well? – and if everyone is contributing, some in economic and others in non-economic ways, that may solve the we’re-all-in-it-together problem.The challenge in a world with less work is how you maintain that sense of social solidarityVolunteering requires empathy and hands-on skills that computers find hard and such activities are not rewarded very well. 
 There is a paradox. Machines can’t do them and they tend to be unpaid by the market. There’s this huge gap between the social value of a lot of this work and the value that’s recognised in the market. So one of the reasons for optimism is that there’s an opportunity to potentially address that.Work not only gives people income, but often gives meaning and identity. How can people get meaning from more leisure? 
 If we think the relationship between work and meaning is very tight, the alternative might be not to think of this as being about the future of work, but the future of leisure. You know, we have labour-market policies to shape how people live their working lives. Maybe we also need leisure policies to shape how people spend their spare time. We already have a pension system that is a heavily subsidised leisure policy of sorts.You’ve worked in government. Is automation a priority for politicians or are they reluctant to address things that may only pay off long after they have been voted out? 
 Almost every government in the developed world has published some kind of AI strategy in the last few years. Whether or not they’re then following that strategy is less clear.You have to explain that this is not a story about the future – this is happening now. Every day, we hear stories of these technologies, driving cars, making medical diagnoses, drafting legal documents, designing buildings – this is something that is happening now; it’s not in the future. It is closely linked to the inequalities we see emerging. It tends not to be acted upon because it’s thought to be something that doesn’t really matter, but it does.

One of the biggest trends at CES 2020 was Artificial Intelligence or AI. Advances in this type of technology have truly changed the way consumers use many devices in a relatively short period. And we’ve only just begun to discover the potential of what it can do. But what is AI exactly?


For those relatively unfamiliar with this technology, it can't be defined in the same way Bluetooth can be, for example. According to Dr. Mark van Rijmenam, who is the founder of Datafloq and author of The Organisation of Tomorrow, AI is an umbrella term that covers multiple disciplines. “When we look at artificial intelligence, it can be divided into three different domains,” he tells me. 

The first domain is robotics, which deals with the physical world and how it can directly interact with humans. “Robotics can be used to improve our work in various ways, including Ford’s exoskeleton or Boston Dynamics’ helping robots,” he says.

PROMOTED
The second discipline is cognitive systems, which concern the human world such as chatbots. “Chatbots are a very tangible example where humans and machines work together to achieve a goal. A chatbot is a communication interface that helps individuals and organizations have conversations,"" Dr. van Rijmenam explains.  

The third is machine learning, which connects how we get information. “Machines use data to learn, and machine learning aims to derive meaning from that data and uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve with machines. A subset of machine learning is deep learning, which enables multi-layer neural networks.""

AI seamlessly integrates these three types of learning. While smart technology was a hallmark of the previous decade, AI will take smart home products to an entirely new level in the 2020s, changing lives in a way that the average consumer may not even be able to imagine.

This type of innovation doesn't necessarily concern how users interact with products (such as with Google Home and Alexa) so much as how products interact with us. Advanced machine learning works “behind the scenes” in a way that goes beyond improved user experience. It has the potential to truly change lives and we the way complete daily tasks.

LG, which had one of the largest presences at CES, demonstrated how they are using this groundbreaking technology at the event, winning multiple awards for their innovations. 
Proactive Customer Service
Installing and maintaining new appliances can be a frustrating experience for many people. LG's proactive customer service uses artificial intelligence in smart appliance models for a variety of purposes. It starts after connecting an appliance to the brand’s ThinQ mobile app by letting the user know that installation has been properly completed.
AI can also notify users when problems occur—before they become worse. For example, it will sense errors such as a decrease in the cooling performance of a refrigerator or a reduction of airflow in a dryer vent. These are issues that humans may not notice on their own until it is too late, ultimately shortening the lifespan of the appliance.  
Depending on the issue, this technology can provide solutions like quick fixes consumers can make on their own or schedule an appointment with a service professional to expedite a repair. 
Another example of what LG's AI can do is send routine maintenance reminders like running a tub clean cycle every 30 washes or replacing a water filter in the refrigerator when needed. 
AI can also have a larger impact on the environment. For example, if it detects an increase in water consumption, it will share tips with the users about how to improve the efficiency of their machines. 
LG TurboWash 360 Washer and Dryer 
One of many LG products that stood out at CES is the LG TurboWash 360, which won the coveted 2020 Innovation Award. This appliance is one of the strongest examples of how artificial intelligence can change the way we complete tasks. 
The front-loading washing machine is designed to deliver precision washing without any human guesswork. Anyone who has overanalyzed the difference between laundry cycles (and still regretted it ten minutes into pressing the start button) will appreciate how game-changing this appliance is. 
Sensors detect the volume and weight of each unique load of laundry. Then they identify the fabric types in each load. Through the use of deep learning technology, the washer then compares this information against more than 20k different data points. It uses the information to select the optimal wash cycle for each load.
After detecting a mixed load of t-shirts and pants, for example, the wash cycle is then programmed with customized motions, temperatures and times. For a load containing towels and sheets, the washing machine would run an entirely different program. This goes way beyond the normal cycle choices such as delicate, heavy, casual, etc. 
How AI Can Save Cash And Help The Environment 
LG shares that this technology can extend the life of a garment by as much as 15%. This not only saves consumers money, but also reduces the impact of textile and garment waste on the environment. 
Another useful feature of this washing machine is that it automatically dispenses the proper amount of detergent and fabric softener for every single load. While this means the inconvenience of pouring liquid from a large, heavy bottle into a tiny cup is no longer a way of life, the advances of LG's artificial intelligence goes way beyond a minor annoyance of life. Many people do not realize that using the wrong amount of detergent decreases the life of fabrics and appliances because an extra or extended rinse cycle may be needed to get rid of all the suds. Those cycles can really add up over time.
So, the life cycles of both textiles and appliances can be extended through AI technology. Money is also saved on the cost of soap and the energy used to run unnecessary cycles on the washing machine. This ultimately means a long term win for sustainability and how consumer habits impact the environment.

One of the trends that came into sharp focus in 2019 was, ironically, a woeful lack of clarity around AI ethics. The AI field at large was paying attention to ethics, creating and applying frameworks for AI research, development, policy, and law, but there was no unified approach. The committees and groups, from every sort of organization related to AI, that sought to address AI ethics were coming up with their own definitions (or falling apart with nothing to show for their efforts). But working out ethics in AI is not just a feel-good endeavor — it’s critical to helping lawmakers create just policies and laws and guiding the work of scholars and researchers. It also helps businesses stay in compliance and avoid costly pitfalls, know where they should and should not invest their resources, and how to apply AI to their products and services. Which is to say, there’s a profound humanity to it all.
Even as the AI field continues to refine and work out ethics approaches, a report out of Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center sought to extract consensus, if not clarity: The work, titled “Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-Based Approaches to Principles for Ai,” is a meta analysis of numerous AI ethics frameworks and sets of principles. The authors wanted to distill the noise down to a set of generally agreed-upon AI ethics principles. (To oversimplify: It’s a sort of Venn diagram.)

Handling Today’s Threatscape at Machine Scale



The authors, led by Jessica Fjeld, who is the assistant director of the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center, laid out their approach in the document: “Alongside the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, we have witnessed a proliferation of ‘principles’ documents aimed at providing normative guidance regarding AI-based systems. Our desire for a way to compare these documents — and the individual principles they contain — side by side, to assess them and identify trends, and to uncover the hidden momentum in a fractured, global conversation around the future of AI, resulted in this white paper and the associated data visualization.”
They looked at 36 “prominent AI principles documents,” from global sources and a diversity of types of organizations, to find the common themes and values therein. They found eight key themes:

Privacy
Accountability
Safety and security
Transparency and explainability
Fairness and non-discrimination
Human control of technology
Professional responsibility
Promotion of human values
advertisement
Those are broad strokes, to be sure, and each begs for qualification. The authors do just that over the course of dozens of detailed and fascinating pages, and in brief, in Fjeld’s concise Twitter thread.
They also produced a large and detailed visualization — a map — of the themes they found, the frequency of the respective mentions of those themes, and the sources that the authors pulled from. In that map, you can see a further breakdown of the keywords under each of the eight themes.
For example, under “Promotion of Human Values” — a rather vague “key theme” — the map lists “leveraged to benefit society,” “human values and human flourishing,” and “access to technology.” That last one, especially, probably resonates with the average person, doesn’t it? And it’s a powerful point: The field of AI apparently believes that giving people access to this powerful new set of technologies is a human value, and moreover, a human value that is explicitly and widely laid out as a matter of documented principle.advertisement
Humanity was at the center of much of their findings, actually, especially with a prominent emphasis on international human rights. The paper reads, “64% of our documents contained a reference to human rights, and five documents [14%] took international human rights as a framework for their overall effort.”
Notably, the documents from civil society groups (four out of five) and private sector groups (seven out of eight) were most likely to reference human rights. That’s encouraging, because it indicates that private sector groups aren’t focused, at least on paper, exclusively on profits, but on the larger picture of AI and its impact. Less encouraging is that less than half of the documents from government agencies (six out of 13) references human rights. It appears that there’s advocacy work yet to be done at the government level.
Aside from the identification of those core eight themes, the authors noted that the documents they looked at that were most likely to hit not just some, but all eight, of those themes, were also likely to be more recent. That fact, they wrote, suggests “that the conversation around principled AI is beginning to converge, at least among the communities responsible for the development of these documents.”advertisement
The report is meant to be an examination of what already exists more than an articulation of any particular viewpoint, but the authors included a plea to those in AI who are charged with crafting and implementing AI ethics principles:
“Moreover, principles are a starting place for governance, not an end. On its own, a set of principles is unlikely to be more than gently persuasive. Its impact is likely to depend on how it is embedded in a larger governance ecosystem, including for instance relevant policies (e.g. AI national plans), laws, regulations, but also professional practices and everyday routines.”

Google CEO calls for regulatory approach to artificial intelligence

Google CEO Sundar Pichai wants international standards for artificial intelligence tech that consider an ethical approach on top of what various AI researchers are doing. (Google) 
Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently called for an international regulatory approach to artificial intelligence technology in an op-ed published in the Financial Times.“Now there is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated,” he wrote. “It is too important not to. The only question is how to approach it.”He said that government regulation should come in addition to ethical development principles within technology companies, citing Google’s own efforts that include conducting independent human-rights assessments of new products. Noting that the EU and the US are already starting to develop regulatory proposals, he called for international alignment of such regulations built upon an agreement on core values. “Companies such as ours cannot just build promising new technology and let market forces decide how it will be used,” he wrote. “It is equally incumbent on us to make sure that technology is harnessed for good and available to everyone.”Pichai also ticked off a few ethical concerns with AI that have been raised by others, including deepfakes and “nefarious uses of facial recognition.” While work is being done to address such concerns, he added, “there will inevitably be more challenges ahead that no company or industry can solve alone.”Tesla’s Elon Musk and other tech luminaries have been worrying publicly for years about unbridled AI and its negative consequences, but Pichai’s commentary takes the discussion to another level by calling for regulatory involvement. Pichai doesn’t describe any regulations specifically needed, but does mention that the European General Data Protection Regulation can serve as a strong foundation. He added that good regulations will consider safety, explainability, fairness and accountability. “Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach, balancing potential harms, especially in high-risk areas, with social opportunities,” Pichai wrote.Pichai’s commentary also gave him a chance to tout Google’s work in AI, including helping doctors spot breast cancer in mammograms with higher accuracy. That work was published in Nature on Jan. 1 and involved Google, Northwestern Medicine and two screening centers in the UK.That research team used mammograms along with follow-up exams to train a deep-learning AI model to identify breast cancer in screening images. The findings showed an absolute reduction in false negatives of up to 9% and a reduction in false positives of up to 5%. Similar studies have used AI training to spot lung cancers.In addition to deep-learning software, Google is one of several large technology companies building AI hardware at the chip level. In 2019, Google Cloud offered the ability to link together its Tensor Processing Unit chips with liquid cooling for faster performance in the training phase of AI systems.Other companies that are building AI chips or augmenting existing chips include Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple. Tesla is building Model S, X and 3 cars with its own AI processor for self-driving capabilities. AI inference work can happen in edge devices with some of these chips, but AI training usually involves massive systems found in cloud companies like Google, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft.Pichai's commentary comes at a time when U.S. lawmakers and federal authorities are scrutinizing the activities of major tech companies like Facebook and Youtube, especially for how their social engagement platforms shape public opinion. RELATED: Intel forges leading role in emerging AI revolution

It certainly is. Today, artificial intelligence offers a solution to solve or at least make the access-to-justice issue better and completely transform our traditional legal system. Here's what you need to know about how AI, big data, and online courts will change the legal system.
The Future of Lawyers: Legal Tech, AI, Big Data And Online CourtsAdobe Stock

The Future of Law

When I sat down in conversation with Richard Susskind, OBE, the world's most-cited author on the future of legal services, to discuss the future of law and lawyers, it became apparent just how much change the legal system will face over the next decade thanks to innovation brought about by artificial intelligence and big data.

In Richard’s book The Future of Law, published in 1996, he predicted that in the future, lawyers and clients would communicate via email. This revelation was shocking at the time, especially to those working in the legal system; however, transmitting communication via email is now commonplace for lawyers and their clients. This story gives insight into the challenges faced in bringing the traditionally conservative legal system into the 21st century.

PROMOTED
In his brand new book Online Courts and the Future of Justice, Richard argues that technology is going to bring about a fascinating decade of change in the legal sector and transform our court system. Although automating our old ways of working plays a part in this, even more, critical is that artificial intelligence and technology will help give more individuals access to justice.
Our current access-to-justice problem, even in what are typically thought of as mature systems, is significant. In fact, only about 46% of people have access to the legal system. There are unimaginable backlogs in some court systems. For most of us, litigation takes too much time and money. We can use technology to help with this issue and make court a service rather than a place as we move legal resolution online.

Some of the technologies that would allow this transition are quite basic.
The first generation is the idea that people who use the court system submit evidence and arguments to the judge online or through some form of electronic communication. Essentially judgments move from the courtroom to online. In a digital society, we should certainly be able to institute extended courts where we go beyond decisions made by judges to some kind of diagnostic system to guide people regarding their legal options, how to assemble evidence, and provide alternative ways for dispute resolution.

The second generation of using technology to transform the legal system would be what Richard calls “outcome thinking” to use technology to help solve disputes without requiring lawyers or the traditional court system. It is entirely conceivable within a relatively small number of years that we will have systems that can predict the outcomes of court decisions based on past decisions by using predictive analytics. Imagine if people had the option instead of waiting for a court date (and support from the traditional legal system) to use a machine-learning system to make a prediction about the likely outcome of a case and then accept that as a binding determination.

Some of the biggest obstacles to an online court system are the political will to bring about such a transformation, the support of judges and lawyers, funding, as well as the method we’d apply. For example, decisions will need to be made whether the online system would be used for only certain cases or situations.
Ultimately, we have a grave access-to-justice problem. Technology can help improve our outcomes and give people a way to resolve public disputes in ways that previously weren’t possible. While this transformation might not solve all the struggles with the legal system or the access-to-justice issue, it can offer a dramatic improvement.
The Future of Lawyers
So far, the emphasis on technology in the legal system has been to support lawyers and their staff in some of the work they do, such as email, accounting systems, word processing, and more. Now, we're beginning to see the merits of using technology to automate some tasks such as document analysis or document drafting—essentially moving from the back office to the front office.
One of our biggest struggles in the future of the law profession is law schools because they’re still generating 20th-century lawyers when what we need is 21st-century lawyers to meet the demand of companies and individuals who want a lower-cost legal option that is conveniently available and delivered electronically.
Some legal work can now be done by machines when in the past, this was unthinkable. Large disputes often have a huge number of documents to analyze. Typically, armies of young lawyers and paralegals are put to work to review these documents. A properly trained machine can take over this work. Document drafting by machines is also gaining traction. We also see systems that can predict the outcome of disputes. We're beginning to see machines take on many tasks that we used to think were the exclusive role of lawyers.
Tomorrow's lawyers will be the people who develop the systems that will solve clients' problems. These legal professionals will be legal knowledge engineers, legal risk managers, system development, experts in design thinking, and more. These people will develop new ways of solving legal problems with the support of technology. In many ways, the legal sector is undergoing the digitization that other industries have gone through, and because it's very document-intensive, it's actually an industry poised to benefit greatly from what technology can offer.
Richard believes that in the next decade, machines and lawyers will work alongside each other as well as some jobs being taken over by machines. Eventually, he believes that the legal system and, therefore, a lawyer's job will change because technology is allowing us the ability to solve problems in a new way. For example, in the future, he expects there will be far fewer cases tried in a traditional court, and therefore there will be less need for lawyers who advocate on behalf of clients in a courtroom. Lawyers have a choice to either compete with these systems or help build them. Richard certainly counsels the latter.

Fri, 17 Jan, 2020 - 00:00    Chess teams that pair humans with machines beat humans alone and beat unaccompanied machines. The lesson is that workers should not fear being replaced by technology, says Xavier Litt.While Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg hails artificial intelligence’s “potential to make the world better”, many others are far more cautious.Tesla boss Elon Musk has warned against machines taking over the world. Reluctance to technical progress is not a new phenomenon.In 19th century Britain, the Luddites, worried about being replaced by technology, sought to destroy textile machinery.The fear persists, all the more since AI is improving by the day, including at tasks previously thought of as exclusive to human intelligence.

In 1997, the IBM computer Deep Blue spectacularly defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov for the first time.Many commentators were shocked by the prowess of AI in a strategy game often referred to as the ‘king of games’.AI has moved beyond being a super calculator and most advanced machines will be prominent in strategic thinking and creativity.While many people worry about being overtakenby some form of Skynet, the artificial intelligence defence system from the Terminator film franchise, the last 20 years of computer usage in the game of chess actually suggests the future could be a lot more positive.Chess was one of the first areas tackled by AI, making it an interesting case study. In hindsight, AI brought chess and its human players to previously unattainable heights.Advanced chess computers helped humans improve their own skills. Nowadays, top chess players spend most of their time analysing the game via computers.AI can be used to re-evaluate positions that were previously misunderstood or to rule out moves that are inefficient and focus, instead, on more promising game plans.This evolution occurred despite critics lamenting the end of chess when the machines first defeated man in 1997.Though it was feared at the time, chess players have not given up on the game.

They trained harder and became stronger than players of the past. Rather than competing against AI, chess players utilised it.The benefit of teaming up with AI is illustrated by a new game mode, cyborg chess.It is named after the cybernetic organism, an entity with both organic and mechanical body parts.As in a typical chess match, the human players face each other across a chessboard, but in cyborg chess they also each have a computer, running chess engines.While AI is superior to the human brain in a one-to-one chess contest, human players still contribute to the team.Humans may let the machines make most of the calculations, but, ultimately, they have their own understanding of the game.In some situations, human players make better decisions than machines, and successful cyborg chess players know when they can let the machine decide on the move to play, and when they shouldn’t.Hence, the best cyborg chess team is higher ranked than the best chess engine. This means that the association of human intelligence and AI outperforms stand-alone AI.Another crucial teaching of cyborg chess is that there is a specific skill set for collaboration with AI.The ability to work efficiently with AI matters more for cyborg chess players than their standalone strength in chess. Several cyborg chess competitions were not won by the strongest attending chess players.For instance, in the PAL/CSS Freestyle Tournament in 2005, three chess grandmasters could notdefeat the team Zacks, comprised of two average club players using less powerful AI than the grandmasters.

However, the latter were extremely well-prepared. They had trained extensively with several chess engines and had selected the one they understood the most.In a one-to-one game againsta grandmaster, these two amateurs would have less than 1% chance of winning.Hence, this stunning performance suggests that although mastering chess is a valuable skill for cyborg chess, it is not the main skill.Instead, fruitful collaboration with AI is the key skill.This example teaches us that humans and machines have complementary capabilities.Machines supervised by humans are often capable of doing more than machines or humans on their own.This is becoming common in many fields: plane pilots assisted with auto-pilot programmes, computer-assisted surgeons for complex surgeries, and many others.AI will increasingly be used in the near future and automated tasks will bring forth new jobs.A recent study of the Institute for the Future and Dell Technologies states that 85% of jobs that will be occupied in 2030 do not exist yet; just as countless jobs that exist today were unimaginable 20 years ago.These new jobs will most certainly revolve around this specific human-machine collaboration skill.Since machines first defeated humans 20 years ago, the evolution of chess suggests that AI need not be feared; it can be embraced and pave the way for continuous improvement in all fields.The key is to switch from competition to collaboration with AI. Businesses should neither turn away from AI nor simply replace employees with machines.Success will come from creating adapted teams of men and machines working together.We humans should primarily focus on improving our understanding of AI by honing our human-machine collaboration skills.Xavier Litt is chief executive of Skylads, an AI-driven, digital marketing research lab and technology provider

By Jyothi NayakTo err is human &ndash; but just how true is this in the case of subtitling and captioning?Recently a friend of mine asked me why we don&rsquo;t use automatic subtitling tools. Little did she know how excited I was when I heard about these tools a couple of years ago! After all, wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to get machines to do all the hard work while we humans multi-task? Let&rsquo;s take a step back and use a real-life scenario to analyze this. Platforms like YouTube have for long offered automatic captions for videos, but they are notorious for delivering sentences studded with nonsensical or occasionally obscene phrases. For hearing impaired viewers, however, this is no laughing matter, as they often depend on subtitles to decipher spoken words within a video. To address this issue, social media campaigns like #NoMoreCRAPtions have emerged which focus on ditching automatic captions.This article is all about how subtitling is becoming increasingly relevant today, why it&rsquo;s imperative, and what role technology can play in the evolving industry landscape. A recent study in the UK showed that more than 63% of Gen Z, who are digital natives, end up using subtitles as it not only helps them watch content on-the-move, but also aids in better comprehension. Jyothi Nayak

Subtitles have indeed come a long way since they first made an appearance during the silent film era. Subtitling is no longer only for viewers to enjoy foreign language content, or for hearing impaired audiences. They are also becoming extremely useful when showcasing content (like ads, showreels etc.) in public places where the audio is muted. Recent experiments in India and a few other developing countries have proved that Same Language Subtitles (SLS) have improved reading literacy. SLS causes automatic, inescapable reading engagement even among weak readers, and over a period of time has a bigger impact than conventional print media. Even developed countries plan to make SLS a default option for children&rsquo;s content, in order to help young viewers develop reading skills in their early years. As the boom in the subtitling industry fuels new business opportunities, large volumes and tight deadlines are making content creators look towards AI-based solutions. Like most other industries, AI has penetrated the translation and localization space and unlocked exciting possibilities. Today, there are several AI-based solutions that not only understand spoken words and convert them to text, but also translate them to a target language. But the million-dollar question is &ndash; are these machine-generated results as good as human translation? No, not yet! While AI can assist in the overall process of subtitling, actual translation by humans is far more impactful for local audiences, as such translation is creatively generated by native speakers of that language. AI tools, in my view, still have several limitations. When working on genres like mythology or content with considerable background noise, heavy accents and high context content (like sarcasm or humor), the use of AI tools becomes challenging and the results are hard to work with. Within text translations as well, complex sentences can result in gibberish. For example, when translating from Hindi to English, an experienced translator would translate the reference of romantic Indian duo &lsquo;Laila Majnu&rsquo; to &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; &ndash; something a machine would be able to do only after considerable learning. Creativity plays an intrinsic part in translating content and generating impactful subtitles. When it comes to subtitling, the context is as important as the content. While words like mom/mother can be used interchangeably, the usage of mother is more appropriate in the context of a religious mention, which the machine will not be able to decipher automatically. Similarly, there are many common idioms and culture sensitive languages (Arabic for instance) which, when translated literally, yield hilarious and sometimes offensive results! AI tools tend to struggle with unclear contexts, new slangs and specialized subjects that require a lot of research. So, does it mean the world of subtitling will remain human-driven even with the advent of AI? It certainly will not, as machines start learning the nuances and growing intelligence. There are many areas where automation can help reduce manual effort and increase speed right away. Examples include time-code shifting, workflows for Quality Check (QC) and auto check for compliance issues (usage of restricted words etc.) which can creep in through human errors. The good news is that there&rsquo;s no need to follow an &lsquo;all-or-nothing&rsquo; approach. You can choose a hybrid workflow where machine transcription takes place first, and QC is performed on this output by native translators, who correct all mistakes (and don&rsquo;t just laugh at them!). These corrections should ideally be fed back to the machine, so that it continues learning and eventually generates better quality subtitles. It also helps to use advanced, end-to-end AI tools that not only create transcripts, but also sync these to the prescribed number of words per second/minute, as well as to the shot boundary. Such tools deliver subtitles that are far more accurate. Another factor to consider is that since most off-the-shelf subtitling tools have several limitations, vendors who deal in large volumes can look at building their own machine learning tools that are trained with past data to fit a particular genre/style of subtitling. This can help you generate high quality results, suited to your specific needs. Alternately, you could even consider using specialized AI tools which go a step further by using the output of multiple best-in-class engines and smartly extract the best from all of these to deliver better results.As you can see, there is a lot of potential for automating the subtitling process, it&rsquo;s just not completely foolproof yet! For now, leveraging an optimal mix of human talent and cutting-edge technology seems to be the best answer. AI-led automation augmented with the creativity of native speakers is the best way to meet the need for speed and volume that the subtitling industry demands today. Getting this blend right is the key for delivering multi-platform, multi-language content to worldwide audiences and increasing global market share. -The author is SVP &ndash; global localization, Prime Focus Technologies.

Even Artificial Intelligence has not been able to escape the inevitable reduction that follows such excessive hype. AI is everything and everywhere now and most of us won’t even blink if we are told AI is powering someone’s toothbrush. (It probably is).&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The phrase is undoubtedly being misused but is the technology too? One thing is certain, whether we like it or not, whether we understand it or not, for good or bad, AI is playing a huge part in our everyday life today — huger than we imagine. AI is being employed in health, wellness and warfare; it is scrutinizing you, helping you take better photos, making music, books and even love. (No, really. The first fully robotic sex doll is being created even as you are reading this.)&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;However, there is a sore lack of understanding of what AI really is, how it is shaping our future and why it is likely to alter our very psyche sooner or later. There is misinformation galore, of course. Either media coverage of AI is exaggerated (as if androids will take over the world tomorrow) or too specific and technical, creating further confusion and fuelling sci-fi-inspired imaginations of computers smarter than human beings.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;So what is AI? No, we are not talking dictionary definitions here — those you can Google yourself. Neither are we promising to explain everything — that will need a book. We are only hoping to give you a glimpse into the “extraordinary promise and peril of this single transformative technology” as Prof Stuart Russell, one of the world’s pre-eminent AI experts, puts it.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Prof Russell has spent decades on AI research and is the author of ‘Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach’, which is used as a textbook on AI in over 1,400 universities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p class=""CrossHead""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Other experts believe our understanding of artificial intelligence should begin with comprehending ‘machine learning’, the so-called sub-field of AI but one that actually encompasses pretty much everything that is happening in AI at present.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In its very simplest definition, machine learning is enabling machines to learn on their own. The advantages of this are easy to see. After a while, you need not tell it what to do — it is your workhorse. All you need is to provide it data and it will keep coming up with smarter ways of digesting that data, spotting patterns, creating opportunities — in short doing your work better than you perhaps ever could. This is the point where you need to scratch the surface. Scratch and you will stare into a dissolving ethical conundrum about what machines might end up learning. Because, remember they do not (cannot) explain their thinking process. Not yet, at least.  Precisely why, the professor has a cautionary take.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;“The concept of intelligence is central to who we are. After more than 2,000 years of self-examination, we have arrived at a characterization of intelligence that can be boiled down to this: ‘&lt;em&gt;Humans are intelligent to the extent that our actions can be expected to achieve our objectives&lt;/em&gt;’. Intelligence in machines has been defined in the same way: ‘&lt;em&gt;Machines are intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve their objectives&lt;/em&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p class=""CrossHead""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whose objectives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The problem, writes the professor, is in this very definition of machine intelligence. “We say that machines are intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve their objectives, but we have no reliable way to make sure that &lt;span class=""italic""&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; objectives are the same as &lt;span class=""italic""&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; objectives.” He believes what we should have done all along is to tweak this definition to: ‘Machines are beneficial to the extent that &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""italic""&gt;their&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; actions can be expected to achieve &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""italic""&gt;our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; objectives.’”&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The difficulty here is of course that our objectives are in us — all eight billion of us — and not in the machines. “Machines will be uncertain about our objectives; after all we are uncertain about them ourselves — but this is a good thing; this is a feature, not a bug. Uncertainty about objectives implies that machines will necessarily defer to humans — they will ask permission, they will accept correction and they will allow themselves to be switched off.”&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p class=""CrossHead""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spilling out of the lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;This might mean a complete rethinking and rebuilding of the AI superstructure. Perhaps something that indeed is inevitable if we do not want this “big event in human history” to be the last, says the prof wryly. As Kai-Fu Lee, another AI researcher, said in an interview a while ago, we are at a moment where the technology is “spilling out of the lab and into the world.” Time to strap up then!&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""italic""&gt;(With inputs from ‘Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control’ by Stuart Russell, published by Penguin, UK.
