The computer can compare activity data with qualitative assessments of workers from personnel files or sales performance figures to give managers a detailed picture of how behaviour affects output.Users so far include five law firms, a training company called Smarter Not Harder and a London estate agency, JBrown, according to Status Today, which promises “real-time insights into each employee and their position within the organisational network”. Workers do not automatically have a right to see the data, which is controlled by the employer.The insurer Hiscox and the IT firm Cisco have used the system for short-term analysis rather than continuous surveillance, Status Today said.Rise of robots ‘could see workers enjoy four-day weeks’Read moreCritics say such systems risk increasing pressure on workers who fear the judgment of the algorithm, and that it could encourage people not to take breaks or spend time in creative thought that will not be logged.“If performance targets are being fine-tuned by AI and your progress towards them being measured by AI, that will only multiply the pressure,” said Ursula Huws, a professor of labour and globalisation at the University of Hertfordshire. “People are deemed not to be working if they take their hands off the keyboard for five minutes. But they could be thinking, and that doesn’t get measured. What is this doing for innovation, which needs creative workers?”She said there were risks to mental health if people did not feel free to take breaks, for example to surf social media for a few minutes or play a game. A survey released this week suggests UK workers tend to procrastinate for on average three hours a day.The Isaak system has already gathered data on more than 1bn actions, which it uses to pinpoint “central individuals within a network” to better allocate workload and responsibilities, “ultimately improving the overall workplace environment and reducing stress and overworking”.It is part of what experts have labelled the “precision economy”, in which more and more aspects of life will be measured. The Royal Society of Arts predicts that in the next 15 years, life insurance premiums will be set with data from wearable monitors and workers in retail and hospitality will be tracked for time spent inactive. As gig economy working spreads, people will qualify for the best jobs only with performance and empathy metrics that pass a high threshold. Those with lower scores will have access to only the most menial and sometimes miserable tasks such as content moderation on social media, the RSA has predicted.Ankur Modi, the chief executive of Status Today, said his system aimed to provide a “wellbeing analysis” and could detect overwork – for example at evenings and weekends. But he admitted: “there’s always a risk that it might be misused”. He agreed it was a legitimate concern that companies could use it only to boost productivity, without focusing on wellbeing.“If one salesperson is performing well and you can see overwork and another isn’t performing well and isn’t overworked, that could be enough to start a conversation,” he said.However, he argued that it could help bosses cut out bias and discrimination by removing subjectivity from management decisions.How Taylor Swift showed us the scary future of facial recognitionRead moreAI ideas that are being developed elsewhere have included the use of facial recognition software and mood monitoring at work, recording a worker’s location on wearable devices and the monitoring of keyboard strokes. A survey by the Trades Union Congress last year found that a majority of workers were opposed to all of these.The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Workers want to be trusted to do their jobs. But this kind of high-tech snooping creates fear and distrust. And by undermining morale, it could do businesses more harm than good. Employers should only introduce surveillance technologies after negotiation and agreement with the workforce, including union representatives. There should always be a workplace agreement in place that clarifies where the line is drawn for legitimate use, and that protects the privacy of working people.”Explore more on these topicsProductivityArtificial intelligence (AI)Work & careersnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

Ginni Rometty is CEO, president and chairman of IBM. She has held the top job since 2012.
When she joined the company in 1981, total headcount across IBM was roughly 350,000. By 1994, under the direction of CEO Lou Gerstner, headcount dropped to around 225,000.

When she took over as CEO from Sam Palmisano—who had enjoyed a ten-year run as IBM’s top dog—the global employee population at the company had swollen to nearly 450,000 people. Some of it was organic. A lot of it was by acquisition.
Today and under Rometty’s leadership, IBM headcount has dropped approximately 25%. There are now less than 350,000 people. How? In part, artificial intelligence.
Rometty recently spoke at a CNBC event titled “@WORK TALENT + HR: Building the workforce of the future.” It’s her comments that got me thinking about the impact that artificial intelligence is going to have on an organization’s HR strategy and employee population.
PROMOTED
First, Rometty indicated that 100% of all jobs will be impacted by artificial intelligence.
I agree. Every role in the corporate hierarchy will in one way, shape or form be affected by the introduction of AI over time. She went on to say that job losses as a result of AI is a “red herring” and that we really shouldn’t “follow that logic all over the place.”

Not so fast.
There are millions of people in need of retraining and reskilling as a result of AI. If they aren’t at least partially taken care of by the organization, society will be overrun by people wondering what happened to them. It will become a zombie-like apocalypse of people wandering the streets looking for work.
In Rometty’s defense, she pointed out to audience members that organization’s ought to be considering three tactics to help with the transition to AI:

Retrain current employees;
Embrace people with less than a four-year degree;
Reskilling employees by apprenticeships.

Somewhat ironically, however, Rometty indicated that skills were going to become the lifeline of an employee’s relevancy. “If you have a skill that is not needed for the future and is abundant in the market and does not fit a strategy my company needs, you are not in a good square to stay inside of,"" Rometty said. ""I really believe in being transparent about where skills are.""
Again, transparency is one thing but helping employees with their transition under the shadow of AI, in my opinion, has got to be one of the organization’s top strategies going forward.
By example, IBM has reduced its global HR workforce by 30% through the introduction of AI into the company. But did it do anything to help those who were packaged out to learn a new skill?
Perhaps it did and those HR employees simply decided to leave. After all, Rometty suggested that  transparency is key to IBM’s workforce planning and skills gap. She also said that the AI that’s in place “infers” through the analysis of data, networks, relationships, skills, rankings and education what jobs are possible for internal candidates.
Maybe Watson felt those HR employees at IBM just didn’t have it in them to take on a new role.
That being stated, Rometty’s love for HR and the potential benefits of AI is demonstrable.
She alluded to other traditional HR systems being uprooted by AI for the better. MYCA—IBM’s internal career platform called My Career Advisor—no longer acts as a self serve system; instead the AI proactively recommends jobs to you based on skills, tenure, project work, rankings, and so on.
The company’s learning management system has become the “Netflix of Learning,” again proactively recommending courses and skill upgrades based on your progress at the company.
In an apparent knock to the antiquated way that HR organizes itself, Rometty believes that HR has got to become employee centric. “We have to do things for employees not to employees,” she said. She wants to see co-creation become a large part of its culture.
She wants companies to move away from centres of excellence to solution centres. Perhaps we should be thinking about pop-up solution shops. Using agile skills and collaborative team processes, these pop-up solution outfits allows her teams to come together for specific HR-related issues rather than the centre of excellence model.
Rometty rightly believes HR should be the role model for agile, AI, design thinking, net promoter score, and putting skills at the center of the organization. She believes it is an underutilized department. No complaints from me on that point.
IBM’s talent strategy also involves the proactive retention of people. Its HR AI system accurately predicts 95% of the time if people might want to leave the company. “It has saved the company over $300 million,” said Rometty, specifically due to proactive retention practices. It’s the artificial intelligence that tipped off IBM executives to take action—be it adding more compensation, skill development or a job change—before the employee might have left.
According to Rometty, this new way of operating at IBM has delivered a 20% bump in employee engagement scores across the company.
It’s still not clear how the changes in HR AI helped those folks in HR itself who lost their jobs due to AI. Irony aside, on the whole, I agree with Rometty.
Artificial intelligence is a must for any HR team if it wants to survive not only the pending talent war but its long-term existence, too. The big question is whether it will put that technology to good use to assist all employees, or will it simply be used to trim costs and total headcount numbers.

AI, or artificial intelligence, is huge right now. “Unsolvable” problems are being solved, billions of dollars are being invested, and Microsoft even hired Common to tell you how great its AI is with spoken word poetry. Yikes.
As with any new technology, it can be hard to cut through the hype. I spent years doing research in robotics and UAVs and “AI,” but even I’ve had a hard time keeping up. In recent years I've spent a lot of time learning to answer even some of the most basic questions like:AdChoicesADVERTISING

What are people talking about when they say AI?
What’s the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning?
What’s so great about deep learning?
What kind of formerly hard problems are now easily solvable, and what’s still hard?

I know I’m not alone in wondering these things. So if you’ve been wondering what the AI excitement is all about at the most basic level, it's time for a little peek behind the curtain. If you’re an AI expert who reads NIPS papers for fun, there won’t be much new for you here—but we all look forward to your clarifications and corrections in the comments.
What is AI?
There’s an old joke in computer science that goes like this: what’s the difference between AI and automation? Well, automation is what we can do with computers, and AI is what we wish we could do. As soon as we figure out how to do something, it stops being AI and starts being automation.
That joke exists because, even today, AI isn’t well defined—artificial intelligence simply isn’t a technical term. If you were to look it up on Wikipedia, AI is “intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.” That's about as vague as you can get.
Generally, there are two kinds of AI: strong AI and weak AI. Strong AI is what most people might be thinking of when they hear AI—some god-like omniscient intelligence like Skynet or Hal 9000 that's capable of general reasoning and human-like intelligence while surpassing human capabilities.
Weak AIs are highly specialized algorithms designed to answer specific, useful questions in narrowly defined problem domains. A really good chess-playing program, for example, fits this category. The same goes for software that’s really accurate in adjusting insurance premiums. These AI setups are impressive in their own way but very limited overall. Further ReadingDeepMind AI needs mere 4 hours of self-training to become a chess overlord
Hollywood aside, today we aren’t anywhere close to strong AI. Right now, all AI is weak AI, and most researchers in the field agree that the techniques we’ve come up with to make really great weak AIs probably won’t get us to Strong AI.
So AI currently represents more of a marketing term than a technical one. The reason companies are touting their “AIs” as opposed to “automation” is because they want to invoke the image of the Hollywood AIs in the public’s mind. But... that's not completely wrong. If we're being gracious, companies may simply be trying to say that, even though we’re nowhere near strong AI, the weak AIs of today are considerably more capable than those of only a few years ago. Ars VideoHow Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror
Any marketing instincts aside, that’s actually true. In certain areas, in fact, there has been a steep change in capability in machines, and that’s largely because of the two other buzzwords you hear a lot: machine learning and deep learning.

Machine learning
Machine learning is a particular way of creating machine intelligence. Let’s say you wanted to launch a rocket and predict where it will go. This is, in the grand scheme of things, not that hard: gravity is pretty well understood and you can write down the equations and work out where it will go based on a few variables like speed and starting position.
But this gets unwieldy when you’re looking at something where the rules aren’t as clear and well-known. Say you want a computer to look at pictures and you want to know if any of them shows a picture of a cat. How do you write down rules to describe what every possible combination of whiskers and cat ears looks like from every possible angle?Further Reading“OK Facebook”—Why stop at assistants? Facebook has grander ambitions for modern AI
The machine learning approach is well-known by now: instead of trying to write down the rules, you build a system that can figure out its own set of internalized rules after being shown a lot of examples. Instead of trying to describe cats, you would just show your AI a lot of pictures of cats and let it figure out what is and is not a cat.
This is perfect for our present world. A system that learns its own rules from data can be improved by more data. And if there’s one thing we’ve gotten really good at as a species, it’s generating, storing, and managing a lot of data. Want to be better at recognizing cats? The Internet is generating millions of examples as we speak.
The ever-increasing tide of data is one part of why machine learning algorithms have been blowing up. The other part has to do with how to use the data.
With machine learning, besides the data there are two other, related questions:

How do I remember what I’ve learned? On a computer, how do I store and represent the relationships and rules I’ve extracted from the example data?
How do I do the learning? How do I modify the representation I’ve stored in response to new examples and get better?

In other words, what’s the thing that’s actually doing the learning from all this data?
In machine learning, the computational representation of the learning that you store is called the model. The kind of model you use has huge effects: it determines how your AI learns, what kind of data it can learn from, and what kind of questions you can ask of it.
Let’s take a look at a really simple example to see what I mean. Say we’re shopping for figs at the grocery store, and we want to make a machine learning AI that tells us when they’re ripe. This should be pretty easy, because with figs it’s basically the softer they are, the sweeter they are. 
We could choose some samples of ripe and unripe fruits, see how sweet they are, then put them on a graph and fit a line. This line is our model.








                    Our baby AI, in line form. “The softer it is, the sweeter it is...""                  


                                          Haomiao Huang                                      









                    Things quickly get more complicated when you add extra data, though.                  


                                          Haomiao Huang                                      



Previous SlideNext Slide

Look at that! The line implicitly captures the idea of “the softer it is, the sweeter it is” without us having to write it down. Our baby AI doesn’t know anything about sugar content or how fruits ripen, but it can predict how sweet a fruit will be by squeezing it.
How do we train our model to make it better? We can collect some more samples and do another line fit to get more accurate predictions (as we did in the second image above).
Problems become immediately evident. We’ve been training our fig AI on nice grocery store figs so far, but what happens if we dump it in a fig orchard? All of a sudden, not only is there ripe fruit, there’s also rotten fruit. They’re super soft, but they’re definitely not good to eat.
What do we do? Well, it’s a machine learning model, so we can just feed it new data, right?
As the first image below shows, in this case we’d get a completely nonsense result. A line simply isn’t a good way to capture what happens when fruit gets too ripe. Our model no longer fits the underlying structure of the data.
Instead, we have to make a change and use a better, more complex model—maybe a parabola or something similar is a good fit. That tweak causes training to get more complicated, because fitting these curves requires more complicated math than fitting a line.








                    OK, maybe a line wasn't such a good idea for complex AI...

This is a pretty silly example, but it shows you how the kind of model you choose determines the learning you can do. With figs, the data is simple so your models can be simple. But if you’re trying to learn something more complex, you need more complex models. Just as no amount of data would let the line-fit model capture how rotten fruit behaves, there’s no way to do a simple curve that fits to a pile of images and get a computer vision algorithm.
The challenge of machine learning, then, is in creating and choosing the right models for the right problems. We need a model that is sophisticated enough to capture really complicated relationships and structure but simple enough that we work with it and train it. So even though the Internet, smartphones, and so on have made tremendous amounts of data available to train on, we still need the right models to take advantage of this data.
And that's precisely where deep learning comes in.

Over the next decade up to 40% of jobs could be replaced by automation. That’s according to a forecast from the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. 



Risk of job automation by country. In New Zealand, for instance,
the median worker has 39% chance of their job being automated.
OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Paper No. 202


Other estimates are less dire. A report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says only 14% of jobs across its member nations are “highly automatable”, though another 32% are likely to change significantly.
Despite this uncertainty about the exact number of human jobs that will disappear, it is certain the impacts of automation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) are potentially profound. 
If the new jobs that emerge as a result are fewer and less rewarding than those lost, we face a period of social dislocation. 
Yet there is little evidence of any strategic planning and forward thinking by Australia’s federal and state governments to minimise the potential downside. The recent federal budget, for example, was silent on this issue. 
It is analogous to the lack of a strategic plan on climate change.

Our concern about the policy vacuum is based on an extensive search on government websites, the media and budget speeches, which disturbingly yielded very little. 
We think AI should be an election issue, because there is virtually no job that won’t be affected by AI-driven automation. Being ready for this technological and social revolution should be at the heart of any government’s economic and educational reform agenda. 
Workers that never rest
The activities at which AI is expected to outperform humans by 2030 include translating languages, writing high-school essays and driving trucks. By mid-century it is expected AI could be capable of writing a bestselling books or performing surgery. 
Researchers believe there is a 50% chance AI will outperform humans in all tasks in 45 years and that almost all current human jobs can be automated in 120 years.

The World Economic Forum may argue that AI and automation “is about empowering people, not the rise of the machines” but there are good reasons to think some people will lose out.

      Careful how you treat today's AI: it might take revenge in the future




Machines have many attractions to employers. They do not need rest, holidays or take sick leave. They will never complain about overtime or join a union. 
A report published last month by management consultancy McKinsey Australia suggests, if proactive measures are not taken, the unemployment rate could increase by 2.5 percentage points, based on up to 46% of jobs being automated by 2030.




The industries likely to experience the greatest disruption are retail, administration and government, health and social assistance, construction, manufacturing, and accommodation and food services.
Australia Statistics, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), ONED, BLS, Oxford Economics



Inequality will also increase, the report says. To what extent depends on “how much Australia steps up its efforts to retrain and redeploy its surplus service, administrative and manual workers”. Without large-scale retraining, Australia’s Gini coefficient (the standard measure of income inequality) could increase from 0.32 to 0.41.
Questions for policymakers
The stakes are high. Employment is so much more than just an income. A decent job provides purpose and dignity. It enables security, health and well-being. Joblessness hurts the individual, families and the wider community. If fewer people have work, and more people get paid less, the federal government will have to contend with falling income-tax revenue and rising welfare spending.
With intensifying global competition and rapid technological change, all governments need to be strategic. They need long-term policies to help business and workers gain the knowledge, skills and abilities needed to seize the opportunities and mitigate the threats.

      Artificial intelligence can now emulate human behaviors – soon it will be dangerously good




There are three key questions for policy makers: 

To what extent will AI-driven automation increase unemployment and underemployment?
How can governments and employers take advantage of AI and create the jobs of the future? 
How can government, employers and educators equip employees and graduates with the skills to have jobs alongside robots, instead of competing with them? 

The growth in AI and machine learning need not pose a threat to jobs and our standard of living, but without a strategic and shared effort, we will repeat the mistakes of previous technological revolutions, which imposed a terrible price on some in the name of progress.

The authors of this article are working towards a book, The Fourth Industrial Revolution: Implications for Managers in the Asia Pacific, due to be published in September. It will include chapters from colleagues in Taiwan, China, India, Mauritius, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. For the Australian chapter we need more information from leaders and managers in industry about the impact of AI and the preparation and planning that is, or is not, occurring. We invite you to complete a short survey as part of this study. You can do so confidentially here.

Writer Tara Calishain shares tips and tools so you can learn to do cool stuff with technology.
Headlines about artificial intelligence are almost uniformly grim: it’s the worst thing ever, the robots are coming, they’re taking our jobs, Daleks will rule the earth. Behind the headlines, though, things are a bit more prosaic: AI has a long road ahead of it. While it’s good at some things, it’s awful at others, and I don’t take seriously any robots that have to levitate to get up stairs (sorry, Daleks).
If you want to get a sample of what AI can do right now, take a look at photo apps on the web. Editing photos is often daunting, but web apps make it easy. If you can upload a photo, you can use a web app to colorize it, remove the background, and more!

These tools can’t take the place of a full-fledged photo editor like GIMP or Photoshop, or even a heavy-duty web app like PicMonkey. On the other hand, they’re free, and there’s no learning curve. If you’re interested in editing photos but don’t know how to get started, these apps can help you dip your toe in the water and get a sense of the possibilities.
Munsie. (Tara Calishain)
For comparison I’ll be using this photo of my great-great-grandmother, Munsie, and showing you what four different sites can do to enhance this picture.
Colorize It
Colorizing photos is equally an art and a skill, and an AI-based app is not going to come close to the ability of a human colorist. At the same time, not everyone has the time or the ability to learn to colorize. These apps won’t be perfect, but you’ll be surprised how good they are. Note also that not all coloring apps are equal. The two I’m going to show you here will give you very different results. Pick the one you like best or try a lot of different photos for comparison.
Algorithmia
Colorize with Algorithmia. (Tara Calishain)
With Algorithmia, you can upload a picture or choose one from the web. The instant you do, Algorithmia will start colorizing it and provide you with a comparison image. You can download that or download the fully-colorized photo. Here’s a comparison of Munsie.
As you can see, the image is almost sepia-toned except for the red in the jacket. I suspect it’s because this picture was taken outside in full sunlight and the image is accounting for the glare.
Colourise.sg
Colourise treats the image quite differently. This app was developed by GovTech Singapore, and the images it used to train its AI to color photos was completely different, which shows up in how it colors the picture of Munsie:
Colourise. (Tara Calishain)
As you can see, Colourise went more for a green tint than red. I like this better because of the enhanced difference between Munsie’s skin and the wall behind her. Furthermore, her hair looks more natural, and not like there’s been a sheen of color applied to it. All photos are different, though, and I wouldn’t settle on using Colourise exclusively based on the processing of one image.
Take Out the Background with Remove.bg
I’m willing to bet that you have a picture of someone where you’d like to remove the background. Whether it’s because you want to get rid of somebody behind you or because the setting isn’t flattering, removing background images can be so useful but at the same time so difficult. But not with Remove.bg. Try this tool with a photo and you will feel like a wizard. In just a few seconds you’ll get a clean image with no or very little background.
There are a couple of caveats to be aware of: Remove.bg works best for single individuals, and it only works on humans (can’t take the background out of your dog picture!). All you have to do is upload your photo. Here’s the picture of Munsie with the background removed:
Remove.bg. (Tara Calishain)
It’s almost perfect in only seconds. The only thing Remove.bg missed is the arm beside Munsie (probably because the arm and her jacket are so close together) and a bit of shadow.
Remove.bg does offer the option of editing the image further before downloading it, but I found the tools a little awkward. If you’d be comfortable using that, you’d probably be more comfortable using GIMP or Photoshop, which would give you more options for cleaning up the image. (To be honest I’d probably just crop the photo a bit.)
Get Stylin’ with DeepArt
Maybe you want to glam up your picture a little bit and give it a little pizazz. DeepArt is here for you. Upload an image and choose a style, and it’ll apply the style to your image for free — with one condition.
DeepArt.com.
DeepArt result. (Tara Calishain)
The one condition is that as of this writing the queue for getting your image processed is over five days long. If you’re willing to pay €1.99 (about $2.25) you’ll get your image in fifteen minutes. I found myself pleasantly surprised by how Munsie’s image worked out:
Editing images doesn’t have to be complicated, difficult, or costly! And we have AI to thank for it. I suspect that we’re only going to see more of these apps over time. I’ll be able to do even more of this instant editing, and see my picture of Munsie in more new ways.

Who put the non-human into human resources? At first glance, it seems like an unpopular alliance—the use of artificial intelligence to support a company's strategic goals vis a vis human resources.





IBM, however, is the company going big and bold in championing the benefits of technology driving work efforts to retain the best, the brightest, the most apt to contribute something to the conference table.
IBM CEO Ginni Rometty touted IBM's successful use of AI for leading the workforce at CNBC's @ Work Talent + HR Summit. She sat down with Jon Fortt and delivered some impressive numbers on how the IBM's AI tool helped the company.
First, though, let's run a flashback to the old days of Watson in the limelight when Forsyth Alexander in 2016 in a blog said HR people could use Watson Analytics to know what factors can be changed to hold on to good finds. Alexander walked readers through what lightbulbs can turn on once the HR-curious logged in to Watson Analytics.
""I ask Watson Analytics what drives attrition, because it's the most interesting to me, and I want to see how the other fields statistically relate to that target. It looks like working a lot of overtime is strongly linked to attrition."" She then had Watson show her predictive information ""on how job role and performance evaluation relate to employees who have left.""
Sure, some insights on triggers that a worker will leave that she saw may seem obvious– people who work a lot of extra hours without being rewarded and attrition in sales jobs being higher than other areas.
""What Watson Analytics does is quantify these insights reliably."" That way, she said, a company can take focused actions based on factual insights.






Fast-forward to 2019 and IBM is still talking up AI's potential for human resources insights and, regarding accuracy, the numbers being touted are impressive. CNBC said IBM HR now has a patent for its ""predictive attrition program"" which was developed with Watson to predict employee flight risk and prescribe actions for managers to engage employees.










CEO Ginni Rometty in 2019 talked about this ""predictive attrition program.""
Eric Rosenbaum, Editor, CNBC.com, said the AI retention tool is part of a suite of IBM products that are designed to upend the traditional approach to human resources management.
IBM artificial intelligence can predict which employees will leave a job with 95 percent accuracy.
The tool feeds into an overall strategic view at IBM of changing the human resources function from service to growth engine. She also said, you have got to put skills at the center of the culture.
An article in Forbes relays an understanding of the proactive retention of people.
""IBM's talent strategy also involves the proactive retention of people. Its HR AI system accurately predicts 95% of the time if people might want to leave the company. 'It has saved the company over $300 million,' said Rometty, specifically due to proactive retention practices. It's the artificial intelligence that tipped off IBM executives to take action—be it adding more compensation, skill development or a job change—before the employee might have left.""
How does this AI tool work? Seriously, how does it work? Several reports said they had not found specifics behind how this AI works.
Meanwhile, not everyone hastens to cheer and embrace the role of AI in HR. An interesting view was from Nick Kolakowski, senior editor, Dice Insights:





                Credit: IBM
             


""Indeed, given all the hype over A.I. and machine learning, it's easy to forget these aren't omnisciently wise systems...and HR processes are generally far more sophisticated, with a tricky human element.""
On the other hand, it is not easy to dismiss Rometty's insights about employee focus and fairness.
Have all managers in your experience kept an eye out for your professional growth? ""Among the tasks that HR departments and corporate managers have not always proved effective at, and where AI will play a bigger role in the future, is keeping employees on a clear career path and identifying their skills,"" said CNBC.com. ""Rometty said being transparent with individual employees about their career path is an issue in which many companies still fail.""
Regarding formal skills assessments. managers can be subjective in ratings.
Nonetheless, human resources as a human function with AI in the mix is a testy subject for some workers and it was not surprising to see thoughtful reader comments in TechSpot.
""If only we could predict when 'that next guy' is loading his AR-15 and getting ready to do something terrible,"" said one reader.
""Now it would be nice if employees also could use AI to predict when they are going to be laid off..."" said another,
And this one: ""As for what this AI is looking at, they say people don't leave companies, they leave bosses.""
Perhaps the last word on this belongs to Don Pontefract in Forbes: ""Artificial intelligence is a must for any HR team if it wants to survive not only the pending talent war but its long-term existence, too. The big question is whether it will put that technology to good use to assist all employees, or will it simply be used to trim costs and total headcount numbers.""

A Faculty of Computer Science researcher has been named as one of the new Canada CIFAR AI (CCAI) Chairs. This is the first Canada CIFAR AI Chair held by a Dalhousie faculty member.

Dr. Sageev Oore, also a Research Faculty Member at the Vector Institute in Toronto, joins top academic AI researchers from across Canada to form the second cohort of Canada CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) AI Chairs.

“I'm grateful to CIFAR,” says Dr. Oore. “Not only for the opportunities that the CCAI Chair opens for my own research with colleagues and students but also for the opportunities that the entire program opens for AI in Canada.”
World-class AI research

Alongside his work at Dalhousie, Dr. Oore is a Research Faculty Member at the Vector Institute. Based out of Toronto’s AI Hub, the Vector Institute is a community of world-class AI researchers and academic partners who work across disciplines on both curiosity-driven and applied research. The chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute is Geoffrey Hinton, one of the founders of the field of neural networks and deep learning, who also happens to have been Dr. Oore’s PhD supervisor.


“I joined Vector in early 2018 and I’m fortunate to be part of it,” says Dr. Oore. “There’s enormous wealth of experience and strength in machine learning at Vector, and my students at Dalhousie also have the opportunity to be affiliated with that.”

This latest announcement brings the number of Canada CIFAR AI Chairs to 46, from 29 announced in December. As part of the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, the prestigious Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, funded by the Federal government with $86.5 million over five years, provides researchers with long-term, dedicated research funding to support their research programs and help them to train the next generation of AI leaders. The 46 Chairs are named in partnership with Canada’s three national AI Institutes: Amii (Edmonton), Mila (Quebec) and the Vector Institute (Toronto), as well as twelve universities and hospitals across the country.

“The Canada CIFAR AI Chairs Program is core to Canada’s ongoing leadership in machine learning research and training,” says Dr. Elissa Strome, Executive Director of the CIFAR Pan-Canadian AI Strategy. “As the first country to develop a national AI strategy and the birthplace of deep learning, Canada is uniquely positioned to advance machine learning research and responsible AI.”
AI and music

Dr. Oore’s research is focused on using deep learning techniques to generate music and art – enabling him to combine his backgrounds as both a computer scientist and a professional musician. He joined the Faculty of Computer Science in early 2018 after spending eighteen months as a Visiting Research Scientist working at Google Brain in Mountain View, California.

“I was on the Magenta team, creating AI-powered tools to assist people making music and art. Part of this included using deep learning to generate music. Sometimes that music might sound, for a moment, as though a human is playing it, even though it’s machine-generated.”


Combining AI and music has been a curiosity for Dr. Oore for a long time and he is currently building his lab here at Dalhousie. His lab is focused on machine learning in computational creativity, but Dr. Oore is also very interested in the synergies with related areas in the field.

“As a scientist and musician, it’s fascinating to see how this research relates closely to many other directions. Some music-generation models use a ‘language model’ that’s based on similar techniques used for text processing—like Google Translate. Other projects are tied to signal processing, speech, or image generation. A keen student has lots to contribute regardless of whether they have musical background, and we have many collaborative opportunities.”

Dr. Oore is part of a group of well-established AI researchers in the Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning research cluster at the Faculty of Computer Science.

Artificial intelligence in Australia needs to get ethical, so we have a plan

The question of whether technology is good or bad depends on how it’s developed and used. Nowhere is that more topical than in technologies using artificial intelligence.
When developed and used appropriately, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the way we live, work, communicate and travel.
New AI-enabled medical technologies are being developed to improve patient care. There are persuasive indications that autonomous vehicles will improve safety and reduce the road toll. Machine learning and automation are streamlining workflows and allowing us to work smarter.
Around the world, AI-enabled technology is increasingly being adopted by individuals, governments, organisations and institutions. But along with the vast potential to improve our quality of life, comes a risk to our basic human rights and freedoms.
Appropriate oversight, guidance and understanding of the way AI is used and developed in Australia must be prioritised.
AI gone wild may conjure images of The Terminator and Ex Machina movies, but it is much simpler, fundamental issues that need to be addressed at present, such as:





how data is used to develop AI
whether an AI system is being used fairly
in which situations should we continue to rely on human decision-making?

We have an AI ethics plan
That’s why, in partnership with government and industry, we’ve developed an ethics framework for AI in Australia. The aim is to catalyse the discussion around how AI should be used and developed in Australia.
The ethical framework looks at various case studies from around the world to discuss how AI has been used in the past and the impacts that it has had. The case studies help us understand where things went wrong and how to avoid repeating past mistakes.


We also looked at what was being done around the world to address ethical concerns about AI development and use.

Based on the core issues and impacts of AI, eight principles were identified to support the ethical use and development of AI in Australia.

Generates net benefits: The AI system must generate benefits for people that are greater than the costs.
Do no harm: Civilian AI systems must not be designed to harm or deceive people and should be implemented in ways that minimise any negative outcomes.
Regulatory and legal compliance: The AI system must comply with all relevant international, Australian local, state/territory and federal government obligations, regulations and laws.
Privacy protection: Any system, including AI systems, must ensure people’s private data is protected and kept confidential and prevent data breaches that could cause reputational, psychological, financial, professional or other types of harm.
Fairness: The development or use of the AI system must not result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups. This requires particular attention to ensure the “training data” is free from bias or characteristics which may cause the algorithm to behave unfairly.
Transparency and explainability: People must be informed when an algorithm is being used that impacts them and they should be provided with information about what information the algorithm uses to make decisions.
Contestability: When an algorithm impacts a person there must be an efficient process to allow that person to challenge the use or output of the algorithm.
Accountability: People and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of AI algorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts of that algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended.

In addition to the core principles, various toolkit items are identified in the framework that could be used to help support these principles. These include impact assessments, ongoing monitoring and public consultation.
A plan, what about action?
But principles and ethical goals can only go so far. At some point we will need to get to work on deciding how we are going to implement and achieve them.
There are various complexities to consider when discussing the ethical use and development of AI. The vast reach of the technology has the potential to impact every facet of our lives.
AI applications are already in use across households, businesses and governments, most Australians are already being impacted by them.
There is a pressing need to examine the effects that AI has on the vulnerable and on minority groups, making sure we protect these individuals and communities from bias, discrimination and exploitation. (Remember Tay, the racist chatbot?)
There is also the fact that AI used in Australia will often be developed in other countries, so how do we ensure it adheres to Australian standards and expectations?
Your say
The framework explores these issues and forms some of Australia’s first steps on the journey towards the positive development and use of AI. But true progress needs input from stakeholders across government, business, academia and broader society.

That’s why ethical framework discussion paper is now open to public comment. You have until May 31, 2019, to have your say in Australia’s digital future.
With a proactive approach to the ethical development of AI, Australia can do more than just mitigate against any risks. If we can build AI for a fairer go, we can secure a competitive advantage as well as safeguard the rights of Australians.
