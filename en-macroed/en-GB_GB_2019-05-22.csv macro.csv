The whole process takes about a minute for a single berry.It seems like heavy going for a robot that cost £700,000 to develop but, if all goes to plan, this is the future of fruit-picking.Automation threatens 1.5 million workers in Britain, says ONSRead moreEach robot will be able to pick more than 25,000 raspberries a day, outpacing human workers who manage about 15,000 in an eight-hour shift, according to Fieldwork Robotics, a spinout from the University of Plymouth.The robot has gone on trial in the UK, as the farming industry battles rising labour costs and Brexit-related shortages of seasonal workers.Numbers of seasonal workers from eastern Europe have diminished, partly due to Brexit fears but also because Romania and Poland’s surging economies have persuaded their own workers to remain in their home countries .The robot has been developed in partnership with Hall Hunter, one of Britain’s main berry growers which supplies Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Waitrose. Standing at 1.8 metres tall, the wheeled machine with its robotic arm has begun field trials in a greenhouse at a Hall Hunter farm near Chichester in West Sussex.Guided by sensors and 3D cameras, its gripper zooms in on ripe fruit using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence. When operating at full tilt, its developers say the robot’s gripper picks a raspberry in 10 seconds or less and drops it in a tray where the fruit gets sorted by maturity, before being moved into punnets, ready to be transported to supermarkets.The final robot version, expected to go into production next year, will have four grippers, all picking simultaneously.Separate field trials in China have shown the robot can pick tomatoes, and it has also been let loose on cauliflower.As robots don’t get tired, they can pick for 20 hours a day, but the biggest challenge has been getting them to adapt to different light conditions, says Rui Andres, portfolio manager at Frontier IP, one of the main backers of Fieldwork.Andres says UK farmers typically pay £1 to £2 for a kilogram of raspberries picked by human workers. Fieldwork intends to lease its robots to farmers for less.The robot is the brainchild of Dr Martin Stoelen, a lecturer in robotics at Plymouth University, who moved from aerospace engineering into robots and took inspiration from his grandparents’ farm in Norway. By tackling one of the most difficult soft fruits first, he hopes to be able to tweak the technology so the robot can be used to pick other berries, fruit and vegetables.Some growers have already expressed interest, under pressure from the rising minimum wage, with labour accounting for half of their costs. They have also been spurred into action by a decline in seasonal pickers coming from Bulgaria, Romania and Poland since the UK’s vote to leave the EU in June 2016. Berry and apple growers have been the hardest hit by the labour shortages, and farms have started poaching pickers from each other.Many EU workers are staying away because their earnings have been eroded by the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the referendum.Nicholas Marston, chairman of the British Summer Fruits (BSF) trade body, says fruit growers were 15%-30% short of seasonal pickers last summer. “It’s a struggle. There were definitely crop losses last year and the year before.”Q&AWhat is AI?ShowArtificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Under a new UK government-sponsored two-year pilot scheme, 2,500 berry pickers will be coming from Ukraine and Moldova, but this will not be enough to plug gaps, Marston says.UK farms growing apples, berries and field crops need 70,000 seasonal workers a year. The berry industry alone employs 29,000, but BSF estimates it will need an extra 2,000 pickers by 2020, as people eat more berries. The National Farmers’ Union has recorded more than 6,000 unfilled vacancies on farms so far this year.The UK is not alone – with a population shift from rural areas to cities, other European countries, the US and China are all struggling to attract enough seasonal workers to harvest their crops, so robots could be the answer in the long run.Robots are also starting to be used for weeding and planting crops, and milking cows, as part of the long-term trend of automation in agriculture. The Small Robot Company, based near Salisbury, is trialling robots that look like spiders on wheels, called Tom, Dick and Harry. They seed, feed, weed and monitor field crops such as wheat in a gentler way than heavy farm machinery, reducing the need for water and pesticides.Robots promise to raise productivity, at a time when UK productivity growth is lagging behind other countries. Analysts attribute this lack of economic efficiency to a shift towards more low-skilled jobs since the financial crisis, a lack of business investment and a decade of austerity.If the rise of the robots materialises, it is expected to mainly affect low-skilled jobs. A new cohort of highly-skilled workers will be needed to maintain and debug the machines.But Marston cautions: “It will be 10 years before robots will work as effectively as people.”Explore more on these topicsRobotsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingFarmingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide
                        
                                While there are many examples of technology changing the way people work, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics have many people worried that their work will no longer be required at all. 

According to OECD estimates, more than 1 in 5 low-income jobs across its member countries are at high risk of automation. But it’s no longer just manual routine tasks that are affected by automation. Artificial intelligence is increasingly capable of performing “cognitive routine” tasks that are typical of the service sector. For example, artificial intelligence has recently surpassed humans at speech and image recognition, indicating that automation could also have an impact on relatively high-skilled occupations in the future. However, the share of high-income jobs at risk of automation is still significantly lower than it is for occupations that require fewer skills.

In its latest Economic Outlook, the OECD notes that automation won’t necessarily lead to lower labor demand though, as new tasks and jobs will appear. These jobs may require a different set of skills, however, which is why proper education and training are crucial to limit the adverse effects of automation on labor markets in the future.

In the near future, when you apply for a job or join a new team at work, a machine, rather than a human, may assess your personality traits to see if you are suitable.




Realising that people could manipulate conventional personality tests, a team of computing and psychology researchers from Macquarie, CSIRO and the University of Sydney decided to investigate ways to make personality detection more objective.Try faking this test: Associate Professor Shlomo Berkovsky says by using new technology, we can accurately assign personality traits.“If needed, people can easily change their answers and behaviour to be the kind of person that is expected of them,” says Associate Professor Shlomo Berkovsky of Macquarie’s Australian Institute of Health Innovation.So the team thought of a new approach. “Our main idea was to detect someone’s personality using objective methods that they couldn’t control or manipulate.”Berkovsky presented this new research earlier this month at CHI 2019, the premier international conference in human-computer interaction hosted by the Association of Computing Machinery, the peak global computing research body. The research also won the Best Paper Award of the conference – a true recognition of the originality and significance of the work.No cheating: specialist equipment delivers honest resultThe researchers decided to track people’s bodily responses, such as pupil dilation, brain activity and skin conductance (when you are excited and your skin momentarily exudes micro sweat beads) as they looked at evocative videos and images.To conduct the experiment and collect the data, they brought 21 people into their lab. They fitted them with special glasses that had two tiny built-in cameras to capture their pupil dilation and eye movements, a headset to record brain activity and two electrode clips on their fingers to detect their heartbeat and skin conductance.The AI methods would be cheaper, faster and more accurate than the current expert assessment tools.Then the researchers showed these people validated images and videos already backed up with earlier research that indicated they evoked emotions. Each person spent about 14 minutes watching videos and nine minutes looking at the images while their bodily responses were recorded.Once they’d collected the data, the researchers processed it and used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict 16 personality traits from three established, and widely used in psychology, personality assessment models.Quantity is keyThe predicted personality traits, to their surprise, were very accurate. “Just using the eye data, we had close to 86 per cent accuracy of the predictions. With the other sensory data added, the accuracy goes up to over 90 per cent,” Berkovsky says. “Basically, the more data and bodily responses you plug in, the more and more things are captured, so then the AI can predict the personality traits with higher and higher levels of accuracy.”Artificial intelligence will improve our health systemWhat needs to change to get more women in science top jobsSimilar predictive AI technologies could possibly be used in the future for recruitment or team-building purposes, he says. “AI could soon replace the existing tests to gather objective data about humans. The AI methods would be cheaper, faster and more accurate than the current expert assessment tools.”Looking to the futureAlready Berkovsky is using this AI predictive capability as the first stepping stone into wider research he is involved in at the Australian Institute of Health Innovation.“Because we’ve found these physiological responses capture a lot of information, we are trying to apply similar ideas to predict medical conditions,” he says. His team is trying to use AI to predict the development and progression of mental and neural disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as learning difficulties, such as dyslexia which is very hard to diagnose.“Just imagine, instead of putting a child through clinical tests with a specialist, they’d just have to use a normal mobile phone to capture their eyes and voice while the child read something to their parents. We can hopefully come up with an AI prediction, a probability of dyslexia, in a matter of minutes,” Berkovsky says. “The wider applications of this technology in health are endless.”Associate Professor Shlomo Berkovsky is based at the Australian Institute of Health Innovation.
