Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of US adults believe artificial intelligence will “eliminate more jobs than it creates,” according to a Gallup survey. But, the same survey found that less than a quarter (23 percent) of people were “worried” or “very worried” automation would affect them personally. Notably, these figures vary depending on education. For respondents with only a four-year college degree or less, 28 percent were worried about AI taking their job; for people with at least a bachelor degree, that figure was 15 percent. 

These numbers tell a familiar story. They come from a Gallup survey of more than 3,000 individuals on automation and AI. New details were released this week, but they echo the findings of earlier reports.

One survey conducted by Quartz last year found that 90 percent of respondents thought that up to half of all jobs would be lost to automation in five years, but 91 percent said there was “no risk to my job.” Another study from the Pew Research Center in 2016 found the same: 65 percent of respondents said that 50 years from now automation would take over “much” of the work currently being done by humans, but 80 percent thought their own job would still exist in that time frame. 

""Will AI destroy jobs or create them? No one really knows""

On the surface, these answers suggest complacency, ignorance, or short-sightedness, but they also reflect a deep divide among experts on what exactly the effects of new technology will have on the workplace. Studies trying to estimate job losses caused by advances in robotics and AI vary wildly. Some claim that up to 1 billion jobs will be destroyed overall as soon as 2022, while others predict that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs will be lost globally, but more than that number will be gained. As you might expect, the methodology in these studies also varies. What counts as “AI” and when is a job “destroyed”  are up for debate. 

Historically, though, it’s the cheerier scenario that’s been true: technology usually leads to a net gain in jobs, destroying some professions but creating new ones in the process. What’s different this time around, argue some economists and AI experts, is that machines are qualitatively smarter than they were in the past, and historical examples don’t offer a useful comparison. This stance is sometimes presented as a doomsday scenario in which AI and automation lead to mass unemployment.

Given these contradictory predictions, it’s no wonder that most Americans think automation is someone else’s problem. After all, enough people are saying it is a problem, but not many individuals will look at their own job and think, “Yes, a computer could probably do all this.” This isn’t ignorance, either. Even in high-risk industries like truck driving, there’s only so much automation can do. A computer can drive on a highway, yes, but it can’t repair a truck, unload its inventory, argue with unhelpful warehouse managers, or even refill the gas tank. Not yet anyway. 

The newly released findings from Gallup’s survey also show that by one measure, the use of AI is already widespread in the US. Nearly nine out of 10 Americans (85 percent) use at least one of six devices or services that use features of artificial intelligence, says Gallup. Eighty-four percent of people use navigation apps like Waze, and 72 percent use streaming services like Netflix. Forty-seven percent use digital assistants on their smartphones, and 22 percent use them on devices like Amazon’s Echo. 

This definition of AI-enhanced products may strike some as overly broad, but it contains an important lesson that’s relevant to our predictions about job losses. It shows that AI is not a singular entity. It is a process, something that’s integrated into products and jobs bit by bit. You might not think that Netflix’s predictions of what you want to watch next count as artificial intelligence (or that they’re even intelligent at all), but they’ve helped the service steal viewers from traditional TV and cable companies by shaping the creation of shows like House of Cards. Measuring this sort of impact in economic surveys is understandably hard. 

What Gallup’s survey helps illustrate is that AI is not some mystic event that will change the world overnight at some point in the future. It’s something that is already happening, in ways both big and small. As Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of Gallup, told The New York Times: “Whether they know it or not, AI has moved into a big percent of Americans’ lives in one way or another already.”

In manufacturing plants, they carry out pre-ordained, repetitive tasks all day and night.But if they step outside, they are unable to deal with the chaos of the real world. It is a place where order and routine are gone. Even the simplest of tasks are complicated by the unpredictability and vagueness of human interaction.A team at the University of Texas, Austin has set itself the challenge of bringing robots out of their comfort zone and into our messy world.Laptops on motorised pedestals wander eerily through the lab like slow, partly built Daleks.

Currently, they are learning their way around the place.Pallab Ghosh/ BBC NewsRobot soccer players have a short career - usually a season or twoSo far they have learned how to avoid bumping into stuff. But great things are planned for them.The aim is for them to be able to carry out simple instructions, like finding a colleague or locating and bringing over a piece of equipment. But that is easier said than done. They need to be able to recognise objects and people. They also need to understand rather than recognise human speech. There is a difference. The later involves having a limited number of voice commands pre-programmed into them. But understanding requires context and meaning. This can only be achieved using AI techniques, which involve the robot asking questions to help it understand what words mean. The researcher leading the project is a linguist, Dr Jesse Thomason. He has restricted the number of questions the partly built Daleks can ask to just five. Why so few?He tells me that the robots can become ""infuriating"" with their questions. They would ask them forever like a small child.Top teamIndeed, when Jesse teaches one of the robots it seems like he is talking to a baby.His colleague, Dr Andrea Thomaz, is trying to teach human etiquette to the Daleks. She wants them to know when it is appropriate to approach a human and start up a conversation. Dr Thomaz has developed code to enable the robots to give out social cues, such as waving at someone, and then to look for movements or expressions from their human counterparts that indicate that they are happy to talk.""The problem really is that robots have to be able to deal with the dynamics and noise and unpredictability that people bring into the environment, and so we have to think about perception, control and learning to build robots that can deal with that sort of thing,"" she told BBC News.In another part of the lab, humanoid robots are playing football. They are part of an international ""RoboCup"" initiative, which has set itself the challenge of building a team capable of beating the men's World Cup winners by 2050.The robots play on a mini indoor football pitch, working together as a team and learning from each match.Tiki-taka robotsPlaying football is far harder for machine-learning systems than chess or go, according to Prof Peter Stone who leads this project and plays football regularly himself.""Rather than turn-taking, you have everyone moving at the same time. And if you take too long to decide what to do when you pass the ball, your opponents come and take the ball from you.""It's also continuous. There are no discrete places where people need to be. They are always moving, through the air and through space.""So there are many challenges in contrast to some of the board games.""The kinds of robots in 1950s films are still in the realms of science fiction.

However, pesticides also carry inherent risks, such as the damage they can do to the environment and local ecosystems, and the hazards that over-exposure can pose to human health. Their production and distribution also has environmental costs, as well as financial costs to the farmers. For this reason, when they must be used, there are a lot of good reasons that they should be used efficiently, and accurately.

Computer vision specialist Blue River Technology has developed a solution for exactly that, using advanced machine learning algorithms to enable robots to make decisions, based on visual data (just as we would do ourselves) about whether or not a plant is a pest, and then deliver an accurate, measured blast of chemical pesticides to tackle the unwanted pests. Given that traditionally such decisions are made on a field-by-field basis, rather than plant-by-plant basis, the opportunities for efficiency are clear.
PROMOTED
Farm equipment and services giant John Deere saw the potential of this development and acquired the start-up late last year and added it to the catalog of high tech, data-powered services it already offers its customers.

It is just the latest move in John Deere’s push to put data-driven analytical tools and automation in the hands of farmers. With the rate of global population growth, the company – established in 1837 as a tool manufacturer – understands that they serve an industry where small efficiencies quickly add up to big competitive advantages.
Already the firm enables automated farm vehicles to plough and sow, under the control of pinpoint-accurate GPS systems. On top of that its Farmsight system is designed to enable data-driven insights to inform agricultural decision making, based on shared user data from subscribers all around the world.

With so much data now available and an ever-growing number of sophisticated tools to crunch through it, it’s no surprise that agriculture is staking its claim to a slice of the AI-driven tech revolution. And it’s a good job too - the industry which provides us with our most basic necessity for survival is heavily affected by weather patterns, climate change, water availability and human migration patterns. And that’s before you even get into the impact that economic and political activity can have.
Luckily infrastructure for gathering data which can be used to predict the effects of these influences is increasingly available. Satellite imagery – previously often prohibitively expensive – is more affordable than ever with one person I spoke to recently comparing the cost of launching a satellite to launching an app. Visual data is also available from unmanned aerial vehicles such as quadcopter drones, which can be used to monitor the growth and spread of pest through crops in real-time.
One company specializing in analysis of satellite imagery last year came within 1% of accurately predicting corn and soya yields by applying machine learning algorithms to their data. It has already released its predictions for this year’s season, which it claims will be more accurate.
The large-scale mechanization of agriculture means that accurate data is available from the machines which spread seeds and harvest crops. Robots - such as those developed by Google Funded Abundant Robotics which suck ripe fruit from branches with vacuums -naturally record everything they do and every parameter of their operation. This structured machine data meshes well with unstructured data from meteorological or satellite imagery, and when filtered through AI algorithms will provide insights that more accurately predict yields and losses.
Of course, getting on-board with all these possibilities could prove challenging to some farmers who are more accustomed to running their businesses on grain silos than data silos. And even in the developed world, its generally acknowledged that the slow rollout of fast broadband services to rural areas has had a constricting effect on business. In the developing world the situation is worse with local farmers often reliant on slow, shared internet connections provided by community cooperatives or charities.
But it’s problems like this that agricultural technology plans to overcome, and with the world population expected to grow by another billion by 2030 while the amount of available agricultural land is expected to shrink, it is in all our interest to make farming as efficient as we can.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

AI Seen as Greater Job Threat Than Immigration, Offshoring
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

58% in U.S. say new technology is the greater threat to jobs
23% of U.S. workers worry they may lose their jobs to technology
12% of workers worry they may lose their jobs to immigration


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than half of Americans (58%) say technology poses a greater threat to jobs in the U.S. over the next decade, while 42% see immigration and offshoring as the greater threat. Republicans, who see immigration and offshoring as roughly an equal threat as technology, are the only subgroup of Americans not to see technology as a greater threat.


Americans' Perceptions of Threats to Jobs Over the Next Decade
Which of the following do you believe is a greater threat to jobs in the U.S. in the next 10 years: job loss due to immigration and offshoring, that is jobs or companies moving overseas, or job loss due to new technology, automation, robots, or artificial intelligence?

NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/GALLUP SURVEY, SEPT. 15-OCT. 10, 2017





 
These data come from a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults was conducted Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017. The data show Americans are largely positive about the impact AI will have, but still expect it to cost jobs, with 73% of Americans predicting that AI will lead to a loss of more jobs than it creates.
The survey asked Americans to choose which they thought was the greater threat to U.S. jobs over the next decade, immigration and offshoring or new technology, automation, robots, or artificial intelligence. The question defined offshoring as jobs or companies moving overseas.
Although majorities across nearly all subgroups agree that new technology poses a greater risk to their jobs than immigration and offshoring does, Republicans consider the threat posed by technology (52%) to be roughly equal to that of immigration and offshoring (48%). Republicans' perceptions contrast sharply with Democrats', whose views strongly tilt toward believing new technology is the greater threat to jobs (67%) than is immigration and offshoring (33%).
U.S. Workers Twice as Likely to Worry About Losing Job to AI Than to Immigration
U.S. workers as well see a greater threat from new technology than from immigration and offshoring. Almost one in four American workers say they are very or somewhat worried about losing their own jobs to new technology, nearly twice as many as the 12% who say the same about immigration and offshoring. Levels of worry about these specific threats to American workers' jobs are higher than the 8% of U.S. adults who worry about being laid off in the next 12 months, in general.


American Workers' Worry About Job Loss to New Technology vs. Immigration
How worried are you about your job being eliminated as a result of new technology, automation, robots, or artificial intelligence?
How worried are you about an immigrant, that is, someone from another country taking your job, or are you not worried at all?

*Among employed Americans


NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/GALLUP SURVEY, SEPT. 15-OCT. 10, 2017





 
For the most part, American workers' fear of losing their jobs to new technology versus to immigrants varies little by subgroup. However, the key exception is Republican workers, who worry about the two threats to their own jobs roughly equally -- 19% for new technology versus 17% for immigration. Among Democratic workers, nearly a quarter (23%) worry about losing their jobs to new technology compared with 9% who worry about the threat to their personal jobs posed by immigration.

Bottom Line
Americans largely perceive new technology as a greater threat to jobs in the U.S. over the next decade than immigration and offshoring. This view is supported by a recent Oxford study of the potential impact of the adoption of AI on the U.S. job market, which suggests as many as 47% of jobs are potentially at risk of elimination from this new technology. In contrast, estimates of the cost in American jobs from immigration and offshoring vary widely, with some reports suggesting these may create more jobs than they eliminate.
The risk posed by new technology to American jobs has been given little public attention by President Donald Trump's administration. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently said that there was no need to worry about AI displacing American workers for a half century or more. Trump has been much more focused on the impact of immigration, based on the contention that immigrants take jobs away from Americans.
Whether the Trump administration is focused on the impact of AI on jobs, many others see it as particularly pressing. Nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) say the adoption of AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University-Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15 to Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.
-For results based on the total sample of 3,297 U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.
-For results based on the sample of 2,871 employed U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

Reg Chua, executive editor of editorial operations, data and innovation at Reuters, says the aim is to divvy up editorial work into what machines do best (such as chew through data and spot patterns), and what human editorial staff excel at (such as asking questions, judging importance, understanding context and — presumably — drinking excessive amounts of coffee).
That differs from previous editorial tech efforts that sought to train AI to write entire stories, such as snippets about local sports teams or earthquake warnings. Reuters already tried that with financial stories, and that work has ""informed"" the new aim to build a ""cybernetic newsroom"", rather than a fully automated one, says Chua. ""The real value is using machines to do what they're good at and then presenting that to humans — that's the best of both worlds.""
The system will churn through massive datasets, looking for anything interesting: a fast moving stock price, intriguing changes in a market, or subtler patterns. Journalists are handed that information however they choose — in an email, messenger service, or via their data terminals when they sit down for a shift — alongside key context and background to help jumpstart their research if they think the story is worth pursuing. They can also enter a particular company into the system to get a quick overview, handy for background research and interview preparation.
Reuters is not the first news organisation to turn to machines for a helping hand. The Washington Post has run hundreds of machine-written short snippets using its in-house robot reporter, Heliograf, while the Press Association is working with Urbs Media for natural-language generation for local news with a project called RADAR, or Reporters and Data and Robots, and  Yahoo turned to automated writing tool Wordsmith for everything from fantasy football snippets to Game of Thrones recaps. The Associated Press has increased the number of companies it covers by an order of magnitude using automation.

But it's not all spitting out machine-written stories — others have used AI to boost reporting. In NiemanLab's predictions for this year in journalism, the industry watcher predicts artificial intelligence will ""scoop"" human reporters, pointing to ProPublica's use of machine learning to analyse what topics US Congress spends its time on and BuzzFeed's algorithm for sifting through flight-tracking data to find spy planes.
Lynx Insight can write sentences, letting journalists drag-and-drop machine-generated copy into their own stories, but it's more about supplying data. In one example shared by Reuters, Lynx Insight would alert a journalist that Walmart shares fell by ten per cent, noting the last time the dropped as fast and why, by pulling in headlines from that day about the company. The demo also showed Lynx Insight offering the names of analysts quoted in previous Walmart stories, and explaining how the company has recently performed against rivals.
There's no question journalists could gather all that information themselves, trawling through databases and skimming quarterly earnings reports, but using machine learning is ""going to give them a huge boost down the runway"" in terms of research, says Padraic Cassidy, editor for news technology at Reuters. Chua adds: ""The goal is it adds value to what they would done, and frees them up to pursue angles that would have taken them longer to get to.""
Not all story ideas or data points will be useful, and journalists are able to flag the less insightful suggestions and tell developers what they've missed. That means that as the system learns, it can find more interesting stories.
The aim is to eventually remove the UI layer and have the system pop up suggestions, facts, and contextual background information as the journalist types — yes, it's Word's ""Clippy"" for journalists. ""You appear to be writing a story about Microsoft... "" laughs Chua. ""I hate to use the Clippy analogy, but that's the idea: you'd get 15 facts on the topic you're writing about. It's on our roadmap.""
Right now, Lynx Insights works with Reuters' ocean of financial data, but there are plans afoot to extend it to sports and potentially even the company's extensive legal databases, though it's less clear exactly how that information could be sifted by AI. Any dataset can be pulled in, be it government data for investigative reports or polls on the campaign trail, making it easier to spot why a candidate is trending up or down. ""In theory it could be any data set we've got a handle on, that's got a good structure,"" says Cassidy. ""We could pipe that in.""
Thanks to metadata, Lynx Insight also works on videos and photos. Pick a bit of text, and it can find a photo that matches to pair up for social posts — it's essentially a financial news meme builder.
Alongside helping journalists do better work more quickly, Chua and his team believe the technology behind Lynx Insights could be used to personalise news stories. That could be for wire services, offering a sports roundup with the local team in the lead for each market, or even for individuals, with a paragraph explaining how a stock swing impacts their own portfolio.
Is this the future of journalism? David Caswell, fellow at the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri and founder of the Structured Stories news platform, believes AI can help relieve newsroom pressures as journalism revenues decline, especially for beats that don't bring in much cash, such as local reporting. ""Other big benefits are increased scale, extreme customisation and personalisation, speed and accuracy and the ability to become systemic on reporting certain beats,"" he says. ""There are also longer term benefits resulting from the accumulation of news as data over time that may be even more important.""

While Reuters is starting with financial data, Caswell argues automation can assist any area of journalism that has repetition, from crime to business deals, award shows to celebrity gossip. ""Anything that is formulaic — which is a significant portion of journalistic output,"" he says. ""Essentially the only barrier to all this is the availability of carefully structured data, which machine learning is helping to solve."" And structured data is something Reuters, and its parent firm Thomson Reuters, has oodles of.
But we shouldn't lean too heavily on data-driven journalism, and limit reporting to what can be aided by machines. ""We need to remember that this is a tool, not a replacement — data and algorithms just can't see, feel or know most of what we see, feel or know, so there may be a risk that we may narrow our view of journalism to only that which we can capture as data,"" he says. ""That would be a grave mistake.""
Indeed, Chua hopes Lynx Insight becomes just another tool in a journalist's arsenal, as revolutionary and mundane as the telephone or Google Search. ""The goal is not that it becomes some 'gee whiz' new tool, but that it becomes just a part of their working day,"" he says. ""In an ideal world, people wouldn't even notice this — it just works in the background, like a telephone or Google. If it just becomes part of what people do, that'd be a marker of success.""

""There are also longer term benefits resulting from the accumulation of news as data over time that may be even more important.""Read more: How Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan broke Gawker: UpVote 24While Reuters is starting with financial data, Caswell argues automation can assist any area of journalism that has repetition, from crime to business deals, award shows to celebrity gossip. ""Anything that is formulaic — which is a significant portion of journalistic output,"" he says. ""Essentially the only barrier to all this is the availability of carefully structured data, which machine learning is helping to solve."" And structured data is something Reuters, and its parent firm Thomson Reuters, has oodles of.But we shouldn't lean too heavily on data-driven journalism, and limit reporting to what can be aided by machines. ""We need to remember that this is a tool, not a replacement — data and algorithms just can't see, feel or know most of what we see, feel or know, so there may be a risk that we may narrow our view of journalism to only that which we can capture as data,"" he says. ""That would be a grave mistake.""Indeed, Chua hopes Lynx Insight becomes just another tool in a journalist's arsenal, as revolutionary and mundane as the telephone or Google Search. ""The goal is not that it becomes some 'gee whiz' new tool, but that it becomes just a part of their working day,"" he says. ""In an ideal world, people wouldn't even notice this — it just works in the background, like a telephone or Google. If it just becomes part of what people do, that'd be a marker of success.""This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Developing good software is extremely challenging for any number of reasons. Look no further than cloud-based solutions like Workday to see that just because you have a $26 billion company, it doesn’t mean you’re capable of deploying something that would be considered remotely usable by anyone other than your local human resources department. On the other hand, deploy a CRM tool like Salesforce for your sales team, and you’ll wonder how you could have ever lived without it. The difference between good and bad software is something called software quality assurance or SQA. It’s not just about software testing, but encompasses the entire software development process.
If you’ve ever worked in a software testing role (a key function of SQA), then you know what a isht job it is for at least several reasons. Firstly, you need to make sure the software developers built what the requirements document asked for (referred to as internal requirements), but that’s not enough. If your business analyst didn’t do their job properly, then the requirements document may not actually reflect what the user asked for (referred to as external requirements) so even though you built the right thing, you actually built the wrong thing. Then, because the sales people have already sold something that wasn’t actually built yet, you’re pressured to release the software anyway even though it’s complete crap.

That’s the joy of working in SQA. It’s not just about testing software to internal and external requirements, but also about developing software properly.
We recently talked about a company that is using artificial intelligence to find people who would make good software engineers even though they may not have the stereotypical pedigree. It’s a great idea because intelligent people are simply those individuals who have the ability to learn, and that will take you places in the ever-changing world of software development. Of course that’s only a temporary need, because soon we’re going to have software that creates itself – using artificial intelligence of course. Until then, developing good software will continue to be difficult because of humans, so we’re interested in learning about more companies out there that might be using artificial intelligence to help develop better software. Here are three two examples and one startup that should be using AI.
Mabl
Founded in early 2017, Boston startup Mabl has taken in $10 million in funding to develop “the only machine learning test automation service that automatically maintains tests and identifies regressions for you make functional testing much easier”. Let’s get some of this terminology defined for the average layman. Regression testing is when you create a suite of software tests and then run them over and over as a software product evolves. Every time one of your brogrammers on Soylent makes a change, you can then run the regression tests to make sure nothing broke.
Bonus points for referring to software testing as a “journey”
In ancient times, software testers would use record-and-playback tools to create these regression test suites (anyone remember Rational Robot?). This would allow software testers to automate functional software testing, that is, testing the software in the way that the users would actually use it via the “graphical user interface” or GUI. That’s also called “test automation”, and it’s something that the founders (Izzy Azeri and Dan Belcher) saw could be optimized while they were working at Google. The reason they were at Google is because that’s who bought their last successful startup, Stackclouds, which raised $15 million before being acquired. Mabl is free to use and the founders are solid guys so go check it out.
Update 09/20/2018: Mabl has taken in an additional $20 million from a Series B Round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) for a brand new enterprise product. This brings the company’s total funding to $30 million so far. 
Diffblue
Founded in 2016, Oxford University spinout Diffblue has taken in 17 million British pounds (about $23.46 million) from investors that include Goldman Sachs to essentially “automate all traditional coding tasks: bug fixing, test writing, finding and fixing exploits, refactoring code, translating from one language to another, and creating original code to fit specifications”.  As of now they have three products:

Automatic Test Generation – While before we talked about “functional testing” using the GUI, there are also tests that programmers write are supposed to write behind the scenes that look for problems. Also called “unit testing”, the idea here is that you don’t want your highly paid Indian developers spending their time doing this sort of stuff. Now AI will do it for you.
Refactor – This is all about changing a piece of code while making sure it still does the same thing. Refactoring makes code cleaner and helps with things like maintenance and performance. AI would be perfect for doing something like this, and it can even test itself to make sure nothing broke.
Security – The AI algorithms get all devious and try to find places in the code that hackers other malicious AI algorithms may try and exploit.

The platform is something they’ve been developing over the past 10 years, and now they’re rolling it out to blue chip companies.
Split
No, this isn’t the now defunct startup that built an app that helps you avoid people you don’t want to run into (first world problem) but a nearly three-year-old Silicon Valley startup that makes tools for testing software. With nearly $27 million in funding, Split offers a solution for a type of testing that many people out there who work in web development would be familiar with – A/B testing – and it’s already being used by some big clients like Salesforce and Chase. More simply, A/B testing can be described as experimenting. You choose two different options in your software design (A & B), then you have 1,000 people use them. Whichever performs better using whatever performance metrics you choose can then be implemented. Here are some of the features in nerd-speak:
Bonus points for referring to A/B testing as a “customer experience”
While we didn’t see them explicitly talk about using artificial intelligence, it’s exactly the sort of thing that could be optimized with some AI algorithms. All Split needs to do is hire a few AI programmers and a “big data expert”, then instruct their marketing team to splash these terms all over their website liberally so they can raise even bigger funding rounds. You’re welcome.
What usually happens when we write one of these broad-topic AI articles is that shortly after, we get inundated with “you forgot our cool AI startup” emails which is understandable considering that we usually “forget” all kinds of startups out there. That’s because research costs money, and we only have so many MBAs working 9-9-6 trying to get you free, insightful research just as quick as their little hands can type. If your startup uses artificial intelligence / big data / machine learning / neural networks / etc. to develop better software then, yes, we forgot you. Please drop us a note reminding us about how cool you are, and we’ll include you in a coming article that will dive deeper into the topic of using artificial intelligence for software development.

Artificial Intelligence and the Rise of the Bots
An autonomous, artificially intelligent entity could task itself with inciting hatred to millions, even without being designed for that purpose.

by Nathan González Mendelejis



 


The 1984 classic Terminator envisions a future taken over by warrior robots on a quest to eradicate humans. The story is a classic Frankesteinian tale of a hubris-fueled human invention getting out of hand and eventually turning against its creator. Recent developments in defense-related artificial intelligence (AI), such as autonomous drones, offer eerie reminders of the sci-fi plots of yesterday. And yet, while we may be tempted to ruminate on future robot armies, a more immediate AI threat is brewing right under our noses: heteromated terrorism, which occurs when humans engage in violent acts at the behest of AI technology.

Computer scientists Hamid Ekbia and Bonnie Nardi coined the term heteromation to describe “an extraction of economic value from low-cost or free labor in computer-mediated networks.” This refers to commercial technology that pushes critical tasks to the end users: humans. We can think of a person scanning products at the supermarket self-check-out line at the prompting of a machine, or someone uploading valuable personal information at Facebook’s request in order to help enrich the company with data that can be turned into ad revenue. 

If automation involves machines doing the work of humans, heteromation refers to the way machines task humans with essential actions. As Ekbia and Nardi argue, heteromation turns “artificial intelligence on its head” by extracting free or low-cost labor from willing human participants.
Given the prevalence of so-called “bot” agitation on social media, and given the fact that social media serves as a primary platform for political recruitment, it is not a stretch to envision acts of heteromated terrorism becoming a trend. Filmmakers and authors have imagined the AI threat as a rational process, whereby non-human entities accumulate power and eventually move to systematically replace humans. But heteromated terrorism is something arguably more dangerous—and also more likely to occur in the near term, as it marries the power and reach of algorithmic content production and targeting with humans’ propensity for irrational outbursts.





For example, an individual could be radicalized at home through the relentless input of bot-generated content online, boosted and repeated ad nauseam into an echo chamber the target human considers credible. The human would then take up arms and fight for a cause of the network’s choosing.

Heteromated terrorism could manifest itself as a conscious enterprise, sponsored by a state or a sophisticated non-state actor that lets bots loose on unsuspecting social-media users. It could also emerge as the natural byproduct of AI engagement with today’s acerbic body politic—autonomous bots radicalizing themselves online and in turn becoming independent agents of subversion. Regardless of whether it is planned or spontaneous, the threat of heteromated terrorism is upon us.
The Two Radicals

To realize how likely the rise of heteromated terrorism is, we need only look back at the highly publicized radicalization of two political actors—one artificial and one human—which took place in 2016.
The first example is the seemingly innocuous radicalization of “Tay,” a Microsoft-created AI bot. Tay was released onto Twitter under the handle @TayTweets, and within twenty-four hours, users had successfully taught it to spew conspiracy theories and racist tweets. “I fucking hate feminists and they should die and burn in hell,” wrote Tay in a March 26 tweet. Four minutes later, Tay tweeted, “Hitler was right I hate the Jews.” Some of the outbursts were merely parroting what other users had written—but some of the comments were developed by the bot itself after picking up topics and lingo from the Twitterverse. Microsoft shut down Tay, but the lesson was clear: an autonomous, artificially intelligent entity could task itself with inciting hatred to millions, even though it had not been designed for that purpose.
The second radicalization example is that of Edgar Maddison Welch, a human from Salisbury, North Carolina. On December 4, 2016, Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington, DC armed with a semi-automatic rifle and on a mission to rescue children he thought were being held captive. Welch had been motivated by extremist media outlets like InfoWars and Breitbart, as well as by Twitter and message boards that had become increasingly prone to promoting conspiracy theories. According to Welch’s echo chamber, the pizza parlor in question was host to a pedophile ring in which then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was supposedly implicated. The accusation was blatantly untrue and absurd, but like many extreme viewpoints, it gained a gullible audience online.
Tay and Welch represent two sides of what a heteromated terror equation might look like. On one side would be an artificially intelligent network pushing extremism, and on the other, a willing human nudged to act on behalf of the network’s objectives. What makes heteromation such a pressing concern today is that we already know Welch’s radicalization was likely influenced, if not by sophisticated artificial intelligence, then at least by a cadre of relatively simple bots that helped amplify the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory over social media.
The Rise of the Bots
The extreme rhetoric that inspired Welch’s acts were fed by a loose network that involved the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a private troll farm based in St. Petersburg, Russia, which U.S. intelligence claims has ties to the Kremlin. (A troll farm is a group of humans paid to create and comment on antagonistic claims online.) The broader network also relies on activists and media personalities with an interest in disseminating combative views. The brilliance of IRA’s efforts is in the company’s ability to fuse with existing political and social dynamics of the countries it targets. One such country is the Ukraine, where Russia has an interest in supporting separatists. Another is the United States, where Russia wants to undermine a political establishment it has battled for two generations. The IRA doesn’t create the social schisms it exploits, but it has had some successes in harnessing and amplifying them via trolls and social bots—algorithms that help with both targeting and automation of propaganda messages.
Emilio Ferrara, et al., define a social bot as “a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, trying to emulate and possibly alter their behavior.” Such bots have already become highly advanced and hard to distinguish from human actors. For example, bots can be selective about whom they follow (gauging by influence level and content type), when they post (to mimic human sleep and activity patterns), and they can even interact with human users.
Social bots additionally have the capacity to model themselves after people in a social network, not unlike the way machines took on the physical characteristics of humans in the Terminator franchise. By scouring for names, profile photos, and speech patterns from actual people who willingly offer up their identities to social-media companies, bots are successfully exploiting today’s highly heteromated environment.
Bots are difficult to detect, not only because of their human resemblance, but because human social- media activity has a high tolerance for interacting with unknown users, either in the form of replies on Twitter or Facebook users accepting friend requests from unknowns. Ferrara, et al., found that 20 percent of legitimate Facebook users accept friend requests from anyone—even folks they do not know. And 60 percent of users will accept friend requests from users with whom they share at least one common friend. This means that once a bot has successfully befriended one human user, the door opens to the infiltration of a broader social network.
Heteromated Terror
Heteromated terror need not be limited to right-wing extremism. In fact, the Islamic State’s social-media campaign has followed a model similar to that of Russia’s IRA. Both the IRA and the Islamic State rely on two separate stages for propagating messages: content creation (original work written by humans) and amplification (retweets and comments by humans and bots). The amplification phase lends itself well to automation, allowing a comment to be retweeted thousands of times in order to keep it from fading into Internet obscurity, as the vast majority of social-media posts do. But as Tay has shown, artificially intelligent bots can now take on the role of content creators, too.
More sophisticated social-bot campaigns would give the Islamic State and similar groups a significant boost in capabilities. Like the Russian IRA, Islamist radicals can assume a good percentage of their target audience would not be aware it is interacting with non-human accounts. Even algorithmic tools developed to detect bots have a mixed record, and Christian Grimme, et al., showed that today non-English accounts are particularly difficult for anti-bot technology to flag. This means the use of Arabic, French, Urdu and other languages found in the diverse Muslim world will be attractive vehicles for heteromating Islamist terrorism.
A Campaign without a General
As artificial intelligence further develops on social-media platforms, we can imagine heteromated terrorism being exponentially more difficult to combat than anything we have fought to this day. That is because the extremist signal will not need to originate from a particular group or state. Instead, autonomous AI bots will learn from the already existing cesspool of extremist propaganda on the Internet and build upon it independently of human direction. For states fighting terror, there will be no targets to bomb or countries to sanction. The ever-evolving enemy will live online.

How artificial intelligence will impact the South African workforce.
Last year, research by Accenture and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) posited that artificial intelligence (AI) had the potential to double the growth rate of the South African economy and boost rates of profitability by an average of 38 percent by 2035. This is great news for South African businesses of course, but an AI-dominated landscape brings with it multiple ethical and social issues, including the problem of a labour force that feels redundant and whose skills may be no longer needed.
AI will undoubtedly change the world of work, just as the Industrial Revolution did in the 1700s and 1800s. Certain jobs will become obsolete, as intelligent machines will be able to complete tasks quicker and more accurately than humans. New roles will also be created – jobs that we haven’t even thought about yet. AI will be the biggest disruptor the business world has seen in over two centuries. It is little wonder, then, that people are already starting to get jittery about the possibility of being replaced by, or working with, a robot in the near future.




Why we see AI as a threat
Neuroscience, which focuses on how the brain works, has some valuable insights into precisely why AI is perceived as such a threat by the workforce. As social animals, our desire to be part of a herd – in this case a company – is hardwired into our brains, an evolutionary remnant of when physical survival depended on safety in numbers. Any sense of social exclusion, therefore, is felt as a danger to our very existence, and our brain is consequently sensitive to this trigger in our social environments.
Feeling excluded is one of the five social triggers that is interpreted by the brain as a result of its central organising principal: to minimize danger and maximise reward. These triggers can put our brains into a threat or reward state that has an effect on our capacity to solve problems, make decisions and collaborate. AI is particularly threatening because it can be triggered by all five areas of human social experience: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness (SCARF).
AI threatens an employee’s Status, as their value in the workplace and as a productive member of society comes into question. Certainty is no longer guaranteed, as the future is unpredictable and employees wonder whether they will even have a job in the next five years. With AI encroaching on the workplace, employees feel as though they are losing their Autonomy because they cease to feel in control and think that they may not have options. Their Relatedness is threatened as they believe that they don’t belong anymore and are not sure which group they may belong to in the future. Finally, a sense of Fairness is triggered in employees as they feel as though they may not be treated equally.
One of the worst effects of being in a threatened state is that people are not open to change because the brain has less access to long-term memory and its capacity to think rationally and make decisions is reduced. This is because the brain is in a flight-or-flight survival mode, and so does not prioritise these actions. People are consequently also unable to see AI as something that could allow them the space to be more innovative, explore a new career, or give them more free time.
This brain state also affects the control of self-defeating behaviour; for example, an employee in a threatened state could stop being collaborative with their colleagues, procrastinate in their work, and have lower capacity to solve problems. None of this behaviour is conducive to doing business or ensuring a productive workforce.
Cultivating a growth mindset in employees
As AI becomes more of a permanent fixture in companies, employers should start focusing on fostering a growth mindset in their employees, so that they welcome the change that AI will bring, rather than fearing it. This mindset, pioneered by the work of Dr Carol Dweck, is based on whether employees believe that their abilities are finite or if they can be developed. If they do believe that their ability can be developed, then they will be inspired by the change and look forward to it as an opportunity to grow.
We must also remember that, with the dawn of the age of AI, human qualities become far more valuable. AI machines cannot truly collaborate and adjust their behaviour in relation to others’ actions. They do not have the same degree of social intelligence, and cannot become leaders. AI machines also lack business acumen and are unable to transfer their ‘skills’ from one industry to another. All these qualities, even in the age of AI, will still be a vital aspect of ensuring a prosperous society and thriving economy.
Entrepreneurship provides a solution
It is undeniable, however, that many South African’s jobs will become obsolete or change as AI becomes more of a permanent fixture in the workplace. The significant portion of SA’s workforce that is unskilled or semi-skilled will most likely be the first to be replaced by machines that will be able to do the work more efficiently. This will place pressure on individuals to change how they approach work and possibly to seek work in other sectors. However, this is no different to how jobs have evolved in the past. The introduction of more efficient farming technology a few centuries ago, for example, meant fewer people were needed to farm the land and so more workers were able to take up roles in other industries where there were labour shortages.
But with every door that AI closes to the workforce, another one opens – in this case, entrepreneurship. AI will make entrepreneurship an even more sought-after skill in the SA economy, as it focuses on innovation, provides employment opportunities, and has significant social impact. Entrepreneurship also gives individuals a sense of belonging, as being productive members of society provides Status, Certainty, Autonomy, and a sense of Relatedness and Fairness. People are able to elevate their level of contribution, they have more certainty and autonomy in their own work in an entrepreneurial setting, and can develop a more individualised sense of belonging by being able to gain as much as they contribute. This sense of belonging means that people are performing at their best, as they do not feel threatened by a change that may seem out of their control.
Of course, in order to retain employees, it is not feasible to ask them to set up their own shops. However, as employers, we can look at the ways that we define and integrate current employment when the machines join us in the workforce. By allowing employees more autonomy and control in the way they do and view their work, we can put them in a better brain state, as it plays to their social drivers. In most industries where the impact of machines will become more prominent, this is already being done in the advancement of the gig economy.
In conclusion, then, AI is definitely set to change our workforce in the next few decades, but not all these changes will be threatening. It is up to employers to ensure that their employees realise this by playing to the social domains that trigger the brain, so that every individual can continue to perform optimally, learn new skills, and work towards their future roles in stimulating our economy. If we are able to do this, we will ensure our brains will be at their best to face and embrace this change.
In a world that is becoming more mechanistic, it is our ability to be aware of our social surroundings that both sets us apart, and allows us to never fear a robot taking our job.

It's common now to read of the Chinese government's push to lead the world in applications of artificial intelligence. But, in fact, many of the greatest gains are the result of key individual actions and intersections over many years.

Take the case of SenseTime, a standout in facial-recognition technology and, by virtue of an implied capitalization it says exceeds $3 billion, China's largest AI unicorn.
SenseTime's creation begins with Tang Xiaoou's Ph.D. in computer vision from MIT in 1996, which led to a teaching post at Chinese University of Hong Kong. Busy in the same engineering department there was Xu Li, en route to his own doctorate in computer vision and imaging in 2010. (Computer vision is software for recognizing images.)
PROMOTED
The two formed part of the nucleus of what became SenseTime a few years later, with Xu as CEO. One of Tang's students at the school, Xu Bing, today spearheads the company's fundraising and strategic partnerships. And when Tang took a sabbatical from the university in 2008 to head a computer-vision group at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing, he met Yang Fan, now SenseTime's head of product development. ""It took me a couple of years to find out what I really liked to work on at MIT. Then it took more than 20 years of hard work in this area such that we finally start to see some real industrial applications and impacts. It does not happen overnight,"" Tang, now 49, writes in an email.

It also took investors to give the group a critical boost. Justin Niu, a partner at venture capital firm IDG in Beijing, in 2014 visited professor Tang and his research team, still working out of the same university lab. They showed him demos of how a camera enhanced by machine learning could pull distinct faces out of a smoggy day's tableau in Tiananmen Square.
""Their techniques are quite shocking to me. I realized how far the progress had been in the field,"" Niu recalls.
IDG joined with another firm, StarVC, to lead a $30 million investment into the formative SenseTime as Tang was processing the company's registration paperwork. The professor and his founding group, by then numbering ten and all at least a decade his junior, parked themselves a few miles away in Hong Kong's Science Park. Yang Fan added a contingent from his base, Tsinghua University.

In 2014, a series of technology breakthroughs won SenseTime global acclaim from publications such as Nature and Science and other media attention before IDG came calling. These included a research paper showing its computing capability, the world's first to outperform human vision under certain conditions, and its claim of beating Facebook's DeepFace with its algorithms called DeepID.
Fast-forward to 2018, after stakes were taken by other Chinese VCs and private corporations, and by Qualcomm of the U.S. SenseTime's workforce numbers 1,500, with five mainland hubs added to the Hong Kong site. Revenues aren't disclosed, but by Forbes Asia's estimations approach $100 million.








SenseTime founder Tang Xiaoou.





Tang remains the largest individual shareholder. SenseTime sports two faces: a research team working with 18 professors at universities across China and the profit-seeking commercial operations, which Tang, simply referred to as ""founder,"" and Xu Li lead. ""We hope our professors would continue to focus on the fundamental research,' including our founding professor, so we can continue to have discoveries,"" says CEO Xu, who spent three years at a Motorola research center in Shanghai and six months at Omron Research Institute in Kyoto.
SenseTime's field is exploding, and it says sales are growing better than fivefold annually. With the proliferation of smart machines and mobile devices, computer ""eyes"" are seemingly everywhere. In China's burgeoning fintech sector, SenseTime's recognition technology has scanned and authenticated the faces of 400 million consumers, 300 million for China Mobile alone. Its software is being used by China's ten largest security surveillance manufacturers, fitted on various Chinese phone makers to catalog, search and enhance user images, and soon should equip autonomous vehicles in a partnership with Honda.
To put the current pace in context: It had taken SenseTime nine months to produce its first commercial product: a face-based identity-verification system for opening an account at one of China's 4,000 peer-to-peer microlenders, phasing out days of laborious manual processing. SenseTime claims applying its facial recognition to a security lock can be as safe as an eight-digit password, compared to four digits in 2014.
In mobile apps, SenseTime's augmented-reality software helps place products in commercials (such as during Alibaba's Singles Day promotion) and other short videos and live broadcasts. For instance, a performer could pull a showcased item, such as a soda can, from out of nowhere. On top of the consumer uses come the ""public security"" applications, which can be the most lucrative. ""There's a strong, hard demand driven by smart cities and surveillance,"" Yang Fan says.
Visitors at SenseTime offices are greeted by cameras that capture their images while instantly matching their identities with an internal registrar and making an estimate of their age, and detecting intruders behind face masks or eyeglasses.
With positioning technology capable of processing data from 240 points on a human face, a leap from just 106 points before August 2017, SenseTime-aided monitors capture and count every passerby, whether inside an Ikea outlet or at a busy downtown intersection. That can be used for general crowd data (breaking down by age or sex, say, for marketing) or a specific identity search. Humans are surprisingly good at recognizing faces but no longer a match for machines that can also attach names and data to an image.
SenseTime, with an internal training database of 2 billion faces (many of them collected online) and claiming 10 billion more images and videos, has worked with 40 Chinese localities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing. Yang cites a case in 2016 in which police in Chongqing, powered by its technology, identified 69 suspects and caught 14 fugitives within 40 days. ""What we've accomplished [once] happened only in movies,"" he says.
At the central government level, SenseTime is working with the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute to develop the nation's so-called citizen network identity infrastructure.
The web is another policing opportunity. In 2016 the Cyberspace Administration of China, its central internet regulator, enlisted SenseTime on a national cleanup campaign: to scan and delete online pornography, banishing videos of violence, terrorism and horror as well. This work would otherwise be attempted by legions of laborers. Result: The Chinese web might be the most ""hygienic"" on earth. ""It's very, very difficult to find all these videos on the Chinese internet today,"" Yang says.








SenseTime’s recognition technology has scanned and authenticated the faces of 400 million consumers.





Of course, SenseTime does not have this emergent imaging sector to itself. Two prominent Chinese rivals, Megvii of the Face++ brand and Yitu Technology, are on the same hunt for clients. Megvii, founded in 2011 and backed by Ant Financial and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, claims its FaceID platform has authenticated the identity of 290 million worldwide, with more than 85% market share in security software for China's financial industry. Yitu, five years old, with backing from Alibaba founder Jack Ma's private Yunfeng Capital and giant Sequoia Capital, is active in health care imaging and fintech, and boasts of being an industry leader with 50% of market share in some unspecified segments in China's financial services industry.
A Megvii representative argues that SenseTime's accuracy in facial recognition doesn't automatically translate into use applications. Software design needs to fit with computer chips, monitors and an organization's procedures. ""More and more public security clients look at product compatibility, timeliness and efficiency. Its algorithm could be used as technical support but by itself would not address a security problem,"" he says.
Founder Tang is undaunted. At a recent event in Hong Kong, he told the audience: ""Dream big. I also learned from my son. He said someday he wanted to build an airplane with a swimming pool in it, calling it 747-380. That's a combination of Airbus and Boeing. You need to prepare for your dream. I prepared for it for 20 years.""
Supplementing his AI talents in Hong Kong, he scurried for hardware engineers in Shenzhen, and found plenty of software engineers in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, his company has 150 employees with doctorates--and globally competitive salaries to match. ""The success of SenseTime is really based on the connection of Hong Kong with Shenzhen, with Beijing and with Shanghai,"" he says.
Its stated ambition is to be the global dominant force in facial recognition, a ""platform company"" in the category of Google and Facebook, by taking a page from Intel, the global chip giant. Says CEO Xu, ""For SenseTime, our algorithms would form the high-entry barrier. We are forming an ecosystem with our business partners. Learning from Intel Inside, we are building up our model. Call it 'SenseTime Inside.' ""Shu-Ching Jean ChenFollowingFollowI cover regional corporates and entrepreneurs for Forbes Asia magazine as a contributing correspondent.
