But does it make mistakes – and can you boost your chances?,N/A,US news,N/A,"More recruiting companies are using AI technology to review applications. But does it make mistakes – and can you boost your chances?By Hilke SchellmannSupported byAbout this contentWed 11 May 2022 04.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 May 2022 04.31 EDTShareMartin Burch had been working for the Wall Street Journal and its parent company Dow Jones for a few years and was looking for new opportunities. One Sunday in May 2021, he applied for a data analyst position at Bloomberg in London that looked like the perfect fit. He received an immediate response, asking him to take a digital assessment.It was strange. The assessment showed him different shapes and asked him to figure out the pattern. He started feeling incredulous. “Shouldn’t we be testing my abilities on the job?” he asked himself.The next day, a Monday, which happened to be a public holiday in the UK, he got a rejection email. He decided to email a recruiter at Bloomberg. Maybe the company made a mistake?What Burch discovered offers insight into a larger phenomenon that is baffling experts: while there are record level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, even in sought-after fields like software development, while many companies complain they can’t find the right talent?Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. This is a huge shift, because until relatively recently, most hiring managers would handle applications and resumes themselves. Yet recent findings have shown that some of these new tools discriminate against women and use criteria unrelated to work to “predict” job success.While companies and vendors are not required to disclose if they use artificial intelligence or algorithms to select and hire job applicants, in my reporting I have learned that this is widespread. All the leading job platforms – including LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster – have told me they deploy some of these technologies.Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter, said that artificial intelligence and algorithms have already conquered the field. He estimates that at least three-quarters of all resumes submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. “The dawn of robot recruiting has come and went and people just haven’t caught up to the realization yet,” he said.A 2021 survey of recruiting executives by the research and consulting firm Gartner found that almost all reported using AI for at least one part of the recruiting and hiring process. Yet it is not foolproof. One of the most consequential findings comes from Harvard Business School professor Joe Fuller, whose team surveyed more than 2,250 business leaders in the US, UK and Germany. Their motives for using algorithmic tools were efficiency and saving costs. Yet 88% of executives said that they know their tools reject qualified candidates.Despite the prevalence of the technology, there have just been a few famous cases of misfires. A few years back, Amazon discovered that its resume screener tool was biased against women. The algorithm was trained on resumes of current employees, who skewed male, reflecting a gender disparity in many tech fields. Over time, the tool picked up on male preferences and systematically downgraded people with the word “women” on their resumes, as in “women’s chess club” or “women’s soccer team.” Amazon’s engineers tried to fix the problem, but they couldn’t and the company discontinued the tool in 2018.“This project was only ever explored on a trial basis, and was always used with human supervision,” said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser.AI vendors that build these kinds of technologies say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. If a company is drowning in applications, many human recruiters read only a fraction of the applications. An AI analyzes all of them and any assessments and judges every candidate the same way.View image in fullscreenSupporters say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. Photograph: Ivan Chiosea/AlamyAnother benefit, these vendors say, is if employers choose to focus on skills and not on educational achievements like college degrees, applicants from diverse backgrounds who are often overlooked can get to the next stage of the process.“At the end of the day, we don’t want people to be hired into roles that are going to drain them and not utilize their strengths. And so it’s really not about rejecting people, it’s about ‘screening in’ the right people,” said Caitlin MacGregor, CEO of Plum, which built the assessment Burch found so puzzling. MacGregor said the company’s clients have increased their diversity and retention rates since they started to use Plum. She said the assessments helped hone in on applicants’ “potential”.But job candidates who have the necessary experience worry they’re being unfairly weeded out when companies focus on elusive factors like potential or personality traits.“This was the first time in my life, in my career, where I was sending out resumes and there was nothing,” said Javier Alvarez, 57, a distribution and sales manager from Monrovia, California, who sent out his resume more than 300 times on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs he said he was qualified for. No job offer materialized, and he started to wonder if he was being automatically excluded in some way – perhaps because of his age or salary requirements. “I felt hopeless. I started to doubt my abilities.”Ronnie Riley, a 29-year-old event planner from Canada, had a gap of several years in their resume because of an illness. Riley applied to more than 100 event planning and some administrative assistant jobs in December 2021, and over 70 jobs in January, but ended up with a total of five interviews and no job offers. They worry the gap is the reason. “It just seems it’s discounting a whole bunch of people that could be perfect for the job,” they said.Fuller’s research has helped provide answers to how exactly automatic rejections occur. One reason, he found, is that too often, job descriptions include too many criteria and skills. Many employers add new skills and criteria to existing job descriptions, building a long list of requirements. Algorithms end up rejecting many qualified applicants who may be missing just a couple of skills from the list.One executive Fuller spoke with said their company’s tool has been rejecting qualified candidates because they scored low in one important category, even when they got a near perfect score in all the other important categories. The company found that it was left with job applicants who received mediocre scores across the board. (Longer job descriptions may also deter more female applicants, Fuller believes, since many women apply to jobs only when they fulfill most of the requirements.)Another reason qualified candidates are rejected by automated systems are so-called knockout criteria. In Fuller’s research, he found that almost 50% of the executives surveyed acknowledged that their automatic systems reject job applicants outright who have a work gap longer than six months on their resumes. These applicants never get in front of a hiring manager, even if they are the most qualified candidates for the job.“The six month gap is a really insidious filter,” said Fuller, since it’s probably built on the assumption that a gap signifies something ominous, but may simply represent military deployments, pregnancy complications, caregiving obligations or illness.Experts contacted by the Guardian also described automatic resume screeners making mistakes similar to the infamous Amazon example, rooted in learning biases from an existing dataset. This hints at how these programs could end up enforcing the kinds of racial and gender biases observed with other AI tools, such as facial recognition tech and algorithms used in health care.John Scott is the chief operating officer of APMetrics, an organization that helps companies identify talent, and is often brought in by larger companies to check if new technologies the company wants to buy from a vendor are fair and legal. Scott has examined multiple resume screeners and recruiting tools and discovered problems in all of them. He found biased criteria unrelated to work, such as the name Thomas and the keyword church, to “predict” success in a job.Mark Girouard, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis, found that the name Jared and having played lacrosse in high school were used as predictors of success in one system.Martin Burch, the London jobseeker, discovered he had been weeded out in a different way.He contacted a human recruiter at Bloomberg and asked her to look at his CV. His experience lined up with the job description and this was a direct competitor, making his background all the more valuable, he thought. But the problem turned out to be the pattern-finding and personality test he had taken, which was created by Plum.A recruiter at Bloomberg replied: “I can see that your application was rejected due to not meeting our benchmark in the Plum assessment that you completed. Unfortunately on that basis we are not able to take your application any further.” Burch felt stunned that he had indeed been rejected by a piece of code.He retained a lawyer, and in communications with Bloomberg asked for a human review of his application.Bloomberg informed Burch that the role he applied for was no longer available and he wouldn’t be able to be considered for it.Bloomberg did not return emails and calls asking for comment.As adoption of AI tools in hiring expands, lawmakers are starting to take a closer look. In the UK, the government is planning new regulation of algorithmic decision making. In the US, a recent local law requires employers to inform job seekers how their application materials are screened by AI upon request. And congressional lawmakers have introduced bills that would regulate AI in hiring at a national level, including the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022, but have faced hurdles getting them passed.Burch decided to file an official claim with the Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent organization that upholds privacy laws in the UK. In February the office reprimanded Bloomberg, writing: “From reviewing the information provided, it is our decision that there is more work for you to do. As such, we now expect you to take steps to address any outstanding issues with the individual.”Burch has since accepted £8,000 ($9,864) in compensation from the company. He says he also fought to demonstrate a point: “I am trying to prove to them that it’s probably weeding out good candidates so they should probably stop using it.”Plum’s CEO Caitlin MacGregor declined to comment on Burch’s case directly, citing privacy concerns, but she stands behind her product: “I should not be interviewing somebody that is a 35, regardless of how much experience they have. There is somewhere else that they are going to be their own 95 [percent] match.”How to write a resume in the age of AI

Instead of trying to stand out, make your resume machine-readable: no images, no special characters such as ampersands or tildes. Use the most common template. Use short, crisp sentences – declarative and quantitative, said Ian Siegel, CEO of the job platform ZipRecruiter

List licenses and certifications on your resume

Make sure your resume matches the keywords in the job description and compare your resume to the job description using online resume scanners to see if you are a match for the role

For entry-level and administrative jobs, consider stating that you are competent in Microsoft office suite applications even if it’s not in the job description, said Harvard business professor Joe Fuller.

Humanity should get the best from AI, not the worst - UN disability rights expert

        Special Rapporteur on disability          








Artificial intelligence has fundamentally altered the terms of existence for human beings, said UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities Gerard Quinn.
“New technologies can be of enormous benefit to persons with disabilities and drive the search for inclusive equality across a broad range of fields such as employment, education and independent living,” he said. “However, there are many well-known discriminatory impacts.”
Quinn made his statement during a presentation of his report to the Human Rights Council. In his report, Quinn defined artificial intelligence, or AI, as machines made to work “in the same or a similar way to humans, only faster, better and more reliably and, theoretically, without human bias.”
While there is growing awareness of the human rights challenges that these new technologies can pose, Quinn said the discussion should shift to focus on the specific challenges these new technologies pose to the rights of people with disabilities, as provided by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These include the rights to privacy, autonomy, education, employment, health, independent living, participation
AI enabled systems have had positive impacts on the lives of people with disabilities.   Quinn pointed out that, “blockages that we formerly thought of as insurmountable are suddenly scalable.”
These include assistive technology that improve the mobility of blind individuals. Adaptive learning platforms also provide personalised learning experiences tailored to the specific needs of students with disabilities. Further, AI powered robots and other tools provide home-based care and other assistance, allowing people with disabilities to live independently.
However, AI is made ‘smart’ through a process of machine learning dependent on a set of training data, or ‘algorithms’, that often includes “data shaped by prior human decisions and value judgements that may be faulted on many grounds,” Quinn said.
AI tools can still carry human biases and be exclusionary towards people with disabilities as a result, the report states. One example was in employment, where recruitment processes increasingly use algorithms to filter out candidates.
“The predicates that underpin the algorithms that drive Artificial Intelligence can reflect and embed ableist assumptions (and indeed ageist assumptions). Disability can be ‘seen’ by the technology as deviant and therefore unwelcome,” Quinn said. “[Persons with disabilities] may be ruled out of consideration for employment without ever considering their merits and whether a ‘reasonable accommodation’ might assist in enabling them to perform the essential functions of a job.”
In his report, Quinn proposes a way forward to realize the practical benefits of AI for people with disabilities by placing their human rights at the centre of the debate around new technologies.
 In other recommendations, he urged States to include disability in their artificial intelligence strategies and to continue applying their obligation of ‘reasonable accommodation’, as well as explicitly taking disability into account when purchasing AI products and services.
“Most importantly, we call for a new space – a collaborative space – between the corporate sector, Government and civil society – to work through and realize the positive benefits of the technology and to take active steps to reverse some its known negative impacts and to avoid such impacts into the future,” he added.
“Otherwise, the ‘furthest left behind’ will simply have no chance to catch up.  Given the promise of the technology, this would be a tragedy for humanity.”

Artificial intelligence/machine learning reduces mistakes and waste
AI/ML systems not only use vision to guide robotics in pick-and-place, but also can simultaneously make intelligent quality decisions

Good data—and lots of it—is key to making artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) production, inspection and packaging systems work without a hitch, plus well written algorithms to analyze the data and make decisions that will help people and machines function more intelligently. In fact, 3-D vision systems are usually the “eyes” robots use to guide them as they sort and package products or load pallets—3-D because it provides much more data to make intelligent decisions quickly.Processors are keenly interested in getting their products perfect before packaging, and AI/ML can play a part in production monitoring. “I think we will begin seeing a lot more utilization of AI/ML to improve product quality and consistency,” says Jason Prince, Golden State Foods director of operations, protein products. “For instance, adjusting product pressure automatically to achieve a very specific product thickness or weight, given a set of ever-changing variables such as product temperature and density. This would ensure that the finished product is consistent over time, despite changing raw material characteristics. Adjustments will be able to be made in near real time and eliminate the time required for a quality check to be completed and then an operator adjustment to be made.”

AI is currently being deployed to determine weight trends in a product as it is picked and placed, according to Jeff Hawkins, FESTO global accounts manager. But AI can also be used as a nonstructural reporting center. An example would be multiple sensors monitoring the process of chocolate candy bars. As the point cloud distribution plots millions of points of data, a trend begins to take shape. The data then displays the trend in layman’s terms. A terminal may read: “AI/ML has noticed that size and weight of the candy bar may also vary because of a slight change in the exterior color of the candy bar.” Now the candy maker can sort for proper color shade to make sure the product meets expectations. The vision system, in addition to measuring the physical dimensions, alerts for color variances.What are AI’s weak points? Hawkins suggests that the limitations of AI are mostly in trying to over-analyze the data, and thus nothing can be derived because the data set exceeds the actionable use case.Inspection a chief role for AI/ML in packaging systemsIf you ask a system integrator (SI) like Craig Souser, president and CEO of JLS Automation, what is a key element in AI/ML in packaging systems, he’ll tell you vision systems—and several camera systems today have deep learning built in and enabled. “The role of AI/ML produces better quality control in inspection systems—improve inspection to decrease the number of rejects that are actually OK—shades of gray instead of go/no go.” Deep learning algorithms embedded in modern camera systems, especially 3D, allow for more qualitative analysis and can help adjust parameters in lieu of a somewhat highly trained technician having to make the same adjustments, says Souser. The real advantage of this is that it can be done continuously—versus a technician who will only see a snapshot of the various attributes at whatever time he/she is looking at the images or historical data versus real time. So, it’s a great way to modify vision parameters and accept good products or packages versus rejecting them as the parameters may have been too tight when the technician last updated the values. It actually makes specific values in recipes less critical as the machine can make adjustments as soon as a run starts and immediately optimize the inspection.

The use of vision systems combined with robotics—not only for robotic picking and placing—but for quality inspections are key areas of focus for SIs, says Gregory Powers, VP, digital transformation at Gray Solutions, a Gray Company. “Any repeatable tasks that involve patterns provide opportunities for vision systems to increase efficiencies. Through a large number of samples, vision systems can learn patterns and adjust accordingly.”The use of vision systems with AI/ML is becoming more common in robotic pick-and-place applications, where in the past, for example, operators performed labor-intensive manual inspections as they placed food items in a package all day long. “Vision systems have come a long way in the past few years, and we expect this trend to continue,” says Powers. “For example, we’re currently looking at new technologies in vision systems where we can see abnormities that the naked eye cannot see.”

Advantages of AI/ML are endless, adds Powers. Efficiency gains in reducing downtime and improving the quality in product, as well as the all-around labor savings that can be achieved through AI/ML prove to be advantageous for companies today. Implementing AI/ML for robotics and inspection is getting easier too. “AI/ML are getting more plug-and-play, especially in the area of vision systems,” says Powers. Programming these units is much easier and allows for ease of implementation with advanced learning algorithms. Some of the more advanced software companies are installing their own devices on equipment to directly monitor possible issues. Equipment providers are also following this approach. With all that said, data and the access to it can be problematic, according to Powers. “As cybersecurity is a big concern with the companies, getting data out of the plants becomes even harder. IT groups are hesitant to open port channels for data to be collected from equipment. In most cases, equipment providers already have data scientists in place to help make decisions on the equipment, but changing parameters on the equipment directly is not being widely adopted yet.”Making the software simpler to use: a real-world exampleWhile AI/ML is becoming easier to implement, it still depends on software programmers and engineers to do the heavy lifting so SIs and end users don’t have to write code. One such vendor, Pleora Technologies, writes the code and algorithms that can be used with camera systems. “AI/ML are getting more plug-and-play, especially in the area of vision systems.” -- Gregory Powers, VP of digital transformation, Gray SolutionsPleora has several AI applications in packaging, labeling and product inspection. In one application, a distillery is using the AI system for visual inspection to add decision-support to human processes during in-process and final inspection, according to Ed Goffin, manager, marketing at Pleora Technologies.For the distillery, a main concern is maintaining a consistent brand appearance so they can ensure a premium spot on a store shelf. The distillery uses a bottle designed after an old-fashioned milk bottle, with distinctive and eye-catching labelling. The bottle has three brand elements, with a main label and cap label applied by machine. A human then has to accurately place an emblem logo that visually aligns with corresponding brand elements on the other labels to ensure a consistent and appealing shelf display. With multiple products and short manufacturing runs, Goffin says it’s not economical for the distillery to fully automate its labelling process.Without requiring any programming skills, the distillery quality manager and operator trained the AI system’s inspection app to add decision-support for its labelling process. With just one image of a known good product—a “golden reference”—the system automatically identifies the key brand elements on the bottle. The app has been customized to then add a graphic overlay on the visual display that highlights and guides the correct placement for the medallion label for the operator. AI-based visual inspection ensures brand consistency and accuracy for the distillery, as well as cost-savings as labelling does not have to removed and replaced due to human error. The technology is also being used by the manufacturer as a training tool for new operators, so they can quickly understand the proper positioning of brand elements on the bottle and the difference between “good and bad” products. Overall, in this application, AI adds consistent decision-support to manual tasks to reduce human errors that result in higher costs and slower production.We’ve reviewed primarily standalone applications within a plant, but AI/ML doesn’t have to be relegated to just packaging and inspection at a single point. Berk Birand, founder and CEO of Fero Labs suggests that ML can be applied in scenarios where food products are processed across multiple stages, each affecting a food’s qualities and chemical composition. So, rather than focusing on a single machine or work cell, AI/ML can be applied to all stages of the production, processing data from all the machines and optimizing a process from end to end, creating the optimal chemistry of a food product. With increasing CPU performance and memory densities plus the availability of all types of wired and wireless sensors, successful AI/ML applications will continue to increase with the only limitation being human creativity, which so far has shown no bounds.

        Universal Human Rights Index          

        Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals          











How do you manage ever-growing amounts of human rights guidance, including almost 180,000 individual observations and recommendations from UN human rights mechanisms, and ensure easy access to everyone, including the general public, governments, NGOs and UN agencies? At the same time, how do you ensure this guidance has a real and positive impact on human rights worldwide?
One of the solutions, for UN Human Rights, lay in an innovative partnership with the Danish Institute of Human Rights and a Danish social enterprise called Specialisterne (“The Specialists”), an organisation which works with consultants on the autism spectrum who are skilled in solving challenging data puzzles.
When the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015, one of UN Human Rights’ aims was to make human rights guidance available to inform the national policies needed to implement them.
The result is that today, the Universal Human Rights Index (UHRI), the world’s largest and most comprehensive human rights database of guidance from the human rights mechanisms, is being powered by artificial intelligence, showing the links between this guidance and the SDGs.
Prior to this, the tens of thousands of observations and recommendations the Universal Periodic Review, Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures were being manually tagged, with OHCHR staff spending hours, days, weeks and months analysing and inputting information.
While this work is gradually being replaced by artificial intelligence, Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, Director of Human Rights Council and Treaty Mechanisms Division at UN Human Rights, explains that “While we are expecting to save thousands of hours in manual work, human rights experts will continue to undertake quality checks at every stage, which in turn further refines the precision of the algorithm.”

Make human rights more accessible
The partnership between UN Human Rights, the Danish Institute of Human Rights and Specialisterne began in 2017. It brought together a great diversity of skills, knowledge and approaches.
“We are talking about a level of information that no one human being can possibly digest,” says Birgitte Feiring, Director of Human Rights and Sustainable Development at the Danish Institute for Human Rights. “In pulling together these three very different organisations, at the end of the day, our common goal is to make human rights more accessible to rights holders, and to help them bring governments to account.”
For Feiring, the new algorithm makes human rights analysis, programming and planning much easier for governments. “When governments have to design a plan for sustainable development, for example, or for sustainable recovery from COVID-19, in a few clicks, they can find out what are the human rights problems facing older persons, or what the issues are related to access to healthcare and vaccines. They are also directed to the solutions, as advised by the various human rights mechanisms.”
The brain behind the algorithm
The individual who developed the algorithm – called ‘TextClassify’ – is physicist Niels Jørgen Kjær. Previously employed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the capacity of High Energy Physicist, he now uses his expertise working for Specialisterne.

“The most challenging part of the algorithm was to make it scalable to very large data sets,” explains Kjær.
He says the central ingredient was the development of a fast multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, called ‘Mahjong.’ Mahjong evaluates an optimisation step in about 10 microseconds, and makes tests on millions of word combinations feasible.
The result is an algorithm that Kjær says can “handle millions of text snippets and thousands of categories, and still run everything in seconds on a PC.”
Unique brains key to success








Specialisterne is a self-described ‘socially innovative company’ where the majority of staff have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. The company was founded in 2003 with the objective of providing better jobs and working conditions for neurodiverse talent.
According to CEO Carsten Lassen, autistic individuals are often known to find creative solutions and unusual perspectives in problem-solving when in the right work environment.

“I often hear autistic persons say that their brain works like an algorithm, in that it tends to work in a more binary way than the neurotypical brain: if it’s not absolutely right, then it’s wrong. That’s exactly how algorithms are built and that’s the foundation for all programming,” Lassen says.
What does the algorithm do?
Because of the new algorithm, it is now possible to easily explore how human rights guidance can boost implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by country, theme, or group of affected persons.
The UHRI now shows the concrete linkages between individual recommendations issued by UN human rights mechanisms and the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda.
“For us it has been of great support to benefit from the innovations developed by our partners,” says Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, UN Human Rights. “Machine learning can dramatically improve efficiency and enable us to analyse and present the human rights work of the mechanisms in more accessible and visual ways.”
“We are proud to be part of a project where we can show the potential of this technology to promote human rights work,” says Cissé-Gouro. “We are particularly happy that the algorithm we are using has been developed in a way that provides a high degree of transparency and enables meaningful human oversight.”
For the future? UN Human Rights will continue to expand its work using the algorithm.
“The successful experience of integrating the algorithm on the UHRI has been a milestone for us,” explains Cissé-Gouro. “It continues to inspire our thinking on how we can analyse and present human rights guidance and information. We look forward to expand this work with our partners in the future driven by the aspiration of leaving no one behind.”

Posted May 8, 2022 1:34 pm.




Alberta is investing in the province’s first artificial intelligence (AI) lab, also known as GovLab.ai.


The initiative was launched as part of the Alberta Technology Innovation Strategy and alongside AltaML, which is a Canadian artificial intelligence company.
The AI lab’s goal is to shape Alberta’s digital future, according to a government release.
AltaML will work with government, post-secondary students, and recent graduates as they work to develop products and services that would use AI to solve complex, real-world problems.
The lab hopes to create intellectual property and also boost Alberta’s economy.
“Strengthening Alberta’s position as a leader in artificial intelligence is a key objective of the Alberta Technology and Innovation Strategy. By providing opportunities for students and government staff to build skill sets, we are moving our province forward and building an economy for the future,” said Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Jobs, Economy and Innovation.
The Alberta government will invest $3.4 million annually into GovLab.ai and in partnership with Mitacs, hopes to support job opportunities for post-secondary students.
Mitacs is a Canadian non-profit research organization that partners with academia, private industry and government to provide training programs in industrial and social innovation.
AltaML estimates that AI will yield approximately $100 million in benefits for Alberta over the next five years.
GovLab.ai’s purpose is to encourage the growth of machine learning and AI skills, which are becoming increasingly in demand in Alberta and around the world.

One of the features of the new tech lab is a talent accelerator for public service professionals, post-secondary students and recent graduates, the province says.
Students will have the ability to get hands-on experience in developing solutions.
“We are excited to work with the Government of Alberta and AltaML on GovLab.ai.,” said John Hepburn, CEO of Mitacs. “Innovation is an incredibly important part of Alberta and Canada’s future and this new collaboration will give students an opportunity to develop the hands-on skills that will be vital to solving society’s biggest problems.”
