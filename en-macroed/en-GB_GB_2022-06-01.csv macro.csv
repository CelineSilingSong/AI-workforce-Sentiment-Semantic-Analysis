Sci-fi books and movies going all the way back to Kurt Vonnegut’s Player Piano portray a world where workers have been replaced by machines (or in some instances, just one machine). More recently, these ideas have moved from the annals of novels into the predictive economic papers of governments and consulting firms. In 2016, the Obama administration authored a report warning that the robots were coming, and that millions of Americans could soon be out of a job. In 2021, McKinsey predicted that algorithms and androids would vaporize 45 million jobs by 2030. And the Brookings Institute prophesied in a 2019 study that 52 million U.S. jobs would be affected by algorithms by 2030. While no one can agree on exactly when the robots will take over, or how many jobs they will swallow up, the assumption has generally been that garbage collectors, bus drivers, and interstate truckers will be among the first to lose their livelihoods to A.I. Lately, however, it’s starting to look as if people like me—creatives—are even more imminently in danger. Over the past few months, new advancements in A.I. have made it clear that writers, illustrators, photographers, journalists, and novelists could soon be driven from the workforce and replaced by high-tech player pianos.Don’t believe me? Just read the opening of this short story:It was late when I first heard the loud clicking noise coming from outside. As I looked out of my bedroom window, the tall grass swayed in an unseen breeze. And then, a shadow passed over it—which is when I saw it. A creature standing just outside the window, staring right at me. Its eyes were deep red with a venomous glow; they seemed to burn with a fire that made me shudder. The creature’s body was black as coal, with a large, thin tail near its rear. It hissed at me and tapped its long, sharp claws impatiently on a tree trunk. I grabbed the nearest weapon I could find—a baseball bat—and headed outside. The creature’s breath reeked of sulfur, and its hushed breathing carried an echo of a crackling campfire. When it saw me, its feet hit the soil with thundering booms as if a skyscraper had crashed to the earth with each footfall. It lunged forward at me; its claws slashing wildly in the air.AdvertisementThat paragraph wasn’t written by an MFA, or a sci-fi author, but rather by a new online machine-learning platform called Sudowrite, which is billed as a tool to help with the creative-writing process. For the above paragraph, I wrote the first sentence—about the loud clicking noise—and the A.I. wrote the rest. The technology works using a platform from OpenAI, an artificial-intelligence research laboratory with a billion dollars in funding from Microsoft, and investments from Elon Musk. More specifically, it’s built on GPT-3, a component of the company that focuses on text. GPT-3 scrapes billions of words and learns from them using natural-language processing. Then, it gets to work. After reading Sudowrite’s first draft, I said I wanted more description. So the A.I. suggested we add some “smells,” and revised the text accordingly in a few seconds. While the story isn’t Pulitzer Prize–worthy (yet), I was startled by the algorithm’s ability to turn phrases like “the tall grass swayed in an unseen breeze” and “its hushed breathing carried an echo of a crackling campfire.”HiveWhere Wall Street, Washington, and Silicon Valley meet.Enter your e-mailSign UpBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Another OpenAI tool currently being likened to magic by people in Silicon Valley is a visual platform called Dall-E. Using a version of GPT-3, Dall-E can create truly astounding renditions of artworks and illustrations. Like GPT-3, Dall-E has learned how to draw and paint by combing through billions of images. It’s now conversant in styles, objects, shapes—you name it. Just type a set of commands into Dall-E, and it will nearly instantaneously generate an image to illustrate them. For example, if you ask it to draw “an astronaut riding a horse in a photorealistic style,” it will create several options to choose from. If you tell it to instead make a “pencil drawing,” it will render new images in that style. You can order up stained glass, spray paint, Play-Doh, cave drawings, or paintings in the style of Monet. You can replace the astronaut with a teddy bear. A dog. Elon Musk. Or have the horse riding a horse. The possibilities are endless, and the end results are terrifyingly impressive—so much so that one of the top questions associated with a Google search of the platform is “Is Dall-E fake?”Watch Now: Andy Serkis Breaks Down a Fight Scene from 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage'These new technologies have scrambled our assumptions about creativity and computers. Philosophers have long believed that computers would never be able to create “art” because machines don’t have emotions. They don’t feel pain or joy; therefore, they can’t express those feelings in a creative way. As it turns out, however, computers don’t need feelings to make art. They can simply copy what humans have already made. “It’s not so much that the computer is ‘thinking’ like a human artist,” said Hod Lipson, a scientist who specializes in artificial intelligence and robotics at Columbia University. “It’s more that they are producing output based on what they have seen.”Now, I have to be honest. I didn’t interview Hod Lipson. I didn’t even search the web for his quote. Instead, I asked another GPT-3-powered program called ShortlyAI to write a post for me about algorithms replacing journalists and artists. The algorithm found Lipson’s work, read his research papers, videos, talks, and interviews, and selected this quote as the most compelling to add to this piece. When I reached out to Lipson to see if this was something he said, and that the A.I. hadn’t just made it up, Lipson said it was accurate, but noted that a more accurate point would be to say that “it’s more that, like a human, the computer too is producing output based on what it has experienced.” Here’s what else the A.I. wrote:Most PopularAward SeasonViggo Mortensen Speaks His Mind: On Amazon’s “Shameful” Decision, Green Book’s “Disingenuous” Critics, and Indie Film’s Unclear FutureBy David CanfieldCelebrityMethod Man Talks Wu-Tang Clan, Working With ODB’s Son, and the “Uncomfortable Subject” of Martin Shkreli’s Auctioned AlbumBy Lisa RobinsonMoviesAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in NightbitchBy Hillary BusisRobots, machine learning, and other A.G.I.s (artificial general intelligence) will soon be writing daily news stories about stocks, sports scores, weather-related events and a variety of breaking news alerts. In the next decade or less, artificial intelligence will make huge strides in their capability to produce high-quality written news. This will bring an end to the era of the journalist as we know it. The difference between A.G.I.s and journalists is the ability to comprehend and absorb information, not just to report it. An A.G.I. will be able to understand the “what” of a story, as well as its “why,” without breaking a sweat over details, because it simply doesn’t care about them in terms of story-writing.

      See, now you’re wondering which parts of this column I wrote, and which ones were written by a computer. Amit Gupta, the cofounder of Sudowrite, believes that these writing platforms won’t completely replace humans. Instead, this new tech will supplement our all-too-human efforts, not unlike the way the predictive text on an iPhone does. “Financial reporting and sports reporting will be the first to be sent to automation because they are a little bit more rote,” Gupta said, but he thinks that most journalism will be produced in conjunction with, rather than completely by, A.I.—at least for the foreseeable future. “Auto-complete is already kind of working its way into Google Docs and Gmail; that type of A.I. writing is going to be ubiquitous, so as I’m writing a story, it will say, ‘Oh, here’s a potential quote.’” (Yes, I did actually interview Gupta for this piece.)GPT-3 is far from perfect. It can be wonky, repetitive, even racist. As TechCrunch noted in 2020, GPT-3 language models have associated the word Islam with terrorism, and female pronouns with the word naughty. That’s because it’s crawling text that has been written by humans in the past. These platforms are learning not from other A.I. entities but from us—which has its upsides from a creative standpoint, and its downsides from a humans-are-jerks perspective. Dall-E’s own documentation warns that words like personal assistant and flight attendant will generate images of women, and words like CEO will likely give you white men.Those issues may give you and me pause, but they aren’t doing much to slow the technology’s evolution. Last week, Google announced its own text-to-image platform, called Imagen, which is just as impressive (and scary) as Dall-E. If anything, Imagen’s photorealistic images are even more indistinguishable from the real thing.For now, the companies behind these image platforms aren’t making them available to the public—mostly while they work out the kinks, but also, as Google has noted, while they work on ways to prevent the software from being used for nefarious purposes. “Datasets of this nature often reflect social stereotypes, oppressive viewpoints, and derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups,” Google said in its latest announcement about its software. “[This] guides our decision to not release Imagen for public use without further safeguards in place.”Once these services are publicly available, all bets will be off. Think about the speed with which fake news obliterated trust in the journalism landscape online during the 2016 election cycle. An A.I. that can create fake images indistinguishable from real ones could have disastrous effects on the public’s ability to separate fact from fiction. I don’t even want to imagine what kind of horrifying imagery the QAnon folks could dream up, let alone the denizens of 4Chan and other bowels of the internet. I’m sure Russia would have a field day with this tech too. As with all new technologies, there will be good and bad results. The question is, will the creators of these platforms be able to discover the negatives before this tech is released into the public? (Which, let’s be honest, has never happened before in technological history.) Perhaps it will take years to foresee all the potential outcomes of these services. There’s a fun irony in the thought that the only thing saving our jobs from being replaced by algorithms is the fear that humans will do terrible things with the technology.Some early experiments point to positive and creative applications. GPT-3 was recently used to create a new song with lyrics written and rapped by an A.I. Eminem—it isn’t half bad. There’s also an A.I.-written play now being performed in London that supposedly asks what technology can teach us about ourselves. (A notice to ticket buyers warns ominously that the play “may contain strong language, homophobia, racism, sexism, ableism, and references to sex and violence.”) One group, called Calamity A.I., is using GPT-3 to write screenplays that are then filmed with actors—as you can see from “Lady Bird: A Lost Scene Written by Artificial Intelligence,” the A.I. isn’t quite at the level of Greta Gerwig. But the same software did come up with a relatively delicious chocolate-chip-cookie recipe. There are other iterations of OpenAI technology used to generate music from scratch, like Jukebox, which can write its own music, including singing and instruments in numerous genres and styles.As someone who has been covering new technologies for more than 20 years, I’ve seen a lot of contraptions, apps, sites, platforms, and newfangled inventions, and few have ever felt like they would change the way we live. Twitter, the iPhone, and driverless cars have been among the handful of standouts. The more I see of these new machine-learning algorithms, though, the more I realize that the future is coming quickly. And in that future, a good number of people could lose their jobs—not to mention their grasp of what originated in the mind of a human or a machine. Soon, you’ll be asking yourself every time you read an article, Did a human write this, or did an algorithm? The answer is: You’ll never know.More Great Stories From Vanity FairWhere Do the Obamas Stand on Joe Biden? “The Silence Is Deafening”Peter Thiel, J.D.

As someone who has been covering new technologies for more than 20 years, I’ve seen a lot of contraptions, apps, sites, platforms, and newfangled inventions, and few have ever felt like they would change the way we live. Twitter, the iPhone, and driverless cars have been among the handful of standouts. The more I see of these new machine-learning algorithms, though, the more I realize that the future is coming quickly. And in that future, a good number of people could lose their jobs—not to mention their grasp of what originated in the mind of a human or a machine. Soon, you’ll be asking yourself every time you read an article, Did a human write this, or did an algorithm?

It is impossible to overestimate the importance of artificial intelligence in the corporate world and in modern human lives. Serhii Pospielov, AI practice lead at Exadel, examines the top ten challenges enterprises face in AI development and implementation and shares ten ways to overcome them.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating the business world across different industries, from banking and finance to healthcare and media, with goals to improve efficiency and increase profitability, among others. 
Fifty percent of respondents in The state of AI in 2020Opens a new window  global survey by McKinsey reported that “their companies have adopted AI in at least one business function”; the numbers are forecasted to keep growing in the coming years, doubling the revenues generated by AI. 
Companies are going to continue implementing AI in business. However, despite its huge potential, AI also creates development and implementation challenges. 
Ten Challenges (and Solutions) for AI Implementation and Development
If you’re thinking of artificial intelligence app development for your company, you’ll likely come across some obstacles. Understanding them beforehand may ease your work. These are the most common problems with AI development and implementation you might encounter and ways in which you can manage them:
1. Determining the right data set 
Data quality and availability are necessities for AI capabilities. For a company to ensure the most efficient and timely AI capabilities, it should use the right data sets and have a trusted source of relevant data that are clean, accessible, well-governed, and secured. Unfortunately, it is impossible to configure AI algorithms to control the flow of low-quality and inaccurate data; but businesses can get in touch with AI experts and work with the owners of different data sources to overcome the challenges of implementing AI. 
2. The bias problem
The quality of AI systems depends on the data they are trained on. Good data are key to good artificial intelligence development services. If good data are lacking, companies face numerous AI implementation challenges stemming from biases — anomalies in the output of ML algorithmsOpens a new window  when producing results based on discriminatory assumptions made during the machine learning process or prejudices in the training data. Low-quality data often go along with racial, gender, communal, and ethnic biases.
Such biases must be eliminated. Real change may come either from training the AI systems with unbiased data or from the development of easily-explained algorithms that can be easily read. Furthermore, many companies that develop artificial intelligence invest heavily in developing control frameworks and techniques to drive better trust and transparency and to identify bias in AI algorithms.
3. Data security and storage
Most artificial intelligence development services rely on the availability of large amounts of data to train the algorithms. Although generating large volumes of data provides better business opportunities, on the one hand, it simultaneously creates data storage and security issues on the other. The more data is generated and the more users have access, the higher the chances of data leakage into the hands of someone on the dark web. Data security and data storage issues have reached a global scale, as this data is generated from millions of users around the globe. This is why businesses need to ensure that the best data management environment for sensitive data and training algorithms for AI applications are being used.

4. Infrastructure
Artificial intelligence-based solutions change our lives and provide daily utility through high internet speeds. AI systems achieve these speeds under the condition that a company has suitable infrastructure and premium processing capabilities. However, most organizations still rely on outdated infrastructures, applications, and devices to run their IT operations, as management often gets scared of the expenses needed to update the systems, choosing instead to reject implementing AI at all. Although companies that develop artificial intelligence or adopt it should be ready to bring their IT services to a new level, replacing outdated infrastructure with traditional legacy systems remains one of the biggest challenges for many IT companies.
5. AI integration
Challenges with implementing AI in business first arise from the necessity of integrating AI into existing systems. It requires the support of AI solutions providers with extensive experience and expertise. Transitioning to AI is more complicated than just adding new plugins to the current website. Infrastructure, data storage, and data input should be considered and secured from negative effects. Compatibility with all AI requirements, as well as smooth operation of the current systems, must be ensured. Additionally, once the transition is over, the employees must be given proper training on working with the new system.
6. Computation
The information technology industry encounters many challenges and constantly needs to keep updating. No other industry has developed as fast. But achieving the computing power to process the vast volumes of data necessary for building AI systems is the biggest challenge that the industry has ever faced. Reaching and financing that level of computation can be challenging, especially for startups and small-budget companies. 
7. Niche skillset 
Searching for and training people with the proper skillset and expertise for artificial intelligence implementation and deployment is one of the most frequently-referenced challenges. A lack of knowledge prevents organizations from adopting AI technologies smoothly and hinders organizations on their AI journey. Because this is a significant challenge in the IT industry, companies should think about spending additional budget on artificial intelligence app development training, hiring AI development talents, or buying and licensing capabilities from bigger IT companies.
8. Expensive and rare
As mentioned above, AI integration, deploymentOpens a new window , and implementation require a specialist like a data scientist or a data engineer with a certain level of skills and expertise. One of the major challenges with implementing AI in business is that these experts are expensive and currently quite rare in the IT market. Companies with a small budget, then, face a challenge to bring in the suitable specialists that the project requires. Moreover, once you decide to implement or develop an AI-based system, you’ll have to provide constant training, which may require rare high-end specialists.
9. Legal issues
There are a lot of legal concerns around artificial intelligence app development and implementation that companies need to be concerned about. The data the algorithms collect from users are very sensitive. Erroneous algorithms and data governance systems installed in AI applications will always make incorrect predictions and bring losses to the company’s profit. Moreover, it can violate laws or regulations, putting the organization in the trap of legal challenges.
10. Explainability
It’s human nature to trust only things that are easily understood. One of the critical AI implementation challenges is the unknown nature of how deep learning models and a set of inputs can predict the output and formulate a solution for a problem. Explainability in AI is required to provide transparency in AI decisions, as well as the algorithms that lead to them. This means that organizations must work on the policies that inspect the impact of artificial intelligence on decision making, provide frequent audits of their systems, and have regular training.  
The AI Implementation Roadmap
Artificial intelligence app development has become a part of IT industry life. Nevertheless, businesses have to learn how AI works and how to overcome AI implementation challenges and AI development challenges with minimal risks and losses. There’s no doubt that the AI implementation roadmap can be tricky, but getting familiar with the challenges beforehand and adopting a step-by-step AI implementation strategy can ease the process.

It’s part rave and part science exhibit, a school-bus-sized feat of engineering glowing on the dusty playa. Called Dr. Brainlove, it’s one of the art cars of the Burning Man Festival, a drivable, surrealist piece created specifically for this yearly event focused on community, art, and self-expression. Even at a distance, the geometric jungle gym structure quite clearly resembles a human brain. The Atlantic magazine called Dr. Brainlove “the most Burning Man thing ever,” even more so than the soaring wooden ""temples"" that spring up overnight in the desert only to be purposely lit on fire, the temporary semicircular encampment lined with streets called “freak show” and “hanky panky,” or attendees cosplaying as aliens, faeries, and cyberpunks.Dr. Brainlove rolls through the desert at Burning Man. (Photo courtesy of Tom Bishop)  An early sketch of Dr. Brainlove drawn by Asako Miyakawa. (Image courtesy of Asako Miyakawa) But Dr. Brainlove is more than a colorful addition to a far-out festival. It aims to stop attendees in their tracks, encourages them to consider how their own brains constantly process information, and hopefully inspires them to learn more about neuroscience. The actual brain behind Dr. Brainlove belongs to scientist Natalia Bilenko, who volunteered her own MRI brain scans to the project team of over 100 scientists, engineers, and artists that created this rolling art installation.“Thinking about art as a medium for communication of technology and making technology more accessible, that has always appealed to me,” says Bilenko.In addition to the large but not exactly street-legal Dr. Brainlove vehicle, she helped engineer a smaller four-foot version, called “MiniBrainlove,” which debuted at the Bay Area Science Festival in 2014, and brought a tabletop version (“MicroBrainlove”) to the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Bilenko says these efforts are all about encouraging community engagement and participation at the intersection of art and science.She also co-created an exhibit for the San Francisco Exploratorium called Cognitive Technologies, the world's first interactive exhibit to use real-time brain activity. The interdisciplinary project brought together artists and scientists to create an environment for the public that would demystify the “black box” of what’s happening in the human brain. Visitors experimented with cutting-edge scientific tools to understand and extend the human mind. Attendees could use hand gestures to explore a 3D model of a brain created from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, or they could don an electroencephalography (EEG) cap and control a mechanical arm using only their mind. “I can’t help but feel like I’ve just watched magic happen,” wrote a reporter who visited the exhibit.Bilenko (left) and exhibit co-creator James Gao (right) demonstrate how visitors could interact with their exhibit at the Cognitive Technologies exhibit at the San Francisco Exploratorium. Attendees could use gestures to explore the data on the screen. (Photo courtesy of Anja Ulfeldt and the Cognitive Tech group)  Bilenko examines a prototype of Dr. Brainlove, an interactive art car modeled on scans of her own brain. (Photo courtesy of Asako Miyakawa) The desire to understand unseen processes has always interested Bilenko. As a child, she was fascinated with chemistry and studied chemical formulas to better understand what was occurring inside living organisms and in the natural world around her. When she was a teenager, she emigrated from Russia to the United States with her parents and had to navigate the usual challenges of high school while also adapting to a new country and culture. Although she had studied English in school in Russia, “there was discomfort with spoken language that took a while to get over,” she says. Around that time, she became interested in language processing and neuroscience as she noticed that formulas and models could not explain everything she experienced and observed.“What jumps to mind is this word 'ambiguity,'” she says.In college at Brown University, she worked in a neural linguistics lab, studying how the brain interprets ambiguous words like “stable,” which can mean either a shelter for horses or a description of something that doesn't change.“That was the seed for me: thinking about how language is a model of the world, and we have different ways of understanding.” But, she quickly points out, “the problem with models is that they are static representations. The world is not as simple as any model, and it’s constantly changing.”Natalia Bilenko (far left) moderates a discussion with panelists Morgan Klaus Scheuerman (speaking), Hannah Wallach (right), and Vivienne Ming (far right) discuss “Algorithmic inequity and the impacts on the queer community and beyond.” (Photo courtesy of Raphael Gontijo Lopes )Her interest in mental models led her to the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which seeks to train computers to create models that make meaning from information and draw conclusions as effectively as humans. For decades, computers were limited to performing simple tasks with clear rules. Computers struggled to interpret new types of data, and they were easily derailed by ambiguous information or items that fit into several categories. Advances in AI aim to change this, allowing computers to provide ever more sophisticated data back to humans. One of the most difficult challenges in AI is computer vision – a subfield of artificial intelligence that trains computers to identify and recognize people and objects. For example, a computer can be trained to recognize that two photographs – one showing a person with a beard and long hair, the other showing a person with no beard and short hair — are in fact, both images of humans.“I tend to find my personal and professional interests in the spaces between art and technology. Identifying as queer is part of that,” says Bilenko, who identifies as queer and non-binary. “Also being an immigrant, that is part of my experience as well -- being in that in-between place.” Bilenko (center, with microphone) explains the MicoBrainlove art piece to interviewer Mario Milicevic at a SXSW event in Austin, Texas. (Courtesy of IEEE)  Bilenko, Valkyrie Savage, and Berkeley Professor Jack Gallant built off of earlier work in computer vision to train artificial intelligence algorithms to reconstruct images that participants had seen, based on what areas of their brains were activated. Although blurry and imperfect, the images the AI produced were surprisingly close to the original images. As a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of California at Berkeley, Bilenko met students Asako Miyakawa and James Gao, who would become co-creators of Dr. Brainlove and the Cognitive Technologies exhibit. She became a researcher in Professor Jack Gallant’s lab, collaborating with him on a project to train a computer to reconstruct a person’s visual experience by interpreting EEG signals from the brain. The researchers created a computer algorithm that could interpret the brain impulses, match them against visuals collected from thousands of hours of YouTube videos, and generate movies that illustrate likely images based on the impulses.To outside observers, the results looked freakishly like computer-assisted mind reading. While the resulting visualizations were hazy, the work made a big splash in the tech community. It even prompted Mark Zuckerberg to declare that in the future “you’re going to be able to capture a thought.” With his usual techno-optimism, Facebook’s founder envisioned a time when “what you’re thinking or feeling in its ideal and perfect form in your head, [you will] be able to share that with the world in a format where [others can] get that.”Bilenko herself takes a much more pragmatic view: “the mind leaps very quickly to what it could be, but there are a lot of uncomfortable possible possibilities as well,” she says. She is quick to point out that the visually striking findings came from participants who consented to hours and hours of research, and that everyone’s brain is different, so the brain decoding only works if it has been calibrated to each person individually.""There are some grand ideas about what AI could be in the future, and it's important for technologists like me to think about the impacts and repercussions of our work,” she says.After graduating from Berkeley, Bilenko turned her AI skills to a more pressing present-day concern: better screening for heart problems. Moving from the academic lab into industry was important to Bilenko because private companies tend to focus on bringing the immediate, practical applications of new technologies to market. Having been exposed early to science and medicine thanks to her grandfathers – one was an inventor and professor of nanoelectronics, the other a surgeon – her new job drew on her interest in artificial intelligence, healthcare, and innovation. She joined an eight-person medical device company called Bay Labs (now known as Caption Health), which employs AI to make ultrasound scanners easier to use.  Drawing from U.S. Patent no. 1,093,7156 for ""Saliency mapping of imagery during artificially intelligent image classification,"" co-invented by Bilenko and her colleagues when she worked at Caption Health. “Ultrasound-based imaging is really important for early detection,” says Bilenko. “But because people have to be highly trained to use the technology, it’s really costly, and it’s often a problem to get the proper checkups and diagnosis.”The team of engineers at the company met with experienced medical professionals to understand what the experts look for when scanning the heart for problems. They fed the computers reams of visual data from different machines, both clear images and very poor ones.They trained the computers to assess the visuals from the scanners, created an interface that gave real-time guidance to operators on positioning the scanner and confirming if the image captured was clear, and developed a method to sift through the thousands of images captured during the hour-long exam to identify the best ones for medical specialists to review.This new technology could help catch heart problems early and could be particularly impactful for people who live in rural areas far away from experienced cardiologists and ultrasound technicians. “The goal was to create a tool so someone who was not necessarily a fully trained tech could do a checkup that might indicate if a patient should be redirected to a professional, similar to taking your blood pressure,” says Bilenko.The research resulted in three patents for Bilenko and her co-inventors, and the Caption Health AI-guided scanner was named one of the “100 Best Inventions of 2021” by Time Magazine. With heart disease being the leading cause of death in the United States, the work is both cutting edge and potentially lifesaving. Her research also led to two more patents on related technologies, making her a named inventor on five patents before the age of 37.Caption Health's cardiac scanner uses AI to provide real-time feedback to the scanning technician on the quality of the images being collected. The yellow and green indicators in the top left of the scanning screen help technicians confirm they are capturing clear and useful images.

(Photo courtesy of Rachel Kalmar) “I think that a lot of my approach to working with technology is motivated by how to avoid the non-benevolent uses of technology. And there can be a lot of dangers to AI in particular.”The lack of diversity among AI practitioners is a known challenge. Another is the absence of participation and input from those outside the field who might be affected by the technology. While Bilenko’s short purple pixie haircut wasn’t particularly notable amongst the diverse team that brought Dr. Brainlove to Burning Man, it did cause her to stand out when she attended scientific conferences.“AI is a profession that excludes a lot of people from participating, and that’s a huge problem,” she says. Chatting with a handful of non-binary and queer scientists among the thousands attending a key research conference in the field, they brainstormed how to address these issues. The result was “Queer in AI,” a group to support queer researchers and raise awareness of issues in AI and machine learning that might disproportionately affect the queer community. They took their inspiration from other newly created groups like Women in AI (founded in 2016) and Black in AI (founded in 2017).“A lot of the motivation I had for starting the organization Queer in AI with other folks, it was about some of these impacts of technology on people who are marginalized – both in society in general and in access to these technologies.”Queer in AI found that most queer scientists they surveyed do not feel completely welcome in the field, partially due to a lack of a visible community and role models. Since then, Queer in AI members have worked to become a more visible presence in the larger AI community, returning to that conference and others each year to host social gatherings, lead mentoring sessions, and give research talks. The group has created a scholarship fund to help students apply to graduate school in AI and worked to raise awareness of concerns within the queer sub-community of the larger AI community. Through their original research and advocacy, they encourage and highlight new findings to address various concerns, such as the ethical use of AI, privacy and safety, and how binary-based model assumptions can harm members of the queer community. Bilenko notes that algorithm development requires a large volume of data, and sometimes older data includes assumptions based on stereotypes, which then reinforces biased decision making.“It’s not just wrong, but wrong in ways that harm those that are already the most marginalized.” Queer in AI organizers, from left to right: Raphael Gontijo Lopes, William Agnew, and Natalia Bilenko prepare materials for the Queer in AI workshop at the 2019 NeurIPS Conference.The group organizes community building activities and workshops, and provides scholarships for students interested in graduate work in artificial intelligence. (Photo courtesy of Raphael Gontijo Lopes)Through art cars, public exhibits, inventing new medical tools, and now advocacy, Bilenko has worked to bring others into the process of technology development and meaning-making. She views others, including people who provided the personal data that informs the models, as co-creators in an AI-augmented future. She is particularly inspired by concepts such as design justice, which lays out a vision to make marginalized communities central in the development of new technologies, helping to dismantle structural inequality. With experience developing creative ways for non-scientists to explore and understand how AI works, “there’s a way design can be participatory and people can participate in work that may affect them later on.”“The technologies are not really separate from the politics and environment in which they are created,” says Bilenko, making it all-important that everyone is given opportunities to help co-create the future of AI.CreditsProduced by the USPTO’s Office of the Chief Communications Officer.

",NewsArticle,"Intelligent agents! Yes, even one of the topmost cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence has intelligent agents for smart functionalities. Let us know interesting facts on how intelligent agents work in AI models to be more productive with training data..An intelligent agent is known as an entity making smart decisions that allow AI to be put into action efficiently and effectively. It is a software entity conducting operations on behalf of users after examining the environment. Intelligent agents are popular for their capability to learn during the time of performing any activity. Two key roles include perception and action with sub-agents performing low-level activities..Intelligent agents have some important workloads to perform in artificial intelligence such as information access and navigation, decision support and empowerment, repetitive office activities, regular personal workload, search and retrieval of data, management activities, and many more..Yes, IA can perform multiple activities that have made it one of the key tools of IT in the 21st century. There are multiple names that you should know about an intelligent agent including software agents, knowbots, wizards, softbots, and many more. It is making automation of difficult workloads possible to boost productivity and efficiency. It works as five different agents in artificial intelligence such as a simple reflex agent, model-based reflex agent, goal-based agent, utility-based agent, and learning agent..Intelligent agents are also known for working on simple commands through voice-assistant technologies like Alexa, Siri, Google Home, and many more. That being said, you are making intelligent agents work every day with different tasks without having an in-depth knowledge of it. The more you use smart devices, the more you receive the performance from intelligent agents..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
