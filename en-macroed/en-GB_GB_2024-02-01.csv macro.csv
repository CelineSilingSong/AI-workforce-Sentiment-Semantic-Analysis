UK will miss AI goldrush unless Government adopts a more positive vision 
2 February 2024




The Communications and Digital Committee’s report, says large language models will produce epoch defining changes comparable with the invention of the internet.

Enhanced report summary: Advances in AI large language models
Inquiry: Large language models
Communications and Digital Committee

Overview
The Government’s approach to Artificial Intelligence and large language models (LLMs) has become too focused on a narrow view of AI safety. The UK must rebalance towards boosting opportunities while tackling near-term security and societal risks. It will otherwise fail to keep pace with competitors, lose international influence and become strategically dependent on overseas tech firms for a critical technology.
The report issues a stark warning about the “real and growing” risk of regulatory capture, as a multi-billion pound race to dominate the market deepens. Without action to prioritise open competition and transparency, a small number of tech firms may rapidly consolidate control of a critical market and stifle new players, mirroring the challenges seen elsewhere in internet services.
Main findings 
The Committee welcomes the Government’s work on positioning the UK as an AI leader, but says a more positive vision for LLMs is needed to reap the social and economic benefits, and enable the UK to compete globally. Key measures include more support for AI start-ups, boosting computing infrastructure, improving skills, and exploring options for an ‘in-house’ sovereign UK large language model.
The Committee considered the risks around LLMs and says the apocalyptic concerns about threats to human existence are exaggerated and must not distract policy makers from responding to more immediate issues.
The report found there were more limited near-term security risks including cyber attacks, child sexual exploitation material, terrorist content and disinformation. The Committee says catastrophic risks are less likely but cannot be ruled out, noting the possibility of a rapid and uncontrollable proliferation of dangerous capabilities and the lack of early warning indicators. The report called for mandatory safety tests for high-risk models and more focus on safety by design.
The Committee calls on the Government to support copyright holders, saying the Government “cannot sit on its hands” while LLM developers exploit the works of rightsholders. It rebukes tech firms for using data without permission or compensation, and says the Government should end the copyright dispute “definitively” including through legislation if necessary. The report calls for a suite of measures including a way for rightsholders to check training data for copyright breaches, investment in new datasets to encourage tech firms to pay for licensed content, and a requirement for tech firms to declare what their web crawlers are being used for.
To steer the UK toward a positive outcome, the Committee sets out 10 core recommendations. These include measures to boost opportunities, address risks, support effective regulatory oversight - including to ensure open competition and avoid market dominance by established technology giants - achieve the aims set out in the AI White Paper, introduce new standards, and resolve copyright disputes.
Chair's quote
Baroness Stowell of Beeston, Chairman of the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee, said:
“The rapid development of AI Large Language Models is likely to have a profound effect on society, comparable to the introduction of the internet. That makes it vital for the Government to get its approach right and not miss out on opportunities – particularly not if this is out of caution for far-off and improbable risks. We need to address risks in order to be able to take advantage of the opportunities – but we need to be proportionate and practical. We must avoid the UK missing out on a potential AI goldrush.
“One lesson from the way technology markets have developed since the inception of the internet is the danger of market dominance by a small group of companies. The Government must ensure exaggerated predictions of an AI driven apocalypse, coming from some of the tech firms, do not lead it to policies that close down open-source AI development or exclude innovative smaller players from developing AI services. We must be careful to avoid regulatory capture by the established technology companies in an area where regulators will be scrabbling to keep up with rapidly developing technology.
“There are risks associated with the wider dissemination of LLMs. The most concerning of these are the possibility of making existing malicious actions quicker and easier - from cyber attacks to the manipulation of images for child sexual exploitation. The Government should focus on how these can be tackled and not become distracted by sci-fi end of the world scenarios.
“One area of AI disruption that can and should be tackled promptly is the use of copyrighted material to train LLMs. LLMs rely on ingesting massive datasets to work properly but that does not mean they should be able to use any material they can find without permission or paying rightsholders for the privilege. This is an issue the Government can get a grip of quickly and it should do so.
“These issues will be of huge significance over the coming years and we expect the Government to act on the concerns we have raised and take the steps necessary to make the most of the opportunities in front of us.”

But do they work?Zoë CorbynSat 3 Feb 2024 08.00 ESTShare122122Investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of work, Hilke Schellmann thought she had better try some of the tools. Among them was a one-way video interview system intended to aid recruitment called myInterview. She got a login from the company and began to experiment – first picking the questions she, as the hiring manager, would ask and then video recording her answers as a candidate before the proprietary software analysed the words she used and the intonation of her voice to score how well she fitted the job.She was pleased to score an 83% match for the role. But when she re-did her interview not in English but in her native German, she was surprised to find that instead of an error message she also scored decently (73%) – and this time she hadn’t even attempted to answer the questions but read a Wikipedia entry. The transcript the tool had concocted out of her German was gibberish. When the company told her its tool knew she wasn’t speaking English so had scored her primarily on her intonation, she got a robot voice generator to read in her English answers. Again she scored well (79%), leaving Schellmann scratching her head.“If simple tests can show these tools may not work, we really need to be thinking long and hard about whether we should be using them for hiring,” says Schellmann, an assistant professor of journalism at New York University and investigative reporter.The experiment, conducted in 2021, is detailed in Schellmann’s new book, The Algorithm. It explores how AI and complex algorithms are increasingly being used to help hire employees and then subsequently monitor and evaluate them, including for firing and promotion. Schellmann, who has previously reported for the Guardian on the topic, not only experiments with the tools, but speaks to experts who have investigated them – and those on the receiving end.Not only do many of the hiring tools not work, they are based on troubling pseudoscience and can discriminateThe tools – which aim to cut the time and cost of filtering mountains of job applications and drive workplace efficiency – are enticing to employers. But Schellmann concludes they are doing more harm than good. Not only are many of the hiring tools based on troubling pseudoscience (for example, the idea that the intonation of our voice can predict how successful we will be in a job doesn’t stand up, says Schellmann), they can also discriminate.In the case of digital monitoring, Schellmann takes aim at the way productivity is being scored based on faulty metrics such as keystrokes and mouse movements, and the toll such tracking can have on workers. More sophisticated AI-based surveillance techniques – for example, flight risk analysis, which considers various signals, such as the frequency of LinkedIn updates, to determine the chance of an employee quitting; sentiment analysis, which analyses an employee’s communications to try to tap into their feelings (disgruntlement might point to someone needing a break); and CV analysis, to ascertain a worker’s potential to acquire new skills – can also have low predictive value.It is not, says Schellmann, that she’s against the use of new approaches – the way humans do it can be riddled with bias, too – but we should not accept technology that doesn’t work and isn’t fair. “These are high stakes environments,” she says.It can be hard to get a handle on how employers are using the tools, admits Schellmann. Though existing survey data indicate widespread use, companies generally keep quiet about them and candidates and employees are often in the dark. Candidates commonly assume a human will watch their one-way video but, in fact, it may only be seen by AI.View image in fullscreenHilke Schellmann: ‘These tools aren’t going away so we have to push back.’ Photograph: Jennifer AltmanAnd the use of the tools isn’t confined to employment in hourly wage jobs. It is also creeping into more knowledge-centric jobs, such as finance and nursing, she says.Schellmann focuses on four classes of AI-based tools being deployed in hiring. In addition to one-way interviews, which can use not just tone of voice but equally unscientific facial expression analysis, she looks at online CV screeners, which might make recommendations based on the use of certain keywords found in the CVs of current employees; game-based assessments, which look for trait and skills matches between a candidate and the company’s current employees based on playing a video game; and tools that scour candidates’ social media outputs to make personality predictions.None are ready for prime time, says Schellmann. How game-based assessments check for skills relevant to the job is unclear, while, in the case of scanning a candidate’s social media history, she shows that very different sets of traits can be discerned depending on which social media feed the software analyses. CV screeners can embody bias. Schellmann cites the example of one that was found to be giving more points to candidates who had listed baseball as a hobby on their CV versus candidates who listed softball (the former is more likely to be played by men).Even vendors may not know precisely how their tools are working, let alone the companies that use them – or the candidatesMany of the tools are essentially black boxes, says Schellmann. AI let loose on training data looks for patterns, which it then uses to make its predictions. But it isn’t necessarily clear what those patterns are and they can inadvertently bake in discrimination. Even the vendors may not know precisely how their tools are working, let alone the companies that are buying them or the candidates or employees who are subjected to them.Schellmann tells of a black female software developer and military veteran who applied for 146 jobs in the tech industry before success. The developer doesn’t know why she had such a problem but she undertook one-way interviews and played AI video games, and she’s sure was subject to CV screening. She wonders if the technology took exception to her because she wasn’t a typical applicant. The job she eventually did find was by reaching out to a human recruiter.Schellmann calls on HR departments to be more sceptical of the hiring and workplace monitoring software they are deploying – asking questions and testing products. She also wants regulation: ideally a government body to check the tools to ensure they work and don’t discriminate before they are allowed to hit the market. But even mandating that vendors release technical reports about how they have built and validated their tools so others could check them would be a good first step. “These tools aren’t going away so we have to push back,” she says.In the meantime, jobseekers do have ChatGPT at their disposal to help them write cover letters, polish CVs and formulate answers to potential interview questions. “It is AI against AI,” says Schellmann. “And it is shifting power away from employers a little bit.”

Will their workers benefit as well?Share full articleRead in appBig banks like Morgan Stanley spend a large percentage of their payrolls on the kinds of jobs most likely to be affected by generative A.I., according to the Burning Glass Institute.Credit...Gabby Jones for The New York TimesBy Steve LohrSteve Lohr covers technology from New York.Feb. 1, 2024A new generation of artificial intelligence is poised to turn old assumptions about technology on their head.For years, people working in warehouses or fast food restaurants worried that automation could eliminate their jobs. But new research suggests that generative A.I. — the kind used in chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will have its biggest impact on white-collar workers with high-paying jobs in industries like banking and tech.A report published Thursday by the Burning Glass Institute, a nonprofit research center, and SHRM, formerly the Society for Human Resource Management, stops short of saying the technology will do away with large numbers of jobs. But it makes clear that workers need to better prepare for a future in which A.I. could play a significant role in many workplaces that until now have been largely untouched by technological disruption.For people in tech, it means they may be building their A.I. replacements.“There’s no question the workers who will be impacted most are those with college degrees, and those are the people who always thought they were safe,” said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor hundreds of corporations, the researchers estimated the share of payroll spending that goes to workers employed in the 200 occupations most likely to be affected by generative A.I. Many of those jobs are held by affluent college graduates, including business analysts, marketing managers, software developers, database administrators, project managers and lawyers.Companies in finance, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, have some of the highest percentages of their payrolls likely to be disrupted by generative A.I. Not far behind are tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Meta.Getting A.I. to do human work could result in big savings for those companies. The research estimates that banks and some tech companies spend 60 to 80 percent of their payrolls, or more, on workers in occupations most likely to be affected by the new technology.The retail, restaurant and transportation industries are least likely to be affected by generative A.I., the report found. Companies like Walmart, McDonald’s and Delta Air Lines mostly employ workers without college degrees who perform roles like helping customers, stocking shelves, cooking food and handling baggage. They spend less than 20 percent of their payrolls on employees in occupations most likely to be affected by generative A.I.The report doesn’t predict potential job losses related to generative A.I. That will be up to employers, the report said, and whether they want to bank the savings from A.I. automation or use that money to invest and grow, adding more workers. Most experts expect that A.I. will mostly change jobs for the next few years rather than eliminate them — though that could change if the technology improves sharply.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe report highlights the need for increased training to prepare workers to adapt to a fast-arriving technology, said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., chief executive of SHRM.“Corporations and governments are going to have to seriously invest to get ahead of this,” he said.ImageRetail, restaurants and transportation are at the bottom of the list of industries expected to be affected by generative A.I.Credit...Amir Hamja/The New York TimesThe report is the latest entry in a growing field of work trying to predict the effect of generative A.I. on the economy and the workplace. Other studies have forecast a surge in economic growth and productivity, automating activities that add up to the equivalent of millions of jobs, and time savings of up to 50 percent for routine office and coding tasks.In its research, the Burning Glass Institute started with the estimates of generative A.I. exposure by occupation in a widely cited academic paper that was published last year. It then added its own data sets — including job listings, payroll information, government statistics and corporate disclosures — for the company-by-company calculations. The SHRM report includes a ranking of selected companies. The Burning Glass Institute did the percentage estimates of the payroll spending by company for The New York Times.Manav Raj, a co-author of the academic paper that the Burning Glass Institute relied on, said the new research appeared to be a credible effort to parse company-level data. But at this stage, he said, all the studies are educated guesses.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The many papers out there generally conclude that this wave of A.I. has the potential to have a very large effect,” said Mr. Raj, an assistant professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “But it’s going to take some time to find out what that effect really looks like.”Steve Lohr writes about technology and its impact on the economy, jobs and the workplace.

Managing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools will entail big changes in culture and procedures as its use continues to spread like wildfire through developer teams.







According to Kiran Minnasandram, vice-president and chief technology officer for Wipro FullStride Cloud, this is not just about adopting new tools, but transforming how developers interact with technology, solve problems and create new paradigms in software engineering.
A “comprehensive cultural and procedural metamorphosis” is needed, he says, to properly manage risks associated with GenAI, which range from hallucinations, technical bloat, data poisoning, input manipulation or prompt injection to intellectual property (IP) violations, and theft of GenAI models themselves.
“You’ve got to worry about the validity of the model,” says Minnasandram. “You’ve got to worry about model drift or model hallucinations. Every model is based on data, and data inherently has bias. Even if it is a small percentage of bias, and you start to extrapolate that to more and more and more data, the bias is only going to increase.”
For that reason, organisations must be “very careful” with the amount of data with which they engage the models, because bias is going to get into the data. When organisations extrapolate from limited datasets, results are restricted to that quality and quantity. Desired data may be sensitive and private – and data not available in your own explicit datasets can easily introduce model hallucination.
“You therefore need good mitigation strategies, but it’s all on a case-by-case basis,” says Minnasandram. “We’ve got to be very cautious. For instance, if it’s sensitive data, how do you anonymise it without losing data quality?”
Generated content can need guardrails, too. Even if it’s source-code generation, writing some code for machine completion, that code is not complete. Appropriate guardrails for that may entail measuring the quality of that content, he says.

Responsibility frameworks
Enterprise value will require responsibility frameworks that cover individual use, as well as tech and its technicalities in a given environment. Wipro has developed its own, and looks at how it should be taken and implemented, including internally and while maintaining responsiveness to clients.
That includes working to fully understand risk exposures around code review, security and auditing, regulatory compliance and more to develop guardrails.
The good news is that more code quality and performance improvement tools are emerging, including code and compiler optimisation, for integration into CI/CD pipelines, says Minnasandram.
It cannot be a matter of just setting GenAI aside, however. Demand for tasks like code refactoring and more advanced techniques like predictive coding or collaborative coding – where a machine “sits with the dev” and does initial code lifting – are rising.
Don Schuerman, chief technology officer (CTO) of workflow automation company Pegasystems, says the key challenges are not from a lack of code so much as “a mountain of technical debt”, with poorly managed GenAI simply increasing tech burdens.
For that reason, he sees GenAI as better used for tasks other than “cranking out code”.
“Far better to use GenAI to step back into the business problem that code is trying to solve: how do we optimise a process for efficiency? What’s the fastest way to support our customers while adhering to regulatory guidelines?” he says. “Design the optimal workflows of the future, rather than cranking out code to automate processes we already know are broken.”


Workplace pressures
Even if you have experienced and skilled oversight at all levels, editing and checking code after it has been written, workplace pressures can introduce errors and mean things get missed, he agrees.
Ensure users have “safe versions of the tools” and then use GenAI more to “get ahead of the business”. With low-code tools, IT teams often found themselves cleaning up shadow IT failures, and the same could be true with GenAI – with it being more useful to deploy it specifically to deliver speed and innovation within guardrails that at the same time ensure compliance and maintainability, Schuerman points out.
Adopt methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help control how GenAI accesses knowledge without the overhead of building and maintaining a custom large language model (LLM), creating knowledge “buddies” that answer questions based on a designated set of enterprise knowledge content. RAG can help prevent hallucinations while ensuring citations and traceability.
Use GenAI to generate the models – workflows, data structures, screens – that can be executed by scalable, model-driven platforms. The risk comes from using GenAI to “turn everyone into developers”, creating more bloat and technical debt, says Schuerman.
Limit it to generating workflows, data models, user experiences and so on that represent the optimal customer and employee experience, grounded in industry best practices. If you do that, you can execute the resulting applications in enterprise-grade workflow and decisioning platforms that are designed to scale.
“And if you need to make changes, you aren’t going into a bunch of generated code to figure out what’s happening – you simply update business-friendly models that reflect the workflow steps or data points in your application,” says Schuerman.

While artificial intelligence will not live up to its name any time soon, mass adoption of large language models, whether by customers or in-house, requires thinking about by enterprise IT leaders.
As the hype surrounding artificial intelligence enters a new phase with the rising enterprise and hyperscale interest in generative AI, operators are not sure how to proceed with new datacentre builds, it is claimed.



Chris Royles, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) field CTO at data platform provider Cloudera, says it’s important to also train people to augment their prompts with better, more relevant information. That may mean providing a limited, thoroughly vetted collection of datasets and instructing the generative tool to only use data that can be explicitly found in those datasets and no others.
Without this, it can be tough to ensure your own best practice, standards and consistent principles when building new applications and services with GenAI, he says.
“Organisations should think quite clearly about how they bring AI into their own product,” says Royles. “And with GenAI, you’re using credentials to call third-party applications. That is a real concern, and protecting credentials is a concern.”
You always want to be able to override what the GenAI does, he says.
Make development teams broader and wider, with more accessibility or shorter test cycles. Built applications should be testable for validation features, such as whether the right encryption frameworks have been used, and whether credentials have been protected in the appropriate and correct manner.
Royles adds that GenAI can be used for other dev-related tasks, such as querying complex contracts, or whether it’s in fact legal to build or use the application in the first place. This, too, must be managed carefully due to the risk of hallucination of non-existent legal proofs or precedents.
Mitigation might be achieved in part by training people to augment their prompts with better, more relevant information. For example, providing a limited, thoroughly vetted collection of datasets and instructing the tool to only use data that can be explicitly found in those datasets and no others, he notes.


Bans won’t work
Tom Fowler, CTO at consultancy CloudSmiths, agrees that forbidding devs to use GenAI will not work. People will typically choose to use tech they perceive as making their lives easier or better, whether that flies in the face of company policy or not.
However, organisations should still apply themselves to avoiding the slippery slope to mediocrity or the “rubbish middle” that is a real risk when inadequate oversight or a team with too much technical debt seeks to use GenAI to patch over a gap in their dev skillset. “Organisations need to be cognisant of and guard against that,” says Fowler. “You need to try to understand what LLMs are good at and what they’re bad at.”
While capabilities are evolving quickly, LLMs are still “bad” at helping people write code and get it into production. Some sort of restriction might need to be placed on its use by developer teams, and organisations will still have a requirement for software engineering, including good engineers with solid experience and strong code review practices.
“For me, you can use GenAI to help you solve lots of small problems,” says Fowler. “You can solve a very small task very, very quickly, but they just don’t have the capability of holding large amounts of complexity – inherited systems, engineering systems designed to be able to solve big problems. That way humans are good. You need insight, you need reasoning, you need the capability to hold this big picture in your head.”
This can actually mean you’ll be looking at upskilling your dev teams, rather than hollowing it out to save money, he agrees.
A good engineer can functionally decompose what he or she is trying to do down into lots of small problems, and to those individual chunks, GenAI can be used. When GenAI is asked for help with a big complex problem or to do something end to end, “you can get rubbish”.
“You either get code that’s not going to work without some massaging, or just get bad ‘advice’,” says Fowler. “It’s about helping to scale your team and do more with less [partly as a result]. And the advent of multiple modalities, and domain-specific models, whether built from scratch or fine-tuned, will be 100% the future.”


Copyright considerations
Big players are beginning to offer enterprise offerings with protections around data and leakage and the like, which is “fantastic”, yet relatively little attention has so far been paid to copyright and other IP risk as it pertains to code, says Fowler.
Look at what happened when Oracle sued Google around using the Java API. Organisations might want to look at similarities and precedents to head off potentially nasty surprises in future.
“There’ll be precedents around what’s OK in terms of how much of it being tweaked and changed enough to be able to say that it’s not exactly the same as something else – but we don’t know yet,” he points out.
With the generic, broad uses of GenAI, data can easily come from something on Google or Stack Overflow, and somewhere amid all that, someone else’s IP can be replicated via the algorithm. Organisations building an LLM-based tool into their offering may need guardrails on that.
“All of that being said, I’m not convinced it’s a large risk that will deter most organisations,” says Fowler.

Tries 20 Jobs | WIREDVimGPT is an experimental open-source program built by Ishan Shah, a lone developer, not a product in development, but you can bet that Apple, Google, and others are doing similar experiments with a view to upgrading Siri and other assistants. VimGPT is built on GPT-4V, the multimodal version of OpenAI’s famous language model. By analyzing a request it can determine what to click on or type more reliably than text-only software can, which has to attempt to make sense of the web by untangling messy HTML. “A year from now, I would expect the experience of using a computer to look very different,” says Shah, who says he built vimGPT in only a few days. “Most apps will require less clicking and more chatting, with agents becoming an integral part of browsing the web.”Shah is not the only person who believes that the next logical step after chatbots like ChatGPT is agents that use computers and roam the Web. Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who was Apple’s director of AI research from 2016 to 2020, believes that Siri and other assistants are in line for an almighty AI upgrade. “The next evolution is going to be agents that can get useful tasks done,” Salakhutdinov says. Hooking Siri up to AI like that powering ChatGPT would be useful, he says, “but it will be so much more impactful if I ask Siri to do stuff, and it just goes and solves my problems for me.”Salakhutdinov and his students have developed several simulated environments designed for testing and honing the skills of AI helpers that can get things done.

Generative AI makes it possible for individuals in a wide variety of professions to become far more productive. They can do so without anyone's permission - at school, at work, at home. They don’t even have to be public about their use of the tools. I have used them to write a computer program (in a language that I don't know), to critique the writing of others as editor of a journal, to edit my own writing, and to create images far more interesting than any I would have created on my own.


A remarkable study by Fabrizio Dell'Acqua of Harvard University and his colleagues demonstrates the potential. The study was based on 758 consultants at the Boston Consulting Group who performed a wide variety of tasks generally required of a consultant. The authors reported that the consultants using AI completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1% faster than usual. They also “produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group),” according to the report. As Ethan Mollick, one of the co-authors of the study, pointed out in his personal Substack post, it was the lower performing consultants who benefited most, achieving almost parity with the top performers.

What should leaders do to engage productively with Generative AI – not just as a better grammar-checker or code generator, but as a general purpose tool with broad potential for reshaping the context of work? Here are a few suggestions:

PROMOTED



Actively encourage people to use the tools to improve their work and make themselves more efficient. You learn by doing.
Create the slack time necessary for them to do so.
Resist the temptation to capture the efficiency gains by reducing the number of employees doing a task; instead, encourage employees to use the time they save to learn more and build on the benefits.
Encourage the sharing of results among members of the work team.
Experiment as a leader with the use of these tools in your own work. (You cannot delegate this understanding!)


AI tools are so powerful and so broad in their application that a failure to use them threatens any company’s competitive advantage. But these tools are different from earlier generations of AI. They democratize AI and cannot be controlled or managed in the traditional sense. In order to gain the full benefit from tools like ChatGPT, leaders need to combine the use of generative AI with true empowerment of employees.

Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously asserted that ""the medium is the message."" The medium in McLuhan's formulation, is any new technology - from computers to roads to AI. The message is the eventual impact the medium has on our lives and our culture. The meaning of the automobile, in McLuhan's analysis, has been (among other things) the rise of suburbs, the emergence of the middle class, and the fragmentation of the extended family. The meaning of previous generations of automation has been the rationalization, standardization and fragmentation of work – from the factory floor to the social worker.

Managing this empowerment may be harder than mastering the generative AI tools themselves, especially under the pressure of day-to-day operations. It is complicated by concerns about AI bias, inadvertent error, misinformation and intellectual property loss. But it is important to get started. If your employees are unleashed, they can help to address the concerns based on real-world cases - at the same time that they are improving their own performance. If employees do not feel that they have permission to experiment, their use of the tools will go underground, limiting their value and sidestepping the very issues of concern..

As leaders, it’s important to create a mindset for experimentation and to democratize decision- making related to the application of AI tools. The technology, by its nature, can best be leveraged at the level of the individual worker. Trying to standardize its use or manage it top-down undermines its value.
ChatGPT and other tools for generative AI constitute a powerful new technology (a new medium in McLuhan's sense of that word). Their first applications will naturally be in making work more efficient and (perhaps) less boring. But the business meaning of generative AI tools will be empowerment - a redefinition of the way work is designed, supported and managed..

 Seventy nine percent of UAE workers who are using generative AI say it makes them more productive



Amy Clewlow | 5 February, 2024









The use of generative AI in the workplace is surging in the UAE, with 40% of workers already having implemented or experimenting with the technology, compared to just 28% of workers globally, according to Salesforce’s generative AI snapshot research titled ‘The Promises and Pitfalls of Generative AI at Work‘.
In a potential boon for employers, 79% of UAE workers who are using generative AI claim it makes them more productive, while 74% say generative AI increases their levels of engagement at work.
However, according to the survey, businesses’ policies and training around the technology are not clearly defined, and are ambiguous at best, in the UAE and globally.
Fifty two percent of UAE workers have not received or completed generative AI training, which shows room for improvement on the part of their employers. Even so, the situation among UAE employers compared favourably with their global counterparts, with nearly seven in 10 global workers having never completed or received training on how to use generative AI safely and ethically at work.
Workers globally also noted that their employers’ generative AI policies are either non-existent or are not clearly defined. In the UAE, 64% of workers say their companies do not have clearly defined policies for using generative AI at work.
Given employees’ surging use of AI, the survey demonstrates that businesses should take steps to ensure that generative AI is implemented effectively, safely and ethically.
Thierry Nicault, Area Vice President and General Manager, Salesforce Middle East, said: “AI is increasingly essential to achieving efficiency and innovation in organisations across all sectors. However, to achieve their aims, companies must invest in safe, ethical and trusted generative AI tools. It is imperative that organisations stay ahead of the curve and invest in the right technology, offer training and implement clear policies that help to foster career growth, trust and an understanding of the ethical use of AI within their business environment. This will lead to yet greater productivity and employee satisfaction, while helping to ensure that AI investments reach their full potential.”

But while the AI makes for a more interesting phone, it doesn't make for a better one.",N/A,Samsung's Galaxy S24 AI features feel like an afterthought,"Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra features on a range of generative AI offerings. But while the AI makes for a more interesting phone, it doesn't make for a better one.",N/A,N/A,"Without AI, there wouldn’t be much to say about Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra.While it’s a very nice Android phone overall, it’s not vastly different from last year’s Galaxy S23 Ultra. I could point to the new titanium frame, the flat display that feels a bit roomier than the old Ultra’s curved glass, or the requisite annual upticks in display brightness and processing power. Still the overall impression isn’t so different from the S23 Ultra.[Photo: Jared Newman]The real novelty with the S24 Ultra comes via on the software side, where Samsung has slathered on a range of generative AI features that let you can summarize web pages, rewrite text messages, fix up your handwriting, and translate phone calls in real time. It has a few AI camera tricks as well, including the ability to reposition objects in photos and add smooth slo-mo to existing videos.[Image: Samsung]But while the AI trickery makes for a more interesting phone, it doesn’t make for a significantly better one. Learning to use Samsung’s AI features requires some new habits, and many of them just aren’t useful enough to justify the extra effort. Right now the boring smartphone performance still matters more than the novel AI stuff.Stuck with the defaultsThe biggest problem with Samsung’s new AI features is that they’re tied to Samsung apps that I’d rather not use.Web page summaries, for instance, only work with Samsung’s stock web browser, which doesn’t sync my history with other devices and kept nagging me to use its Samsung Pass password manager (despite having set Bitwarden as my system-level password manager). The summaries themselves were also overly brief, with no room for follow-up queries, and I soon decided they weren’t worth the trade-offs.I had a similar experience with Samsung’s Chat Assist feature, which can rewrite text messages via a button on Samsung’s built-in keyboard. Its ability to intelligently insert emoji seemed especially promising, but I ended up retreating back to Google’s Gboard keyboard after too many run-ins with Samsung’s decidedly unintelligent gesture typing recognition.And while Samsung’s Notes app has some neat AI features—including a way to auto-format typed notes with headings and bullet points—I’d much rather use Obsidian for note-taking. I’ve yet to get in the habit of using Samsung Notes as a starting point, and wish the Galaxy S24 Ultra could just format the content of any selected text instead.Photo editing tricksOn the photo front, Samsung’s generative AI editing features have more obvious upsides, but some of them are tucked out of sight and others are hit-or-miss with their results.Being able to remove unwanted objects from photos is a great feature—and unlike with Google’s Magic Eraser, it doesn’t require a Google One subscription—but you can get some weird results if the conditions aren’t just right.

I could point to the new titanium frame, the flat display that feels a bit roomier than the old Ultra's curved glass, or the requisite annual upticks in display brightness and processing power. Still the overall impression isn't so different from the S23 Ultra.\n\n\n\n[Photo: Jared Newman]\n\n\n\nThe real novelty with the S24 Ultra comes via on the software side, where Samsung has slathered on a range of generative AI features that let you can summarize web pages, rewrite text messages, fix up your handwriting, and translate phone calls in real time. It has a few AI camera tricks as well, including the ability to reposition objects in photos and add smooth slo-mo to existing videos.\n\n\n\n[Image: Samsung]\n\n\n\nBut while the AI trickery makes for a more interesting phone, it doesn't make for a significantly better one. Learning to use Samsung's AI features requires some new habits, and many of them just aren't useful enough to justify the extra effort. Right now the boring smartphone performance still matters more than the novel AI stuff.\n\n\n\nStuck with the defaults\n\n\n\nThe biggest problem with Samsung's new AI features is that they're tied to Samsung apps that I'd rather not use.\n\n\n\nWeb page summaries, for instance, only work with Samsung's stock web browser, which doesn't sync my history with other devices and kept nagging me to use its Samsung Pass password manager (despite having set Bitwarden as my system-level password manager). The summaries themselves were also overly brief, with no room for follow-up queries, and I soon decided they weren't worth the trade-offs.\n\n\n\nI had a similar experience with Samsung's Chat Assist feature, which can rewrite text messages via a button on Samsung's built-in keyboard. Its ability to intelligently insert emoji seemed especially promising, but I ended up retreating back to Google's Gboard keyboard after too many run-ins with Samsung's decidedly unintelligent gesture typing recognition.\n\n\n\nAnd while Samsung's Notes app has some neat AI features—including a way to auto-format typed notes with headings and bullet points—I'd much rather use Obsidian for note-taking. I've yet to get in the habit of using Samsung Notes as a starting point, and wish the Galaxy S24 Ultra could just format the content of any selected text instead.\n\n\n\nPhoto editing tricks\n\n\n\nOn the photo front, Samsung's generative AI editing features have more obvious upsides, but some of them are tucked out of sight and others are hit-or-miss with their results.\n\n\n\nBeing able to remove unwanted objects from photos is a great feature—and unlike with Google's Magic Eraser, it doesn't require a Google One subscription—but you can get some weird results if the conditions aren't just right. I tried to remove the waiter from a restaurant photo with my kids and their grandparents, for instance, and Samsung replaced him with a lamp that did not exist in reality. I tried removing a few people in the bleachers behind my son at a flag football game, and what was left looked vaguely skeletal.\n\n\n\n[Photo: Jared Newman]\n\n\n\nRepositioning people in an existing photo is also hard to make work in practice, neat as it sounds in theory.

Many people view these awe-inspiring capabilities with excitement and positivity. However, it&#x2019;s understandable that many others view these advancements with apprehension, fearing negative consequences even up to the beginning of the age of (intelligent) machines that will end and take over human race control of our world. Chief among these concerns are the potential loss of jobs and the fear of being supplanted by machines.AI represents the culmination of a rich history of technological advancements, which have firmly established computer technology as the cornerstone of the modern era.Alvin Toffler, in his 1970 book Future Shock and his 1980 book The Third Wave, prophesied that computers would be central to a new revolution in human history. He wrote that they would affect and change not only certain areas of our lives, but also global economy and security &#x2013; and through them, our entire culture.console.log(&quot;2390 BODY2.

The first occurred about 13,000 years ago, with the development of agriculture, after which humans stopped wandering from place to place to hunt and gather food. The second, the Industrial Revolution, happened about 250 years ago, with the invention of modern science.

Indeed, it has the immense potential to tackle societal challenges such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and poverty reduction. Moreover, its implementation can foster the creation of high-skilled, well-paying jobs, while automating repetitive and mundane tasks, thus boosting efficiency and productivity.However, we cannot ignore the challenges and negative aspects of AI. Automation may result in the displacement of certain jobs, particularly those that involve mundane manual or repetitive tasks. Some traditional jobs may likely become obsolete, requiring workers to acquire new skills to remain employable. In short, AI is poised to significantly impact the world of work in the near future. However, concerns about the potential risks involved have prompted calls for the controlled and moderated advancement of AI.I do not concur with this popular opinion. On the contrary, I believe that these concerns are exaggerated and that the implementation of AI will have a gradual effect on the work market and will not cause extensive job losses.In the first instance, AI is not a threat to those jobs that involve physical human labor. Secondly, in most cases, AI will not replace workers but be an auxiliary tool, helping workers to better identify problems. Just as ultrasound did not replace medical doctors but enhanced their capabilities, so AI will not replace jobs but augment them.Upgrading professional lifeThe intensive integration of AI into the labor market will lead to the upgrading and development of new professions, but will not completely change most of the existing professions. I recognize that new ethical concerns may arise, such as algorithmic bias and invasion of privacy, and these issues will need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible AI deployment. AdvertisementI urge us not to fear the advancement of technology. AI is a powerful tool, but it is not a lethal tool. Its use depends on the users, and it can serve humanity for better or worse. We must and we certainly can use it responsibly and build a policy ensuring its use for the common good.In summary, the impact of AI on the workforce is multifaceted. It is crucial for societies, businesses, and policymakers to proactively address challenges, foster education and re-skilling initiatives, and create a balanced approach to AI integration that considers both economic and social aspects.The writer is director of the Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center at Tel Aviv University &#x2013; and chairman of AI Day, February 5, 2024, TAU.",,Opinion,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.jpost.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation', 'name': 'Business &amp; Innovation'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/opinion', 'name': 'Opinion'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/opinion/article-785143', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence won&#x2019;t replace work, but can upgrade it - opinion'}}]",,,,JPOST,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It cannot sit on its hands for the next decade and hope the courts will provide an answer.”The committee recommended the government decides whether copyright law provides enough protection to copyright holders. If it believes there are legal uncertainties around the issue, peers said, it should set out options for updating legislation.Lady Stowell, the committee’s Conservative chair, said: “The government needs to be clear whether copyright law provides sufficient protections to rights holders because of the introduction of LLMs. If the government is clear that the legislative framework is not adequate then it should update that legislative framework.”The government’s intellectual property office is drawing up a code of practice on copyright and AI. Under the 1988 Copyright Act an exemption is made for text and data mining if it is research for “a non-commercial purpose”. In 2022 the government indicated that it would widen that exemption to any use but has now rowed back on that.1:52Robot says AI is 'threat and opportunity' to artists during Lords address – videoStowell added that the UK, with its wealth of private and government-owned data, could offer licensed datasets to AI firms hoping to build models on a secure legal basis. “If we can create new licensed datasets, there is a market we ought to be able to take advantage of,” she said.OpenAI, the US-based developer of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot, is being sued in the US by the New York Times and a number of authors for alleged copyright infringement. One group of writers, which includes the bestselling John Grisham, has accused OpenAI of “systematic theft on a mass scale”.OpenAI said in its submission to the committee that it would be impossible to create tools like ChatGPT without access to copyrighted material. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the image generator company Stability AI and Microsoft, an investor in OpenAI, also told the committee that limiting access to data could result in substandard or biased models.In the US, OpenAI’s defence relies on the concept of “fair use”, which allows use of content in certain circumstances without seeking the owner’s permission. In the UK there are also copyright exemptions under “fair dealing”, which relates to areas such as research, private study and news reporting.Elsewhere in the report, the committee warns the government of a protracted period of “technological turbulence” owing to AI and urges ministers to act against market power being concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies.Stowell said: “There has to be open competition. The market has to remain open. It’s dangerous if we have a situation where it is under the control of a small number of large firms.”A government spokesperson said: “The IPO [intellectual property office] has engaged with stakeholders as part of a working group with the aim of agreeing a voluntary code on AI and copyright. We will update on that work soon and continue to work closely with stakeholders to ensure the AI and creative industries continue to thrive together.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsComputingIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

Tim Cook says that Apple is spending ""a tremendous amount of time and effort"" on AI features that will be announced in the coming months.


Apple's Cook took the opportunity of the firm's latest financial earnings call to enthuse about the Apple Vision Pro and the future of AI. ""We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be an historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing,"" he said. ""Moments like these are what we live for at Apple, they're why we do what we do.""
He said that this is ""why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation,"" and also ""why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users.""
""As we look ahead,"" he continued, ""we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future that includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.""

Cook initially said nothing more than that, and it was only an implication that the news would happen during the year instead of at the end. That does fit with recent reports that Apple will make significant AI and Siri announcements at WWDC in June.
In response to questioning about AI, Cook did expand on his brief statement. ""In terms of generative AI,"" he added, ""we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before.""
""Our MO, if you will, has always been to to do work and then talk about work, and not to get out in front of ourselves and so we're going to hold that to this as well,"" he continued. ""But we have got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.""
Perhaps the most significant element of Cook's promise of forthcoming news was how he set up that initial announcement. Apple is a technology company but also one that is very much focused on how it can ""enrich the lives of our users.""
Cook is saying that Apple is not leaping onto the AI bandwagon just in order to catch up with the rest of the industry. He's saying that Apple has been looking for a point for adding AI features —  and that it has found it.

It is well documented that Australian teachers face challenges incorporating Indigenous perspectives and content in their classrooms. The approach can sometimes be somewhat tokenistic, as if the teacher is “ticking a box”. We need a more culturally responsive teaching workforce. 
Generative AI is advancing at a fast pace and quickly finding a place within education. Tools such as ChatGPT (or Chatty G as the kids say) continue to dominate conversations in education as these technologies are explored and developed.

There are many concerns around academic integrity and things to consider on how to best introduce and control this technology in practice.
As teachers continue to look for ways to meet Indigenous content requirements, it makes sense they would turn to generative AI to assist them in an area they struggle with. But using these tools could do more harm than good.
Indigenous peoples’ concerns around AI
Indigenous people have raised a range of concerns around generative AI. These include the risks these technologies pose for Indigenous people and knowledges. 
For example, AI-generated art is causing a significant threat to Indigenous peoples’ incomes, art and cultural knowledges.
The lead image of this article was created using the generative AI platform Midjourney. The prompts included the terms Indigenous, artwork, colourful, artificial intelligence, Aboriginal, Western Sydney and painting styles. 
This shows that with AI, anyone can easily produce “Indigenous-style” art and content. This poses a threat to Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights. 
With AI being trained on vast data sets primarily from the western corpus of knowledge, there are also concerns relating to Indigenous data sovereignty – the right to “govern the collection, ownership and application of data about Indigenous communities, peoples, lands and resources”.
Generative AI can also perpetuate misinformation that harms Indigenous communities. This happened during the Voice referendum campaign, when fake, AI-generated images of Indigenous “no” voters were published on social media.

Importantly, there is also the potential impact to Country due to the environmental costs of data centres – an issue that must be addressed as more generative AI tools come online.

      The environmental cost of data centres is substantial, and making them energy-efficient will only solve half the problem




How do these concerns translate into the classroom?
All students should see themselves reflected in the classroom. This especially applies to Indigenous students, as attested by Closing the Gap targets for educational attainment.
A 2022 report by the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership states:

The legacy of colonisation has undermined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students’ access to their cultures, identities, histories and languages. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students have not had access to a complete, relevant and responsive education.

Children need both “windows and mirrors” in the classroom. American education scholar Rudine Sims-Bishop has aptly put this in the context of children’s literature:  

When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part.

Students need to see themselves reflected in the curriculum, including the technologies used.
By using generative AI, teachers risk perpetrating and promoting inaccuracies and spreading false information instead of meaningfully engaging with Indigenous values and knowledge systems.
This can potentially harm the student–teacher relationship, which is incredibly important, particularly for Indigenous students.
Late last year, the Australian government released a framework for generative AI in schools. It offers “guidance on understanding, using and responding to generative AI” to everyone involved in Australian school education.  
The framework also affirms the necessity of respecting Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights. But we need more extensive work to ensure teachers can do this appropriately. Currently, there is a lack of research that looks at the intersection between generative AI and Indigenous content inclusion in the classroom. 

Indigenous futures and AI
Generative AI, and other forms of AI, have extensive potential to benefit Indigenous people and their communities. Many Indigenous people are engaging with the technologies to this effect.
For example, you can take a virtual trip to the Torres Strait Islands, spend time at the AI Marae in New Zealand or engage with the Indigenous Protocols and AI Laboratory 
But to make room for what is seemingly an inevitable future that involves AI, work needs to be done in policy and professional bodies to ensure Indigenous inclusion at all levels – from development to use. 
Teachers and students must be supported with the necessary resourcing to promote critical thinking when engaging with generative AI. Teachers will look to the relevant government bodies, whereas students will look to their teachers for guidance.
It is clear we need further guidance on Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, and culturally appropriate AI use for educators.  
Generative AI still has much to learn, and Indigenous knowledges have much to teach it.

Ever since ChatGPT became the fastest-growing new tech platform in Internet history, I’ve been expecting artificial intelligence (AI) tools built using large language models (LLMs) to start to transform how political campaigns work. Well, that moment is here.

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEMuch of the early attention on AI and campaigns has centered on how synthetic media, also known as “deep fakes,” will increase the supply of disinformation, further weakening democracies and potentially upending elections. Just last week, voters in New Hampshire reported receiving a robocall from a voice sounding like Joe Biden, urging people to not vote in the primary.
To the degree that legislators have started to focus on the impact of AI on politics, they’ve responded by trying to make campaigns disclose when they use synthetic media in political advertising. So far, the main response from tech companies is to add digital watermarks to political ads made with AI, to make them easier to spot. Such moves will only affect how official campaign committees operate; they don’t do anything about this new wave of anonymous dirty tricks.
But while videos with realistic replicas of Presidents Biden, Trump, and Obama have circulated widely, showing how easy it has suddenly become to put words into their mouths or pose them in compromising positions, this is just the froth at the top of a much bigger wave. AI is on the verge of changing the practice of campaigning itself.
I got a full blast of what’s coming not long ago, when I got a preview of VotivateAI, an impressive new tool that is emerging out of a joint venture between Votivate, LLC (a spinoff of the Working Families Party’s tech division) and a Louisiana-based AI start-up launched by a former ACORN organizer. By itself, Votivate is an alternative to VAN, the constituent-relationship-management software package that is ubiquitous on both the hard and soft side of liberal/progressive political engagement. The WFP initially built Votivate because in some states the Democratic Party would only give incumbents access to VAN.
VotivateAI is an attempt to leap-frog over existing campaign tools into the future. Three of its offerings stand out. The first, Campaign Assistant, may both appeal to and threaten professional campaign managers. Essentially, if you tell it some basic information about the race you’re involved in, including whether it’s a competitive race or a below-the-radar contest, how much has been raised, and so on, the tool will produce an in-depth campaign strategy memo, which it will continue to update as news develops and variables change.

Will campaign managers use it? Based on a beta sample that I saw, they should at least try it. That’s because campaign professionals can benefit from more opinions than their own and maybe getting the advice of an AI coach can only help. This isn’t the only example of progressives experimenting with training LLMs to do political coaching—New/Mode is also in the process of developing an AI Campaign Strategist for social good and advocacy campaigns.
Votivate AI’s second offering is a low-latency AI voice-calling tool that doesn’t need a precise script, but rather can work from an overview of the campaign to have a natural-seeming conversation. It’s an AI campaign volunteer; unlike a human, it can make thousands of calls without needing a break, or pizza. I listened to a three-minute recording provided by Nic Zateslo, Votivate’s chief operating officer, and the speed and intonation of the AI agent’s banter was quite impressive. It was far more versatile and human-sounding than the ethereal “Ashley” voice that Civox, a London-based start-up, has created for Shamaine Daniels’s congressional campaign in Pennsylvania.
Arguably, the availability of AI campaign volunteer callers could help level the campaign playing field for underdog candidates like Daniels, who says she’s excited about Ashley’s potential to help her reach more voters, understand them better, and connect in more languages (the bot speaks more than 20). “This is going to scale fast,” Ilya Mouzykantskii, the London-based CEO of Civox, told Reuters back in mid-December. “We intend to be making tens of thousands of calls a day by the end of the year and into the six digits pretty soon. This is coming for the 2024 election and it’s coming in a very big way.”
Do we want AI campaign volunteers taking over for human phone-bankers? Compared to auto-dialers, which deliver prerecorded messages, AI callers are far more versatile. And unlike human volunteers, an AI caller can be trusted to stay on message (assuming the tool doesn’t “hallucinate” and the recipient of the call doesn’t try to bait it into silliness). But if campaigns start using AI this way, voters may recoil, worsening a problem we already have thanks to all the unwanted e-mails, texts, and calls they already get. Will campaigns use AI callers to free up human volunteers for more labor-intensive tasks like door-knocking? Or will they make less of an effort to get volunteers in the first place, since they won’t need them as much? A rich candidate with no actual base could buy an army of these things.

There’s an even more troubling question, which also arises around VotivateAI’s third offering: using AI to automatically create high-quality individualized media aimed at moving voters to action. If campaigns now gain the ability to create unique video messages for specific people and to do so quickly, cheaply and at scale, the potential for abuse is enormous. While campaigns may justify this approach since it can help them win elections—and who doesn’t want to find the best way to successfully reach a voter?—hyper-personalized campaign messaging will give politicians who already like to pander to voters the ability to sneakily be all things to all people.
The team at Votivate say they are committed to make sure their tools are only used by progressive candidates and to fight against fascism, to their credit. The founders of Civox also say they intend to mainly work with Democratic campaigns and candidates. (Unspoken are all the opportunities to make money selling these services to businesses.) Unfortunately, one of the most important lessons of the last decade also applies here. Bad actors, including foreign adversaries, will also use these tools.
This means the political waters we swim in are only going to be more polluted. Voters are going to need to be vigilant and, hopefully, more people will share what they are seeing in their inboxes and hearing on their phone lines, which could make it harder for personalized campaigning to tip over into blatant pandering and manipulation. But there’s no simple solution to the use of AI to power campaigns; the future is arriving, and we all had better watch out.

Sources revealed that in January 2024 a report was made on&nbsp; a survey of 300 leaders, from six entertainment industries, including c-suite executives, senior executives and mid-level managers, between November 17, 2023 and December 22, 2023. The firm is expected to have found that 75% of survey respondents indicated Gen AI tools, software and models had supported the elimination, reduction or consolidation of jobs in their business division. It is believed that about 55% of leaders expect sound designers can be affected in the next three years. Over 40% see music editors, audio technicians and sound engineers as vulnerable, with around 33% anticipating impacts on songwriters, composers and studio engineers.

<div id=""p1"">
<div></div>
<div>A new report by Consulting firm CVL Economics has revealed that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) will lead to the loss of more jobs in the films and animation industry than other industries.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The report is based on a survey of 300 leaders from six entertainment industries, including C-Suite executives, senior executives, and mid-level managers late in 2023.</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to the report titled <em>“<a href=""https://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Future-Unscripted-The-Impact-of-Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Entertainment-Industry-Jobs-pages-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FUTURE UNSCRIPTED: The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Entertainment Industry </a><a href=""https://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Future-Unscripted-The-Impact-of-Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Entertainment-Industry-Jobs-pages-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Jobs</a>”,</em> 55% of business leaders surveyed foresee Sound Designers facing the greatest degree of displacement over the next three years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It added that a little over 40% of respondents considered Music Editors, Audio Technicians, and Sound Engineers vulnerable, and roughly 33% expect Songwriters, Composers, and Studio Engineers to experience similar impacts over the next three years.</div>
<ul>
 	<li>
<div><i>“Almost half (47%) of business leaders felt that over the next three years, GenAI will be </i><i>effective in generating 3D assets as well as realistic sound design for film, television, and </i><i>video games.
</i></div></li>
 	<li>
<div><i>“Another 44% believed GenAI would be able to generate realistic and convincing foreign </i><i>language dubbing for film or television dialogue, and 39% believed GenAI would be </i><i>generating music mixes and masters by 2026,” </i>the report stated.</div></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Job cuts in the entertainment industry
</b></h4>
<div>At a time when several entertainment industries are facing challenges, the report noted that the desire to increase productivity, cut costs, and identify new revenue streams will be top of mind.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Already, companies like Riot Games, Unity Software, Amazon MGM Studios, Pixar, and Universal Music Group have announced layoffs within the first few weeks of 2024.</div>
<div></div>
<div>CVL Economics said further job cuts are expected in the months ahead.</div>
<ul>
 	<li>
<div><i>“The introduction of GenAI potentially signifies a large-scale transition from existing </i><i>techniques into new processes, which will likely rebalance the demand for labour and capital </i><i>across the entertainment industries. In doing so, creative workers will be facing an era of </i><i>disruption, defined by the consolidation of some job roles, the replacement of existing job </i><i>roles with new ones, and the elimination of many jobs entirely,” </i>the company added.</div></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>What you should know</b></h4>
<div>Before now, several other reports have established the fact that the entertainment industry will be one of the most impacted by AI.</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to Indeed’s report, Software Development, Media &amp; Communications, and Arts &amp; Entertainment are among the top 20 sectors economy-wide facing exposure to GenAI.</div>
<div></div>
<div>OpenAI’s analysis addresses industry exposure to language model-based AI technologies specifically. It includes Publishing, Broadcasting, Motion Picture and Sound Recording, and Performing Arts among their top 25, underscoring the broad impact GenAI will have across the entertainment sector.</div>
<div></div>
<div>LinkedIn’s research offers a more nuanced view by differentiating between augmentation and disruption. The Technology, Information, and Media sector — which encompasses the Software and Entertainment industries — ranks highest in total GenAI exposure, suggesting that GenAI is likely to play a significant role both in assisting and potentially displacing traditional roles.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Entertainment Providers also appear on the list, with a sizable percentage of the industry experiencing both augmentation and disruption.</div>
