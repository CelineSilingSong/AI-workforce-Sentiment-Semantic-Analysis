A study by researchers at Sweden’s prestigious Stockholm School of Economics (SSE), which looks ahead at the likely impact of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics on people’s lives, should calm the nerves of economic planners and private citizens.
The SSE study The substitution of labour concluded that the introduction of automation technologies will be gradual, and the long-term potential for society is job creation rather than job losses.
The study took the fundamental view that the potential to automate non-routine tasks is likely to remain limited.
This is the fifth report produced under the SSE’s three-year research project, “The internet and its direct and indirect effects on innovation and the Swedish economy”. The project is being funded by Sweden’s Internet Foundation, Internetstiftelsen i Sverige.
At its core, the SSE report investigated the potential long-term impact of AI, machine learning and robotics technologies in the general area of labour replacement.







“We found that technology advancement is unlikely to result in mass unemployment,” said Jochem van der Zande, one of the four researchers behind the SSE study. “It will, rather, lead to more intense collaboration between humans and machines in a way that will change the focus of human labour.”
The study included an impact assessment of new technologies and their likely influence on the Swedish economy. It concluded that although change will be pervade business and industry, influencing how organisations and their employees function, the automation of individual activities is unlikely to displace the majority of working roles and functions that are in place today.
In its own planning strategies for the economy, the Swedish government sees benefits in the ever-changing nature of jobs within increasingly technology-driven workplaces. There is an acceptance that more routine tasks will be replaced by machines, but there is a basic belief that, in the future, humans will work more closely with machines rather than be replaced by them.
“We should not be too afraid of change,” said Ylva Johansson, minister of employment and integration. “Some old jobs will disappear, but new jobs will emerge. Ask any union leader in Sweden if they are fearful of change and the universal response will be a solid ‘no’. Union bosses are less fearful of new methods than they are about old technologies.”
The SSE study identified equipment manufacturing, transportation, high-street retail, warehousing and the wholesale trade as the sectors most likely to replace human workers with AI and robotic automation.

Technical challenges remain
But significant technical challenges to mass automation remain unsolved, according to the SSE study. Computers may well be better at fast-tracking tasks, such as retrieving information from databases, but they lack the capacity and sophistication to compete with human creative intelligence.
Computers also fall short in the routine production of ideas and conceptual thinking. Also, humans perform better in familiar noise-rich working environments, such as manufacturing halls, restaurants and airports.
Machines also lack social and emotional capabilities, although advances in AI and machine learning suggest that gap is narrowing. The SSE researchers said that, based on the current rate of technological progress, many elements of the social and emotional capabilities gap could be effectively eliminated in 20 to 30 years’ time.  
“Creative intelligence is the key – and that is currently one of the most difficult capabilities to automate,” said the report. “To be creative, one must be able to make new combinations of familiar concepts, which requires a rich body of knowledge.”
Sweden’s unstoppable march towards the integration of AI, machine learning and robotics technologies is being fuelled by industry. Swedish companies hope that automation will provide a new dynamic tool to help them compete with goods and services produced in low-cost labour markets in Asia and Eastern Europe.
Latest figures from Sweden’s Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation show a high level of support, both in society and in business, for scaled-up use of AI and robotics. About 80% of Swedes are positive about the idea of increased use of AI and robotics, believing that a move to more computer-based functions will be good for society and the national economy in the long term.
And Sweden’s increasing engagement with AI, machine learning and robotics is not going unnoticed internationally. More Swedish firms, especially those involved in advanced commercial-scale research projects, are likely to be targeted by foreign suitors.

Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important business role for Sweden’s banks – and chatbots are the starting point for many.
The technologists building artificial intelligence algorithms should take responsibility for the technology’s impact on society, a survey finds.
Ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, the World Economic Forum warns that artificial intelligence needs strong governance.



This new trend for acquisitions became apparent when Huachangda Intelligent Equipment, a Chinese industrial robot integrator primarily servicing China’s auto industry, bought Västerås-based Robot System Products (RSP) in November 2017. RSP, which was spun off from the ABB Group in 2003, has operating units in Sweden, Germany and China and produces a range of integral products for robots, including grippers, welding equipment and tool changers.
Sweden’s main services sector also intends to use more AI, machine learning and robotics to automate routine customer-related operations. Swedbank’s increased focus on the digitisation and automation of day-to-day banking services may prove crucial to the bank’s goal of keeping its cost base below SEK17bn (€1.7bn) in 2018 and 2019. Swedbank’s digital-AI-machine learning transition and integration project began in 2016 and is led by its digital banking unit headed by Lotta Lovén.


A positive picture
Ultimately, the SSE’s report paints a positive picture of a future where machines perform more of the routine tasks currently carried out by humans. It underlines the obvious economic benefits of implementing automation, including reduced payroll costs resulting from the substitution of human labour.
The expanded use of AI, machine learning and robotics will inevitably lead to workplaces where fewer employees will be needed to achieve the same output because of increased productivity.
Other value-added advantages of automation include increased throughput and productivity, improved safety, reduced waste and higher quality. For both the private and public sectors, this will help to reduce operating and administration costs, translating into improved operating margins for business and industry.

Superhumanity
March 2018


How will the use of artificial intelligence (AI) affect the workplace and daily life? There is a pessimistic view that “AI creates social problems,” and an optimistic one that “AI solves social problems.” How we understand the impact of AI will be different depending on which perspective we take. But of course, we cannot completely separate these two views from each other, as many have mixed viewpoints, such as promoting AI while maintaining the precautionary principle.
To consider the risks of AI, we need to discuss its ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). Furthermore, we need to recognize that AI cannot be separated from conventional problems caused by information technology (IT). Of course, with AI, there are new problems, such as “Who takes responsibility for the judgments made by machines that learn by themselves?” Yet since information technology first penetrated society, issues such as privacy infringement, information leakage, addiction, and nudging have been problems. While much of the impact expected by AI shares the same problem space and contributes to its extension, it’s important to recognize that AI is currently treated as IT was in the past.
Work
Technology that is difficult for people to use or trust will not penetrate society, even if it is introduced into the workplace. When the personal computer was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, there was a debate around what kind of jobs would be left for people who could not use a personal computer. Now that we are searching the internet for work and writing documents using software, however, there are many people who cannot remember how to find what they are looking for without these technologies.
People use the technology if it is more useful to their jobs, and technology, in turn, becomes more convenient. For example, search engines used to only search text, but now they can search images, movies, voices, etc. Changes such as this largely take place without being noticed. We should also be cautious about overestimating the ability of AI. Even AI engineers themselves are worried about this. There are a lot of activities, such as driving and surgery, where even little mistakes can cause a tragedy. Trust is required, however, and we cannot entirely rely on AI. AI also makes mistake. Troubleshooting will be necessary.
Mastery



Advertisement











We use personal computers and mobile phones without understanding their mechanics or technical operations. AI does not always need to be understood either, but there are a few cases where a certain amount of (re)education is required. For example, driving a car. Cars equipped with automatic braking and automatic steering wheels have already begun to be sold, and largely to drivers who learned how to drive on manual cars. Even though these mechanisms are currently only designed as safety devices, accidents can and will occur if we become overly confident in the automatic capability of machines. Cases such as car automation are transitional technologies, so it is necessary to know what machines can and cannot do. It is therefore necessary to have a place and opportunities for drivers to be reeducated and learn how to drive with AI. Further down the line, automatic driving vehicles themselves might eventually educate people as to what they should and should not do while driving. That said, some people might prefer not to use the technology, or might simply be unable to. Society therefore needs to prepare a safety net, and allow there to be a choice of using AI or not.
Competition
Fordism has long subdivided work into discrete tasks. The Luddite fear that AI will take human jobs is therefore misplaced.1 For instance, the Hen-na Hotel (strange/changing hotel) in the Huis Ten Bosch theme park (Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan) is known for introducing robots to take care of reception, cleaning, concierge, and entertainment.2 Guests hardly see human employees when staying at the hotel. Cleaning is divided into tasks between rooms and corridors, which human beings share with the robots. Due to the sensitivity that guests can have to the cleanliness of their rooms, humans are responsible for their cleaning. The robot, conversely, is in charge of common areas such as corridors, which constantly need to be cleaned.3
Even if the quality of the robot’s performance improves, the task of managing and maintaining the robots remains a human job. In this sense, the concept of “cleaning” in the future may change to mean “cleaning the robot” or “issuing a cleaning instruction,” instead of clearing or removing trash with one’s own hands.4
Specification
AI is good at using machine-learning algorithms for processes of optimization and identification. When actually entering a specific workplace, however, AI will be used according to both its particular purpose and the company’s overarching management policy. While the Hen-na Hotel introduced robots to improve productivity—which has led to staff size being reduced to about one third of what it would otherwise be—the well-established luxury Kagaya Hotel in Ishikawa Prefecture introduced robots into back-of-house operations only. Previously, the hotel staff personally delivered meals to rooms, which imposed a heavy workload on the employees. By introducing an “automatic transfer system” for meals, the hotel aimed to allow employees to concentrate on responding to guests. Contrary to the robot hotel that considers robots as the main staff and humans their support, Kagaya uses robots to support the work of humans.
When introducing AI or robots into a workplace, the value that the company seeks to provide to both employees and customers needs to be considered. Only then can the specific type of AI or robot be found to fit the purpose. While there are managers and company presidents who believe that simply introducing AI or robots will improve their company’s productivity, or who want to do so because their competitors have, the tasks and values of each company vary greatly. Mimicry is not an option.
Problems
It is not just a question of what AI can do, but what humans can and should do. Attention should also be paid to the problems that are left over from earlier forms of IT, such as privacy infringement via the monitoring of one’s location for safety, security, or efficiency. And we cannot deny that the risk of overreliance on IT will—and has—become more serious with the introduction of AI.
Suffering in the workplace will continue to rise until each worker is able to say “no” to technologies that they feel are invasive or over-controlling. The role of the humanities and social sciences in this is to understand and conceptualize those uneasy and unpleasant feelings, and not to disregard them as individualistic selfishness. Problems that arise with the introduction of AI may be rooted in company structures, industry logics, social systems, or human relations. It will therefore become increasingly necessary to focus on the interaction between technology and society to discover the essence of the problem.
AI can be treated as a mirror of our society. It is deeply involved in our daily lives and work, and it questions where we place our values. In other words, AI gives us an opportunity to de- and reconstruct our values, and will lead us to creatively consider the future of our societies.

AI is driving the transformation of business and value creation in new directions.

Online Master of Information Technology 


A new breed of IT expert is getting the knowledge and skills needed to take their place in a burgeoning AI economy.
Whether it is chatbots for customer interaction, neural networks for identifying the patterns tucked in the data or machine learning for improving decision-making, artificial intelligence is driving the transformation of business and value creation in new directions. According to a 2017 study from Cowen and Company, 81 percent of IT leaders are currently investing in or planning to invest in AI.  Angel.co has counted 2,200 AI startups, half of which have emerged in the last two years. By 2019, those startups and others like them will “overtake Amazon,  Google, IBM and Microsoft in driving the [AI]  economy with disruptive business solutions,” according to Gartner.
Few people are as well-positioned as technologists to understand how artificial intelligence is changing the world. After all, IT professionals are accustomed to exploring new automation technologies with the potential for transforming how work gets done.

Most forms of automation focus on performing repetitive, menial tasks. AI’s sweet spot, on the other hand, is in automating tasks that can now be performed by algorithms using access to relevant data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, is an approach to make algorithms “smarter” as they “learn” from more examples. That’s one of the reasons why big data and AI seem to be evolving together.

“With more examples, we can get better algorithms and better prediction accuracy,” explains Kendall Giles, an assistant professor of practice in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech and a faculty member in the university’s Online Master of Information Technology program.
The use of big data and machine learning is just one of the Virginia Tech MIT course concentrations available to students. Those pursuing this degree will position themselves to be in front of a wave of professional demand, with job titles such as:
Machine learning engineer
Data scientist
Research scientist
R&D engineer

Business intelligence developer
Computer vision engineer
Demand for AI specialists
“It is really not a far stretch to claim that every IT professional today must have a working understanding of data science to be successful,” says Naren Ramakrishnan, the Thomas L. Phillips Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech and director of its Discovery Analytics Center. “Seven out of 10 organizations have already invested or plan to invest in big data,” he notes. “Every type of IT practitioner, whether systems or applications, will be impacted by these trends.”

In fact, adds Giles, “There’s a huge shortage in finding people with these skills, who know how to communicate with the computer, who understand technology and who can process data and enjoy doing that.”
According to the New York Times, AI specialists can demand compensation of between $300,000 and $500,000, including salary and company stock, with just a few years of experience. Why such sizable pay? Big companies are driving “a lot of the dollars,” Giles says. “The Googles and Microsofts are able to hire and pay big bucks.”

Virginia Tech’s Online Master of Information Technology program is offered jointly by the College of Engineering and the Pamplin College of Business. Ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the No. 2 “Best Online Graduate Computer Information Technology Programs” the past four years.

When the words “Hello world” appeared in acid green on the tiny screen of a boxy Macintosh computer, I was hooked. I remember thinking with exhilaration, “This thing will do exactly what I tell it to do!” and, only half-ironically, “Finally, someone understands me!” For a kid in the throes of puberty, used to being told what to do by adults of dubious authority, it was freeing to interact with something that hung on my every word – and let me be completely in charge.For a lot of coders, the feeling of empowerment you get from knowing exactly how a thing works – and having complete control over it – is what attracts them to the job. Artificial intelligence (AI) is producing some pretty nifty gadgets, from self-driving cars (in space!) to automated medical diagnoses. The product I’m most looking forward to is real-time translation of spoken language, so I’ll never again make gaffes such as telling a child I’ve just met that I’m their parent or announcing to a room full of people that I’m going to change my clothes in December.But it’s starting to feel as though we’re losing control.These days, most of my interactions with AI consist of shouting, “No, Siri! I said Paris, not bratwurst!” And when my computer does completely understand me, it no longer feels empowering. The targeted ads about early menopause and career counselling hit just a little too close to home, and my Fitbit seems like a creepy Santa Claus who knows when I am sleeping, knows when I’m awake and knows if I’ve been bad or good at sticking to my exercise regimen.Algorithms tracking our every step and keystroke expose us to dangers much more serious than impulsively buying wrinkle cream. Increasingly polarized and radicalized political movements, leaked health data and the manipulation of elections using harvested Facebook profiles are among the documented outcomes of the mass deployment of AI. Something as seemingly innocent as sharing your jogging routes online can reveal military secrets. These cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Even our beloved Canadian Tire money is being repurposed as a surveillance tool for a machine-learning team.Open this photo in gallery:The continuum of creepiness between a Fitbit, above, and 2001: A Space Odyssey's mad computer Hal 9000 may not be as wide as we imagine.MGM/PhotofestFor years, science-fiction writers have spelled out both the technological marvels and the doomsday scenarios that might result from intelligent technology that understands us perfectly and does exactly what we tell it to do. But only recently has the inevitability of tricorders, robocops and constant surveillance become obvious to the non-fan general public. Stories about AI now appear in the daily news, and these stories seem to be evenly split between hyperbolically self-congratulatory pieces by people in the AI world, about how deep learning is poised to solve every problem from the housing crisis to the flu, and doom-and-gloom predictions of cultural commentators who say robots will soon enslave us all. Alexa’s creepy midnight cackling is just the latest warning sign.Which side should we believe? As someone who has played for both teams, my answer is that there are indeed genuine risks we ought to be very worried about, but the most serious risks are not the ones getting the most attention. There are also things we can do to make sure AI is developed in ways that benefit society, but many of the current efforts to address the risk that AI will run amok are misdirected.One scenario I don’t think we need to worry about is the one in which robots become conscious (whatever that means) and decide to kill us. For one thing, conscious robots are still far off. For another, consciousness doesn’t lead directly to murder – it’s a non sequitur. Another scenario I find far-fetched is the one in which a computer tasked with maximizing profits for a paperclip company ends up turning all the resources on the planet (and beyond) into paperclips. Sure, it’s possible, but not very probable. We should be able to switch off that malfunctioning HAL 9000. One thing we should be very concerned about, however, are weaponized drones. Automated killing machines are not going to make our lives better, period.The other serious risk is something I call nerd-sightedness: the inability to see value beyond one’s own inner circle. There’s a tendency in the computer-science world to build first, fix later, while avoiding outside guidance during the design and production of new technology. Both the people working in AI and the people holding the purse strings need to start taking the social and ethical implications of their work much more seriously.In medicine and engineering, there are codes of conduct that professionals are expected to follow. The idea that scientists bear some responsibility for the technologies their work makes possible is also well established in nuclear physics and genetics, even though scientists don’t make the final decision to push the red button or genetically engineer red-headed babies. In the behavioral sciences, there are research-ethics boards that weigh the possible harms to participants in proposed experiments against the benefits to the population. Studies whose results are expected to cause societal harm don’t get approved. In computer science, ethics is optional.Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, which turned 200 this year, is perhaps the most famous warning to scientists not to abdicate responsibility for their creations. Victor Frankenstein literally runs away after seeing the ugliness of his creation, and it is this act of abandonment that leads to the creature’s vengeful, murderous rampage. Frankenstein begins with the same lofty goal as AI researchers currently applying their methods to medicine: “What glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!” In a line dripping with dramatic irony, Frankenstein’s mentor assures him that “the labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” Shelley knew how dangerous this egotistical attitude could be.But the nerd-sighted geniuses of our day make the same mistake. If you ask a coder what should be done to make sure AI does no evil, you’re likely to get one of two answers, neither of which is reassuring. Answer No. 1: “That’s not my problem. I just build it,” as exemplified recently by a Harvard computer scientist who said, “I’m just an engineer” when asked how a predictive policing tool he developed could be misused. Answer No. 2: “Trust me. I’m smart enough to get it right.” AI researchers are a smart bunch, but they have a terrible track record of avoiding ethical blunders. Some of the better-known goof-ups include Google images tagging black people as gorillas, chat bots that turn into Nazis and racist soap dispensers. The consequences can be much more serious when biased algorithms are in charge of deciding who should be approved for a bank loan, who to hire or admit to university or whether to kill a suspect in a police chase.Open this photo in gallery:Tay, a chatbot designed by Microsoft, was introduced in 2016 as an experiment to teach an AI how to hold conversations with people. Within 24 hours, Twitter users had taught it to say racist and misogynist things. Microsoft quickly closed off the bot to the public.TwitterThere is a growing movement within AI to do better. For the first time, this past December, one of the top AI conferences, NIPS, featured a keynote about bias in AI. The New York Times recently reported that top computer-science schools such as MIT and Stanford are rushing to roll out ethics courses in response to a newfound awareness that the build-it-first, fix-it-later ethos isn’t cutting it.In fact, such courses have existed for a long time. The University of Toronto’s computer-science program has a computers and society course, which includes a few weeks of ethics. Philosophy departments and, where they exist, interdisciplinary departments such as science and technology studies, history and philosophy of science and media studies also routinely offer courses covering the social and ethical implications of technology. Unfortunately, these courses are rarely required for computer-science degrees, so most graduates don’t get any ethics training at all. I’m currently teaching a course about the social and ethical implications of AI in health care – to about a dozen students.That’s what may be changing. When I contacted François Pitt, the undergraduate co-ordinator of U of T’s computer science department, he said the issue of ethics training had come up four or five times just that week. Steve Easterbrook, the professor in charge of the computers and society course, agrees that there needs to be more ethics training, noting that moral reasoning in computer-science students has been shown to be “much less mature than students from most other disciplines.” Instead of one course on ethics, he says “it ought to be infused across the curriculum, so that all students are continually exposed to it.” Prof. Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill agrees, commenting on Twitter, “You have to integrate ethics into the computer science curriculum from the first moment you teach students here’s a variable, here’s an array, and look, we can sort things. When you run your first qsort, [a standard sorting algorithm encountered in computer-science 101 courses], you’ve encountered ethical and ontological questions.”Open this photo in gallery:It remains to be seen how computer-science departments can pull off that sort of sweeping curriculum change, given that many of their faculty have just as little ethics training as their students. Philosophy departments regularly face the frustration of having the expertise to teach applied ethics courses, only to have those courses get poached by law, medicine and engineering departments, which require their students to take in-house ethics courses that are often taught by non-experts. Hopefully, computer-science departments expanding their ethics offerings will see the need to hire trained ethicists to design and teach the courses. Frankly, opportunities for philosophers to make themselves useful are rare enough that we shouldn’t pass them over in cases where their training has real value.Another kind of effort at fixing AI’s ethics problem is the proliferation of crowdsourced ethics projects, which have the commendable goal of a more democratic approach to science. One example is DJ Patil’s Code of Ethics for Data Science, which invites the data-science community to contribute ideas but doesn’t build up from the decades of work already done by philosophers, historians and sociologists of science. Then there’s MIT’s Moral Machine project, which asks the public to vote on questions such as whether a self-driving car with brake failure ought to run over five homeless people rather than one female doctor. Philosophers call these “trolley problems” and have published thousands of books and papers on the topic over the past half-century. Comparing the views of professional philosophers with those of the general public can be eye-opening, as experimental philosophy has repeatedly shown, but simply ignoring the experts and taking a vote instead is irresponsible.The point of making AI more ethical is so it won’t reproduce the prejudices of random jerks on the internet. Community participation throughout the design process of new AI tools is a good idea, but let’s not do it by having trolls decide ethical questions. Instead, representatives from the populations affected by technological change should be consulted about what outcomes they value most, what needs the technology should address and whether proposed designs would be usable given the resources available. Input from residents of heavily policed neighbourhoods would have revealed that a predictive policing system trained on historical data would exacerbate racial profiling. Having a person of colour on the design team for that soap dispenser should have made it obvious that a peachy skin tone detector wouldn’t work for everyone. Anyone who has had a stalker is sure to notice the potential abuses of selfie drones. Diversifying the pool of talent in AI is part of the solution, but AI also needs outside help from experts in other fields, more public consultation and stronger government oversight.Open this photo in gallery:Elderly people play with a robot named NAO, manufactured by Softbank Robotics, in their retirement home in Bordeaux, France.REGIS DUVIGNAU/REUTERSAnother recent article in The New York Times claimed that “academics have been asleep at the wheel,” leaving policy makers who are struggling to figure out how to regulate AI at the mercy of industry lobbyists. The article set off a Twitter storm of replies from philosophers, historians and sociologists of science, angry that their decades of underfunded work is again being ignored and erased. Like the Whos down in Whoville, they cried out in fear, “We are here! We are here! We are here! We are here!” If policy makers and funding sources listen closely to those voices, there are solutions being offered. The article concludes that we “urgently need an academic institute focused on algorithmic accountability.” On Twitter, the article’s author, Cathy O’Neil, insisted, “There should be many many more tenure lines devoted to it.” Those both sound like solid ideas.How does this play out in the Canadian context? The federal government recently earmarked $125-million for a Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy – with the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in charge – and three new research institutes in Edmonton, Toronto and Montreal. One of the goals is to “develop global thought leadership on the economic, ethical, policy and legal implications of advances in artificial intelligence.”There are promising signs already. An International Scientific Advisory Committee on AI Strategy was recently announced and includes a co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, which has a mission to safeguard life against technological challenges. CIFAR just launched an AI and society program featuring workshops and publications designed to stimulate discussion and guide policy makers on the ethical, legal, economic and policy issues AI presents for society. The Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute so far focuses on industry partnerships, while Toronto’s Vector Institute has particular strengths in deep learning and medical applications of AI. Vector Institute research director Richard Zemel has a growing side project in algorithmic fairness and has been making connections with legal scholars and researchers from the University of Toronto’s Centre for Ethics. Another group is studying AI and safety. Prof. Zemel promises that bringing in social scientists, ethicists and policy analysts is something he is “determined to do.”The Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) has taken several concrete steps toward addressing AI’s ethical challenges, including offering diversity scholarships, hosting an interdisciplinary forum on the socially responsible development of AI and announcing the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of AI. Although this too is a crowdsourced ethical code, there’s a key difference: Philosophers, social scientists and policy analysts were involved in its inception and will oversee the final document.What’s still lacking is investment in jobs dedicated to the social, ethical and policy implications of AI. The Vector Institute is hiring research scientists and postdocs, and MILA is hiring interns, postdocs and professors, but in each case, expertise in machine learning is the main job qualification. CIFAR’s AI and society workshops propose to bring together “interdisciplinary teams to explore emerging questions about how AI could affect the world,” but there are precious few jobs in Canada (or elsewhere) for people who study AI’s effects from the perspective of the humanities and social sciences. Alongside the creation of new tenure lines and graduate degrees in AI, we need to invest in training and employing experts in the social, ethical and policy implications of AI if we’re to have a hope of predicting and preventing dangerous outcomes.Open this photo in gallery:Sophia, a robot with Saudi Arabian citizenship, interacts at an innovation fair in Kathmandu. As the technical achievements of robotics and AI advance, there are few jobs to study artificial intelligence from a humanities or social-science perspective.NAVESH CHITRAKARA recent CIFAR event illustrates what’s still missing in the strategy. The workshop brought together AI and health researchers for a joint project to develop systems to do things such as predict flu outbreaks. Sounds good, but work by philosophers of science has shown that putting people in the same boardroom is not enough to make interdisciplinary projects work. Researchers in different fields use different vocabularies, concepts and methods – and may have conflicting goals. Words such as “bias,” “naive,” “ontology,” “regression” and “supervised” have technical meanings in AI that are very different than their usual meanings. Having a translator of sorts at the table to integrate across disciplines is essential to avoid potentially costly misunderstandings. That means inviting philosophers, sociologists and historians of science to the table.Fahad Razak, an internist at St. Michael’s Hospital and an assistant professor of health policy, management and evaluation at the University of Toronto, describes facing just this kind of challenge applying AI methods in his research. The Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute’s General Medicine Inpatient Initiative at St. Mike’s applies machine learning to health-care data with the aim of improving treatment, especially for patients with multiple concurrent diagnoses. One of the main challenges with health-care data sets, according to Prof. Razak, is “a data-quality problem, both with data being inaccurate or poorly coded, but also often because of the lack of lots of relevant data.” Socioeconomic status and the ability to function without assistance at home are two examples of important data that is often missing. But, he says, computer scientists don’t realize how messy and gappy the data is, and because of the hype around AI, health researchers “believe that AI methods are so miraculous, they just work despite data quality problems!”If every computer-science student were taught to look for social and ethical problems as soon as they learn about variables, arrays and sorting, as Prof. Tufekci suggests, they would realize that the way health data is coded matters very much. For example, recording age as a range, such as under 19, 19-24, 25-35, may seem harmless, but whether a patient is 1 or 17 can make a big difference to their health-care needs. An algorithm that doesn’t take that into account could make fatal mistakes – for example, by suggesting the wrong dosage. Likewise, since income is usually missing from health data sets, an algorithm could draw false conclusions about how to prevent diabetes or premature births.These are just a small sample of the mistakes we need to prevent. The current generation of AI researchers (with a few exceptions) do not have the training necessary to deal with the implications of the AI they are building. So far, the experts who do have that training are not being hired to help. That needs to change – or the darkest of science fiction will become reality.Open this photo in gallery:Universal Studios Home Entertainment/Associated PressSign up for the Opinion Newsletter.Keep your opinions sharp and informed with a helpful summary of The Globe’s most provocative columns, covering politics, world affairs, business, arts, health and the way we liveRegister to sign upExplore newsletters",bottom-furniture-recommendations-bottom-furniture-more-for-you,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Catherine Stinson', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail'}}]",Deep learning: Why it’s time for AI to get philosophical,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.l-article'}",False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'url': '/business/article-cleveland-cliffs-to-buy-canadian-steel-maker-stelco-in-us25-billion/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'url': '/world/article-trump-assassination-attempt-rally-shooting-details/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'url': '/business/commentary/article-a-mortgage-crisis-still-looms-for-canada-for-the-worst-is-yet-to-come/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'url': '/world/article-trump-shooting-police-butler-pennsylvania/'}]","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Globe and Mail', 'productID': 'theglobeandmail.com:access'}",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail'}",2018.0,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'url': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/', 'inLanguage': 'en'}",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/ZSPMSMM5QREOBFHPOENAV36CUA.jpg?auth=dc574be76a777b6681f84911d5d9b0b7fd8eb76f049ea93dac3cd271f47f1f95&width=640&quality=80,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were shooting a powder-blue 1962 Austin Mini, but through special effects the rusted relic would be transformed into an autonomous vehicle that looked more like the DeLorean from “Back to the Future.”Stepping back from the camera, Mr. Avalos referred wryly to the movie he was filming as “Project Unemployment.” The film was a way of testing new technology from a start-up called Arraiy, which is trying to automate the creation of digital effects for movies, television and games.ImageTesting Arraiy’s technology at the company’s offices in Palo Alto, Calif. “This is no joke; it will put people out of work,” said a filmmaker who also runs a visual effects house.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesThis new type of artificial intelligence, which is also being developed by the software giant Adobe and in other technology industry research labs, could ultimately replace many of the specialists who build such effects.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“This is no joke; it will put people out of work,” said Mr. Avalos, a Los Angeles-based filmmaker who also runs a visual effects house. “The artists are safe. But it will replace all the drudgery.”Over the past three decades, computer-generated imagery has transformed how movies and television are made. But building digital effects is still a painstaking and enormously tedious process. For every second of movie time, armies of designers can spend hours isolating people and objects in raw camera footage, digitally building new images from scratch and combining the two as seamlessly as possible.ImageOne of the main ways Arraiy engineers train their artificial intelligence software is by photographing objects in a controlled environment and allowing the algorithm to practice separating the foreground from the background.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesArraiy (pronounced “array”) is building systems that can handle at least part of this process. The company’s founders, Gary Bradski and Ethan Rublee, also created Industrial Perception, one of several robotics start-ups snapped up by Google several years ago.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Filmmakers can do this stuff, but they have to do it by hand,” said Mr. Bradski, a neuroscientist and computer vision specialist with a long history in Silicon Valley. He has worked with companies as varied as the chip maker Intel and the augmented reality start-up Magic Leap.Backed by more than $10 million in financing from the Silicon Valley venture firm Lux Capital, SoftBank Ventures and others, Arraiy is part of a widespread effort spanning industry and academia and geared toward building systems that can generate and manipulate images on their own.ImageWesley Chaney, an Arraiy engineer, shows off an application that enables so-called green screen footage to be processed quickly.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesThanks to improvements in so-called neural networks — complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data — these systems can edit noise and mistakes out of images or apply simple effects and create highly realistic images of very fake people or help graft one person’s head onto the body of someone else.Inside Arraiy’s offices — the old auto body shop — Mr. Bradski and Mr. Rublee are building computer algorithms that can learn design tasks by analyzing years of work by movie effects houses. That includes systems that learn to “rotoscope” raw camera footage, carefully separating people and objects from their backgrounds so that they can be dropped onto new backgrounds.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdobe, which makes many of the software tools used by today’s designers, is also exploring so-called machine learning that can automate similar tasks.ImageUnique “tackers” used to calibrate camera lenses with the A.I. software are placed within a scene being filmed at Arraiy.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesAt Industrial Perception, Mr. Rublee helped develop computer vision for robots designed to perform tasks like loading and unloading freight trucks. Not long after Google acquired the start-up, work on neural networks took off inside the tech giant. In about two weeks, a team of Google researchers “trained” a neural network that outperformed technology from the start-up that had taken years to create.Mr. Rublee and Mr. Bradski collected a decade of rotoscoping and other visual effects work from various design houses, which they declined to identify. And they are adding their own work to the collection. After filming people, mannequins and other objects in front of a classic “green screen,” for example, company engineers can quickly rotoscope thousands of images relatively quickly to be added to the data collection. Once the algorithm is trained, it can rotoscope images without help from a green screen.The technology still has flaws, and in some cases human designers still make adjustments to the automated work. But it is improving.ImagePreparing a set for filming, and for testing Arraiy’s technology.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times“These methods are still rough around the edges — there is still a long tail of things that can go wrong in unpredictable ways — but there aren’t any fundamental roadblocks,” said Phillip Isola, a computer vision researcher at M.I.T. and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab created by Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and others.Mr. Avalos thinks this work could ultimately supplant work done by his own effects house. But he is comfortable with that. He already farms out many of the more tedious tasks, via the internet, to workers in other countries.As hardware improves, these methods will help generate preliminary effects right on the movie set, giving filmmakers a better idea of what the finished product will look like, Mr. Bradski said. The Mill, an effects house based in London, recently used Arraiy’s technology to create a system that could instantly apply effects that change the look of an automobile.If tech companies can help automate some of the grunt work involved in creating special effects, creative people will have a chance to try new things, said Pasha Shapiro, a filmmaker and special effects artist who has also worked with Arraiy.“Some work is so tedious that it is not practical,” he said. “That is where technology can help even more.”Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning are shaping up to dominate the tech industry in coming years, and software developers are eager to work with them. This according to a new study from Digital Ocean, which queried tech professionals on a variety of topics. Notably, 81 percent say they are “interested in learning about” or trying A.I. and/or Machine Learning (ML) tech this year. Good thing there are lots of educational resources out there for that! When asked what advancements they were most interested in, developers and software engineers gave a mixed-bag response, though most were interested in automation. Here’s how it shapes up: 
 Digital Ocean’s data is close to Stack Overflow’s Developer Survey, which notes 40.8 percent of developers voiced a desire to increase automation in their daily routines. Similarly, 19.8 percent of developers in Stack Overflow’s survey say they felt artificial intelligence was “dangerous”... which is almost the exact same figure who show no interest in artificial intelligence via Digital Ocean’s survey. Specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning can greatly boost software engineers' take-home pay, which is one of the reasons they're excited about it. Salaries for software engineers are already high: At Google's L7 level (i.e., senior staff software engineer), annual salary can top $256,059 per year, coupled with $286,176 in stock options and a bonus of $83,294. With the right background in A.I. and ML, though, payouts can spiral into the millions; at Google, self-driving experts were paid so much that they basically started to retire. Compare Google’s data to Microsoft, where engineers who hit level 67 (i.e., principal software development engineer, and roughly equivalent to Google’s L7) are paid roughly $222,714 in salary, along with $226,000 per year in stock options, and a bonus of $73,143. A.I. and ML skills will make that go even higher. Consumers are already using A.I. with aplomb. Though the use-cases for digital home assistants are limited, customers enjoy them. A recent Gallup poll shows 85 percent of customers claim to be using at least one device or program with A.I. baked in. Around 81 percent of developers interested in A.I. and ML has another important angle: it’s a sharp increase from the last time Digital Ocean asked devs how they feel. These ‘Currents’ surveys are released quarterly, with the last coming in December of 2017. At that time, 73 percent of devs were interested in A.I. Artificial Intelligence is also seeing a boom in job growth. Canadian startup Element AI examined LinkedIn data and found a potential six-digit deficit in A.I. researcher positions. Dice’s own Salary Survey shows skills related to artificial intelligence (such as Python) are lucrative, and incomes are gaining steam. It’s also worth noting Digital Ocean’s data points to A.I. efforts coming from outside academia or big companies like Google or Apple. 32 percent of respondents work at companies with less than six employees, and 54 percent had a total headcount of 25 or fewer. Only 15 percent came from companies with 1,000 or more employees; the same percentage as those with over 100 employees.

This year, AI grabbed hold of the Swiss outpost and supercharged the conversation with a palpable shift in tone. In just one day, more than 20 news dispatches about AI came out of Davos in Bloomberg alone.It’s not hard to understand our AI obsession: For years, many of Silicon Valley’s highest-profile leaders, from Elon Musk and Marc Benioff to Bill Gates, have issued warnings about coming waves of automation, saying that they could threaten our jobs and ways of life.This year’s World Economic Forum gathering in Davos included some of that alarmism. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, reiterated his own prediction that AI and robots aren’t only going to take a lot of jobs, they’re also going to start World War III.But Ma’s comments felt out of date this year.Instead of imagining a future of robot overlords, the vast majority of Davos attendees with whom I spoke or heard commentary from instead said they now envision AI augmenting our strengths, not replacing them. Think Iron Man, not Terminator.However, outside of Davos, Ma’s–or, for that matter, Musk’s or Steve Wozniak’s–alarmism is still all too common when it comes to predicting the future of work. And that’s not a good thing. Fearmongering threatens to create the dismal future we all seek to avoid. Envisioning negative outcomes can help us better prepare for the future, but can also pave the path to them. Simply put, we can’t let our anxieties become self-fulfilling prophecies.Related: How Demographics, Automation, And Inequality Will Shape The Next DecadeTo get a sense of the extent to which fear of AI has crept into our psyches, consider the results of Pew Research Center’s survey last fall.When it comes to advancing automation of jobs, Americans are almost twice as anxious as they are excited. Among U.S. adults, 72% say they’re worried “about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans,” according to Pew.Gallup’s latest polls on AI, released in January, show that many Americans “remain largely positive about the impact the new technology will have on their lives and work over the next decade.” At the same time, three in four Americans believe that AI will destroy more jobs than it creates.These are depressing statistics because they’re self-reinforcing. If more and more people expect robots will take over their jobs, what incentive do they have to invest in new skills? Won’t their next job be automated, too? Without answers to those questions, how does a worker even go about deciding what new skill to learn?But if, instead, we envision positive potential outcomes, we can plan accordingly by discussing how to best point ourselves in their direction. Fortunately, new research gives us a practical guide to think seriously about future-of-work solutions and, by helping foster constructive conversation, also provides some relief from the anxiety all this fearmongering creates.[Photo: courtesy of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Wikimedia Commons]Lost, FoundIn collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group, a January WEF report, “Towards a Reskilling Revolution,” set out to create a “building block for workers looking to find their place in the future of work and for business leaders and governments looking to build more prosperous companies and productive economies and societies.” Using the United States labor market, it looks at the jobs most likely to disappear next as a result of technological change, and then examines the practical job options for the displaced.No one knows how fast artificial intelligence will advance, and without knowing that, it’s impossible to say how many jobs will truly be lost. An OECD study from 2016 estimated that 9% of jobs are threatened by automation while another study says 50%.The WEF/Boston Consulting Group report shows that the number of jobs lost might not actually matter very much. Why? Because it finds that the skills used to perform the jobs most currently at risk of being automated will help these workers transition to new careers less at risk of automation.advertisementAs I’ve argued before, work is not a fixed pie that machines are eating a bigger and bigger piece of while humans get less and less. New technologies create new jobs, too. Cars killed off the horse and buggy, but replaced it with a giant auto industry. In the 1980s and ’90s, as banks began installing ATMs everywhere, people assumed bank tellers would lose their jobs, but that’s not what happened. Banks used the savings they reaped from labor-saving tech to open more banks and change the job of a teller to be more of a customer service rep, and today banks employ more tellers than they did in 1980.Of course, we can’t expect displaced coal miners to all become software engineers. So what skills will translate to new jobs?Turns out, a lot.The U.S. government’s Department of Labor predicts that 1.4 million workers currently employed will be displaced by technological disruption by 2026. But when the WEF studied Labor Department data, its analysis found “good-fit” job transitions for 96% of those 1.4 million workers.Office clerks might be replaced. But the WEF report says their skills could translate well to being a customer service rep. And software might displace legal secretaries, but the report says their skills make them a good fit to be paralegals.[Photo: Rawpixel.com]From Fear To ActionWhile few countries have taken action in this area, there are some national examples showing what’s possible.Singapore has launched a lifelong learning initiative that’s focused on developing future-oriented skills that can help enhance workers’ productivity. The WEF has also praised the apprenticeship and vocational training programs of Germany and Switzerland. Germany’s Educational Vocation Act, for example, provides 500,000 Germans with two to three years of classroom instruction combined with paid on-the-job apprenticeships.Unfortunately, the United States hasn’t yet taken the lead. There are no national plans to tackle the issue. And while a lot of discussion is developing around the idea of a universal basic income, that is a distraction, not a solution. Education and training are what matter, and solutions addressing them are most urgent.Related: These Two Silicon Valley Pizza Places Show The Challenges Posed By Automation And Inequality Just last week, for instance, AT&T announced a billion-dollar retraining initiative. The company has one of the largest workforces in the world and, when research showed only half its employees had the STEM skills they needed, it decided to take action. According to Bill Blase, senior vice president of human resources at AT&T, the company chose to “try to reskill our existing workforce so they could be competent in the technology and the skills required to run the business going forward.”While AT&T’s move is promising, I still know of no public-private partnerships like Germany’s or Switzerland’s to train the 1.4 million workers that U.S. government’s own analysis predicts will be displaced within eight years. As it stands, the U.S. spends less on vocational training as a percentage of its GDP than almost every other country in the developed world.But that can change. We must enter the next wave of automation prepared, because we can either build the future we want, or be changed by it. First, though, we have to change our conversations themselves, from less anxious predictions to more discussion of how to work toward positive outcomes.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards before the final deadline, July 12.Sign up for Next Big Things in Tech Awards notifications here.

Facebook has made a high-profile hire as part of a plan to expand its AI research team in Seattle — adding to an already-fierce competition for talent in the artificial intelligence field.
The social network has signed up Luke Zettlemoyer, a computer science professor at the University of Washington who was most recently a senior research manager at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2.
Zettlemoyer is considered a rising star in the AI field, and was among the researchers featured last November in a New York Times article about the bidding war for artificial intelligence talent. He left AI2 last week and began at Facebook this week. His move comes as the Allen Institute, created by Paul Allen, looks to ramp up its own hiring in a tight market for AI talent with help from an additional $125 million in funding from the Microsoft co-founder.
Facebook spokesman Ari Entin said Zettlemoyer will be working with the company’s Seattle-based computational photography team, which was formed in 2015 and is led by Microsoft veteran Rick Szeliski. But Entin added that Zettlemoyer will report to Menlo Park, Calif., under the broader aegis of Facebook AI Research, also known as FAIR.

Zettlemoyer, who led the AllenNLP natural language processing project as part of his AI2 work, is expected to continue working part-time as a UW professor while at Facebook. In November’s New York Times article, Zettlemoyer cited his desire to continue teaching as a reason for turning down an earlier job offer from Google.
His hiring by Facebook is part of a broader initiative targeting AI as a “very significant investment area,” Entin told GeekWire.
“We’re going to continue to recruit and build up our presence in Seattle,” he said. “Luke isn’t a single hire and we’re done.”
Facebook’s recruiting campaign sparked speculation in Seattle’s AI research community that the company would soon open full-scale FAIR labs in Seattle, but Enten played down that idea. “We have FAIR representation in that office, but it’s not a full-scale lab like Montreal, Paris, NY or Menlo Park,” he said in an email.
For what it’s worth, Facebook is looking for research interns to work with FAIR in Seattle as well in Menlo Park and New York — which serves as another indication that Facebook is raising Seattle’s profile in AI research.
Ed Lazowska, a leading computer science professor at the University of Washington, said Facebook’s hiring campaign is “one of a number of signs of Seattle’s emergence as a center of excellence in AI — specifically in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and AR/VR.”
“We have in the past attracted many companies here because of the region’s deep expertise in infrastructure engineering — in building web-scale systems,” Lazowska told GeekWire in an email. “We’re beginning to see that happening in AI, another key technology for the future.”

Facebook already has a significant presence in the Seattle area. Just this month, executives showed off the company’s new 150,000-square-foot Seattle office on Westlake Avenue, which will eventually house 900 employees. When you add in Facebook’s nearby engineering center, that provides enough capacity for close to 3,000 workers in Seattle’s core.
Facebook’s VR company, Oculus, has a separate operation in Redmond, Wash.
And when it comes to Seattle AI research, Facebook is far from alone: Initiatives in artificial intelligence are among the top priorities for local powerhouses Amazon and Microsoft. Last year, Google’s AI investment arm led a $10.5 million funding round for Seattle-based Algorithmia.
 It’s a very, very, very competitive field right now for anybody who has any expertise here, and it’s just going to grow.
AI2, which was created by Allen five years ago, has contributed to Seattle’s standing by spawning initiatives such as the Semantic Scholar search engine as well as spin-outs such as Kitt.ai (which was bought by Baidu last year) and Xnor.ai. The institute has an increasingly active incubator program for AI startups.
Last month, Allen committed $125 million to fund a new initiative at AI2 called Project Alexandria, which aims to foster “common-sense AI.” With the additional funding, AI2 is planning a significant increase in its hiring of artificial intelligence researchers.
There could be a downside to a recruiting campaign that targets institutions such as AI2 and the University of Washington’s highly regarded Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. Scooping up professors and senior researchers en masse could make it tougher to train the next generation of AI developers.
Another potential downside has to do with Facebook’s image problem, highlighted by a scandal over the disastrous mishandling of personal data that was gleaned from the social network’s users. It may be a bit tougher to recruit talent when lawmakers are calling for hearings and the company’s stock is falling.
“Personally, I question whether I would be interested in working for Facebook, given what we’ve learned to date,” AI2’s CEO, Oren Etzioni, told GeekWire.
The potential upside is that all the added attention could strengthen the Seattle area’s pull as a magnet for AI talent. On that score, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., delivered a commercial message at least as enticing as Facebook’s job listings this week during an AI conference in Washington, D.C.
“I can tell you right now, if you have any kind of AI education, please head to Seattle, Washington,” she said. “The employers there are telling me it’s a very, very, very competitive field right now for anybody who has any expertise here, and it’s just going to grow.”

Meagan Metzger
Founder and CEO, Dcode
“I’ve found that tech in D.C. tends to be a very inclusive space,” Meagan Metzger, founder and CEO of the government tech accelerator Dcode told FedScoop. That said, leadership positions are still male-dominated. “It’s no secret that government and the contracting industry are still very male at the top: I’ve gone into countless meetings as the only woman in the room. As a female CEO, I’m now trying to do my part to make sure women in leadership are visible, heard, and seen as the norm in government technology.” One way to do this? Make sure there are women on panels at industry conferences. “I’m on a personal mission to make sure that there is not yet another all-male speaking lineup at major government or tech conferences,” Metzger said.
