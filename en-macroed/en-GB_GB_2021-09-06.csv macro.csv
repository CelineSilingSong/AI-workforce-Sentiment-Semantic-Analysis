AI is becoming strategic for many companies across the world. The technology can be transformative for just about any part of a business. 

But AI is not easy to implement. Even top-notch companies have challenges and failures.


So what can be done? Well, one strategy is to provide AI education to the workforce. 

“If more people are AI literate and can start to participate and contribute to the process, more problems–both big and small–across the organization can be tackled,” said David Sweenor, who is the Senior Director of Product Marketing at Alteryx. “We call this the ‘Democratization of AI and Analytics.’ A team of 100, 1,000, or 5,000 working on different problems in their areas of expertise certainly will have a bigger impact than if left in the hands of a few.”

Just look at Levi Strauss & Co. Last year the company implemented a full portfolio of enterprise training programs—for all employees at all levels—focused on data and AI for business applications. For example, there is the Machine Learning Bootcamp, which is an eight-week program for learning Python coding, neural networks and machine learning—with an emphasis on real-world scenarios. 
PROMOTED
“Our goal is to democratize this skill set and embed data scientists and machine learning practitioners throughout the organization,” said Louis DeCesari, who is the Global Head of Data, Analytics, and AI at Levi Strauss & Co. “In order to achieve our vision of becoming the world’s best digital apparel company, we need to integrate digital into all areas of the enterprise.”
Granted, corporate training programs can easily become a waste. This is especially the case when there is not enough buy-in at the senior levels of management.
It is also important to have a training program that is more than just a bunch of lectures. “You need to have outcomes-based training,” said Kathleen Featheringham, who is the Director of Artificial Intelligence Strategy at Booz Allen. “Focus on how AI can be used to push forward the mission of the organization, not just training for the sake of learning about AI.  Also, there should be roles-based training. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to training, and different personas within an organization will have different training needs.”

AI training can definitely be daunting because of the many topics and the complex concepts. In fact, it might be better to start with basic topics. 
“A statistics course can be very helpful,” said Wilson Pang, who is the Chief Technology Officer at Appen. “This will help employees understand how to interpret data and how to make sense of data. It will equip the company to make data driven decisions.”

There also should be coverage of how AI can go off the rails. “There needs to be training on ethics,” said Aswini Thota, who is a Principal Data Scientist at Bose Corporation. “Bad and biased data only exacerbate the issues with AI systems.”

For the most part, effective AI is a team sport. So it should really involve everyone in an organization. 
“The acceleration of AI adoption is inescapable—most of us experience AI on a daily basis whether we realize it or not,” said Alex Spinelli, who is the Chief Technology Officer at LivePerson. “The more companies educate employees about AI, the more opportunities they’ll provide to help them stay up-to-date as the economy increasingly depends on AI-inflected roles. At the same time, nurturing a workforce that’s ahead of the curve when it comes to understanding and managing AI will be invaluable to driving the company’s overall efficiency and productivity.”

It turns out that/news/2019/04/move-from-banking-to-private-equityprofessionals do too. A new study by a professor at one of France's top finance universities explains how.

Professor Thomas Åstebro at Paris-based HEC says private equity firms are using artificial intelligence (AI) to push the limits of human cognition and to support decision-making. Åstebro says the sorts of people employed by private equity funds is changing as a result. 

Åstebro looked at the use of AI systems across various private equity and venture capital firms. He found that funds that have embraced AI are using decision support systems (DSS) across the investment decision-making process, including to source potential targets for investments before rivals. 

Data companies specializing in the investment process are already emerging. - For example, one firm, InReach Ventures, claims to have developed software that can analyze around 2,500 start-ups each month. In other cases, funds have developed proprietary technology in-house.

One of the funds Åstebro studied was Paris-based private equity firm, Jolt Capital, which has developed its own DSS called ""Ninja."" Jolt introduced Ninja in 2019 and by the spring of 2020 it had already automatically stored and identified data on over 600,000 companies. A further 15,000 companies had been reviewed and by the algorithm, 3,000 were liked by a partner and 300 were passed to the investment committee for review. Jolt invested in 17 companies over the period. 

Jean Schmitt, partner and CEO at Jolt Capital, told Åstebro that the traditional approach to identifying target companies worthy of investment involved hiring juniors, typically MBA graduates, and training them in how to spot good deals.  This often didn't work well, said Schmitt: ""I don’t want a junior to filter my deals, because they have their own biases, and often won’t see the real opportunity.”

By comparison, Schmitt said Ninja made the investment process more efficient by codifying his own decision-making. ""The point is to train the system to understand what I like and don’t like, and then the system can show me what I would normally like...every week we are looking at 70 opportunities brought up by the system. This thing is a productivity tool, so there’s no idle time.” 

It turns out that even partners at private equity firms aren't great at identifying investment opportunities. Philippe Laval, the CTO at Jolt who helped develop Ninja, pointed out that partners don't learn much in the process of investing because their investments don't happen very often. Senior partners have the greatest insights, but this is a problem because it means that decision-making ability is focused in the hands of a few top people. 

At Jolt, the artificial intelligence system has changed the jobs of senior staff and reduced the need for juniors. In the past, partners spent a lot of their time travelling to meetings and on phone calls, and didn't record data systematically. Now, they spend around three hours a day on Ninja reviewing investment decisions suggested by the system, and the system is trained on their decision-making process. 

Pierre Garnier, a partner at Jolt, said Ninja's reports help him appear more informed when he gets in front of clients: ""This guy really knows the sector … I’m engaging with smart investors.” Private equity partners enjoy working with the AI-driven systems, says Åstebro: ""What is not to like about an algorithm that is your digital self and relieves you from spending hours in planes and meetings and sifting through websites?""

While partners are empowered by the artificial intelligence, juniors have seen their jobs disappear. If AI is doing the analysis and due-diligence previously undertaken by juniors, those juniors will be far less in demand than before. Technology and data staff will replace junior bankers as private equity funds' preferred hires.  

In future Åstebro says funds will,  ""spend more on information technology, and decisions will be made much more quickly. Those that don't risk missing out on the best opportunities and disappearing altogether.

But it is not a threat to professional programmers.Tom Smith, a veteran programmer, shows how Codex can instantly generate computer code from a request in plain English.Credit...By Jason HenrySupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTShare full article71Read in appBy Cade MetzPublished Sept. 9, 2021Updated Sept. 10, 2021As soon as Tom Smith got his hands on Codex — a new artificial intelligence technology that writes its own computer programs — he gave it a job interview.He asked if it could tackle the “coding challenges” that programmers often face when interviewing for big-money jobs at Silicon Valley companies like Google and Facebook. Could it write a program that replaces all the spaces in a sentence with dashes? Even better, could it write one that identifies invalid ZIP codes?It did both instantly, before completing several other tasks. “These are problems that would be tough for a lot of humans to solve, myself included, and it would type out the response in two seconds,” said Mr. Smith, a seasoned programmer who oversees an A.I. start-up called Gado Images. “It was spooky to watch.”Codex seemed like a technology that would soon replace human workers. As Mr. Smith continued testing the system, he realized that its skills extended well beyond a knack for answering canned interview questions. It could even translate from one programming language to another.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYet after several weeks working with this new technology, Mr. Smith believes it poses no threat to professional coders. In fact, like many other experts, he sees it as a tool that will end up boosting human productivity. It may even help a whole new generation of people learn the art of computers, by showing them how to write simple pieces of code, almost like a personal tutor.“This is a tool that can make a coder’s life a lot easier,” Mr. Smith said.ImageTesting Codex convinced Mr. Smith, who runs an artificial intelligence start-up, that it will only enhance how people work with computers.Credit...Jason Henry for The New York TimesCodex, built by OpenAI, one of the world’s most ambitious research labs, provides insight into the state of artificial intelligence. Though a wide range of A.I. technologies have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade, even the most impressive systems have ended up complementing human workers rather than replacing them.Thanks to the rapid rise of a mathematical system called a neural network, machines can now learn certain skills by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for example, they can learn to recognize a cat.This is the technology that recognizes the commands you speak into your iPhone, translates between languages on services like Skype and identifies pedestrians and street signs as self-driving cars speed down the road.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAbout four years ago, researchers at labs like OpenAI started designing neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of prose, including thousands of digital books, Wikipedia articles and all sorts of other text posted to the internet.By pinpointing patterns in all that text, the networks learned to predict the next word in a sequence. When someone typed a few words into these “universal language models,” they could complete the thought with entire paragraphs. In this way, one system — an OpenAI creation called GPT-3 — could write its own Twitter posts, speeches, poetry and news articles.Much to the surprise of even the researchers who built the system, it could even write its own computer programs, though they were short and simple. Apparently, it had learned from an untold number of programs posted to the internet. So OpenAI went a step further, training a new system — Codex — on an enormous array of both prose and code.VideoIf you ask Codex to “make a snowstorm on a black background,” it will do just that, generating and running the code.CreditCredit...By OpenaiThe result is a system that understands both prose and code — to a point. You can ask, in plain English, for snow falling on a black background, and it will give you code that creates a virtual snowstorm. If you ask for a blue bouncing ball, it will give you that, too.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“You can tell it to do something, and it will do it,” said Ania Kubow, another programmer who has used the technology.Codex can generate programs in 12 computer languages and even translate between them. But it often makes mistakes, and though its skills are impressive, it can’t reason like a human. It can recognize or mimic what it has seen in the past, but it is not nimble enough to think on its own.Sometimes, the programs generated by Codex do not run. Or they contain security flaws. Or they come nowhere close to what you want them to do. OpenAI estimates that Codex produces the right code 37 percent of the time.When Mr. Smith used the system as part of a “beta” test program this summer, the code it produced was impressive. But sometimes, it worked only if he made a tiny change, like tweaking a command to suit his particular software setup or adding a digital code needed for access to the internet service it was trying to query.In other words, Codex was truly useful only to an experienced programmer.But it could help programmers do their everyday work a lot faster. It could help them find the basic building blocks they needed or point them toward new ideas. Using the technology, GitHub, a popular online service for programmers, now offers Copilot, a tool that suggests your next line of code, much the way “autocomplete” tools suggest the next word when you type texts or emails.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It is a way of getting code written without having to write as much code,” said Jeremy Howard, who founded the artificial intelligence lab Fast.ai and helped create the language technology that OpenAI’s work is based on. “It is not always correct, but it is just close enough.”VideoIn a nod to a popular internet meme, Codex generates a website for “a cat that’s an attorney,” providing a biography, a phone number and a small avatar.CreditCredit...By OpenaiMr. Howard and others believe Codex could also help novices learn to code. It is particularly good at generating simple programs from brief English descriptions. And it works in the other direction, too, by explaining complex code in plain English. Some, including Joel Hellermark, an entrepreneur in Sweden, are already trying to transform the system into a teaching tool.The rest of the A.I. landscape looks similar. Robots are increasingly powerful. So are chatbots designed for online conversation. DeepMind, an A.I. lab in London, recently built a system that instantly identifies the shape of proteins in the human body, which is a key part of designing new medicines and vaccines. That task once took scientists days or even years. But those systems replace only a small part of what human experts can do.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn the few areas where new machines can instantly replace workers, they are typically in jobs the market is slow to fill. Robots, for instance, are increasingly useful inside shipping centers, which are expanding and struggling to find the workers needed to keep pace.ImageGreg Brockman of OpenAI said artificial intelligence was taking the drudge work out of jobs, not replacing them.Credit...Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesWith his start-up, Gado Images, Mr. Smith set out to build a system that could automatically sort through the photo archives of newspapers and libraries, resurfacing forgotten images, automatically writing captions and tags and sharing the photos with other publications and businesses. But the technology could handle only part of the job.It could sift through a vast photo archive faster than humans, identifying the kinds of images that might be useful and taking a stab at captions. But finding the best and most important photos and properly tagging them still required a seasoned archivist.“We thought these tools were going to completely remove the need for humans, but what we learned after many years was that this wasn’t really possible — you still needed a skilled human to review the output,” Mr. Smith said. “The technology gets things wrong. And it can be biased. You still need a person to review what it has done and decide what is good and what is not.”Codex extends what a machine can do, but it is another indication that the technology works best with humans at the controls.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A.I. is not playing out like anyone expected,” said Greg Brockman, the chief technology officer of OpenAI. “It felt like it was going to do this job and that job, and everyone was trying to figure out which one would go first. Instead, it is replacing no jobs. But it is taking away the drudge work from all of them at once.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

And started there a week later.""Two and a half years later, I really think it's the best decision I ever made,"" she reflects.When she started at the company, she was the first woman developer working on her team. She now spends her spare time encouraging other women, people of colour, and LGBT people to try coding.For programmers like her, she says the most interesting shift recently has been the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) tools which can bite off increasingly big chunks of programming all by themselves.In June, GitHub, a San Francisco-based code-hosting platform with 56 million users, revealed a new AI tool called Copilot.You start typing a few characters of code, and the AI suggests how to finish it.Getty ImagesInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger applauded the application of AI to coding""The single most mind-blowing application of machine learning I've ever seen,"" Instagram's co-founder Mike Krieger enthused about Copilot.It is based on an artificial intelligence called GPT-3, released last summer by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI lab, co-founded by Elon Musk.This GPT (which stands for generative pre-training) engine does a ""very simple but very large thing - predicting the next letter in a text,"" explains Grzegorz Jakacki, Warsaw-based founder of Codility, which makes a popular hiring test.OpenAI trained the AI on texts already available online such as books, Wikipedia and hundreds of thousands of web pages, a diet that was ""somewhat curated but in all possible human languages,"" he says.And ""spookily, it wasn't taught the rules of any particular language,"" adds Mr Jakacki.The result was plausible passages of text. People have subsequently asked it to write in a variety of styles, for example, new Harry Potter stories, but in the style of Ernest Hemingway or Raymond Chandler.Getty ImagesAI can make ""silly mistakes"" points out OpenAI chief executive Sam AltmanEventually the hype over GPT-3 got ""way too much"", and people needed reminding the AI ""sometimes makes very silly mistakes"", tweeted Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive.Still, GitHub - whose owner, Microsoft, bought an exclusive licence to use GPT-3 in September - decided to train-up another, similar model. But this time, training the AI on software source code instead.GitHub is the world's largest host of source code, it has at least 28 million public repositories (places software packages are stored). So, the company has fed Copilot on a healthy diet of public code.As a result, Copilot can provide ""relatively good solutions, even though sometimes it requires some tweaking,"" according to Miss Luk who has tried giving the AI coding challenges.As a programmer, far from seeing the tool as risking her job she likes the idea of having AI to support her with ""the more boring parts"" of coding, like checking over complicated strings, called regular expressions, that she always has to ""quadruple check"".Red HatSenior Red Hat programmer Dina Muscanell says inexperienced coders should be wary of relying on AI helpAnd, since the AI has been fed code written by professional programmers, it's really helping coders draw on their colleagues' collective wisdom, says Dina Muscanell, Vermont-based senior programmer at open-source software company, Red Hat.There are already coding-community websites like Stack Exchange, where programmers can pose questions and get suggestions. Maybe this isn't so different?""If you think about getting that feedback instantaneously as you're typing, that's pretty awesome. You have a team of people feeding you this code"" even if there is an AI assembling it, she observes. But professional programmers also have a few qualms about the new AI kid on the block.One is spotting mistakes. In software engineering, ""you're lucky where the garbage [rubbish] is very obvious, but this thing can generate very subtle garbage,"" says Mr Jakacki.Subtle mistakes in code can be especially costly and very hard to find.A possible future answer could involve using AI to detect bugs: for instance, noticing that pressing some buttons on a microwave ""are valid inputs, but do not make sense"". But we're not quite there.In the meantime, ""if you're not experienced, and you're just trying to learn, you could be doing something bad without being aware of that,"" warns Ms Muscanell.More Technology of BusinessJust how hard is it to recycle a jumbo jet?How to back up your data and keep it safeHow to keep your cool when the office heats upWhy artificial intelligence is being used to write advertsHow can new technology protect outdoor workers?Another big question involves ownership of this auto-generated code. What if Copilot, which has been trained on other people's programs, dishes-up something near-identical to code another programmer has written, and then you use it? Using the AI tool ""can potentially violate open source licences because it can cite something from the training set,"" Miss Luk argues. And that could land you in hot water for plagiarism.It's all an area ""where law is not catching up with technology,"" Mr Jakacki says.In theory, you could measure how much code owed to one bit of training code: by training up a different AI using all the other source code but leaving that particular bit out.But doing this would be ""extremely costly,"" observes Mr Jakacki.In reality, at the moment the AI only provides short passages of code, not fully turned out software programs.By comparison 10,000 lines is the minimum length of website code 'when you're getting some meaningful functionality', Mr Jakacki says.So, it's not quite ready to replace human programmers yet.Or bring about the fabled AI singularity - an idea first hypothesised by mathematician John von Neumann, where computer intelligence enters a runaway explosion of self-improvement cycles, and quickly far surpasses human intelligence.And more to the point, for coders like Miss Luk, ""even though it does help, it doesn't necessarily mean the workload is alleviated"".Code still needs to be thoroughly reviewed, and subjected to tests both involving how it works (called unit tests) and how it fits with other pieces of code (integration tests). Which is all just as well, she adds.The chief reason she enjoys coding ""is the problem-solving element of it, and if everything is already done for you, it takes the fun out of it,"" Miss Luk reflects.If computers do too much of the thinking, ""you don't get the satisfaction after solving an issue.""And while she thinks there is potential for AI programming tools, as they learn more and adapt, ""but hopefully not so soon that we won't be needed any more,"" she laughs.

Compliance has always played a pivotal role across financial firms and banking institutions in an effort to pinpoint and mitigate various risks across communication channels, including market abuse, insider trading, spoofing, front-running, and even sexual harassment and racism. For decades, legacy vendors have been at the forefront of providing services to these institutions to flag and report any compliance and security breaches. This process was typically done manually where the compliance team would sift through emails and phone records and flag anything that appeared nefarious. While somewhat tedious, these compliance measures have helped institutions maintain industry wide standards and regulations as well as their own internal standards for employee conduct. 
However, over time technology has evolved and has now become a mainstay across all industries, including banking and finance, offering support and assistance to organizations and institutions, making them more effective and efficient in their daily operations. More specifically, artificial intelligence has provided the banking and finance industries with comprehensive compliance tools that automate the process. While these measures can be implemented to make compliance and security oversight easier, it does come with its share of challenges including regulator hesitancy which stems from historical concerns regarding bias, discrimination, and privacy, which has now ultimately led to some calling for policymakers to introduce overly burdensome regulations on the technology. Nonetheless, the adoption of artificial intelligence will continue to grow, as it’s already demonstrated immense value playing a significant role in the future of banking and finance.
Concerns over AI and the Potential to Regulate
Artificial intelligence has proved and continues to prove itself to be one of the most valued assets, across all industries, that enables companies to rapidly evolve and conduct their business more effectively and efficiently. However, it does bring with it criticism and concern in which regulators and skeptics are asking the question, “can artificial intelligence be transparent? Can we trust it?” There have been reports of bias, discrimination, invasiveness to private data and violations of human rights, which has led the European Union to propose the Artificial Intelligence Act which will aim to impose restrictions on artificial intelligence in an effort to regulate the technology and eliminate these instances. While the law would impact all industries, there would be a particular focus on high-impact sectors which includes both the banking and finance industries. 
While these regulations seem to have the public’s best interest and values in mind, it also proposes an impractical solution, especially if other countries seek to implement them. According to the Center for Data Innovation, these new regulations would cost the European economy more than $30 million to introduce and manage. Should policymakers enact these regulations, they would ultimately spend more on regulating the technology than the cost of compliance itself, making it illogical. The banking and finance industries have already seen artificial intelligence at work and have reaped the benefits and any service less than what they’re accustomed to would be a setback. 
One of the major concerns from a technology standpoint is that artificial intelligence relies on what is referred to as the “black box”, which means regulators are able to see what goes into the AI and what comes out but are unable to see how the algorithms and technology actually works. Tech companies are hesitant to share their algorithms – what’s inside the black box – because it can lead to potential intellectual property infringement and theft. While the European Union continues to push for some type of reform, it is important they realize that they need to work directly with tech companies to implement risk management solutions that provide thorough training and regular testing to offer protections against biases. 
Communication in Today’s Digital and Remote Work Environment
Over the last few decades, there has been a steady stream of new communication methods that have surfaced including SMS, Slack, WhatsApp, etc. As these new channels have become dominant in the way we communicate daily in both our personal and professional lives, it has become harder and nearly impossible for compliance teams to provide security oversight and carry out thorough reviews and investigations. In 2020, financial organizations saw an increase of 54% in tickets coming in through WhatsApp. While new communication channels are making it easier and are being more heavily relied on to communicate, it’s also indirectly creating opportunities for security and compliance breaches. 
These new channels alone call for the use of artificial intelligence to make compliance more effective and efficient. However, with the new workplace environment where many are working outside of the office and from home, it is even more critical for banking and financial institutions to find a better way to maintain compliance regulations. With a dire need to address compliance across all communication channels, many are turning to artificial intelligence as a solution as it provides automated compliance and security oversight that is more advanced and tech-driven especially when communicating over encrypted messaging services. This ultimately will provide banks with a valuable resource that allows employees to continue using messaging apps and services that are in line with privacy laws like GDPR, ensuring separation between personal and business data. 
AI’s Value to Compliance in the Banking and Finance Industries
Financial institutions have struggled with communication storage and while still new to the industry, artificial intelligence provides the support and solution to overcome. Artificial intelligence enables compliance officers and institutions the ability to automate all elements of their communications data management. This includes capturing data, enriching it with third party data such as CRM, normalizing it and allowing the compliance officer the ability to seamlessly investigate, archive and retain data. Under regulatory rules, there is an immense amount of both structured and unstructured data which is required for recordkeeping. Additionally, artificial intelligence can combine all data sources which in turn makes advanced searches and the ability to perform full investigations more efficiently. 
In addition to the previously mentioned capabilities, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial compliance and redefining the way in which communications compliance risk is managed. Financial institutions are able to mitigate risk, improve operational efficiency, and reduce compliance costs by being afforded the ability to proactively detect and alert on abnormalities in communication including threats or violations such as insider trading, providing an in-depth analysis and breakdown of various communication triggers, and offering the ability to manage and customize alerts based on their specific needs, regulations, and procedures. 
Implementing Artificial Intelligence Responsibly
For any organizations or institutions that decide to implement artificial intelligence for compliance purposes, it is incredibly important that it is done so responsibly. It is critical that banking and finance organizations work with companies who can fulfill their internal needs as well as meet industry standards and regulations. With much discussion around transparency, it is key to ensure the ability to separate personal data from professional data, conduct business without the consequences of bias and discrimination, and offer data that is easily interpreted and explained by compliance team members. These capabilities are readily available and continue to be top of mind when creating and developing new artificial intelligence models and algorithms.    
Compliance and security measures are in place to keep our businesses and employees safe and protected from various risks and market abuse. The fact of the matter is that the old way of doing things just can’t keep up and is no longer an effective process. 
While trust from regulators, or lack thereof, continues to play a role in the acceptance of artificial intelligence, it will not prevent companies from adoption and implementation as long as new opportunities continue to arise to mitigate risk, cut compliance costs, and increase operational efficiency. Artificial intelligence is only going to continue to develop and evolve, leaving banking and financial institutions to get on board to keep up with the fast pace of communication and do their due diligence in following regulations. The alternative? Continue to rely on outdated legacy vendors and risk failing to maintain industry wide regulations. Artificial intelligence can and will drastically improve compliance and security oversight.

 - stock.adobe.com)HONOLULU, Hi. — Artificial intelligence does a better job of identifying the hidden signs of breast cancer, scientists in Hawaii say. Their study finds a sophisticated tool, a type of AI called deep learning, analyzes breast scans to identify women with early signs of cancer whose tumors are hard to find by conventional methods.
Doctors recommend that all women over the age of 40 book themselves for a mammogram at least once a year to screen for breast cancer. These images help physicians detect the cancer early, significantly increasing a patient’s chances of survival.
They also help to determine how likely a woman is to develop cancer further down the line, based on her breast density. While dense breasts on a mammogram signifies a higher risk of cancer, there are many other, unknown factors, which doctors can’t account for. Now, researchers at the University of Hawaii have taught a computer to look for these hidden signals.
“Conventional methods of breast cancer risk assessment using clinical risk factors haven’t been that effective,” says lead author Professor John Shepherd in a statement to SWNS. “We thought that there was more in the image than just breast density that would be useful for assessing risk.”
Making the yearly screening process easier?
The team analyzed more than 25,000 breast scans from 6,369 women. They found over 1,600 women had developed breast cancer that was successfully picked up during their screening. However, another 351 developed interval invasive breast cancer, meaning it was not detected during the regular screening process.
Scientists trained a “deep learning model” to find hidden details or signals in the scans which could indicate a higher risk of breast cancer. The tool was more effective than traditional methods at predicting the cancers which were picked up during regular screenings. On the other hand, the technology was less effective when trying to calculate the risk of cancers developing between screenings.
“The results showed that the extra signal we’re getting with AI provides a better risk estimate for screening-detected cancer,” Professor Shepherd tells SWNS. “It helped us accomplish our goal of classifying women into low risk or high risk of screening-detected breast cancer.”
Armed with the algorithm, women could be sorted into groups depending on their level of risk instead of having to come back a year later for another screening.
“This would allow us to use a woman’s individual risk to determine how frequently she should be monitored,” Shepherd says. “Lower-risk women might not need to be monitored with mammography as often as those with a high risk of breast cancer.”
Smarter technology dealing to smarter cancer decisions
The AI tool could also help medical professionals make more informed decisions when referring people for MRIs and other imaging procedures.
“Women in the high-risk deep learning group who also have dense breasts and are at a higher risk for interval cancers may benefit most from a monitoring strategy that includes supplemental imaging that retains sensitivity in dense breasts such as MRI, ultrasound and molecular imaging,” the study authors explains. “Interval cancers usually have more aggressive tumor biology and are typically discovered at an advanced stage.”
Next, the researchers are hoping to replicate the study in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women, groups which have been underrepresented in breast cancer studies until now. They are also hoping to study different grades of breast cancer, from the least to most aggressive forms.
“By ranking mammograms in terms of the probability of seeing cancer in the image, AI is going to be a powerful second reading tool to help categorize mammograms,” Prof. Shepherd concludes.
The findings appear in the journal Radiology.

Ethical Artificial Intelligence is Focus of New Robotics Program


















AUSTIN, Texas — Ethics will be at the forefront of robotics education thanks to a new University of Texas at Austin program that will train tomorrow’s technologists to understand the positive — and potentially negative — implications of their creations.
Today, much robotic technology is developed without considering its potentially harmful effects on society, including how these technologies can infringe on privacy or further economic inequity. The new UT Austin program will fill an important educational gap by prioritizing these issues in its curriculum.
“In the next 10 years, we are going to live more closely alongside robots, and we want to be sure that those robots are fair, inclusive and free from bias,” said Junfeng Jiao, associate professor in the School of Architecture and the program lead. “And because the robots we create are reflections of ourselves, it is imperative that technologists receive an excellent ethics education. We want our students to work directly with companies to create practices and technologies that are equitable and fair.”
Called CREATE (Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists), it will offer graduate coursework and professional development in responsible design and implementation.
CREATE is a collaboration among Texas Robotics, industry partners and the UT grand challenge research initiative Good Systems, which seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society. The program has been recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation through its Research Traineeship Program, which will support 32 doctoral students to receive coursework, mentorship, professional development, internships, and research and public service opportunities.
Students will focus specifically on how to ethically design, develop and deploy service robots, which can make deliveries, work in factories and clean homes. They will consider factors such as how to design delivery service robots so they are more inclusive and can reach all people and how to ensure home service robots protect occupants’ privacy. Several notable robotics companies have also said they will offer students internships, including Sony AI, Bosch, Amazon, SparkCognition and Apptronik.
Researchers involved in the program cross many disciplines at UT, including computer science, architecture, engineering, information, and public affairs. Faculty members from these units will teach courses as part of the curriculum, and two faculty members will mentor each trainee during the five-year program. Additionally, each trainee will receive help with career development, grant writing, and exposure to local startup companies.

 
 
More than half of the program’s trainees will be chosen from underrepresented groups in STEM education, including women and racial minorities, to help bring much-needed diversity to the field of robotics. The coursework component, which includes five classes in ethical robotics, will be institutionalized as a graduate portfolio program and will be available to all STEM graduate students at UT Austin.
“This program will enable us to educate well-rounded roboticists who are not only grounded in the technical details of designing and building autonomous robots but also are equipped to fully consider the societal implications of their work,” said Peter Stone, director of Texas Robotics and a professor of computer science. “That is a missing part in robotics education in the U.S. and the world. We believe this is a game changer for the future of robotics.”

AI algorithms can complete any kind of work within a short period of time while providing opportunities for employees to focus on creativity. But it has been discovered that artificial intelligence can predict human death by identifying any early death risk. Even scientists and AI developers have been startled at this discovery where AI algorithms are predicting death. AI detecting human deaths is one of the unbelievable innovations in this 21st century. Scientists and developers do not have a clear understanding of how AI algorithms are predicting death. Let's dig deep into how if anyone needs to know early death risk, artificial intelligence is here to predict human deaths efficiently. .The healthcare sector leverages artificial intelligence to boost productivity, help patients with medicines and assist doctors in analysing medical reports. Now, AI algorithms predicting death within a year is startling doctors. Doctors are observing normal reports but artificial intelligence can look at heart tests and predict early death risk. What seems like a normal ECG report to cardiologists, AI can accurately predict the early death risk of multiple patients. .This is showing that artificial intelligence can detect certain risky elements in a human body that are invisible in the human naked eye or what professional doctors consider normal. This major disruptive technology holds the potential to teach human doctors different lessons that may be have been misinterpreted and miscommunicated for a long time. Doctors incorporated around 1.77 million ECG logs with over 400,000 patients for AI detecting human deaths from cardiac problems like heart attacks and atrial fibrillation. Later on, the AI algorithms generated the appropriate result in predicting death risk in the nearby future. .Artificial intelligence detected heart problems in patients who were cleared from any cardiac issue by professional doctors. These algorithms can predict lung cancer and other chronic diseases more accurately than the medical staff. Professionals and scientists are worried about how artificial intelligence can detect such diseases and how patients can be on medication, depending on the determinations from machine learning algorithms. .This breakthrough of AI predicting death risk and human deaths within a year is getting popular in these recent years. It only automates rigorous work but can predict early death risk. The University of Nottingham has created an AI-based model to predict premature human deaths. Surprisingly, artificial intelligence predicted more accurate results than any other machine. Being a Silicon Valley giant, Google AI can harness predictive algorithm to detect and predict early death risks, deaths, discharges, and many more. Similarly, the European Cardiology Society also had experimented with the same kind of test with AI. The members utilized a machine learning algorithm known as LogitBoost for analyzing cardiac imaging data from approximately 950 patients from the Turku PET Centre in Finland. .That being said, it is proved that artificial intelligence can predict early death risk but there are some major concerns among several healthcare professionals. The issue of unconscious and bias in the machine learning algorithms can create a drastic effect on patients who have cardiac problems as well as those who do not. There may be discrepancies among data of white patients, patients of colours, and different genders. AI cannot still mitigate the issues of gender inequality and racism efficiently.  Doctors are concerned because this outcome is a matter of life and death that cannot be compromised for AI algorithms predicting deaths. There are series of medications that needed to be put in patients and if those patients do not need the cure, it will create a drastic effect in bodies. From there, innocent patients can deteriorate more. .Thus, it is useful to have such cutting-edge technologies in the healthcare sector to help and assist doctors in other work. But for predicting early death risk and human deaths, solely depending on algorithms can possess a huge risk for the healthcare sector. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Bias in Artificial Intelligence: Teaching machines to think responsibly

















Monash Lens
If humans are programming artificial intelligence, are we stuck with the human biases that inadvertently work their way into AI systems?  Mark AndrejevicProfessor, Communications and Media Studies

  Susan CarlandAcademic, author and social commentator



The guests on this episode of What Happens Next? don't think so.

Dr Susan Carland is again joined by communications and media studies expert Professor Mark Andrejevic, human-computer interaction scholar Yolande Strengers, Monash University Interim Dean of Information Technology Ann Nicholson, and Microsoft Australia's former chief digital advisor, Rita Arrigo.AI is undoubtedly playing a beneficial role in society, helping us respond more effectively to medical emergencies, improving surgical procedures, and even making our buildings smarter.There are already methods in place ensuring society can hold AI and its designers accountable. Established ethics committees have been joined by new legislation and increasing awareness among policymakers.Accessible courses and casual data science meetups enable any of us to join the conversation, and help shape emerging technologies, the data they use, and how they use it. As we work towards a more ethical society, we can ensure our AI is ethical, too.I think we could imagine cases where it's demonstrated over time that the machine actually makes a better decision with a better social outcome.Professor Mark Andrejevic


 TranscriptDr. Susan Carland:Welcome to another episode of 'What Happens Next?' I'm Dr Susan Carland. In our first episode, we spoke about the potential problems with biases in artificial intelligence or AI. What are the consequences in the future if there are no regulations in place to prevent it?Today, we take a more positive approach and look at some of the potential AI has in addressing biases and how it could ultimately play a role in helping us achieve all positive outcomes.Rita Arrigo was most recently Chief Digital Advisor at Microsoft Australia. Her role as an AI ambassador drives many AI for good initiatives, including smart, inclusive cities; diversity, sustainability; and humanitarian aspects. I asked Rita where she thinks AI is headed in the future. It turns out, she's quite excited. Rita, lovely to have you here today.Rita Arrigo:Thanks, Dr Susan Carland. It's wonderful to be here.Dr Susan Carland:Tell me what you see as the role of AI, or artificial intelligence, for societies going into the future.Rita Arrigo:Well, I think there's really exciting stuff happening in society at the moment. I think we're really moving from being consumers of stuff to entering this idea of societal innovation, where we want to solve complex problems, address some of these huge challenges like the environment, sustainability, accessibility, inclusion. I think this is a real vital role for AI and data science, because it will allow us to augment the world and see the world in a different way as we start to find these new ways that we want to innovate society.Dr Susan Carland:So you see AI as helping us solve some of those big problems.Rita Arrigo:Yeah, absolutely.Dr Susan Carland:Do you have a fear that AI might try to kill us in our sleep like Terminator?Rita Arrigo:No, but I love that Hollywood loves that, you know? Hollywood's there to make horror movies and stuff, and I think I love that whole dystopia kind of model that they create, but we haven't seen it. I've been in technology for like 40 years, pretty much, and read about the Luddites that try to, you know, break all the machinery when the industrial age was coming, but really, did it really affect what was happening? And has the progress been going on regardless of those kinds of fears that we have? Maybe they are just part of the drama of Hollywood potentially, I don't know.Dr Susan Carland:Are any of the fears justified? Do you think we have enough checks and balances or policies or proper ring fencing around any of, perhaps, the ethical concerns people might have about AI?Rita Arrigo:I think we do. I think we're a really risk averse culture. I think in the way that we implement technology ... you know, it takes 50 change managers, cultural program, and building the culture and the diversity in the organisation, and the training. I don't think we just switch on technology and go, ""Wow, what happened then?"" There's a lot of planning and journey creation around it, so yeah, I don't think that that's an issue.Dr Susan Carland:I want you to look into the crystal ball. If we continue down the same path that we're on with our approach to AI - imagine we don't change anything in our approach to AI - what does our future look like? What does our society look like? What's good and what's bad?Rita Arrigo:Well, I think there'll be some really great things. I think a lot of the frustrations that we have with customer service, for example, like how many times do you want to tell someone your name, address, date of birth? ""Excuse me, I'm over this,"" right? We want more intelligent customer service and experiences, and I think that there's going to be some real advantages in that.I think healthcare is one of the areas that really needs AI, and we're already seeing things like quantum-inspired algorithms to improve the way we do scans. We're seeing much better real-time prediction in hospitals with algorithms to assist clinicians to know what's going on. You know, all those crazy beeping machines actually being turned into messages that people can understand. We're seeing it with things like holographic surgery, where we're moving into that spatial world and adding an AI layer to that. So I think in healthcare, there's some really exciting things.And I think in transportation and smart cities, that's going to be a massive disruption. Roads are going to change. We're maybe not going to have as many accidents on roads because we're going to have a bit more AI computer vision and a bit more -Dr Susan Carland:Like AI in our cars, you mean?Rita Arrigo:Yeah, AI in our cars and on our roads, and lots of cameras. I don't know if you've driven a Tesla lately, but ...Dr Susan Carland:Sadly, no. I'm on an academic wage.Rita Arrigo:I only test drove one. But they're quite cost-effective because all of a sudden you don't have to pay for petrol and et cetera, et cetera. But you know, it can actually see the road, and it can identify pedestrians, and it will stop instead of colliding into one. I think that that side of it's going to be really amazing.Then what's happening in smart cities. Even this building, it's like, it's almost like a smart building I've walked into. People knew I was arriving, had an experience to it, but imagine all the other critical infrastructure we have. Our bridges, our water, our energy, and that being turned into these cyber-physical digital twins for us to be able to predict the future and understand the past.Dr Susan Carland:Although Rita is excited about the future benefits of AI, she also concedes that at this stage, we still bring our own biases when developing new systems. Because after all, it's humans who are doing the programming.Is there a way that you can see the future of AI better tackling the human biases that may have inadvertently been placed within them?Rita Arrigo:Yeah, I really do. I think that's so real in terms of, if you even look at the way that we run our finance systems and how you apply for a loan. A lot of those biases exist before you even put the AI around it. Or how do we go about getting a new job and what kind of... how do people judge us when we enter the room - that combination of body language, et cetera, et cetera.I also think it's about building a lot of fairness. There's a lot of work going on in creating responsible AI guidelines so that we can have fairness, reliability, safety, privacy, security, inclusion, transparency, and accountability. It's these principles that we're starting to see in organisations as they start to bring them on. How to create these kind of committees to discuss and think about some of the implications of what we take when we start to mine our data and start to find examples from them and start to predict things, and also start to use AI to learn.I think it's those learning parts of things, that deep learning, that will have to become much more focused around ensuring that we're using these responsible AI principles. So I actually think it's some kind of new science that's emerging. We're seeing a lot of the philosophers and ethicists and people coming in to have these discussions, because it is a real multi-disciplinary discussion, and probably an area that I'm really passionate about, because I think traditionally data science and data engineering and people dealing with data can be quite a male-dominated area. But I also think that women are amazing at data analysis and understanding that side of things. So being able to make it more multi-disciplinary and also include other stream of thoughts that might not necessarily be a lot of the engineers that you traditionally work with, bringing them into the equation will make a massive difference as well.Dr Susan Carland:In our previous episode, we spoke with Yolande Strengers about how female voices on our smartphones and networked home devices such as Google Home are perpetuating old-fashioned feminine stereotypes. I asked her what she thinks are some of the things needed to improve these issues.Would it be having things like Siri or Alexa come where you can choose from five different voices, and gradually trying to get people used to hearing different voices in these devices? How else could we do it?Yolande Strengers:I think we also need to be experimenting with personality. Actually that's - there is also already a lot of experimentation with voice. There's already a lot of options away from the default, but not so much around what it is, or how we expect these devices to behave.Dr Susan Carland:So we might suddenly start having an AI who's a bit sassy?Yolande Strengers:Yeah.Dr Susan Carland:Or I say, ""What's the weather,"" and they say, ""Work it out yourself, idiot."" Like, talks back?Yolande Strengers:Yeah, possibly. I mean, there are some great design precedents out there already, and they're quite quick. They didn't have to be threatening. They don't have to be rude or not likeable. They can actually be kind of just a really interesting kind of character in our lives.Dr Susan Carland:Tell us about some of those precedents that are available at the moment.Yolande Strengers:There's one that Jenny and I refer to in the book called Kai, which is actually a banking assistant that was developed by a feminist designer, Jacqueline Feldman. Her kind of design ethos was that she wanted this device to be assertive, and also, I guess, to have a kind of - a bot sense of humour. It's gender neutral, but it's not personality-less. It still tries to behave in the world like a bot. So if someone kind of puts a human question to it, like, ""Do you want to go out with me?"" Or, you know ...Dr Susan Carland:Why can we not help doing that? You said Kai was a banking bot?Yolande Strengers:Yeah, that's right.Dr Susan Carland:So I thought you were going to say the question would be, ""How much money do I have in my account?"" Or, ""How do I move it?"" Why can we not help asking AI these questions?Yolande Strengers:Exactly. Look, I think because they're designed to behave like people, right?Dr Susan Carland:So we want to see, what will you say?Yolande Strengers:That's right. Yeah, we want to engage with them like we would engage with another person.Dr Susan Carland:Right.Yolande Strengers:I think that's partly human nature.Dr Susan Carland:Okay. So I ask Kai, I type in Kai, ""Kai, how about a date?"" What would Kai say?Yolande Strengers:Well, I can't remember exactly what Kai would say, but it'd be something like, ""Oh, I'm a bot, so such trivial consent things don't concern me. I'm much more interested in…"" I don't know, whatever it's interested in, numbers and maths or something. That was a very poorly scripted answer on my part, but she makes him sound so - just gendered it - she makes it sound much more quirky and kind of funny.Another one that I really like is the Tamagochi robot, which died if you didn't look after it. You know, it's not like devices that don't put up with things haven't existed around us in different forms for a while. I think that there are other sources of inspiration out there, little pockets of resistance. Like the Tamagochi robot, it's often not where you expect it to be. But it dies. If you don't look after it, that's it. I mean, I think it does eventually possibly come back to life, but there's - I can imagine similar situations with a voice assistant kind of shutting down for a period of time if you treat it badly.Some of the companies have started to do that on a very modest scale now in response to widespread criticism of how they respond to sexual harassment, and sort of abusive language and loud, aggressive tones. But I think there's, again, a lot more I could do around what they are prepared to tolerate, I guess, in terms of how people are going to treat them.Dr Susan Carland:Professor Ann Nicholson is the Interim Dean of IT at Monash University. What do you see as some of the greatest successes that artificial intelligence is giving us at the moment?Ann Nicholson:Well, I think that we've had a huge improvement, if you like, in what AI systems that have kind of been around with the fundamental technology for about 30 years, that's the deep learning is based on neural networks, that they - it sounds really technical, but basically the idea is if you get data, you can feed it into a model and it kind of learns based on those inputs, something about the outputs.Now, that might be recognising features in a picture. So we know now that computer vision is really accurate and speech-to-text and speech recognition are doing really well. So they've really massively improved for two reasons: One is that we have got much greater computing power, and we've got much greater sources of data to train them up well. They can take lots of data and just do an amazing job on finding patterns, and learning things, and classifications, and so on. It's truly amazing, what's happening in that space.Dr Susan Carland:What advice would you give to people who want to ethically and mindfully engage with AI?Ann Nicholson:I think that if you've got the time, that there's some quite good online courses, like micro-credentials that actually try and explain a little bit about AI and actually can show you with some software online, that you can kind of run some little tests and create some sort of little AI model.That might be something that would be too much for some of your listeners, but for other ones, I would encourage you to sort of expand your technological base. People are really amazing. My mum is on Facebook and downloading things and messaging, so she's upskilled. I do think that getting a bit more familiar with some of the guts of it, even if you're not going to go off and do it seriously, can help you get a better understanding of how it's built.And then you can then assess better when you think there might be an AI on and that you're putting data in, how they might use it. I think that if you're working with an organisation who wants to collect your data, you should definitely be asking how they're using it. If you're typing it in to get an answer back from something, you should be aware that there's some AI and that it might be really dodgy or it might be really good. You can try and have a [inaudible] and ask the organisation. If they can't tell you, you should probably give it a miss.Dr Susan Carland:Do you have any examples of projects you've worked on where artificial intelligence is clearly doing a social good?Ann Nicholson:Well, I'm working on one right now where we're trying to prove that it will. That is, that we're collaborating with Ambulance Victoria to have an AI system that will listen in on emergency calls and provide a kind of a decision support flag to earlier detect cardiac arrest calls. Cardiac arrest is where the heart's stopped, so time is critical. The call-takers do a great job. They have a script though that they have to go through. If we can detect agonal breathing, a particular kind of breathing in the background, before the call-taker does, or some other indication while they're still going through their script and we can flag it earlier, we could save precious seconds and get the ambulance out there earlier. Or we could hook into these new systems they've got where they ping someone who knows how to do CPR and could be in the vicinity, and say, ""Get to that person who's a hundred metres away from you and help with the CPR."" So we're not necessarily there yet, but we've got some very promising results that show in particular cases, that we can just help get that right decision detection earlier.Dr Susan Carland:I asked Professor of Communications and Media Studies in the Faculty of Arts at Monash University, Mark Andrejevic, for some advice.Dr Susan Carland:I once typed into my Google search bar - I think it was something like, ""Why are academics so..."" or, ""Why are professors so..."" and do you know what it suggested?Mark Andrejevic:Oh no.Dr Susan Carland:""So badly dressed."" Deeply hurtful bias. What can the average person do to either be more aware of the biases we may be encountering in AI, or even do something about it?Mark Andrejevic:Well, clearly I need to dress better.Dr Susan Carland:I think, well, clearly we both do, because that's what humanity thinks.Mark Andrejevic:I think that in many cases, these responses are going to have to be collective political ones. I think the type of organising that we've been seeing in response to concerns about bias. For example, political mobilising around bias in the use of facial recognition technologies. I think those ... where the politics is going to come to bear on the decisions to actually use those systems. Once the systems are in place, it's very difficult to find ways to reverse-engineer them. Although I think it will be important to advocate for accountability as well.On an individual level, I think it's very hard ... when it comes to political change, I think in most cases we're talking about collective action. So we have to, as a society, start to hold accountable those places where these decisions are being made and say, ""This is what we want and this is what we, you know, we don't want certain types of decisions to be made by automated systems in ways that are non-explicable to us.""And when it comes to very significant decisions about medical care, employment, we're going to have to be able to come to a shared political consensus about when systems are appropriate to use, and why they're appropriate to use.I think we could imagine cases where it's demonstrated over time that the machine actually makes a better decision with a better social outcome. That seems conceivable to me, but it's got to be demonstrable and explainable how we came to that decision and how we have the belief that that's going to continue to operate if we're going to continue to use that system.It's been interesting to see, for example, bias and facial recognition has gotten a lot of political attention. I think it's because the face itself is - we're very concerned about biometric monitoring of our faces because we think of our faces as communication ... I don't know how, I mean, one way we think of our faces is that they're ours to control our interface with the world. The idea that it can be captured and used to make inferences about us and to identify us without our ability to know that that's happening or to see how it's happening is alarming.And so it's been a site of people expressing concern, and there've been bans of the use of facial recognition technology in some municipalities. That has received political traction, and there's political response to that. So I think it's possible, but I think it does require interrogating the systems, and looking at how they're being developed and pushing back against them. That takes political will, and it takes a lot of knowledge about what's going on, and it's going to be harder and harder to do because more and more of these systems are going to be operating. You're going to have to keep directing your attention. Wait, is it the prison parole system? Is it facial recognition technology? Is it medical triage? Where are we going to devote our effort?Dr Susan Carland:Mark, thank you so much for coming back. I think you're really well dressed. I think Google got it wrong.Mark Andrejevic:Thank you. Likewise.Dr Susan Carland:I asked recent Chief Digital Advisor on Microsoft Australia, Rita Arrigo, for her advice.What advice would you give to the average person who is interested in maybe accessing AI, but wants to make sure they're part of an ethical or fair society of AI use?Rita Arrigo:I feel really into that. I think there should be ways that you can start to be part of these ethics committees, and be part of these kinds of decisions. I think there's already a bit of a startup around the ethics in AI committee and people that are going to make, have opinions around that. You're seeing it in our public sector. You're also seeing in our vendors where a lot of ... I was playing with this system called Fair Learn, which actually assesses systems and mitigates any impacts from race, gender, or disability, or age, and kind of assesses your AI platform in the way that you're using it. So a lot of software-driven stuff as well to start to assess a lot of those kinds of things.But I think the way I've ... I'm a real hands-on learner, so the way I've always kind of learned about the way things work or learned about IOT or learned about mixed realities, I like to go to hackathons or meetups. I think if I'm a young person, you want to turn up to some of these things and have a listen to what people are saying about data science. My first data science meetup, it was all about trying to figure out who's going to win the soccer. So people were studying soccer games and trying to figure out, and had servers under their desk. Now it's really evolved into being able to tap into services to do a lot of that kind of deep learning and machine learning and not have to kind of create your own hardware and that kind of stuff. I think for young people, it's really exciting to kind of see the applications and see the way we're using some of the newest technology to trial some of these things.Dr Susan Carland:Rita, thank you so much for joining us.Rita Arrigo:It's a pleasure. Had a lot of fun.Dr Susan Carland:That's it for our look into the issues surrounding bias in artificial intelligence.

Why?


Well, unlike many news organisations, we have no sponsors, no corporate or ideological interests. We don't put up a paywall – we believe in free access to information of public interest.

Media ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world (Learn more). Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward, fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country. According to independent assessment, about 98% of the media sector is held by three conglomerates. This tendency is not only totally unacceptable, but also to a degree frightening). Learn more here
We endeavour to provide the community with real-time access to true unfiltered news firsthand from primary sources.
It is a bumpy road with all sorties of difficulties.

We can only achieve this goal together. Our website is open to any citizen journalists and organizations who want to contribute, publish high-quality insights or send media releases to improve public access to impartial information. You and we have the right to know, learn, read, hear what and how we deem appropriate.

Your support is greatly appreciated.

All donations are kept completely private and confidential.

Thank you in advance!
