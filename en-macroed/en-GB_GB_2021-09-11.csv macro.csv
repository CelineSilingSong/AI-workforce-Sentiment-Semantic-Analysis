On 14 September 2021, eight international organisations joined forces to launch a new portal promoting global co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). The portal is a one-stop shop for data, research findings and good practices in AI policy.
The objective of the portal is to help policymakers and the wider public navigate the international AI governance landscape. It provides access to the necessary tools and information, such as projects, research and reports to promote trustworthy and responsible AI that is aligned with human rights at global, national and local level.
Key partners in this joint effort include the Council of Europe, the European Commission, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the World Bank Group.

Photograph: ReutersArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 years oldScientists identify key conditions to set up a creative ‘hot streak’This article is more than 2 years oldResearchers use AI to reveal runs of artistic success are commonly preceded by an experimental phaseNicola DavisMon 13 Sep 2021 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Oct 2022 10.08 EDTShareWhether it is the director Márta Mészáros or the artist Jackson Pollock, those in creative careers often experience a particular burst of success.Now researchers have used artificial intelligence to reveal such “hot streaks” are commonly preceded by an experimental phase followed by a focus on one particular approach once the winning period has begun.The director Peter Jackson’s career is, perhaps, a prime example: his hugely successful Lord of the Rings trilogy came after an eclectic range of movies such as the sci-fi comedy horror Bad Taste, the puppet film Meet the Feebles and the drama Heavenly Creatures.The new work builds on a previous study by the researchers that suggested many creatives find themselves on a roll at some point in their career, although when exactly this happens appears to be random.“About 90% of people have at least one hot streak” said Prof Dashun Wang of Northwestern University, who led the latest study. But, Wang said, it was important to understand why they happened.“Then we can think about, how do we facilitate an individual to help them break through?” he said. “How do we first create an environment that will help the individual to achieve their full potential?”Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Wang and colleagues report how they sought to investigate whether there was a common pattern behind hot streaks. To do so they looked at metrics of success such as the auction price of art works, IMDb ratings of films and citations of research papers to identify hot streaks for 2,128 artists, including Pollock and Frida Kahlo, 4,337 directors – including Mészáros and Jackson – and 20,040 scientists, including the Nobel laureates John B Fenn and Frances Arnold.They then analysed how diverse the individuals’ work was at different points in their careers. This was assessed using an artificial intelligence system that was trained, in the case of art, to “recognise” different styles by features such as the brush strokes, shapes and objects in a piece, while in the case of film, it was trained to classify a director’s work based on plot and cast information. For science, the system identified different research topics based on the papers cited within a researcher’s publications.The diversity before and during the hot streaks was then compared with the diversity at random points in the careers. The team found that for all three career types, work tended to be more diverse just before a true hot streak than expected from the randomly selected points.However, once success had begun, individuals switched, sticking to a narrower than expected approach. That, the team says, suggests “that individuals become substantially more focused on what they work on, reflecting an exploitation strategy during hot streak”.But the researchers found that neither exploring new approaches nor exploiting one were alone linked to hot streaks. Instead it is the combination that is important.“There’s experimentation, and then there’s implementation based on what you have learned through experimentation,” said Wang.Among other twists, the team found that scientists are more likely to try new things with small teams before a hot streak, but then work with large teams once a hot streak begins.Wang said a key direction for future work is to look at how long an experimentation period tends to be.Pamela Burnard, a professor of arts at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research.“‘Trying something new’, ‘going for it’ and optimising ‘hot streaks’, are not new in our understanding of creative careers. What is new is the use of AI to study careers,” she said, adding that old models, for education, economies and creative careers were failing.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ArtPeter JacksonHilary MantelJackson PollockComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policyJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How many of you will know how it was to keep track of cricket before ESPNcricinfo came along?I kept my own database: pages and pages of averages and records clipped from magazines and newspapers and pasted into large notebooks. Because everything got outdated quickly, my little project soon occupied a shelf and threatened to consume many more.You had to have been there in that long-ago age to know how magical it felt to see averages tick over live, and to watch record pages update themselves on ESPNcricinfo. A few years after, along came Statsguru to spoil numbers geeks. It still remains the cricket world's default tool to search, dice and zoom in and out of stats across players, teams, eras and formats. Early in my job as editor of the site, I remember the utter panic in a media box once when Statsguru went down for a while towards the end of a game. I could feel eyes on me, but instead of feeling awkward, I was quietly chuffed.AskCricinfo is a natural, and if I may say, slightly giddy, step forward in that journey: another breakthrough, a little more magic. For all its wonders, Statsguru, with all those filters that allow you to drill and drill, can be a bit overwhelming for the newbie. But what if you could get Virat Kohli's record against legspinners in the last two seasons in the IPL by just typing out a query about it in regular English?Or the answers to other queries, like these:Who hit the most sixes in the powerplays in IPL 2020?What is Dale Steyn's record against AB de Villiers in all T20s? What is Babar Azam's strike rate against Shahid Afridi in the PSL?Which bowler has the most wickets in death overs in the men's T20 World Cups?Which batter has the most 50-plus scores in women's T20Is?Who has the most sixes in an innings in the T20 Blast/T20 Cup in England?Who has scored the most runs in the death overs in an innings in the IPL?What is the highest total by a team in a women's T20I?Who has scored the most runs against Rashid Khan in the BBL?What is the highest partnership in a successful run-chase in the BPL?Just  AskCricinfo. Get to the page. Key in the question. Or ask it aloud if you have voice input enabled for your phone browser. The answer will flash in a few seconds.Of course it's not all that simple at our end. First, the  AskCricinfo engine needs to think like a cricket fan and interpret ""Which opening batter has faced the most dot balls in the powerplays in an innings in IPL?"" or ""What is the highest partnership for the sixth wicket after five wickets down for less than 50 in the CPL?"" correctly. Next, it has to translate that into language that computers understand, and also correctly identify which database to send the question to - our Statsguru engine, the ball-by-ball database, or the records pages. After these tasks, it needs to return the exact answers to those questions.These are not static web pages called up by keyword-matching, as with normal search engines. Here, each question is unique, there are millions of questions that our databases can answer, and a million ways the engine can go wrong. The enormous complexity of this task is why you haven't seen anything like this - not for cricket, not for any sport, not for anything else - where a natural language question returns a precise answer from a database.Since a lot of these answers are derived from ball-by-ball data, this version of  AskCricinfo only fully supports top-flight international cricket, both men's and women's, and all the major leagues. We have started with the newest format simply because there is relatively more ball-by-ball data available for T20 as a whole. Our aim is to build  AskCricinfo tournament by tournament, and then format by format.Artificial intelligence, as most of us know by now, gets better with use. Like with the discovery algorithms on streaming apps,  AskCricinfo will get smarter the more questions it is asked.In the period leading up to this launch, we have endured as much frustration as we have experienced exhilaration. When the first answer came through, it felt like magic. But as expectations and ambition grew, there were days when the task felt hopeless. Accepting the pursuit of accuracy as a more realistic goal freed us from the burden of trying to achieve perfection - unattainable in this case.So let's set our expectations. AskCricinfo is designed to answer queries based on scoring data. It doesn't have opinions: you can ask  who has taken the most wickets in the death overs, but not ""Who is the best bowler in the death overs?"" It doesn't deal in trivia (How many batters have scored hundreds on their birthday? How many sets of brothers currently play in the IPL?) And there is some data it doesn't process yet. (Who was the fastest bowler? Who has scored the most runs from cover drives?)Since the tool is in learning mode, the more specific the questions, the better the answers. Try to spell things right, particularly names; use specific terms like ""batting"", ""bowling"", ""in an innings"", ""in a match"", ""in a season"";  ""Ben Stokes' bowling record"" instead of ""Ben Stokes' record"". Use ""versus"" or ""vs"" or ""v"" for batter-versus-bowler queries, and ""and"" to compare two players ( ""Kohli vs Rashid"",  ""Compare Warner and Rohit Sharma strike rates in powerplays"").Those inclined to help, please make sure to click the thumb icons at the bottom of the  AskCricinfo page.

Researchers mimic the animal kingdom’s most basic signs of intelligence in quantum material
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — For artificial intelligence to get any smarter, it needs first to be as intelligent as one of the simplest creatures in the animal kingdom: the sea slug.
A new study has found that a material can mimic the sea slug’s most essential intelligence features. The discovery is a step toward building hardware that could help make AI more efficient and reliable for technology ranging from self-driving cars and surgical robots to social media algorithms.
The study, publishing this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted by a team of researchers from Purdue University, Rutgers University, the University of Georgia and Argonne National Laboratory.
“Through studying sea slugs, neuroscientists discovered the hallmarks of intelligence that are fundamental to any organism’s survival,” said Shriram Ramanathan, a Purdue professor of materials engineering. “We want to take advantage of that mature intelligence in animals to accelerate the development of AI.”

Two main signs of intelligence that neuroscientists have learned from sea slugs are habituation and sensitization. Habituation is getting used to a stimulus over time, such as tuning out noises when driving the same route to work every day. Sensitization is the opposite – it’s reacting strongly to a new stimulus, like avoiding bad food from a restaurant.
AI has a really hard time learning and storing new information without overwriting information it has already learned and stored, a problem that researchers studying brain-inspired computing call the “stability-plasticity dilemma.” Habituation would allow AI to “forget” unneeded information (achieving more stability) while sensitization could help with retaining new and important information (enabling plasticity).
In this study, the researchers found a way to demonstrate both habituation and sensitization in nickel oxide, a quantum material. The material is called “quantum” because its properties can’t be explained by classical physics.
If a quantum material could reliably mimic these forms of learning, then it may be possible to build AI directly into hardware. And if AI could operate both through hardware and software, it might be able to perform more complex tasks using less energy.
“We basically emulated experiments done on sea slugs in quantum materials toward understanding how these materials can be of interest for AI,” Ramanathan said.
Neuroscience studies have shown that the sea slug demonstrates habituation when it stops withdrawing its gill as much in response to being tapped on the siphon. But an electric shock to its tail causes its gill to withdraw much more dramatically, showing sensitization.
For nickel oxide, the equivalent of a “gill withdrawal” is an increased change in electrical resistance. The researchers found that repeatedly exposing the material to hydrogen gas causes nickel oxide’s change in electrical resistance to decrease over time, but introducing a new stimulus like ozone greatly increases the change in electrical resistance.
Inspired by these findings, a research group under Kaushik Roy, Purdue’s Edward G. Tiedemann Jr. Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, modeled nickel oxide’s behavior and built an algorithm that successfully used these habituation and sensitization strategies to categorize data points into clusters.
“The stability-plasticity dilemma is not solved at all. But we’ve shown a way to address it based on behavior we’ve observed in a quantum material,” Roy said. “If we could turn a material that learns like this into hardware in the future, then AI could perform tasks much more efficiently.”
For practical use of quantum materials as AI hardware, researchers will need to figure out how to apply habituation and sensitization in large-scale systems. They also would have to determine how a material could respond to stimuli while integrated into a computer chip.
This study is a starting place for guiding those next steps, the researchers said. In addition to the experiments performed at Purdue, a team at Rutgers University performed detailed theory calculations to understand what was happening within nickel oxide at a microscopic level to mimic the sea slug’s intelligence features. Argonne National Laboratory characterized the nickel oxide sample’s properties and the University of Georgia measured conductivity to further analyze the material’s behavior.
The work received funding from multiple entities, including the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, the Office of Naval Research, and the Center for Brain Inspired Computing, a Joint University Microelectronics Program center sponsored by the Semiconductor Research Corporation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The research used the resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory.

Habituation and sensitization (non-associative learning) are among the most fundamental forms of learning and memory behavior present in organisms that enables adaptation and learning in dynamic environments. Emulating such features of intelligence found in nature in the solid state can serve as inspiration for algorithmic simulations in artificial neural networks and potential use in neuromorphic computing. Here, we demonstrate non-associative learning with a prototypical Mott insulator, nickel oxide (NiO), under a variety of external stimuli at and above room temperature. Similar to biological species such as Aplysia, habituation and sensitization of NiO possesses time-dependent plasticity relying on both strength and time-interval between stimuli. Combination of experimental approaches and first-principles calculations reveal that such learning behavior of NiO results from dynamic modulation of its defect and electronic structure. An artificial neural network model inspired by such non-associative learning is simulated to show advantages for unsupervised clustering task in accuracy and reducing catastrophic interference, which could help mitigate the stability-plasticity dilemma. Mott insulators can therefore serve as building blocks to examine learning behavior noted in biology and inspire new learning algorithms for artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence (AI) might be the way of the future in tech, gaming and smart-device industries. When applied effectively, AI can save on human employment costs and, in some cases, can accomplish tasks even better than humans can. It would make sense for other industries to try to capitalize on AI's efficiency, versatility and overall power, but for entrepreneurs, applying AI to human resources (HR) poses some challenges.

Understanding AI and the challenges it creates in HR departmentsHR professionals may want to put AI to use, at least partly because it can offer predictive analysis for recruiting. When a company is swamped with resumes, AI can scan resumes for those that best fit the skills and responsibilities required for that specific job. In this sense, AI can save HR teams days of sifting through resumes and cover letters. But applying AI to HR departments isn't always that simple, and in many cases AI can create more challenges than the problems that it solves. Here are some of those issues, and how you can deal with them.


1. AI won't understand your company like you or a recruiter canAlthough AI might help recruiters quickly scan through a pile of resumes, it lacks the global understanding of a company that recruiters possess. When hiring ideal employees, a recruiter researches a company and develops an understanding of that company's positioning, direction within the market and even company culture. AI lacks that same understanding, so when it comes to identifying employees who might be a good fit given the wider global view of the company, AI technology falls short. AI also lacks the knowledge and intuition that recruiters develop from decades in their jobs. AI won't necessarily spot important connections in an applicant's past work that might hint that applicant could be an important candidate. For instance, a recruiter might see that an applicant has worked for a company that underwent rapid growth in the past. That could mean the applicant might be comfortable and flexible enough to grow with a quickly expanding startup. AI won't make that same connection.

The key here is to consider mixing these solutions, so you receive the benefits of both. For example, you can use AI to help candidates more easily send you their credentials (automatic web forms and the like), but use recruiters and your own experience to narrow down the applicants who may actually be the best fit.2. You might miss out on hiring outliersJob applicants who don't fit all of the strict hiring criteria a company has established might also be overlooked by HR. Some of these outliers could make a strong contribution to a company but might not get an interview because of AI technology used to screen resumes. Similarly, because AI lacks a human touch, it might approve resumes of applicants who meet all of the required criteria, but who still aren't ideal applicants for a position. Although it's smart to use AI to cast a wide net, watch the process closely to keep an eye out for certain characteristics that you want in a new hire. If necessary, schedule time for you and your team to personally assess any candidate if needed. Related: Nervous About Meeting Employees in Person for the First Time? Try These 5 Tips


3.  AI can't account for human emotion When hiring, companies don't base their decision-making process on only hard skills. Emotional and psychological traits are important, too, including ambition and passion. AI cannot currently monitor or evaluate human emotion, and it can't account for how emotion affects human behavior. AI also cannot account for personalities and how emotion can affect teams. If tasked with finding a new team member to add to an existing team, AI can't recognize the nuances of team dynamics and how personalities work together. That's where you and the team come in. Because AI operates without the background understanding of complex human emotions, it makes for a flawed hiring and employee evaluation process. Use it sparingly for actual employee evaluation, and let team members do that themselves. 4. AI can't ""read' peopleHR is a human-based, personal operation. AI can't replace an individual manager's unique viewpoint or ability to ""read"" people in person, whether they're job applicants or current employees. Although companies might incorporate AI solutions into their business models, the technology isn't ready to take over significant face-to-face responsibilities in an HR department just yet. As mentioned, the technology might be useful in resume screenings, but it needs to be monitored closely and can't replace talent evaluators (no matter what Elon Musk's plans are).Related: 3 Ways to Set Up Personal and Business Success During Immense Change


5. AI lacks ethical responsibilityEthical responsibility is key for HR teams today, especially when it comes to hiring minorities, taking action after sexual assault and other hot-button issues. AI lacks the ethical responsibility that HR needs to uphold, and AI can unknowingly become biased, too. AI technology ""learns"" from the algorithms that it processes. If AI's machine learning process is programmed by a human, it can take on the biases of its programmer, even though he or she might be unaware of their biases. With biased technology, a company's talent acquisition process might unintentionally also be biased. If the hiring process is ever challenged or questioned, the technology cannot be held accountable for the bias, so HR leaders and the HR team need to take on ethical responsibility. In order to prevent or remedy these occurrences, HR pros have to communicate about such problems to company leadership and programmers. Then, different departments should work together to identify bias, and prevent it from influencing hiring processes.  On another ethical note, if AI can replace a certain number of workers at a company, HR might face the challenging question of deciding which employees to let go. AI might save a company money, but replacing employees with technology can be a touchy ethical dilemma. 


Also, certain AI tech can help by actually picking which people to lay off. Discuss whether these types of solutions feel ethically right to you and your team or not. Just who will select the technology, who needs to be retrained or who might be fired in the end? Go carefully and thoughtfully as you deal with AI and how it affects all of these matters.Related: 4 Lessons from Steve Jobs That Are Still Relevant 10 Years After His Death

Even now, though, things with artificial intelligence may go wrong. Unfortunately, AI systems may run amok on their own, with no outside intervention..AI failed to recognize images:.This example is one of the popular AI failures. Deep learning, a collection of methods commonly used to construct AI, began its triumphant march around 20 years ago with the breakthrough in image recognition, also known as computer vision. It completed previously unsolvable tasks, such as identifying cats from dogs and vice versa, before moving on to more difficult and demanding challenges. It is now a widely held belief that computer vision is a stable and trustworthy technology that is unlikely to fail. Researchers from Berkeley, the University of Chicago, and the University of Washington gathered 7,500 unedited nature pictures a year ago, which perplexed even the most powerful computer vision algorithms. Even the most tried and true algorithms might fail at times..AI despised humans:.After 24 hours of 'learning' from human interactions, Tay, Microsoft's most advanced chatbot, declared, &quot;Hitler was correct to hate the Jews&quot; on Twitter. The goal was to build a slang-filled chatbot that would raise machine-human conversation quality to a new level. However, it was revealed to be a &quot;robot parrot with an internet connection.&quot; The chatbot was constructed on top of the company's AI technology stack, but the harsh reality appears to have ruined the innocent artificial intelligence worldview: an excellent illustration of how data may damage an AI model built in a &quot;clean&quot; lab environment without immunity to detrimental outside impact. This example belongs to another popular AI failure..AI to fight cancer could kill patients:.Another failure cost US$62 million, which was spent by IBM to develop an AI system to aid in the battle against cancer. However, the outcome was once again unsatisfactory. The product, according to a doctor at Jupiter Hospital in Florida, was a complete failure. He went on to say that they acquired it for marketing purposes. Watson advised physicians to give a cancer patient with serious bleeding a medication that might aggravate the bleeding, according to medical experts and customers. Multiple cases of dangerous and erroneous therapy suggestions were reported by medical experts and customers..AI despised women:.Amazon wanted to automate its hiring process to expedite the selection of candidates for the thousands of job openings they have. Everything ended up being a public relations disaster since the system turned out to be sexist, favoring white guys. The training data used to create the model was most likely imbalanced, resulting in candidate selection bias. This is also another example of AI Failures..AI for secure system access by a face can be tricked with a mask: .Make sure no one is wearing a mask with your face if you have an iPhone X with a Face ID. Face ID, according to Apple, creates a 3-dimensional model of your face using the iPhone X's powerful front-facing camera and machine learning. The machine learning/AI component allowed the system to adjust to aesthetic changes (such as putting on make-up, donning a pair of glasses, or wrapping a scarf around your neck) while maintaining security. Bkav, a security business located in Vietnam, discovered that by attaching 2D &quot;eyes&quot; to a 3D mask, they could successfully unlock a Face ID-equipped iPhone. The stone powder mask, which cost approximately US$200, was created. The eyeballs were simply infrared pictures printed on paper. Wired, on the other hand, attempted to defeat Face ID using masks but was unable to replicate the results..AI believes that members of Congress resemble criminals:.Amazon is responsible for another face recognition blunder. Its AI system was meant to detect offenders based on their facial image, but when it was put to the test using a batch of photos of members of Congress, it proved to be not only incorrect but also racially prejudiced. According to the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), almost 40% of Rekognition's (the system's) erroneous matches in our test were of persons of color, even though people of race make up just 20% of Congress. It's unclear if it was a fault with non-white face recognition or if the training data was skewed. Both, most likely. However, relying only on AI to determine whether or not a person is a criminal would be crazy..A lawsuit was filed as a result of an AI-related loss:.A Hong Kong real estate tycoon purchased an AI system to handle a portion of his money to increase funds. In reality, the robot continued to lose up to US$20 million every day. To reclaim a portion of his money, the tycoon sued the firm that provided the fintech service for US$23 million. The lawsuit claims that the business overstated K1's capabilities, and it is the first recorded example of court action over automated investing losses. This AI Failure is also another example..AI has lost its employment to humans:.The first revolutionary Henn-na Hotel opened its doors to visitors in Japan in 2015. All of the hotel's employees were robots, including the front desk, cleaners, porters, and in-room helpers. However, the bots quickly accumulated consumer complaints: they regularly broke down, we're unable to offer adequate responses to visitor questions, and in-room helpers frightened guests at night by misinterpreting snoring as a wake command. The hotel group that owned the hotel finally got rid of the last of its unreliable, costly, and irritating bots, replacing them with human staff after years of effort. The management said that it will return to the lab to see if it can build a new generation of more adept hospitality bots..A triumph for AI that ended in a defeat:.Artificial intelligence was victorious in this case, but it was on the wrong side of the law. A call from his German employer instructed the CEO of a UK-based energy business to transfer €220,000 (US$243,000) to a Hungarian supplier. The 'boss' stated that the request was urgent and instructed the UK CEO to send the funds as soon as possible. Regrettably, the boss was a 'deep fake' speech-generating program that precisely resembled the genuine human's voice. According to The Wall Street Journal, it employed machine learning to become indistinguishable from the original, including the &quot;slight German accent and the melody of his voice.&quot; Is AI a success or a failure? It is entirely up to you to make your decision. This is one of the examples of AI failures..AI-driven cart Malfunctioned on the tarmac:.On the tarmac, an AI-driven food cart malfunctioned, circling out of control and ever-closer to a vulnerable Aeroplan parked at a gate. Finally, a yellow-vest worker was able to stop the cart by hitting it with another vehicle and knocking it down. This case is a little off the rails. The cart was neither mechanized nor controlled by artificial intelligence in any manner. This is also considered one of the popular AI failures..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AskCricinfo is the easiest way to get your stats questions answered. It's like the stats nerd in your circle of friends who revels in cricket numbers and has an answer to every query. And unlike that stats nerd, it never sleeps.At the moment AskCricinfo is still a work in progress. Which means it will make mistakes, and it won't know the answer to every question you ask. But we're banking on you - the cricket fan - to help us improve it and make it perfect.What sort of queries will it answer?
To start with, T20s will be the focus of AskCricinfo. More specifically, it will answer questions on:
 Tests (Men and Women)
 ODIs (Men and Women)
 ODI World Cup (Men and Women)
 Champions Trophy
 IPL
 BBL
 PSL
 CPL
 BPL
 T20 Blast
 T20 internationals (Men and Women)
 T20 World Cup (Men and Women)
 All T20s (Men) (as an overall grouping)
However, since we don't have ball-by-ball data for many women's T20I matches, for that category, AskCricinfo will only answer those queries for which data is available from scorecards. Thus, you won't get answers to player vs player, powerplay, and death-overs questions, but questions related to match totals, run rates, partnerships etc will be answered.For the men's matches, the results for ball-by-ball queries will include all matches for which these details were recorded.A few examples of the query types AskCricinfo will answer are:RecordsMost sixes conceded by a bowler in the PSL
Fastest to 10,000 runs in men's Tests
Who has scored the most runs in World T20?
Most powerplay wickets taken by a spinner in the IPL
Which captain has won the most matches after losing the toss in men's ODIs?
What is the highest partnership in women's ODIs?
Most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in a match in the BPL
Highest individual score in a women's T20IPlayer stats
Pollard's batting record in the death overs
Yuzvendra Chahal's economy rate at each venue in the IPL
What is David Warner's highest score in run chases in T20Is?
What is Jhulan Goswami's economy rate in ODIs in England?
Sunil Gavaskar's batting average in Tests against West IndiesPlayer/team match-ups / comparisons
Who has dismissed Aaron Finch most often in the BBL?
Virat Kohli's batting average against James Anderson in Tests
New Zealand's T20I record against Bangladesh
Compare the strike rates of Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell in the death overs in IPLPartnerships
What is the highest partnership in a follow-on in Tests?
What is the highest partnership in Women's T20Is?
Highest partnership in a defeat in the T20 Blast
Highest stands between Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers in the IPL
Best strike-rate for a 50+ stand in the BBL
Best run rate for a century partnership in ODIsWhy is there a tournament/ format dropdown listed beside the query bar?
The dropdown ensures you don't need to type in the tournament name for each query - selecting the relevant tournament/format from the dropdown will do the job, and ensure that the output is restricted to that tournament alone, for that query and all subsequent queries, unless another tournament is selected from the dropdown.If a written query specifies a tournament different from the one in the dropdown selection, the dropdown entry will change to accommodate the tournament specified in the text. A couple of examples.Query: What is the most sixes hit in an innings by a team (select ""BBL"" from the dropdown)
The output leads with 15 sixes, by Sydney Thunder versus Sydney Sixers in Adelaide.Change the dropdown selection to ""IPL"". 
The output now leads with RCB's 21 sixes against Pune Warriors in 2013.Now change the query to ""Highest partnership in a defeat in a T20I"", but keep the dropdown selection as ""IPL"" .
As mentioned earlier, the query engine gives precedence to the written query over the dropdown selection, and throws up the 156-run partnership between Adnan Idrees  and Ravija Sandaruwan as the top entry, with the dropdown selection automatically changing to ""T20Is"". You can also view the scorecard of that game by clicking on the drilldown options on the right in that row.Do we need to ask the questions in a particular format?
No, but the clearer the question, the higher are the chances of AskCricinfo fetching the right answers. Here are a few tips:
Defining the innings number in Tests: Since the term 'first innings' could mean the first innings of a match, or the first innings for a team (which could be the first or second innings of a match), the following rules apply for the algorithm to understand which innings to query for:-	'Innings number 1' (or 'innings no. 1' or 'innings no.=1') will returns results only for the first innings of a game. The other three innings will be ignored.
-	Any other terminology will return results for the first two innings.
-	So, 'highest total by a team in innings no. 2 in a Test match' will return results only for that particular innings, ignoring innings 1, 3 and 4, while 'highest total by a team in the second innings in a Test match' will return results for innings 3 and 4.Keep the questions specific and detailed, using key terms that will help the engine identify the question and answer it correctly.

So, ""Gayle versus Ashwin in the powerplay in IPL""; ""Compare the strike rates of Pollard and Russell in the death overs in IPL"".Mind your spellings : The engine may not identify players whose names have been spelt incorrectly, so be careful about spelling names right. In general, avoid spelling errors to get the best results from AskCricinfo.Rephrase your question and try again if you don't get the answer you expect at the first attempt.

Rephrasing the question might help the engine understand, and answer, your question.Pick the tournament from the dropdown: As mentioned earlier, the tournament/format dropdown ensures you don't need to write them out for every query.Will the voice command work for questions?
The voice command will work on the desktop and on mobile web (but not on the ESPNcricinfo app). You can use voice input for your query by clicking on the mic icon and asking the question clearly. Voice commands will work on most browsers on desktop and on mobile.What are some of the questions that Ask Cricinfo will not answer?
While Ask Cricinfo will answer a wide gamut of questions, there are some query types that it is not trained for. So the following question types are beyond it at this time:
Line, length, ball type, ball speed
Eg: Who bowled the most yorkers in IPL 2020
How many times was AB de Villiers dismissed by the googly in last two seasons
Bumrah's economy rate when he bowls back of a length
Who bowled the fastest ball of last seasonWagon wheel
Eg: How many runs has Babar Azam scored in the V this PSL seasonShot type
Eg: What is Prithvi Shaw's favourite shot this seasonControl factor
Eg: Which batsman had the highest control percent this seasonDRS 
Eg: Which team had the best success percent with reviews Consecutives
Eg: Which team has the most consecutive wins
Which batsman has hit 50s in the most consecutive innings Indian versus foreign players in the IPL
Eg: What was the split of runs scored by Indian and foreign players for MI in IPL 2021Dot-ball %, boundary %, control %
The raw values for these data points will work, but not the percentage values. So:
Who bowled the most dot balls in IPL 2020 will work, but Which bowler had the highest percentage of dots in IPL 2020 will not
This is not a comprehensive list of queries which can't be answered.Also, since this is a purely stats-based engine, it will not answer queries which are not related to stats. (So don't expect it to know the name of Virat Kohli's daughter.)",2021-09-14T14:20:00+00:00,2022-08-25T15:34:16+00:00,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319400/319497.4.jpg', 'width': '350', 'height': '200'}",N/A,N/A,"NewsHow to get the best out of AskCricinfoA list of FAQs about AskCricinfo, ESPNcricinfo's unique stats offeringESPNcricinfo stats team14-Sep-2021Geek speak: the simplest way to get cricket stats  •  ESPNcricinfo LtdWhat is AskCricinfo?
AskCricinfo is the easiest way to get your stats questions answered. It's like the stats nerd in your circle of friends who revels in cricket numbers and has an answer to every query. And unlike that stats nerd, it never sleeps.At the moment AskCricinfo is still a work in progress. Which means it will make mistakes, and it won't know the answer to every question you ask. But we're banking on you - the cricket fan - to help us improve it and make it perfect.What sort of queries will it answer?
To start with, T20s will be the focus of AskCricinfo. More specifically, it will answer questions on:
 Tests (Men and Women)
 ODIs (Men and Women)
 ODI World Cup (Men and Women)
 Champions Trophy
 IPL
 BBL
 PSL
 CPL
 BPL
 T20 Blast
 T20 internationals (Men and Women)
 T20 World Cup (Men and Women)
 All T20s (Men) (as an overall grouping)
However, since we don't have ball-by-ball data for many women's T20I matches, for that category, AskCricinfo will only answer those queries for which data is available from scorecards. Thus, you won't get answers to player vs player, powerplay, and death-overs questions, but questions related to match totals, run rates, partnerships etc will be answered.RelatedIntroducing AskCricinfoFor the men's matches, the results for ball-by-ball queries will include all matches for which these details were recorded.A few examples of the query types AskCricinfo will answer are:RecordsMost sixes conceded by a bowler in the PSL
Fastest to 10,000 runs in men's Tests
Who has scored the most runs in World T20?
Most powerplay wickets taken by a spinner in the IPL
Which captain has won the most matches after losing the toss in men's ODIs?
What is the highest partnership in women's ODIs?
Most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in a match in the BPL
Highest individual score in a women's T20IPlayer stats
Pollard's batting record in the death overs
Yuzvendra Chahal's economy rate at each venue in the IPL
What is David Warner's highest score in run chases in T20Is?
What is Jhulan Goswami's economy rate in ODIs in England?
Sunil Gavaskar's batting average in Tests against West IndiesPlayer/team match-ups / comparisons
Who has dismissed Aaron Finch most often in the BBL?
Virat Kohli's batting average against James Anderson in Tests
New Zealand's T20I record against Bangladesh
Compare the strike rates of Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell in the death overs in IPLPartnerships
What is the highest partnership in a follow-on in Tests?
What is the highest partnership in Women's T20Is?
Highest partnership in a defeat in the T20 Blast
Highest stands between Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers in the IPL
Best strike-rate for a 50+ stand in the BBL
Best run rate for a century partnership in ODIsESPNcricinfo LtdWhy is there a tournament/ format dropdown listed beside the query bar?
The dropdown ensures you don't need to type in the tournament name for each query - selecting the relevant tournament/format from the dropdown will do the job, and ensure that the output is restricted to that tournament alone, for that query and all subsequent queries, unless another tournament is selected from the dropdown.If a written query specifies a tournament different from the one in the dropdown selection, the dropdown entry will change to accommodate the tournament specified in the text. A couple of examples.Query: What is the most sixes hit in an innings by a team (select ""BBL"" from the dropdown)
The output leads with 15 sixes, by Sydney Thunder versus Sydney Sixers in Adelaide.Change the dropdown selection to ""IPL"". 
The output now leads with RCB's 21 sixes against Pune Warriors in 2013.Now change the query to ""Highest partnership in a defeat in a T20I"", but keep the dropdown selection as ""IPL"" .
As mentioned earlier, the query engine gives precedence to the written query over the dropdown selection, and throws up the 156-run partnership between Adnan Idrees  and Ravija Sandaruwan as the top entry, with the dropdown selection automatically changing to ""T20Is"". You can also view the scorecard of that game by clicking on the drilldown options on the right in that row.Do we need to ask the questions in a particular format?
No, but the clearer the question, the higher are the chances of AskCricinfo fetching the right answers. Here are a few tips:
Defining the innings number in Tests: Since the term 'first innings' could mean the first innings of a match, or the first innings for a team (which could be the first or second innings of a match), the following rules apply for the algorithm to understand which innings to query for:-	'Innings number 1' (or 'innings no. 1' or 'innings no.=1') will returns results only for the first innings of a game. The other three innings will be ignored.
-	Any other terminology will return results for the first two innings.
-	So, 'highest total by a team in innings no. 2 in a Test match' will return results only for that particular innings, ignoring innings 1, 3 and 4, while 'highest total by a team in the second innings in a Test match' will return results for innings 3 and 4.Keep the questions specific and detailed, using key terms that will help the engine identify the question and answer it correctly. These keywords include the following:batter/batting, bowler/ bowling, team, in an innings, in a match, in a season, overall.For example:- ""Batter with the most sixes in PSL 2020"" or ""Team with most sixes in PSL 2020"", instead of ""Most sixes in PSL 2020""- ""Bowler with most powerplay wickets"" or ""Team with most powerplay wickets"", instead of ""Most powerplay wickets"".- ""Most sixes by a team/batter in an innings"" instead of ""Most sixes in an innings"".- ""Worst powerplay score for a team in a match"", instead of ""Worst powerplay score""- ""Bumrah's bowling record against Ben Stokes"", instead of ""Bumrah's record against Stokes""- ""Compare the batting records of Andre Russell and Kieron Pollard"", instead of ""Compare the records of Andre Russell and Kieron Pollard"".- Use ""versus"" or ""vs"" or 'v"" for batter-versus-bowler match-up questions, and ""and"" to compare two players. So, ""Gayle versus Ashwin in the powerplay in IPL""; ""Compare the strike rates of Pollard and Russell in the death overs in IPL"".Mind your spellings : The engine may not identify players whose names have been spelt incorrectly, so be careful about spelling names right. In general, avoid spelling errors to get the best results from AskCricinfo.Rephrase your question and try again if you don't get the answer you expect at the first attempt.
