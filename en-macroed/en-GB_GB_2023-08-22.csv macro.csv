New report by Thomson Reuters shows that industry professionals expect generative AI to dramatically impact the way they work now, creating new opportunities and posing new challenges

The way we work in professional services is undoubtedly undergoing a massive sea change. This revolution, driven by the novel yet undeniable power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), is increasing apace as professional organizations across industries are beginning or continuing to adopt AI into their everyday workflows.
To better understand this revolution and delve into the insights and perspectives of those facing this change on the front lines of their professions, Thomson Reuters today released a new wide-ranging Special Report, Future of Professionals, which surveyed more than 1,200 individuals working internationally in the legal, tax & accounting, global trade, risk management, and compliance fields who are employed at firms, corporate in-house departments, and government agencies based in North America, South America, and the United Kingdom. The purpose of the survey was to gain a better understanding of how the macro-trends impacting professional services businesses are converging with their talent, their customers, and their environment — and how AI, tech, and automation specifically will impact their operations over the next five years.
Among the critical insights, the survey showed that more than two-thirds (67%) of respondents said they believe AI will have a transformational or high impact on their profession over the next five years. Further, almost as many (66%) predicted that AI actually will create new professional career paths.
By any measurement, the report makes clear that generative AI will become a game-changer in the professional services industries, from legal and tax & accounting to corporate and government work.
“Many of the innovations we use today have crept up on us, evolved, and gradually changed the way we work and play. But not generative AI — this is different,” says Steve Hasker, president and CEO of Thomson Reuters, adding that generative AI “has captured our collective imaginations and changed everything.”
Most survey respondents were optimistic around the power of AI, with 45% saying their biggest hopes for AI was in improved productivity, internal efficiency, and client services. Additionally, 67% of respondents indicated their biggest personal motivator was producing high-quality advice — a critical insight considering that to work in the era of generative AI, professionals need to reconsider and redefine what it means to be an advisor and configure their business models to better prepare and service customers now and in the future.
Indeed, respondents’ expectations of improved efficiency and increased productivity due to the power of AI was a common thread throughout this report. “Through the application of AI to perform more mundane tasks, professionals have the unique opportunity to address human capital issues such as job satisfaction, well-being, and work-life balance,” Hasker explains. “This will in turn unlock time for professionals to focus on complex work that adds value to their client’s needs.”
Naturally, of course, many respondents struck some notes of caution around generative AI use in the workplace, including concerns over accuracy, with 25% or respondents citing this concern; job loss (19%); demise of the profession altogether (17%); data security (15%); and ethics (15%).
The Future of Professionals Report also broke down key findings in several critical professional service industries, including:
Legal — Among legal professionals, improved productivity and efficiency were seen as the biggest positive effects of AI (75% and 67%, respectively). And among those respondents at law firms more than half (55%) see AI as an opportunity for increased revenue and lower costs. Further, a large majority (81%) of legal respondents said they expect new services that will create new revenue streams to emerge within the next five years.
A majority (58%) also said they anticipate a rise in their professional skill level, while more than two-thirds of legal professionals see a more consultative approach to advice emerging.
Tax & Accounting — Tax & accounting professionals saw generative AI as a way to free up their time to deliver more value to clients, as more than half (59%) cited productivity as the highest priority for tax & accounting firms, and three-quarters (75%) cited internal efficiency as the highest priority for corporate tax & accounting departments.
Among individual tax & accounting respondents, producing high-quality advice topped the list of personal motivators for more than two-thirds of professionals (67%). Professionals also predicted new career paths will become available (66%), including a rise in roles that do not require traditional tax qualifications (68%), over the next five years.
Government — Talent issues tend to be a higher priority for government professionals than for their corporate counterparts, and government respondents tend to feel more optimistic that AI can help in areas of training, recruitment, well-being, and engagement.
However, government professionals tend to think that their agencies’ AI adoption will be slower than that of their private sector counterparts, due mainly to data security fears and general resistance to change.

A recent study (21 August) by the UN’s International Labour Organisation has found that women may be disproportionately at higher risk of having their jobs automated by AI. 
Overall, the paper found that AI would not end human labour but rather creates a future where work is “transformed”.

Clerical work was identified as the sector that would see the biggest impact from generative AI. The UN stresses that this is not necessarily negative, as generative AI has just as much potential to augment clerical work as it does to automate it. 
However, a quarter of clerical tasks examined in the study had the potential to be fully automated. 
Not only does this run the risk of job displacement for women, who have traditionally filled these roles according to the UN, but it could lead to this type of work never emerging in lower income countries. 
The study explains that many clerical jobs have acted as “a vehicle for increasing female employment”.

Balancing AI augmentation and automation will undoubtedly have a “strongly gendered effect” on the job market according to the paper’s authors. Whilst a badly managed technological transition to generative AI could disproportionately harm women, the paper does reaffirm that a well-managed transition could create “important opportunities” for women in the workplace. 
The study also calls for better management of the jobs that will be created to ensure the development of AI itself. 
AI’s development hinges on repetitive tagging and feedback tasks, as well as content moderation of the data it is trained on. 
According to GlobalData’s job analytics, active job postings that mention generative AI have increased by 120% in the last four months. 

From 15 May, 2023 to 14 August, 2023, active job postings have increased from 1,406 to 3,118. The biggest hiring countries were the US, India and Canada. 
In a recent GlobalData survey over 52% of businesses have stated that even though they think generative AI is hyped, they do recognise potential use cases for the technology. GlobalData also found that the most common use cases for AI were in accounting, marketing and customer service jobs. 
Our signals coverage is powered by GlobalData’s Thematic Engine, which tags millions of data items across six alternative datasets — patents, jobs, deals, company filings, social media mentions and news — to themes, sectors and companies. These signals enhance our predictive capabilities, helping us to identify the most disruptive threats across each of the sectors we cover and the companies best placed to succeed.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for Indonesia, which has the largest digital economy in Southeast Asia. The AI ecosystem in Indonesia has been growing rapidly and the Indonesian government has consistently supported digital investments in the country including adopting the National Strategy on AI 2020-2045 outlining a plan to develop the necessary infrastructure and talent pool, recommending the formation of a data ethics board to oversee AI development, as well as creating regulations and national standards for AI innovation.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD243.5 billion of productive capacity in Indonesia, equivalent to close to one-fifth of GDP in 2022. Indonesia has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



In fact, according to a recent McKinsey report, generative AI is now being used by 79% of workers and 22% use it regularly to complete their day-to-day work tasks.
Generative AI is also being used by around 40% of organizations to speed up processes and make workers more efficient.
Future outlook
It’s fair to assume that AI’s impact will include some casualties along the way—the World Economic Forum has estimated that AI will result in 83 million global job losses by 2027.
Separately, Accenture has estimated that 40% of all working hours could be affected by generative AI tools, and by the mid-2030s, up to 30% of jobs could be automated.
And while the majority of those surveyed by McKinsey admit that generative AI will cause significant or disruptive change, particularly in knowledge-based work such as banking and pharmaceuticals, this disruption and adoption of a new way of working will also add to revenue to the tune of 9% globally.
Conversely, manufacturing-based businesses including aerospace, automotive and advanced electronics will experience less disruptive effects.
Making AI work for you
The McKinsey report also highlights how we’re using generative AI to speed up repetitive tasks so that workers can focus on more creative endeavors, which is its primary advantage.
Crafting first drafts of text documents is its most popular use at 9%, followed by personalized marketing (8%), summarizing text documents (8%) and identifying trends in customer needs (7%). ChatGPT is also being used by 5% of workers to draft technical documents and forecast trends or anomalies, while 4% are using the tool to create new product designs.
For tech workers, software engineers in particular, AI is also proving to be invaluable when it comes to creating code faster and more accurately. These include CoPilot, which is driven by the OpenAI Codex language model, and can assist in debugging and preventing data breaches while also writing entire lines of code. Similarly, Tabnine, which is compatible with Python, Rust, Go, Java and Javascript, uses open-source code to offer complete suggestions.
And then there’s Amazon CodeWhisperer. It uses a large language model (LLM) trained on AWS services, and suggests and monitors code as you write it, based on the text prompts initially provided by users.
As the adage goes, if you can’t beat them, join them—and the VentureBeat Job Board is the perfect place to start your search. It features thousands of jobs at companies that are harnessing generative AI and actively hiring, such as the three below.

what is thought to be a UK first for the social care sector amid hopes it could help speedily tackle workforce shortages.An avatar – digital representation – of a real-life trainer is being piloted to welcome new staff in multiple languages and teach them various skills including spotting signs of stroke.Social care provider and healthtech company Cera said the avatars could train approximately 20,000 new carers a year if rolled out nationally, with its founder describing it as “an exciting and pioneering development”.We need new innovations to provide greater sustainability to the sector and allow us to do more with less because there is only a growing demand for services, given the ageing population, given the very high waiting listsDr Ben Maruthappu, CeraRecommendedAI can write better university assignments than students, report suggestsRishi Sunak announces Bletchley Park as site of autumn AI summitAI eye scans can detect Parkinson’s up to seven years before symptoms appear, scientists sayThe company is private but said the majority of its business is providing social care on behalf of the NHS and local authorities so staff being trained by the avatars will deliver services in the health service or through councils.A pilot in London and the South East which began this month is expected to have trained around 60 new carers by the end of August.There were around 152,000 vacancies in social care on any given day between April 2022 and March this year, according to the latest report from Skills For Care, which is the strategic workforce development and planning body for adult social care in England.Cera founder and chief executive Dr Ben Maruthappu said the use of avatars could mean training “thousands of people a day at low or no cost, while maintaining the familiar face of their local Cera team”.In an interview with the PA news agency, Dr Maruthappu described it as a “positive and high-impact use” of artificial intelligence (AI).He said: “This is an exciting and pioneering development at an important time for social care.“Given pressures are so high on the NHS and the care sector, we need new innovations to provide greater sustainability to the sector and allow us to do more with less because there is only a growing demand for services, given the ageing population, given the very high waiting lists.“And it is technologies like this that are helping to address these pressures in a very sustainable way.”Sarah Craven, Cera’s operational lead in the pilot area, is the first staff member to have an avatar created and welcomed the development.I used to say I wish I could be in two places at once... this is as close as I think anyone can get to thatSarah Craven, Cera's operational lead in the pilot areaShe said: “People who come into social care love caring for people, that’s what motivates them day in, day out.“Anything we can do to speed up the onboarding process in a safe and more efficient way is hugely welcome.“I used to say I wish I could be in two places at once – welcoming new staff in one part of the region and supporting my current staff in another is the dream with a region like ours that is so geographically spread out – this is as close as I think anyone can get to that.”Age UK, a charity representing older people, said it hoped that AI can enhance training, if used well, but warned it “can’t fully substitute for in-person instruction and support”.Asked about the consequences of the new technology for human trainers, Dr Maruthappu said there will “always” be a need for in-person care and in-person training.He told PA: “For example, showing someone manual handling – how to physically move a patient if they’re in a hoist – that’s something that needs to be done in-person.”Dr Maruthappu said there is already a mix of in-person and online training, but that the use of avatars “makes the online training so much more personalised”.Using avatars is a novel idea and one that we hope will pique the interest of care workers and help them to stay fully engaged in the training programmes on which they are deployedCaroline Abrahams, Age UKAge UK director Caroline Abrahams said: “It’s important that the social care sector keeps up with the exponential progress being made in technology and AI, and exploits it wisely to improve its productivity and effectiveness.“This can only be in the best interests of older people, many of whom will depend on a good social care service at some point in their later lives.“Using avatars is a novel idea and one that we hope will pique the interest of care workers and help them to stay fully engaged in the training programmes on which they are deployed.“Having said that, because social care is at heart a ‘people job’, the most important training that care workers will ever receive is likely to be of the hands-on variety.“As in other ‘people jobs’, the benefits gained by new recruits from working alongside skilled and experienced professionals, watching what they do and how they do it, and reflecting on and discussing their practice with them afterwards, are priceless.”The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) echoed this, saying while it is important to use digital technology, there must be varied approaches to training as “one size doesn’t fit all”.Cathie Williams, joint chief executive of Adass, said: “It’s important to harness the potential for digital technology to improve social care, including new ways to provide training for care workers.RecommendedNvidia sales hit record high as AI chip demand soarsWhite House science adviser calls for more safeguards against artificial intelligence risks“Of course, people learn in different ways, so training must always offer a range of different ways to learn, one size doesn’t fit all.“And the result of any training must always be about developing really good quality care and support based on great human relationships. That’s what enables us to live good lives, not just stay alive when we need support and is at the heart of social care.”Earlier this year social care minister Helen Whately said AI and voice technologies are some of the “really exciting” innovations in social care, describing the use of devices such as voice-controlled virtual assistants as “just the tip of the iceberg” and adding that better use of technology could mean staff spending less time on paperwork.The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.More aboutPA ReadyNHSSouth EastLondonCaroline AbrahamsAge UKHelen WhatelyDepartment of Health and Social Care1/1AI used to train staff in ‘UK first for social care sector’AI used to train staff in ‘UK first for social care sector’A pilot has been launched to train social care workers using artificial intelligence (Alamy/PA)✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Companies are looking to hire more people with experience with artificial intelligence (AI) as the arrival of generative AI tools and platforms forces enterprises to re-think their digital strategies, according to new studies from employment websites.
The studies also documented the AI skills most sought by organizations who hope to use the technology to boost efficiency and production by augmenting and/or automating employee tasks.
Job listing site Upwork on Tuesday released its study on the skillsets of job seekers accepting jobs as well as the search and hiring behaviors of companies in relation to fastest-growing skills category: generative AI. It found that 49% of hiring managers plan to hire more independent talent and 49% say they will hire more full-time employees — both a result of AI deployment plans.
 
 
 













 
 

AI was the fastest-growing category on Upwork in the first half of 2023, with generative AI job posts up more than 1000% in the second quarter of this year compared to the end of 2022; related searches increased more than 1500% in the same time period.

The top 10 generative AI-related job hires were: ChatGPT, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Tensorflow, Image Processing, Pytorch, AI Content Creation, Midjourney, AI Chatbot, LLM tuning, and Stable Diffusion.
 
 
 













 
 

Upwork determined the top AI hires by looking at each job posting and the skills freelance job seekers attached to their online profile; that included gen AI tools, like ChatGPT.
“We looked at the number of jobs hired during January 1 – June 30, 2023 that included Generative AI skills,” said Kelly Monahan, managing director of Upwork’s Research Institute, which performed the study. “We reported on the top 10 Generative AI jobs hired that included one of the Generative AI skills listed in the job posting. Chat GPT rose to the top over that time period. The job hire itself could be a range of activities such as hiring an AI developer who can work with Chat GPT, a Chat GPT writer or a Chat GPT expert to consult on use cases for a company as examples.”
The fastest-growing generative AI-related searches between Q1 and Q2 of this year, according to Upwork, were:

The sentiment around hiring and the surge of activity from companies interested in gen AI are strong early indications that businesses are paying significant attention to the opportunities the fast-evolving technology can provide, according to Upwork. Companies are shifting their focus from singular gen AI tools toward applications and services, including AI content creation, Azure OpenAI, and prompt engineering.
“Generative AI is following a similar adoption curve to other new and emerging technologies,” said Monahan. “When it is first broadly released to the public, people are still determining the specific use cases of the technology, so their searches begin at a broad level. In the case of Generative AI, ChatGPT was the first tool that sparked public attention. As a result, our platform data shows that many of the searches at the beginning of the year were from people coming and looking for freelancers with ChatGPT skills.”

In fact, ChatGPT commanded the largest volume of searches by companies in the first half of 2023. And ChatGPT’s creator, OpenAI, continues to see “a first-mover advantage” with its tool, including the underlying large language models — GPT-3 and GPT-4. ChatGPT is at the top of the list of generative AI-related search terms from those looking to hire, followed by Google’s BERT and Stable AI’s Stable Diffusion.
 
 
 













 
 

On social network and professional networking site LinkedIn, the share of job postings mentioning GPT or ChatGPT increased nearly six-fold from May 2022 to May 2023. And the number of LinkedIn members who hold, or have been holding, “head of AI” positions has nearly tripled in the last five years.

As people have learned more about the capabilities of gen AI, they are beginning to develop a deeper understanding of how it can actually be used. This maturity cycle, Monahan said, is reflected in gen AI-related searches. “Instead of looking for just a single tool, like ChatGPT, they are searching for the diverse use cases of generative AI technologies like AI content creation, services like Gradio, used for building machine learning web apps, and prompt engineering,” Monahan said.
The changes in the hiring market reveal a deeper recognition of the skills needed to implement AI to solve business problems, such as working with Large Language Models (LLMs), the role of prompt engineering, and object detection.
 
 
 













 
 

Object detection is a computer vision technique in which models can be trained to locate, identify, and analyze objects in a digital image or video, according to Monahan. You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a specific object detection tool Upwork sees growing quickly on freelancer profiles as a top generative skill in their profiles.  
In an earlier July study, Upwork found the number of weekly job postings related to genAI like ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Cohere’s Coral, were up more than 450% from a year ago.
The share of global English-language job postings mentioning GPT or ChatGPT is up 21-fold since November, according to LinkedIn’s Future of Work report, which was released last week.
 
 
 













 
 

In fact, 47% of US executives believe using gen AI will increase productivity. Additionally, 44% of executives plan to increase their use of AI at their organization in the next year, and 40% think the technology will help unlock more growth and revenue.

“The rise of AI talent and members adding AI skills has been accelerating since 2016,” LinkedIn said. “With the launch of ChatGPT, we are seeing the promise of AI and how it’s reshaping the skills required at work and at the same time helping people become more productive.”
An analysis of how AI skills are emerging across 25 countries shows that the pace at which LinkedIn members added AI skills to their profiles nearly doubled since the launch of ChatGPT, rising from 7.7% (May–November 2022) to 13% (November 2022–June 2023), LinkedIn said.
 
 
 













 
 

While AI has been used for more than 50 years, generative AI — the algorithm’s ability to generate text, images, or other media — has become a highly sought-after capability, according to Erick Brethenoux, Gartner distinguished vice president analyst.

AI can help organizations with decision support, parse thousands of data points or records in seconds, and replace mundane tasks that can free up employees to perform more important, and creative, jobs. “Generative AI was born out of machine learning techniques. People added rule-based systems and natural language processing and knowledge graphs to AI,” Brethenoux said.
For example, gen AI applications can assist in decision augmentation, or the collaboration of humans and machines, Brethenoux said.
 
 
 













 
 

“I cannot analyze 7,000 dimensions at once,” he said. “Machines can do that. So, then, great — let them analyze the data and find the patterns. Then how to apply those patterns can be at my discretion and could also be helped by a machine.”
Additionally, LLMs can be tailored or customized with APIs to ingest corporate data or fine-tuned through prompt engineering.
For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 LLM is pre-trained as next word or content prediction engines; that’s how most businesses use them — out of the box, as it were. Pre-trained LLMs, which can contain billions or even trillions of parameters, work relatively well at feeding mostly accurate and compelling content.
 
 
 













 
 

At the very least, pre-trained LLMs can be used as a jumping off point by organizations looking to automate some tasks. But, pre-trained LLMs are often trained using older data and are bloated with information.
As a result, LLMs are poised to shrink, not grow, as vendors seek to customize them for specific uses that don’t need the massive data sets in today’s most popular models. Industry-specific use cases, say for financial services or healthcare, require LLMs to generate more unique outputs using the language of those industries and organizations. That will require workers with skill sets that can customize  LLMs for more specific business purposes.
As more employees are trained on AI, fears of job displacement from the technology may subside as workers see the potential for new AI-powered enterprises. For example, there are now 300 AI courses offered on the LinkedIn Learning platform.
 
 
 













 
 

“There are certainly online certification courses that professionals can take to update their resumes and be on top of new and emerging generative AI skills,” Upwork’s Monahan said. “There are plenty of places to start, like on Coursera or Udemy, but companies that have their own open AI services, like Microsoft and Azure, also offer online training opportunities.”

Don’t look now, but the future is here, and with it come the jobs of the future. In fact, more of the future is already behind us – in terms of jobs – than we realize.

2015: AI Jobs of the Future 

In 2015, I wrote, “By 2025, one in four jobs in the American workforce will be jobs that do not exist today.” I also said, “We’re overestimating what AI will be able to do three years from now but underestimating what it will be able to do in 10.” Many of my readers and audience members dismissed or avoided those comments, for two reasons, I found: (1) lack of imagination, and (2) fear.

2008: Jobs of the Future (No AI yet)
Going further back, the first time I published an essay entitled “Jobs of the Future” – but no AI yet – was in October 2008, nine months into the Great Recession. (Remember that “once in a lifetime” event – that we ultimately had two of?) Later that month I was scheduled to do a” Jobs of the Future” presentation to a professional networking group, but the host called me and asked me to present something else. “The furthest into the future anyone in the audience wants to see is to their next unemployment check,” he said. “They’re losing their jobs and their homes. All they want is a job in the present.”

PROMOTED
Look at us now. We’re still riding the greatest job market growth in history, but it’s no longer where the jobs are created (or lost) that counts, but how they are changed.

AI Jobs are transformational
AI is already transforming the job landscape by automating certain many tasks, supporting more than that, and creating countless new opportunities. Just as we have millions of jobs we couldn’t imagine a decade ago, as AI continues its evolution, new job titles will be born. We’ve learned to expect the unexpected – and fortunately, we have two generations – Gen Y and Gen Z – who have proven they’re good at that. They’ll handle this very well, thank you.

AI Data Privacy Manager.
If we didn’t learn from the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2016, we better get a move on. Ensuring privacy, security, and transparency is not just central, it’s existential.
AI Urban Planner. 
I place this very high on the priority list. Despite all the talk of people fleeing the cities, the truth is that we are increasingly growing our urban centers by inward flow of professional talent and outward sprawl of what we now call urban. Not to mention, our aging cities were built with no concern for sustainability while our renewal must be all about that: a huge paradigm shift. Using AI simulations and predictive modeling is key.
AI Climate Change Analyst. 
Glaring evidence of the importance of this job mounts daily: Maui, Southern California, the polar caps, warmer water in the North Atlantic, etc. Meteoric growth in this critical occupation is already happening, especially in the EU, applying AI models to analyze climate data, predict environmental trends, and develop strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change.
AI Trainer/Teacher.
Somebody’s got to design, create, and deliver datasets to train AI models and develop curricula to educate people on AI concepts and technologies.
AI Cybersecurity Analyst.
This is a case of building a corral before the horses get out, rather than scurrying around after they do. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
AI Augmentation Specialist.
One manifestation of a hybrid workplace will be humans work with AI – as coworkers. Facilitating this integration will be tricky.
AI Healthcare Diagnostics Analyst.
This has a huge upside, keeping pace with spectacular advances in the technologies that diagnose and treat.
AI Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Manager.
Overseeing, implementing, and managing RPA will span business operations, ecologic management, space and ocean exploration, wildlife protection, crime, and more.
AI Customer Experience Specialist.
Personalizing customer experiences by analyzing data and predicting customer needs will augment the already active field of UX.
AI Supply Chain Analyst. 
Usually, technology advances start as strategic advantages and then morph into being operational advantages. In supply chain, it could go both ways – at once.
AI Linguist/NLP Specialist.
Developing and refining language models for improved communication between humans and machines should be a job opportunity gor anyone with a degree in Linguistics, Language Studies, and even Fine Arts.
AI Creativity Consultant.
Creativity rarely occurs in a vacuum; it depends on diverse stimuli and diversity of stimuli. Collaborating with AI systems will help in creative efforts across the entire STEAM spectrum.
AI Virtual Reality Architect.
There’s not much of a leap from virtual reality to advanced surgery, infrastructure design and maintenance, agricultural management, military training, and countless other simulations.
Some details could vary, but these job titles should point to what our workplace will look like – or, more accurately, what it’s already looking like.

Many business processes may now be subject to automation and artificial intelligence, but that doesn’t mean everyone needs to be thoroughly skilled in automation and AI development and implementation. A recent survey of executives and employees finds while technical savvy is important, so is business savvy. The most sought-after skills they are seeking in their workforces are time management, teamwork, and communication.


The study of 3,000 global C-suite leaders and 21,000 workers by the IBM Institute for Business Value finds that, yes, AI will affect many jobs, but not in the way many fear. Rather, the pressure will be on people at all levels — from executives to production workers — need to be able to leverage the technology in new ways.

“As AI continues to evolve, its effects will likely intensify across the board, including at the managerial and executive ranks,” according to the team of IBM co-authors led by Jill Goldstein and Bill Lobig. “No level is immune to the impact. This will force executives to rethink job roles, skill sets, and how work gets done.”

What sort of rethinking will be required? “On average, 87% of executives expect job roles to be augmented, rather than replaced, by generative AI,” Goldstein and Lobig found. Disciplines seeing the most changes are procurement (97%), finance (93%), and risk and compliance (93%).

Interestingly, they report, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) skills are “plummeting” in importance, dropping from the top spot in 2016 to 12th place in 2023. AI, automation, and software skills are becoming more accessible to non-technical users, while there’s a greater urgency to connecting capabilities to business growth.

“As technology becomes more user-friendly, employees are also able to do more with less advanced technical skills,” Goldstein and Lobig state. “No-code software development platforms, for instance, let people without a programming background create business-critical prototypes and apps. Plus, as machines take over mundane tasks, people can spend more time on the problem-solving and collaborative work that require stronger people skills.”

“Automating bad processes won’t make them better,” Goldstein and Lobig state. “Break the business down to its essential elements to drive efficiency and deliver real productivity gains.”
The IBM IBV findings map to the views of industry leaders and experts across the spectrum, who agree that those who succeed with AI are those who apply it to business opportunities in a masterful way. “Since this technology is evolving very quickly, it is important for organizations to think in terms of capabilities rather than roles,” says François Candelon, global director of the BCG Henderson Institute.
For example, Candelon continues, “prompt engineering is a highly sought-after role that did not exist a year ago—and may not exist a year from now. What matters most is the organization’s learning capability. The technology is changing much faster than companies are able to adapt.”
With the rise of AI and generative AI, “it’s inevitable that certain job roles will undergo transformation,"" agrees Michael Ringman, CIO at TELUS International. ""As interest in GenAI continues to grow, this technology will create an influx of new jobs, such as data detectives or scientists navigating and uncovering insights from large datasets, prompt engineers crafting instructions for AI systems, and robotics engineers and machine managers overseeing and optimizing AI-powered systems.""
The IBM study anticipates that 15% of executives or senior managers will see an “extreme” or “significant” impact from AI within the next two years, versus 21% of middle management and 17% of first-level management. At least 27% of employees will feel the impact.
The impact may be wide-ranging, and not necessarily negative. “For example, you may choose to use the latest technologies to create a ChatGPT plug-in for your business,” says Candelon. “But, this decision may have unintended consequences as customers are no longer directly coming to your website. To manage these trade-offs, AI initiatives must always draw on a robust understanding of your business and strategy. Moreover, a narrow focus on the technical aspect of AI can alienate other employees and negatively affect their professional identity—to a point where they are reluctant to adopt AI. We’ve found that organizations with employees who personally derive value from AI are five to nine times as likely to get significant financial benefits from AI compared with organizations where employees do not get value from AI.”
The IBM team urges business leaders and managers to see this as a time to “transform traditional processes, job roles, and organizational structures to boost productivity and enable new business and operating models.” In addition, there will be value in building “human-machine partnerships that enhance value creation and employee engagement.” It’s essential to “invest in technology that lets people focus on higher value tasks and drives revenue growth.”
Importantly, while the prospect of AI-driven automation has raised concerns about job displacement, “the role of humans in shaping, implementing and overseeing Gen AI will always remain essential,"" says Ringman. ""Organizations should proactively and carefully explore the opportunities that AI could potentially create for their businesses and employees while considering the needs of society more broadly.""
The crucial capability in the age of AI “is the ability to learn and change faster and continuously,” says Candelon. “As generative AI democratizes the consumption of AI and companies have an opportunity to adopt it with greater breadth and depth, the entire C-suite will need to get involved. The reality is that AI is, above all, a pivotal, multi-faceted technology that deserves to be at the core of an organization’s strategy.""

Generative AI is hyped to disrupt entire industries and GlobalData estimates that the total AI market will be worth $908.7bn in 2023, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from 2022–30.
For the life sciences industry, this means a major shakeup in the workforce and how organisations are structured. Research from consulting firm Accenture suggests that GenAI may affect roughly 50% of life sciences work hours, and half the time currently spent in work activities at a biopharma company will be either automated or augmented.

As organisations shift to accommodate new tools, life science leaders are paying close attention to the areas that the technology can create the highest value.
In an exclusive interview with Medical Device Network, Kenneth Munie, managing director of Accenture Strategy’s life sciences practice, delves into the impact of GenAI. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Catherine Longworth: Can you explain what generative AI is?
Kenneth Munie: Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses machine learning to create content such as text, images, audio, video, design, or software code. It’s not the explanative, descriptive, or predictive AI that we would call classic AI technology – it’s a type of AI that creates things that didn’t exist before.See Also:GE Healthcare buys out Intelligent Ultrasound AI arm How AI is revolutionising medical devices 
CL: What are the use cases for generative AI in life sciences?
KM: It could be something as simple as creating marketing texts or advertising copy from large language models, or it could be something as specific as designing new molecules with generative AI.

For example, Absci achieved a breakthrough approval with its generative AI drug creation and other companies are using the technology for drug discovery. We also see other uses of generative AI to design different modifications to proteins or different protein mutations.
For physicians, generative AI can be used to engage with doctors and patients through conversational AI and the technology can be used to create synthetic data. So, if there’s a rare disease, generative AI can create data based upon patients’ information anonymously. This reduces issues surrounding patient privacy or confidentiality. So, there are many different examples where AI can be used to generate things.
CL: Where across the value chain do you see the technology delivering the most value?
KM: Quite simply, it can deliver value across all parts of the value chain. From product design and development, to manufacturing, commercialisation, supply chain, support, as well as enabling functions such as finance, procurement, legal HR, IT etc.
The basis of Accenture’s research into GenAI was because the technology is new to all industries but has much broader applicability than prior forms of AI. In the past, if you had a task or a question that you needed AI to work on, that was handed over to a group within an organisation that specialised in AI, and they would do their analysis and come back with answers.
Now, we’re seeing the application of GenAI apply to almost everybody in the organisation. The analysis that we did was how will it impact individuals. What’s the application of generative AI or the impact on an individual or roles belonging to different functions?
What we’ve found is that there are two types of impact from generative AI. One is automation, the second is augmentation.
Let’s look at a manufacturing manager – which is a role description that we’ve done analysis for. Generative AI could automate many of the operations within that role. For example, there could be a generative AI agent that summarises information for the marketing manager, and we see that could take up a potential of 30% of the tasks that a marketing manager does in a life sciences company.
The augmentation element could be to look at the usefulness of new products or new technologies in manufacturing, and so generative AI could look at what products and technologies are out there based upon the most recent data, summarise the characteristics of them and their applicability to the specific situation of the marketing manager.
Augmentation is not just about speeding up the task. It’s also about providing more insight or useful insight for the marketing manager to do their job. We see GenAI as impacting around 18.6% of a marketing manager’s role, so overall when you look at it, almost half of that role could be impacted by technology either through automation or augmentation.

CL: What do you see as the limitations of GenAI?
KM: The interesting part is that I don’t believe the limitation is driven by the technology. The limitation is driven by the organisation of talent. For example, if 50% of a marketing manager’s job is impacted by generative AI, what happens next?
If suddenly, 30% of their tasks disappear, what do they fill their time with? The key is the impact must be thought of from an organisational perspective, and it’s a redesign of how that role is established.
You either add more to that role or you reduce the number of roles that you have at that level. Many organisations will need to redesign functions or create new ones. Potentially they could wind up with two different levels of managers – one that oversees all the insight and augmentation, and perhaps a more junior role that oversees all the automation.
The challenge though, is understanding how productivity will impact these roles and creating new or optimised functions. These roles will change to a significant degree, and that’s where we see clients struggling. They get the technology and understand the use case but very few are thinking about how work is reshaped and how that translates into different functions.
CL: How are companies approaching implementation of generative AI within their organisations?
KM: We’ve done surveys of some of our largest clients, and I would say around 20% are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach and this is across all industries. About half or 50% are doing experimentation – so understanding the impact through application and use cases/proofs of concept. Finally, about 30% are taking a top-down C-suite driven approach looking at how to reshape their organisations and reshape distinctive capabilities. It’s a minority of organisations that are thinking this way but if they do it right, these are the companies that gain the most from the technology.
We believe that there is a lot of potential with GenAI but the challenge is getting that impact to turn into financial results. It is not necessarily the tech which will be the hurdle, but the ways of working and how people are organised.
CL: Where is the life sciences world at with adoption of GenAI compared to other industries?
KM: The challenge is always that life sciences is more regulated than other industries, so the implementation of new technologies is generally slower. Of the industries that we cover, we are seeing industrial manufacturers and automotive, large capital-intensive industries, taking the leadership in generative AI for product design and manufacturing applications.
CL: How are workforces currently adapting to the use of these tools?
KM: There have been some studies from Stanford, MIT, and others that have shown that a lot of it is very use-case dependent, but a lot of the early gains or productivity gains have been shown to come from lower experienced workers, meaning taking the lower performers and moving them to average performance and then some smaller boosts to the experienced workers. Overall, this could have implications on company’s talent sourcing strategy and career pathways.
A lot of medical technology clients are at the point where they’re seeing the experience that they have within the organisation ready to retire so it creates an interesting dynamic where these tools might accelerate the growth of new talent within organisations.

The 55-page report surveyed respondents from several countries across multiple roles, adopting a positive stance for AI integration in its outlook.For most job roles in the workforce, the adoption of generative AI would complement the efforts of employees rather than eliminate them. However, the UN agency reports that some roles are more prone to automation than others, with clerical support workers bearing the most risk.Customer service jobs, especially those in Web3, are at a high risk of elimination. During the mass job cuts that plagued the digital currency industry, customer service rolls bore the brunt of the terminations, with over 3,000 professionals losing their jobs.Per the report, travel consultants, bank tellers, clerks, and receptionists could see their roles entirely eliminated due to AI adoption. In terms of gender, the ILO report predicts that women will be the hardest hit of the lot since they make up the bulk of clerical support roles.“3.7 per cent of all female employment in the world is in jobs that are potentially automatable with generative AI technology, compared with only 1.4 per cent of male employment,” read the report.For technicians, sales workers, managers, and elementary occupations, the risk of AI automating their roles stood at less than 5%, with high margins to complement their work processes.Regarding geographical effects, developing countries will be largely unaffected by the integration of generative AI in the workplace. In contrast, developed nations face the largest risks to automation.“Without proper policies in place, there is a risk that only some of the well-positioned countries and market participants will be able to harness the benefits of the transition, while the costs to affected workers could be brutal,” said the ILO.IBM: A chunk of employees will need retrainingA recent report from IBM suggests that 40% of employees in the workforce will require new skill sets to remain competitive in the workplace. Up to 1.4 billion individuals are expected to be affected by the integration of generative AI, with executives urged to invest in the upskilling of talent alongside investment in talent.IBM’s report noted that due to AI, enterprises are rethinking their skill requirements in the workplace, with time management skills being the most sought after while proficiency in STEM is down the pecking order.“As machines take over mundane tasks, people can spend more time on the problem-solving and collaborative work that require stronger people skills,” IBM’s Jill Goldstein and Bill Lobig stated.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Generative AI threatens women's employment more than men's, study finds
9 million men are at risk vs. 21 million women

Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.

In brief: Another study on the impact that generative AI will have on jobs has been published. Mirroring the results of a similar recent report, it concluded that most people will see their positions augmented by the technology as opposed to them becoming automated. However, women and admin workers face the greatest risk of seeing their jobs replaced. 
A new study from the International Labour Organization (ILO) looked at the potential effects generative AI will have on job quantity and quality. The bottom line is that most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented by AI.
Clerical workers were found to be the category with the greatest amount of technical exposure to generative AI. About a quarter of clerical tasks were considered highly exposed, while more than half (58%) had medium-level exposure. The study names typists/word processing operators, travel consultants, scribes, inquiry clerks, contact center information clerks, bank tellers, data entry clerks, and survey and market research interviewers as those whose jobs are most at risk of becoming fully automated.

The risk to clerical workers is a stark contrast to other occupational groups such as professionals, managers, and technicians, who only had a small share of tasks that are greatly exposed, while a quarter of tasks had medium-level exposure.
The study also found that generative AI is likely to impact more women than men. It noted that more than twice the share of female employment is potentially affected by automation, partly due to the higher number of women in clerical work.

ILO estimated that in high-income countries, 7.8% of female jobs (around 21 million) are potentially automatable, while the figure is just 2.9%, or 9 million, for men. Overall, 5.5% of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to automation, whereas in low-income countries, the risk only applies to 0.4% of all employment.

The study, which used the latest GPT-4 large language model that powers ChatGPT, notes that the socioeconomic impacts of generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed. It also warns that the costs to affected workers could be ""brutal.""
ILO's finding mirror a similar report from IBM this week that also predicted generative AI will augment rather than replace jobs. However, the study added that 40% of the global workforce will have to learn new skills over the next three years due to AI implementation, and warned that while AI won't replace people, people who use AI will replace people who don't.

How ChatGPT turned generative AI into an “anything tool”
Until recently, AI models were specialized tools. Modern LLMs are different.

The chief technology officer of a robotics startup told me earlier this year, “We thought we’d have to do a lot of work to build ‘ChatGPT for robotics.’ Instead, it turns out that, in a lot of cases, ChatGPT is ChatGPT for robotics.”
Until recently, AI models were specialized tools. Using AI in a particular area, like robotics, meant spending time and money creating AI models specifically and only for that area. For example, Google’s AlphaFold, an AI model for predicting protein folding, was trained using protein structure data and is only useful for working with protein structures.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

So this founder thought that to benefit from generative AI, the robotics company would need to create its own specialized generative AI models for robotics. Instead, the team discovered that for many cases, they could use off-the-shelf ChatGPT for controlling their robots without the AI having ever been specifically trained for it.
I’ve heard similar things from technologists working on everything from health insurance to semiconductor design. To create ChatGPT, a chatbot that lets humans use generative AI by simply having a conversation, OpenAI needed to change large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 to become more responsive to human interaction.
But perhaps inadvertently, these same changes let the successors to GPT3, like GPT3.5 and GPT4, be used as powerful, general-purpose information-processing tools—tools that aren’t dependent on the knowledge the AI model was originally trained on or the applications the model was trained for. This requires using the AI models in a completely different way—programming instead of chatting, new data instead of training. But it's opening the way for AI to become general purpose rather than specialized, more of an “anything tool.”
Now, an important caveat in a time of AI hype: When I say “general purpose” and “anything tool,” I mean in the way CPUs are general purpose vs, say, specialized signal-processing chips. They are tools that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, not all-powerful and all-knowing. And just like good programmers don’t deploy code to production without code review and unit tests, AI output will need its own processes and procedures. The applications I talk about below are tools for multiplying human productivity, not autonomous agents running amok. But the important thing is to recognize what AI can usefully do. Ars VideoHow Scientists Respond to Science Deniers
So to that end, how did we get here?
Fundamentals: Probability, gradient descent, and fine-tuning
Let’s take a moment to touch on how the LLMs that power generative AI work and how they’re trained.
LLMs like GPT4 are probabilistic; they take an input and predict the probability of words and phrases relating to that input. They then generate an output that is most likely to be appropriate given the input. It’s like a very sophisticated auto-complete: Take some text, and give me what comes next. Fundamentally, it means that generative AI doesn’t live in a context of “right and wrong” but rather “more and less likely.”
Being probabilistic has strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses are well-known: Generative AI can be unpredictable and inexact, prone to not just producing bad output but producing it in ways you’d never expect. But it also means the AI can be unpredictably powerful and flexible in ways that traditional, rule-based systems can’t be. We just need to shape that randomness in a useful way.
Here’s an analogy. Before quantum mechanics, physicists thought the universe worked in predictable, deterministic ways. The randomness of the quantum world came as a shock at first, but we learned to embrace quantum weirdness and then use it practically. Quantum tunneling is fundamentally stochastic, but it can be guided so that particles jump in predictable patterns. This is what led to semiconductors and the chips powering the device you’re reading this article on. Don’t just accept that God plays dice with the universe—learn how to load the dice.
The same thing applies to AI. We train the neural networks that LLMs are made of using a technique called “gradient descent.” Gradient descent looks at the outputs a model is producing, compares that with training data, and then calculates a “direction” to adjust the neural network’s parameters so that the outputs become “more” correct—that is, to look more like the training data the AI is given. In the case of our magic auto-complete, a more correct answer means output text that is more likely to follow the input.
Probabilistic math is a great way for computers to deal with words; computing how likely some words are to follow other words is just counting, and “how many” is a lot easier for a computer to work with than “more right or more wrong.” Produce output, compare with the training data, and adjust. Rinse and repeat, making many small, incremental improvements, and eventually you'll turn a neural network that spits out gibberish into something that produces coherent sentences. And this technique can also be adapted to pictures, DNA sequences, and more.

Generative AI is going to revolutionize the SEO industry, but perhaps not in the way you think.
Yes, your day-to-day job as an SEO will most likely look different in a few years. But are bots going to replace you? 
“Absolutely not,” said Britney Muller, Marketing & SEO Consultant at Data Science 101, and Dave Davies, Amplification Team Lead at Weights and Biases. But there’s no denying the industry is evolving.
So how will generative AI change SEO as a profession and what can you do to stay ahead of the curve? Muller and Davies shared their thoughts on generative AI and the future of SEO at SMX Advanced.
AI is not replacing SEO
Muller was adamant that AI would not be coming for SEO jobs. However, she did note that the industry would have to adapt depending on how Google incorporates AI into search results:

“AI is not the be-all and end-all. In fact, I think the shine will start to wear off as we continue to see the limitations of large language models (LLMs) and how much additional work is required to do things well.”
“LLMs have so many issues that the researchers building this technology have yet to figure out. They are based on a probability distribution and are consistently not factual.”
“Google has done information retrieval very well within search and I think LLMs could be a nice addition to really better define the questions that people have and surface additional information.”

Technical SEOs will have an advantage 
Davies added that technical SEOs may be better positioned to handle the change that generative AI brings than those specializing in content SEO:

“John Mueller from Google said that as long as machines read websites, technical SEO will remain as important as it is. I think that summarizes exactly what sort of world we’re heading into now.” 
“I think technical SEOs are going to have a bit of an advantage – but content SEO will eventually follow. It just just has to change. The structure that they’ll be optimizing for I think will change.”


Links may evolve
Both Davies and Muller agreed that links may change form and not be such a significant ranking factor in the future. Things like mentions or references to a site may become more valuable signals than traditional links. As Davies explained:

“I’m not saying link building is dead, but I think its value is about to be significantly adjusted. It will evolve and might not look like the traditional links that we know and use today – but some version of that instead.”
“Think about the way LLMs are constructed in this linguistic space. They use tokens and they use relationships to make connections. Those things are still very important.”
“The whole mission of neural networks is to establish understanding between different things and so I believe that will still carry weight – but it might not look as specific as links and link building. Perhaps it could be mentions instead? Perhaps it could take the form of something else and just evolve.”

Prompt customization is key
SEOs will need to master prompt customization for AI to deliver the best results, according to Muller. Fine-tuning based on goals and data is crucial vs. a one-size-fits-all approach.

“You really need to customize prompts, learn about prompt engineering and implement those things strategically. I know Andrew Ng just came out with a really great quick and easy course, partnered with Open AI, on that very topic and does a beautiful job explaining those key concepts. So I would definitely check that out,” Muller said. 
“ChatGPT actually has an API that you can use to customize prompts. It makes things a bit easier for the people that I work with, for my teams, for my clients, and it kind of puts the power in their hands as far as here’s how we need to approach this with an iterative process.”

Saving time on content creation
Numerous SEOs are exploring generative AI for content creation, including headlines, product descriptions and articles. There are current concerns with the quality of responses, however, these issues could potentially be resolved over time, as Davies pointed out:

“Generative AI can write quite well. Is it right all the time? No. It’s just a little hack right now. But moving forward, this will speed things up – like with tasks that I was previously doing manually such as looking at what entities were on a page.”
“I still need to use my brain and go OK, [generative AI] missed this and that. I then also need to fact-check. But this saves me probably half an hour per piece of research.”


Search may expand beyond webpages
In the future, search may move beyond webpages into new environments that don’t yet exist on the web today.

“In the next five years, I think we’re just going to see a move into two different sorts of landscapes. I think search will diminish a little bit and move into, I don’t want to say Metaverse, but into different environments that don’t exist right now,” Davies said.

Simplifying code
Muller already uses ChatGPT extensively as a code assistant, highlighting that it’s particularly adept at tasks like generating Python scripts:

“I think it’s important to make note that code in its nature is supposed to be unambiguous, unlike human language, and so generative AI is a lot better, in my opinion, at generating accurate code outputs for things I’m trying to accomplish, whether it be a Python script for a program or just pandas to clean up data. It’s phenomenal at those tasks.”

Judicious use is required
Although generative AI will transform SEO as a profession, careful application is still essential due to the potential for incorrect uses – and this is the reason Muller doesn’t believe that this technology represents the end of SEO as a career. At least not yet.

“Remember, generative AI is a prediction model based on a probability distribution. So if you imagine that it only read let’s say 100 books that were in the realm of sci-fi, and you ask it a medical question, it’s not going to do so well. But it might do really well with generating a new sci-fi character,” Muller said.
“Given that context, generative AI is only as good as the text and information it’s trained on, which is inherently problematic because ChatGPT and LLMs are essentially trained on all of the Internet, which isn’t the best place to grab completely factual information or have representation across marginalized groups of people and topics.”
“These models don’t have emotions. They aren’t reasoning. They don’t have common logic like humans do. And so you have to be really, really, really careful about how you use them, because it’s very easy when you enter a prompt to automate the bias that you already have by the sheer nature of how you ask a question, it’s going to follow that train of thought.”

Celestial bodies have become actors in our myths and folklore. And from the stars and heavens, we draw inspiration and even religion.But the night skies have also taught us how to keep time and coordinate our days and seasons. We have long used the night skies to live our lives more predictably and make our way through the world more purposefully.Job: But we’re not the only ones.I’m Jacob Job, and you’re listening to Scientific American’s Science, Quickly. Today, part four of our five-part series on the Nighttime Bird Surveillance Network—an informal but important global audio dragnet that tracks some of the billions of migratory birds as they fly through the night.Benjamin Van Doren: If you’re lucky, and it’s a clear night, and the moon is illuminated, there are so many birds migrating on average on these nights that if you use a telescope and look at the moon for a few minutes, you’re likely to see a bird high overhead flying and silhouetted in front of the face of the moon.Seeing birds fly in front of the moon or hearing the calls from above, I found really thrilling because it felt like I was tapping into this vast mysterious pulse-of-the-planet phenomenon that was just so much bigger than me.[CLIP:Theme music]Job: Migratory birds navigate to their summer and winter homes by way of the moon and stars. On any given night during migration, there might be thousands of birds flying in the skies above you and tens or hundreds of millions more moving across the continent.We still don’t fully understand the true scope of this mass movement. But now science is turning to machines to unlock the secrets of nocturnal migration.Job: The nighttime bird surveillance network all started with one six-foot sound dish, an expensive studio microphone on reel-to-reel tape and a bunch of hay bales more than 60 years ago. In time, the mics got a lot smaller, and the network grew and grew.Curated by Our EditorsUsing Human-Sized Microphones and Hay Bales, They Unlocked the Mysteries of Bird MigrationJacob JobThey Tap Into the Magical, Hidden Pulse of the Planet, but What is the Nighttime Bird Surveillance Network?Jacob JobDogs’ Visible Emotions Are Muddled by Floppy Ears and Short, Squished FacesLori YoumshajekianThese Animals are Physics WhizzesTom Siegfried & Knowable MagazineToday people all over the world have created a vast, informal network of night sky listeners.Interpreting all of these data, however, has created a new challenge.It’s one that scientists at the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology are tackling head-on.Van Doren: My name is Benjamin Van Doren. I am a scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.Job: Benjamin grew up in New York State and is a postdoctoral research fellow who studies the science of bird migration. His interest in birds goes back a long way, about as far back as his ties to the Lab of Ornithology.Van Doren: I particularly got into birds when I was about eight years old in third grade, and that was thanks to a classroom program that involved watching birds at bird feeders outside the classroom and recording what we saw and actually submitting our data to the ornithologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which I thought was the coolest thing.I was really intrigued by the puzzle of bird identification, that I could learn the tricks to identifying a bird and then be able to put that knowledge to use outside in the real world when I saw a flash of color go by or, later on, heard a sound.Job: During high school, his interest grew deeper.Van Doren: I also started to get really interested in bird migration, and for a bird-watcher, migration is a really exciting period of the year because each day can bring an entirely new set of birds or species to your local park or even your backyard—birds that are in the middle of these long journeys of thousands of miles.Job: But what really sealed Benjamin’s fate as a nighttime bird migration fanatic was a talk he attended at the lab on, you probably guessed it, nocturnal migration.Van Doren: I was captivated by that. And the additional layer of mystery is that songbird migration in large part occurs at night, so it’s also literally shrouded in darkness.Job: He decided to start monitoring birds on his own.Van Doren: I ended up starting a research project in high school that included making audio recordings and looking at radar data. This was a whole nother level of experiencing something that was hidden to so many other people, so I really found that exciting, and I’m still pretty much doing that today.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newslettersJob: And now he’s busy solving the puzzle of how to quickly and accurately analyze thousands of hours and many terabytes of nocturnal migration data.But more people are joining the nighttime surveillance network. More and more data are flying in from nighttime listening stations. Benjamin is one of the few researchers trying to get arms around all of it.And he has a big data problem on his hands.A single night of recording produces anywhere from eight to 12 hours of audio that is about one to three gigabytes in size. And that’s only at one location. Hundreds of people are recording migration all across the U.S. and beyond. Nightly audio intelligence from the network then needs to be combed through to find moments where migratory birds emitted nocturnal flight calls, or NFCs, above the microphone. During especially busy nights, that can mean more than 20,000 NFCs in a single recording from one site.Then comes the problem of deciphering those calls.Van Doren: Flight calls are very short vocalizations. They might last a fifth or even a twentieth of a second, and so it takes a lot of skill and practice to learn how to identify these calls, especially by ear—something I personally don’t feel that confident at. And processing hours and hours of passive audio recordings can be extremely tedious and difficult.Job: And if you’re in the business of studying migratory birds like Benjamin and other scientists at the Lab of Ornithology are, that can get overwhelming.Van Doren: We have hundreds, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of hours of recordings that we may want to analyze, which is just way too much for the small number of skilled humans who can do this sort of thing by hand.So ... we really need computers to do some of the work for us to be able to get any useful, large-scale information out of these long passive audio recordings. And so that’s why we turn to machine learning.Job: Machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, is something we’ve all been hearing a lot about lately. But really, it’s been around for quite some time.Van Doren: Machine learning describes such a vast array of computational tools that it is really everywhere in our lives, everywhere from credit-card-fraud detection to facial recognition to my phone suggesting which apps to open at a certain time of day.Job: I mean, even as I wrote this episode, Google Docs suggested, oftentimes correctly, the next word or phrase I planned on typing. That’s possible because of machine learning. But Benjamin uses a specific type for bird call data.Van Doren: One area of machine learning is computer vision, which we can use to distinguish dogs from cats in pictures, for example—or, in our case, distinguish different birds on audio recordings by feeding the computer not the raw sound itself but actually the visual representation of sound as a spectrogram, really a picture that represents the sound.Job: Basically the spectrograms Benjamin is referring to are visual fingerprints of nocturnal flight call audio.Van Doren: We feed the computer these spectrograms that we’ve classified as one species or another, and then, as we repeat that thousands and thousands of times, the computer learns to be able to distinguish one species from another.Job: So if we want a computer to learn how to identify dogs in pictures, you feed it many thousands of images of different dogs: small ones, large ones, dogs of all colors, dogs in different poses. Eventually, after enough training like this, the computer can recognize if a dog is present in most any picture you present it.Van Doren: If we train our models well enough, it can give us an accurate, or at least useful, estimate of the numbers of birds that were passing overhead, which species they were. And so very quickly, perhaps 300 [times] faster than real time, we can begin to process thousands of hours of audio in an efficient manner with these kinds of tools.Job: If you’re a birder, you may already be familiar with this technology. The Lab of Ornithology added a feature to its Merlin Bird ID app called “Sound ID”.Essentially, if you hear a bird outside and want to know what it is, you can tap this feature in the Merlin app and point your phone’s microphone toward the singing bird. After analyzing the spectrogram of the bird’s song, the app spits out its best guess as to what species of bird is singing in front of you.It’s highly accurate and really useful, kind of like Shazam for birds. I asked Benjamin if people could use this feature to identify NFCs.Van Doren: The tools and underlying technology behind something like Merlin, they can be applied to the flight call problem, this flight call challenge, but as you say it is trickier because there’s less information encoded in a 50-millisecond chip than in [a] several-second song of a Northern Cardinal, for example.So it makes it more difficult for the computer to make the identification accurately, but when you provide enough data, the computer gets good enough that it can hopefully overcome those types of shortcomings.And so one thing that I’m working on right now is trying to take that next step to develop a system based on some of the same technology that underlies Merlin but applied specifically to the challenge of identifying nocturnal flight calls.Job: Benjamin is hopeful this tool will be available in the not too distant future. And by creating such a tool, all of a sudden, the problem of ID’ing hard to identify night calls slowly begins to disappear.And this could help unlock the greatest mysteries of migration.Van Doren: We currently have a poor understanding of what birds are doing at the species level when they’re actively migrating, and flight calls can give us a window into how birds are interacting with the landscape, how they’re interacting with human-dominated areas like cities, and importantly, tell us how different species are behaving differently in response to the environment, to the landscape and also with each other.I think there’s a lot that we have yet to learn about how birds are interacting during migration. They’re saying something up there, and in my view, there’s a lot we don't understand about what exactly they’re communicating as they are participating in these journeys of thousands of miles. So being able to monitor birds at such a large scale will provide us the kind of information we need to make informed conservation decisions going forward.[CLIP: Theme music]Job: And that’s where we’re headed in our final episode on the Nighttime Bird Surveillance Network. We illuminate some of the threats birds face during migration and how scientists are combining weather radar and night call monitoring to aid migratory bird conservation efforts.Kyle Horton: It’s really important for us to monitor those passages, especially in a time where birds are facing many different threats.Things tend to not look amazing for migratory birds right now.Job: Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Kelso Harper.Don’t forget to subscribe to Science, Quickly.

There’s been quite a bit of buzz over the past year about generative artificial intelligence (A.I.), especially in the context of chatbots like ChatGPT. Tech professionals are experimenting with this new technology and, in many cases, figuring out how to integrate it into their respective companies’ tech stacks.

But which generative A.I. skills and tools are most in demand? The answer can help tech professionals adjust their training and potentially land more job interviews. According to Upwork’s latest analysis of the generative A.I. market, the top 10 generative A.I.-related job searches from companies included, in descending order:


ChatGPT
BERT
Stable Diffusion
TensorFlow
A.I. Chatbot
Generative A.I.
Image Processing
PyTorch
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Bard


This analysis took place between January and June 2023. “OpenAI continues to see a first-mover advantage with ChatGPT, including its underlying models GPT-3 and GPT-4, at the top of the list of generative AI-related search terms from those looking to hire, followed by BERT and Stable Diffusion,” Upwork added in a note accompanying the data.

“Many of the skills with the largest quarter-over-quarter growth in searches indicate a shift from singular generative AI tools toward generative AI applications and services, including A.I. content creation, Azure OpenAI, and prompt engineering,” the note continued.

For tech professionals everywhere, gaining baseline knowledge of generative A.I. seems increasingly essential. From there, it’ll only pay to master tools and frameworks such as ChatGPT, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. It’s a good get that A.I. will fundamentally change many tech jobs in the years to come; after all, it’s already having a sizable impact on software development.

While the number of A.I.-related jobs is still relatively small and concentrated in a few key areas, expect mentions of the technology to proliferate in job postings. Companies everywhere want tech specialists who can make apps, services, and backend infrastructure “smarter” through the use of machine learning and A.I.

Certain projections hint at the potential loss of hundreds of millions of jobs, underscoring the transformation of professions and the need for swift and strategic adaptations by organizations to ensure their survival. Curiously, despite being at the forefront of technology, high-tech employees seem to underestimate the scale of this change. A mere 51% of workers in the tech sector believe that the rapid advancements in AI have minimal or no influence on their company's strategies. This data originates from Alignment Labs, a technology startup collecting unique insights into the high-tech industry's trends. A scant 10% perceive a significant impact from artificial intelligence, and a mere 2% consider it central to their strategy. Notably, individuals in management positions tend to better comprehend AI's implications. Distinctions emerge between those in technical and non-technical roles. Employees in less technical positions such as Operations, QA, or Customer Success predominantly report negligible impact. Responses from developers fluctuate based on their specific roles. Algorithm engineers appear less concerned about the impact compared to Full Stack developers who regard these technological advancements as notably influential.   Alon Blum, Co-founder and CPO at Alignment Labs, notes, ""The sense of security among technology workers, even an innocent one, isn't surprising. We witnessed a similar pattern in the tech industry during the economic crisis and market bubble burst. After the crisis, tech workers, especially the youth who hadn't experienced a crisis before, remained complacent. Our data indicated that 82% of the workers in the industry believed the economic situation wouldn't affect them or their companies, right before widespread layoffs."" Blum suggests that managers are likely more exposed to strategic discussions, enhancing their understanding of the technological leap's consequences. He highlights, ""Although certain companies might remain untouched by AI's impact on strategy, many employees remain complacent. They perceive it as distant, irrelevant for now. In reality, hardly any company dealing with deep tech remains unimpacted by AI strategically. This complacency is irrational."" He adds, ""Oddly, tech-savvy individuals adopt new tools less because they grasp how they work."" In other industries, the situation isn't much better. A Salesforce survey of over 4,000 employees globally reveals that 56% believe generative AI will fundamentally change their jobs, and 62% anticipate that these tools will demand different skill sets. Employees anticipate that generative AI will enable them to focus on strategic tasks and save time. 65% believe it will permit concentration on strategic work, potentially saving five weekly work hours—equivalent to a month annually for full-time staff. The latent potential of AI tools remains largely untapped. While 54% of workers believe generative AI will propel their careers forward, 62% admit to lacking the skills required for effective and safe technology utilization. Moreover, the survey underscores a gap between employee aspirations to learn and their companies' provision of skill improvement opportunities. Approximately 40% of workers express uncertainty about effectively employing generative AI at work. 43% admit lacking knowledge about leveraging generative AI with trusted data sources while upholding first-party data security. Furthermore, 53% struggle to maximize the potential of generative AI. Most managers (70%) share the sentiment that employees lack the necessary skills for effective and secure generative AI use.      From an employer perspective, managers perceive tangible advantages in bridging the AI skills gap for organizational cost savings. A significant 82% believe that generative AI will lower overall business expenses, while 80% assert that it will contribute to revenue growth. ""Generative artificial intelligence offers significant opportunities for both organizations and employees. As it becomes increasingly recognized and discussed as a powerful tool within the workplace, the skills gap is likely to widen,"" states Illy Ben Haim, Human Resources Director at Salesforce Israel. ""Today, companies bear the responsibility of furnishing the essential tools and strategies to facilitate swift adaptation. Organizations need to adjust to this new capability by defining their trajectory and establishing a learning framework equipped to manage perceptual shifts and employee cognitive patterns. (How can artificial intelligence capabilities be integrated into roles without rendering them obsolete? What skills can be cultivated in the era of artificial intelligence to support ongoing personal development?) Furthermore, they must establish clarity concerning evolving roles in the age of artificial intelligence applications.""",[],"{'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews', 'name': 'CTech'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/category/5220', 'name': 'News'}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 With the online world obsessing about chatbots, some AI (artificial intelligence) phrases are entering the mainstream conversation. One of those is large language models or LLMs, and you can't read about OpenAI or chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard for long without running into it. But outside of computer science, not many people know what this technology is.

 Large language models power the AI chatbot tech that's getting so much discussion these days. And whether you're eager to see if AI can help you write an email on your Android (it probably already is) or are worried about students cheating with chatbots (there's a lot to unpack there), it's important to understand how they work. So let's dive into the mathematical morass that's large language models and see what's going on! 


 What are large language models (LLMs)? 
    






 These models, which are based on machine learning and neural network technology, analyze and label different parts of a language so that they can ""talk"" like a person. Or, in ChatGPT's case (and the other GPT family like GPT-3 and GPT-4), imitate different tones and conversations, and some are better than others. This is part of the natural language processing or NLP discipline. Large language models are a key part of the chatbot AI and are built to continue learning as long as they can process more examples of human language. 

 LLMs don't learn grammar like humans do. Instead, they follow a unique process that labels different parts — say, words in a sentence — so LLMs can make a good mathematical guess at how to write or talk. With enough study, these deep learning models can make a good guess, good enough to imitate a college essay or a helpful customer service representative.

 LLMs are inherently complex, and we don't have the time to give an entire college course on them (although that would be fun). Instead, let's break down some of their important parts and how these machine-learning models work. 

 Tokenization 
 Tokenization is the process of turning everyday human language into sequences that LLMS can understand, a part of natural language processing. That involves assigning sections (usually words or parts of words) number values and encoding them for rapid analysis. Think of it like the AI way of teaching phonetics. Tokenization's goal is to create context vectors, which are like cheat sheets or formulas for the AI to guess how a sentence goes. 

 The more the AI studies language and gets information about how language fits together, the better guesses it can make about what words come next in certain kinds of sentences. Add that together over and over again, and you get models that can reproduce different ways humans talk on the internet. 






 Transformer models 
 A transformer model is a neural network that analyzes sequential data and looks for signs about how that data fits together, like which words are most likely to follow other words. These models are made of blocks or layers, each focusing on a different type of analysis to help understand what words fit together and what words don't. Sometimes, they get their own names, like the open source BERT. They form foundation models that are the basis for all LLMs. 

 Credit for transformer creation is generally given to Google's engineers in the late 2010s. As mentioned above, transformer models don't learn a language. Instead, they use algorithms to understand how humans write words. Feed a transformer model a bunch of hipster blogs about coffee, and it quickly learns how to write a generic hipster piece about coffee. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning give the model feedback about when it's wrong. Transformer models are the foundation of LLM language generation, and they can be increasingly complex depending on their purpose, so complex that they need lots of servers to hold the large-scale model. 





 Their creators devise creative ways to classify words so that the models understand how they work. For example, positional encoding embeds the order of words in sentences so that the model always knows what order they come in, even if words are provided randomly. Attention mechanisms like self-attention assign more importance to some parts of sentences than others, allowing the models to recognize what humans emphasize when writing. 

 Prompts 
 Prompts are the inputs that developers give LLMs to tokenize and analyze, basically training data for different use cases. Prompts can be nearly anything. For chatbots, for example, prompts are tons of online writing, essays, articles, and books (which is why some authors are suing). The more prompts an LLM gets in the training process, the better it can predict the next word and create sentences. That's because language, especially the casual language used by humans online, is redundant and frequently predictable. 






 Prompts also influence how the AI sounds and responds to things, which can cause trouble. Many of us remember that one of Microsoft's early attempts at online AI was quickly shut down after it became a Nazi because its prompts were from Twitter users. Choosing the proper prompts for a deep learning AI is essential. Services like ChatGPT try to cast a wide net while providing important parameters about what not to include. Lots of fine-tuning is involved, and frequent tweaks to learning algorithms help AI models learn how to treat data or perform specific tasks. 



 Chatbots use large language models, right? Is that a good thing?

 Today's new AI chatbots do, it's how they generate text and answer questions. Basic chatbots, like those found on brand website pop-ups or Facebook stores, don't use this technology and barely qualify as AI in many cases. But services like the family of GPTs, Google's Bard, Bing AI, Pi, and others use different kinds of LLMs. A growing number of apps use simpler models to imitate human speech, like the latest therapy apps (with mixed results). 

 By this point, you may be wondering if LLMs are responsible for AI-generated art from things like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. Basically, yes, visually generative AI are versions of LLMs. They use similar models to look at visual aspects instead of written language. That's how they can roughly understand objects, subjects, and different art styles. 

 But art and text data aren't the only things LLMs are useful for. These are just the beginning. State-of-the-art AI systems are learning molecular structures and protein sequencing in the same way, which helps scientists and pharmaceutical companies discover new solutions. They're handling minor coding tasks and metadata work to make websites better and more accessible. And general-purpose models are helping humans communicate better in different languages. Even everyday uses, like summarizing long reports for busy readers, have large-scale advantages. 







 Are large language models dangerous? 
    

 Dangerous in the sense that they're going to create murderbots to take over Earth? No. They're also probably not going to take over many jobs unless those jobs are simple and repetitive. For LLMs, context is difficult. They can't easily understand new information and can never reflect on what to say before saying it. 

 Still, these models have other issues that can make them dangerous. Most issues boil down to a few root causes: 






 They can spread disinformation or biased opinions: LLMs and their chatbots don't know if the information is accurate. They only know, in a literal way, what they've been told and how to repeat it in different ways. Chatbots have been caught spreading disinformation and been accused of political bias, among other problems. It's hard to create a large language model with internet information that doesn't run into disinformation issues. And sometimes, LLM-powered chatbots produce fake information, including fake financial numbers for corporations and fake cases for lawyers. AI developers sometimes call these hallucinations, and it's hard to optimize them away. 

 They can allow dangerous behavior: You may have heard the stories about how ChatGPT's grandma exploit had granny giving away illegal keys to licensed software or telling you how to make napalm, despite filters to prevent behavior like this. When a large language model consumes enough information, it can teach you how to do about anything, and for today's chatbots, that can include a lot of Dark Web stuff. So far, creators haven't found an effective way to stop it entirely. 






 They're a privacy risk: The massive datasets fed into large language models can also contain some sensitive information, including your information. That includes info about you that's easy to find online or on public social. It can even include conversations you've had online or online activity that advertisers use. Since LLM AIs are new, there's not much robust privacy protection preventing this. 

 They're energy hogs: LLMs are huge and consume a ton of energy. That's bad news for companies trying to lower their carbon footprints, and leads to many associated environmental costs. 

 They don't have any ethics: People can use tools like ChatGPT to create almost anything they want. Now, schools need new ways to detect fake AI essays. People can ask ChatGPT to generate insulting or hateful content or ask it to impersonate someone for catfishing, blackmail, or other purposes. It may even write code for malware or whip up fake research about why vaccines don't work. These are issues that can't be solved with a simple filter, and we're only beginning to see the ramifications. 








 Plotting the future of technology with LLMs 
 Large language models use advanced AI tools to categorize language (or other data) in such a way that lets them understand how humans communicate. That's largely influenced by the parameters set and the prompts fed into LLMs, which is how tools like ChatGPT are formed. 

 The future of LLMs can seem scary and for a good reason. But despite the pitfalls this new technology creates, LLMs have many powerful and positive uses. We have a lot to learn about how to use them, how to structure them so that they're safe to use, and how to feed them the correct prompts. Deepfakes and essay cheats are only a couple of the results when we get things wrong. Welcome to the wild west of language-based AI. It's going to be quite a ride.

Generative AI models are all the rage these days, so it's easy to get caught up in the hype and fall short of delivering real value. The only way to make these emerging models deliver more value is to measure what matters to your organization and improve on the results.







The trouble is that there are many ways to quantify generative AI initiatives and models, from performance and accuracy to precision, utility and ROI. Agreeing on the appropriate metrics upfront can mean the difference between a costly experiment and bottom-line value.
Enterprises should focus on two key types of metrics for generative AI, according to Christine Livingston, a managing director in the emerging technology practice at Protiviti. The first type is related to the performance of the model itself, such as response time, precision and accuracy. These measures should also be considered in the context of the use cases and capabilities a model requires.
The second type of metric is the value delivered. ""It is important to establish an anticipated benchmark for generative AI, such as reducing the time and effort spent to perform tasks, increasing throughput, or increasing demand generation,"" Livingston said. These metrics inform the enterprise of where and when to invest further in generative AI initiatives and ensure models continue to deliver value over time.

Customize metrics for specific use cases
Quantifying the performance of generative AI models can be challenging due to the vast number of use cases, said Buddhi Jayatilleke, chief data scientist at Sapia, a human resources AI platform. And the performance of LLMs can be defined in different ways across the development lifecycle. Various metrics provide more value across pre-training, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback processes.
""The gold standard for evaluating generative models often involves human judgment, but this can be costly and slow, particularly at scale,"" Jayatilleke said. One approach is to use human evaluation sparingly and strategically, perhaps to validate and calibrate automated metrics. It's also helpful to set up feedback loops to learn from users, and to keep abreast of the latest research on new evaluation benchmark data sets to add to the automated tests.
Metrics can vary by the job function and service offered, said Todd Johnson, president of U.S. enterprise applications at Nexer Group, an IT services and consulting firm. Customer service scenarios can use traditional metrics such as customer retention, customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score. Productivity scenarios can be more difficult to measure directly. For example, the task completion rate needs to be balanced against work quality measures.
Johnson recommends carefully rolling out new tools or models by creating test groups to provide baselines and evaluate different tools. ""Ultimately, it's still going to be a human decision as to whether these tools make us better at our job or not,"" he said.


Areas to be evaluated with generative AI metrics
Here are eight areas -- and some of their metrics and benchmarks -- that should be tracked and evaluated to gauge the success of enterprise generative AI programs and projects.
1. ROI
From a financial perspective, measuring ROI helps determine if and how a machine learning (ML) program or project delivers meaningful value. But this value can come from various benefits such as increased sales, profits, productivity or customer engagement. ""Many generative AI-based projects in organizations are still in the research stage, making it hard to predict their exact value,"" said Matan Libis, vice president of products at SQream, a data preparation platform for ML.
Libis recommends setting clear KPIs for success and allocating a sufficient budget for research.
2. Goal completions
Measuring goal completions, which reflect how many tangible and desirable business outcomes a model achieves, is another way to evaluate generative AI achievements, according to Israel Krush, CEO and co-founder at conversational AI platform Hyro.
For example, in an app that helps patients schedule physician appointments, Hyro measures how many such appointments the app handled end-to-end. Developing a new measure for each use case can show when it's delivering value. ""It's never been easier to add a fun and engaging chatbot to your website,"" Krush said, ""but if you don't really understand what it's there for, what's the point of having it?""
3. Fidelity
Another empirical method to gauge the success of generative AI-based systems in organizations is fidelity, which assesses the similarity between generated output and real data. A high fidelity score indicates the model's proficiency in producing realistic and accurate results. Libis said this aspect is critical for building trust in this technology, as both organizations and their customers rely on these models to serve them faithfully and avoid misinterpretation.
However, achieving maximum ROI and fidelity together might not always be possible. Sometimes, improving one can come at the cost of the other. Libis has found it helpful to build a shared understanding of the application's specific requirements to strike the right balance between ROI and fidelity based on project goals and priorities.
4. Task performance
It's also helpful to assess task performance, Jayatilleke said. This area looks at how well the model responds to a given prompt, such as summarizing some text, solving a math problem or performing common-sense reasoning. A task-specific benchmark data set and related metrics can help evaluate how well the model performs against the benchmark.
Jayatilleke often uses the Massive Multitask Language Understanding, or MMLU, benchmark that covers subjects across STEM, the humanities, social sciences and more, ranging from an elementary to advanced professional level. Other relevant metrics include the following:

Generation consistency, which measures whether similar prompts in the same context can lead to almost semantically similar responses.
Prompt sensitivity, which measures how detailed a prompt needs to be to get the optimal response from the LLM.

5. Safety
Safety metrics help test for risks such as ethical concerns about generative AI, truthfulness, toxicity and security. This can include measuring the prevalence of racially biased responses, AI hallucinations or leaks of confidential information. Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA can complement human expert testing. Running multiple automated tests covering various concerns is the best practice, according to Jayatilleke. But as the training data and training parameters change, these benchmarks might not be able to capture the new learnings of the model.
6. Personality
At Sapia, Jayatilleke's team set up their own metrics to assess the personality projected by the different versions of the OpenAI GPT models. Their metrics related to personality dimensions or the emotional intelligence of the generative AI models that power chatbots to help better understand and compare their behavior. They found significant differences between GPT-2, ChatGPT -- built on GPT-3.5 -- and GPT-4. This research helped them establish a baseline that could be used to evaluate how further adjustments to these models affect interactions with users.
7. Accuracy
Accuracy measures how well a model's predictions or outputs align with the desired results, which is not always easy to assess. ""LLMs, in general, have an accuracy problem, and no one has been able to determine a standard method for evaluating an LLM's quality in this regard,"" said Yonatan Geifman, CEO and co-founder of Deci, a deep learning development platform.
It's often easier to assess accuracy in domains such as coding using benchmarks including the HumanEval database. In other domains, there are multiple evaluation methods to choose from, including the following:

Perplexity is a metric that evaluates a language model's ability to predict the next word in a word sequence.
Inception score, or IS, is a mathematical algorithm that measures the quality of generative AI images.
Fréchet inception distance, or FID, analyzes images generated by generative adversarial networks for realism and diversity.
Precision is a metric that measures the number of correct predictions made by a generative AI model.
Recall details the ratio of positive samples classified by a model as positive vs. the total number of positive samples generated.
F1 score measures an AI model's accuracy using the precision and recall factors.
Bilingual evaluation understudy, or BLEU, is a metric used to automatically evaluate machine-translated text against reference text.
Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation, or ROUGE, measures the quality of a machine-translated summary against one created by a human.
Metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering, or METEOR, scores machine translations based on word-to-word matching against a reference translation.
Consensus-based image description evaluation, or CIDEr, measures a machine-generated sentence against human-generated information that is known to be real and true.
Manual evaluation is when a human compares machine-generated results on a case-by-case basis.

It's also common to ask users to count the number of likes or suggestions they accept.
The more significant challenge, Geifman said, lies not in choosing which metrics to use, but in selecting the appropriate evaluation data sets on which to apply these metrics. Inaccuracies are being discovered in some of the most commonly used data sets for evaluation. There are also concerns that large models such as GPT-4 were exposed to these evaluation data sets during training, and therefore they cannot be used as an objective evaluation data set.
8. Inference speed
Inference speed quantifies the model's performance in terms of speed and efficiency at runtime.
The latency of the model is typically measured in iterations per second, which directly affects the inference cost of the model. Lower latency leads to reduced compute cost, a smaller carbon footprint and an improved overall user experience. ""It is important to consider model speed early in the process, as slow inference performance can become a major barrier for business scalability and operational cost efficiency,"" Geifman said.


Challenges in setting up a metrics program
It's important to note that many challenges can arise when setting up a metrics program for generative AI models. Some of these top challenges, according to Doug Ross, vice president and head of insights and data at Sogeti, part of Capgemini, include the following:
Subjectivity
Generative models often create outputs, such as text or images, meant to be consumed and interpreted by humans. Human evaluation is subjective, and individuals might disagree as to the quality of the result. This can make it difficult to establish a benchmark or baseline for evaluation. One way to overcome this is to crowdsource using multiple human evaluators to assess the results.
Bias
Models can mimic or even amplify biases in training data or methods, which can have ethical consequences. Monitoring for bias is an important step, and more diverse training data sets are helpful. A 2023 Capgemini Research Institute report, ""Harnessing the Value of Generative AI: Top Use Cases Across Industries,"" found that 51% of surveyed organizations cited a lack of clarity on underlying training data as a challenge stalling generative AI implementations.
Scalability
As models and data sets grow, the computational power and attendant expenses can also increase. Efficiency and financial metrics can help plan for and address scalability challenges.
Attacks
Some models are susceptible to attacks, such as jailbreaks, that leak information or provide unwanted outputs. Red team testing of models is helpful to determine if additional safeguards are needed.
Selecting the right metrics
Given the various ways to gauge model accuracy, performance and efficiency, choosing the right metrics becomes a key factor in a production deployment.
Monitoring
Continuous checks of model output will help ensure the model does not drift or that answers do not change over time. This can be done with automated testing and human oversight.


The future of generative AI metrics
Tools to assess performance and benefits are a work in progress. Experts expect to see advances on many fronts.
Veracity can be a challenging, if not impossible, metric to establish for LLMs, Livingston observed. She predicts significant developments in the ability to monitor and measure the authenticity and veracity of responses and outputs to determine drift and bias movements.
Libis expects to see more progress on explainability and interpretability metrics, while Jayatilleke believes it is time to consider better metrics to measure the carbon footprint of training generative models. It will also be important to develop metrics to assess the contamination of future training data sets with AI-generated content as those become ubiquitous, he said.
Johnson predicts that additional telemetry will become part of generative AI tool sets to provide detailed data on how the AI model is used. It will also provide insight into how the model is performing and guidance on where there is room for improvement.
Ross expects to see improved performance evaluation metrics that better capture model accuracy and generalized performance. Some promising new metrics include precision and recall; FID+, an enhancement on the Fréchet inception distance algorithm; and learned perceptual image patch similarity, or LPIPS, distance.
""A combination of better evaluation techniques, more diverse training data sets and transparent architectures are likely to be among the directions used in improving objective measures of model performance,"" Ross said.

PT Staff: How is generative AI reshaping the healthcare landscape?



Deborah Weinswig: Right now,what we're seeing is that it's having dramatic impact in terms of how people think. And when you start to look at it from a kind of healthcare provider perspective, that's where we're actually seeing some of the biggest changes now.



And if you think about whether it's around imaging, whether it's around clinical trials, I mean, it is having, I think, much more of an impact than anybody ever would have expected in healthcare specifically. And you start to think about how you can engage with a customer in a physical store. And we're starting to see AI move onto devices. And so this idea that you have that kind of compute power, literally in the palm of your hand, and you can start to really think differently about how you don't have to know everything, you'd have to have the prompt to get the answer. And so, you can take care of customers and I think there's an immediacy. And there's also a kindness now; I find it's expected because when you have a prompt and you ask a question, it's responding very kindly. And so, if you kind of just cut and paste as opposed to adding in your own voice, it's talking in a very nice way. And so, this whole idea that, whether it's at the beginning of the lifecycle in terms of raw materials all the way to consumption, generative AI plays a role today. And we're seeing a lot of experiments that are being run. But I think that some of those are actually turning into full blown impact on organizations. Right now, we're actually seeing more of an impact in healthcare specifically, [which is] kind of moving over into like retail pharmacy clinics and obviously the doctor's office as well, and ultimately, I think [it will impact] the relationship that people have with the consumer.



PT Staff: What factors influence the economic argument for generative AI?



Deborah Weinswig: Economics is really what it always boils down to. And if you think about it, we had Metaverse and Web3 a year ago. And that was easy because companies would develop a non-fungible token (NFT) that had value in terms of being able to be sold, and there was an immediate kind of revenue stream—very clear and concise. And there's also the opportunity to talk to the consumers about what you were doing. You could see it. It's digital, but you'd have it in your phone or whatnot [and] you can send it to people.



The challenge, and sometimes with generative AI, is that you can't really see it, you just have to kind of understand it. And so I do think that in some cases, what we're seeing is that it really is the most senior people in the organization who are making some of these decisions because there's this inability to see what it can do. But if you start to think about it:



[First], I'd look at demand forecasting and do a much better job of understanding generative AI. Take when we talked about drug shortages. There are shortages of all kinds of things right now (i.e. take going to the store and facing organized retail crime) [which shows that] there are other things that are driving [drug shortages]. [Generative AI] can do a better job with demand forecasting, number 1.



Secondly, [generative AI can provide] better data and better insights (around retail media networks) so that those retailers who have the traffic, whether it's online or offline, are being properly rewarded. That's significant.



Third, if you start to think about being able to monetize [generative AI], whether it's the anonymization of your consumer data, or anonymiz[ing] some of the other data in your organization. And then, besides that, you can monetize your internet protocol (IP). So, there's now these other revenue streams, whether you are a healthcare provider or whether you're a retailer with your brand, that didn't even really exist 12 months ago.



And so, I think deciding where to start, that's where some of the (I'd say) frustration is. So, I think you just must make a move. Run a few experiments and see what works. If you're also, let's say, not an international company, in some ways it's easier because where you're experimenting is going to be somewhat homogeneous. What we're seeing is a lot of companies that are global are having greater challenges making some of these decisions, because how does this translate outside of the home market? What is the cost of running these large language models? And there are other factors that come into play on the economic side.



But I think that ultimately, we're going to see fewer hours required to do basic tasks— this may [increase] the ability to drive employee engagement and reduce turnover because people are going to enjoy their jobs more. And then I think that ultimately, the numbers we're seeing is that employees are getting back about 33% to 40% of their time. And so, one of the questions that we've been grappling with is, “Are employers going to think about assigning them more tasks? Or are they going to be able to figure out kind of how to use that time to fill in some of what they're doing, and also maybe spend time learning new things to do?”





PT Staff: How can generative AI be used to stay on top of emerging market trends/overcome obstacles in pharmacy?



Deborah Weinswig: So personally, [I’m] somebody who spent a lot of time thinking about adherence and the challenges that we face, especially as somebody who's had aging parents an have had to worry about these [things], such as “I’ve laid out all the boxes for them, but do they know what time is it [so they take their medications on time]? Did they did they go down [the pillbox rows] instead of across? How do I make sure?”



So this idea that [generative AI] can now help with adherence to me, [reflects how it can] impact outcomes and impact our health immediately. And in starting to think about some of these other things—[especially} because generative AI has almost a sensing mechanism—It’s this idea that before running out of your prescription, a new one is delivered to you (obviously you're opting into that), number 1, and number 2 is this idea that, let's say, the efficacy isn't there and you're having some kind of reaction [to the drug]? Your ability to then get the kind of medication at the right time and let’s say in the right kind of form factor is also really critical.



Three, the ability to reach out to someone; I mean, there are these chatbots and they are becoming increasingly intelligent. And so this idea that they can answer questions for you about how to take your medication, if you're seeing any contraindications or if you have any kind of reaction, it’s this idea that you have a kind of partner almost who is there every step of the way. You have your doctor, obviously, and you have your healthcare system. But this is also then removing some of the burden for everyday questions. And chat boxes can also do higher level work if you will. They can be more proactive, and it frees up the pharmacist’s time from a lot of the more maintenance aspect of their jobs.



And one thing to think about, if we start to think about clinics and if you think about the future of pharmacy is— we talked about this idea before we started the official interview— around food prescriptions. In many kinds of pharmacy situations is a wide assortment of food. And so the idea that, not only can I get advice from a pharmacist that is really personalized, you can call it precision medicine, or personalization at scale. But, there's this idea that not only are you getting the right medication for yourself at the right time, [but] you're getting great advice from the pharmacist… who can start to talk to you about some of what you're eating and how you're eating it, how you're feeling and whatnot, and provide advice. And I think this idea that we start to look at the whole human, if you will, the whole customer in a different way than we've been able to before, I think that we are on the precipice of that. They can save the healthcare system a lot of money and a lot of time and have much better outcomes.",,,,en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marketing and Sales Leaders Want More Generative AI in Their Work [Chart]



Eric Hal Schwartz  on August 25, 2023 at 4:00 pm


Marketing and sales leaders are feeling cautious enthusiasm about deploying generative AI within their organizations, according to a McKinsey study. The consultant group found that respondents saw moderate potential value across potential applications in areas like lead generation, campaign optimization, and personalized outreach. That said, significant gaps remain between interest and implementation, as can be seen in the chart above.
The survey came back with a whopping 90% of respondents saying they believe their teams should utilize generative AI and machine learning techniques often or very often. This aligns with estimates that marketing and sales functions stand to gain the most economic value from deploying AI systems. The numbers in the chart point to ongoing interest in applying generative AI more often than is currently done. That said, a full 60% said their organizations rarely or never do this. Recognizing this potential may be why 85% said they rarely or never use generative AI. It demonstrates the disconnect between eagerness to adopt AI and real-world rollout.
Survey participants were most excited about employing generative AI during the early stages of the customer journey. Lead identification, marketing optimization, and personalized outreach hold the most appeal compared to other use cases. The appeal stems from capabilities like processing vast datasets to identify high-potential leads, rapidly generating tailored messaging and creative content, and automating communication at scale. As seen in data gathered by McKinsey and other researchers, the perceived economic impact of generative AI is enormous, and a rapidly growing number of companies are eager to pursue the technology in any form that might benefit them.

An explosion of interest in generative AI and its chatbot applications has sparked fears over job destruction, similar to those that emerged when the moving assembly line was introduced in the early 1900s and after mainframe computers in the 1950s.

However, the study produced by the International Labour Organisation concludes that: “Most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI.”
This means that “the most important impact of the technology is likely to be of augmenting work”, it adds.
The occupation likely to be most affected by GenAI – capable of generating text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models and other data – is clerical work, where about a quarter of tasks are highly exposed to potential automation, the study says.
But most other professions, like managers and sales workers, are only marginally exposed, it said.
Still, the UN agency’s report warned that the impact of generative AI on affected workers could still be “brutal”.
“Therefore, for policymakers, our study should not read as a calming voice, but rather as a call for harnessing policy to address the technological changes that are upon us,” it said.

This FallStep 1: Assume all students are going to use the technology.Share full article143Read in app Credit...Víctor ArceBy Kevin RooseAug. 24, 2023Leer en españolLast November, when ChatGPT was released, many schools felt as if they’d been hit by an asteroid.In the middle of an academic year, with no warning, teachers were forced to confront the new, alien-seeming technology, which allowed students to write college-level essays, solve challenging problem sets and ace standardized tests.Some schools responded — unwisely, I argued at the time — by banning ChatGPT and tools like it. But those bans didn’t work, in part because students could simply use the tools on their phones and home computers. And as the year went on, many of the schools that restricted the use of generative A.I. — as the category that includes ChatGPT, Bing, Bard and other tools is called — quietly rolled back their bans.Ahead of this school year, I talked with numerous K-12 teachers, school administrators and university faculty members about their thoughts on A.I. now. There is a lot of confusion and panic, but also a fair bit of curiosity and excitement. Mainly, educators want to know: How do we actually use this stuff to help students learn, rather than just try to catch them cheating?I’m a tech columnist, not a teacher, and I don’t have all the answers, especially when it comes to the long-term effects of A.I. on education. But I can offer some basic, short-term advice for schools trying to figure out how to handle generative A.I. this fall.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFirst, I encourage educators — especially in high schools and colleges — to assume that 100 percent of their students are using ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools on every assignment, in every subject, unless they’re being physically supervised inside a school building.At most schools, this won’t be completely true. Some students won’t use A.I. because they have moral qualms about it, because it’s not helpful for their specific assignments, because they lack access to the tools or because they’re afraid of getting caught.But the assumption that everyone is using A.I. outside class may be closer to the truth than many educators realize. (“You have no idea how much we’re using ChatGPT,” read the title of a recent essay by a Columbia undergraduate in The Chronicle of Higher Education.) And it’s a helpful shortcut for teachers trying to figure out how to adapt their teaching methods. Why would you assign a take-home exam, or an essay on “Jane Eyre,” if everyone in class — except, perhaps, the most strait-laced rule followers — will use A.I. to finish it? Why wouldn’t you switch to proctored exams, blue-book essays and in-class group work, if you knew that ChatGPT was as ubiquitous as Instagram and Snapchat among your students?Second, schools should stop relying on A.I. detector programs to catch cheaters. There are dozens of these tools on the market now, all claiming to spot writing that was generated with A.I., and none of them work reliably well. They generate lots of false positives, and can be easily fooled by techniques like paraphrasing. Don’t believe me? Ask OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, which discontinued its A.I. writing detector this year because of a “low rate of accuracy.”It’s possible that in the future, A.I. companies may be able to label their models’ outputs to make them easier to spot — a practice known as “watermarking” — or that better A.I. detection tools may emerge. But for now, most A.I. text should be considered undetectable, and schools should spend their time (and technology budgets) elsewhere.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMy third piece of advice — and the one that may get me the most angry emails from teachers — is that teachers should focus less on warning students about the shortcomings of generative A.I. than on figuring out what the technology does well.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.Last year, many schools tried to scare students away from using A.I. by telling them that tools like ChatGPT are unreliable, prone to spitting out nonsensical answers and generic-sounding prose. These criticisms, while true of early A.I. chatbots, are less true of today’s upgraded models, and clever students are figuring out how to get better results by giving the models more sophisticated prompts.As a result, students at many schools are racing ahead of their instructors when it comes to understanding what generative A.I. can do, if used correctly. And the warnings about flawed A.I. systems issued last year may ring hollow this year, now that GPT-4 is capable of getting passing grades at Harvard.Alex Kotran, the chief executive of the AI Education Project, a nonprofit that helps schools adopt A.I., told me that teachers needed to spend time using generative A.I. themselves to appreciate how useful it could be — and how quickly it was improving.“For most people, ChatGPT is still a party trick,” he said. “If you don’t really appreciate how profound of a tool this is, you’re not going to take all the other steps that are going to be required.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are resources for educators who want to bone up on A.I. in a hurry. Mr. Kotran’s organization has a number of A.I.-focused lesson plans available for teachers, as does the International Society for Technology in Education. Some teachers have also begun assembling recommendations for their peers, such as a website made by faculty at Gettysburg College that provides practical advice on generative A.I. for professors.In my experience, though, there is no substitute for hands-on experience. So I’d advise teachers to start experimenting with ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools themselves, with the goal of getting as fluent in the technology as many of their students already are.My last piece of advice for schools that are flummoxed by generative A.I. is this: Treat this year — the first full academic year of the post-ChatGPT era — as a learning experience, and don’t expect to get everything right.There are many ways A.I. could reshape the classroom. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, thinks the technology will lead more teachers to adopt a “flipped classroom” — having students learn material outside class and practice it in class — which has the advantage of being more resistant to A.I. cheating. Other educators I spoke with said they were experimenting with turning generative A.I. into a classroom collaborator, or a way for students to practice their skills at home with the help of a personalized A.I. tutor.Some of these experiments won’t work. Some will. That’s OK. We’re all still adjusting to this strange new technology in our midst, and the occasional stumble is to be expected.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut students need guidance when it comes to generative A.I., and schools that treat it as a passing fad — or an enemy to be vanquished — will miss an opportunity to help them.“A lot of stuff’s going to break,” Mr. Mollick said. “And so we have to decide what we’re doing, rather than fighting a retreat against the A.I.”Kevin Roose is a Times technology columnist and a host of the podcast “Hard Fork.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Aug. 29, 2023, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: How Schools Can Cope and Grow When Their Students Are Using A.I..

The rise of AI has film and TV unions on edge.Aaron Fernandez for NBC NewsPrintSaveCreate your free profile or log in to save this articleAug. 23, 2023, 2:05 PM EDTBy David IngramFilm and television studios are trying to hire people with expertise in artificial intelligence, even as their writers and actors are out on strike citing the industry’s plans for AI and other concerns. Six entertainment companies, including Disney, Netflix, Sony and NBCUniversal, have been advertising for at least 26 positions related to AI in recent weeks, according to an NBC News search of online job listings. The companies are looking to pay many of the potential software developers more than $200,000 a year and, in some cases, far more, the job listings say. (NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News.)Streaming giant Netflix has been advertising 18 positions related to AI or machine learning, according to a search of the company’s jobs site. One of the positions would pay as much as $1 million to develop video games based on recent advances in AI, the ad says. The company jobs page doesn’t say how long the positions have been listed.A search of job sites turned up eight AI-related open positions at more traditional, establishment media companies. Two major unions, representing actors and writers, are on strike after contract negotiations with the studios broke down on an array of issues, including pay and the use of AI. The 26 AI-related job openings seen by NBC News vary widely in how much they relate to creating content, which has been a primary anxiety in discussions of how AI will affect the livelihood of creative professionals. Some of the openings are focused on the back end of certain products, such as using AI to personalize search results, while other positions are more directly about content generation or supporting others who might do content generation. Even for AI jobs not directly related to creating content, the job openings are one indication of where production companies are putting their resources. As streamers and creative companies are facing a labor crisis, they’re actively seeking AI specialists — and they’re willing to pay high salaries for them. Many of the job openings refer to duties such as building an AI platform or innovation lab, suggesting that the companies are building for the long term rather than seeking an immediate alternative to striking workers. The use of AI to generate content is a major sticking point for striking writers and performers. Union leaders say that AI-generated digital actors threaten to one day take work from their members, with some creators including Sarah Silverman already claiming in lawsuits that tech companies are using their words or likeness to train AI replacements. Fran Drescher, president of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, has called AI “poison.” “When you have a combination of Wall Street, greed, technology, whiz kids that I am not seeing exemplify a great deal of empathy — it’s a deadly cocktail, in my opinion, and I don’t want us to have to drink that poison anymore,” she said in a July 28 episode of the guild’s podcast. “Everybody’s watching dystopia series as entertainment, while my members are living it,” Drescher said. In contract negotiations, SAG-AFTRA is asking for compensation for performers who contribute to AI products and for AI companies to seek consent beforehand. The broadcasting company Sinclair is looking for someone to head its AI content efforts. Best known for conservative-leaning local news, Sinclair also has other media holdings and says it needs a director of AI for its innovation lab. Though the company is based in suburban Baltimore, the job would be in Los Angeles, according to the listing. “You will be at the helm of the development and implementation of generative AI solutions throughout our organization,” the ad says. The base salary is listed as up to $175,000 a year. Generative AI involves creating content and it has taken off in the past year, thanks to the viral success of apps like image generators, such as DALL·E 2, and chatbots, like ChatGPT. Some analysts believe that generative AI has only begun to shape the entertainment industry and how people spend their leisure time. A spokesperson for Sinclair said no one was immediately available for an interview or comment. A spokesperson for the Writers Guild of America West, which represents striking Hollywood writers, declined to comment on the AI job openings. SAG-AFTRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news site The Intercept reported last month that Netflix was offering as much as $900,000 a year for a single AI product manager. The job would involve overseeing an internal platform used by its AI software developers, according to an archived copy of the job ad. Another position for an engineering manager at Netflix would pay up to $900,000 a year for overseeing how the service uses AI to keep customers happy, the ad says. RecommendedCulture & TrendsCulture & TrendsHow Kamala Harris became part of Charli XCX's 'Brat' summerCulture & TrendsCulture & TrendsThe internet has entered its Kamala Harris 'coconut tree' era“Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence powers numerous aspects of the Consumer Experience, including innovation in content discovery and personalization for members, identifying and attracting new members to our product, optimizing our payment processing, and many more,” according to the listing. Other Netflix positions included ones in which potential hires will use machine learning to personalize viewers’ recommendations, or to support back end cloud-computing technology.“We free Netflix engineers from the complexity of modern software development, allowing them to focus on creating world-class entertainment,” says one ad for a director of Netflix’s internal engineering platform. The listing says total compensation for the role would typically be between $330,000 and $1.8 million, the highest pay among all the AI ads that NBC News found. A spokesperson for Netflix, which is based near San Jose, California, declined to comment except to point to a statement in May from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an industry trade group for studios. (NBCUniversal is a member of the alliance.) The industry group said at the time: “AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone. For example, writers want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can’t be copyrighted. So it’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing.” Hollywood studios have been circumspect about their strategies related to generative AI. Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about using AI to create efficiencies and called the technology disruptive but has not given details. Actor Bryan Cranston said he had “a message for Mr. Iger” at a rally in New York last month when the ""Breaking Bad"" star vowed, “We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots.” Disney has been advertising for four AI-related jobs, according to the listings. They include a senior manager for machine learning engineering based in San Francisco, leading a team “to build state of the art event-driven real-time ML ecosystem;” a senior vice president for post-production and innovation with responsibilities that include being “on the leading edge of technology developments, like Artificial Intelligence;” a San Francisco-based machine learning engineer, and a data scientist in Santa Monica, California, working on machine learning and advertising. Overall, Disney and its subsidiaries listed 367 technology-related job openings on LinkedIn, according to a search of the site Monday. Disney did not respond to requests for comment on the job openings. Sony is hiring for a senior research scientist and manager to focus on AI ethics in its Sony AI division. That division was established in 2020 and, according to the job ad, it’s a “research organization pursuing the mission to use AI to unleash human creativity,” working closely with other company divisions, including film studio Sony Pictures. “Sony has many real-world AI applications at the intersection of entertainment and technology, and we are looking for smart, enthusiastic people who want to research, develop and deploy techniques for FTA,” the ad says. FTA refers to fairness, transparency and accountability, three areas that Sony says it wants to research. A Sony spokesperson said in an email: “This is not a job with the entertainment company. Sony AI, which was established 3 years ago, is run out of our corporate headquarters in Japan. The AI Ethics Office operates within Sony AI.” Sony says it’s working on an array of applications for AI, including a digital race car driver named Sophy for the video game franchise Gran Turismo and potential robotic assistants for chefs. NBCUniversal has advertised for a vice president in charge of product, personalization and search. The responsibilities listed include using machine learning to build recommendation and personalization systems. A spokesperson for NBCUniversal said the role is focused on honing customer recommendations and has no connection to the creation of content. Warner Bros. Discovery had one listing for an AI-related position: a senior software engineer based in San Francisco to work on AI-driven recommendations and personalization features for Max, the app formerly known as HBO Max. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. David IngramDavid Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more likely to enhance jobs by automating tasks rather than eradicating them. However, the potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, found a new study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 

The study titled ‘Generative AI and Jobs: Analysing Global Effects on Quantity and Quality of Employment’ proposes that the majority of occupations and sectors face only partial exposure to automation. They are more prone to being supplemented rather than entirely replaced by the latest advancements in Generative AI, like chatGPT. Also Read:

The primary consequence of this technological advancement is anticipated to involve shifts in job quality, particularly concerning factors such as work intensity and autonomy, rather than causing widespread job loss.
Among various jobs, clerical work emerged as the category with the highest technological susceptibility. Approximately twenty-five per cent of tasks within this category were identified as having a substantial level of exposure, while over fifty per cent of tasks exhibited a moderate degree of exposure. 
On the other hand, within occupational groups like managers, professionals, and technicians, only a minor portion of tasks were categorised as highly exposed, while around twenty-five per cent of tasks had a medium level of exposure.
Generative AI's gendered impact
According to the study's findings, the potential impacts of Generative AI are expected to vary notably between men and women. The study reveals that the proportion of female employment facing potential automation is more than double that of males. This discrepancy is attributed to the higher concentration of women in clerical roles, particularly in countries with moderate to high income levels. 
Given that clerical positions have historically been a significant avenue of employment for women during countries' economic advancement, one potential outcome of Generative AI is the absence of certain clerical jobs in lower-income nations.
Generative AI's geographical impacts
Conducted on a global scale, the study underscores significant variations in how different countries are impacted, aligning with their developmental stages and technological disparities. It reveals that in high-income nations, approximately 5.5 per cent of the overall workforce faces potential exposure to the automation repercussions of this technology. 
In contrast, low-income countries experience a notably lower risk of automation, affecting only around 0.4 per cent of employment. The prospects for job augmentation remain relatively consistent across countries. This implies that implementing appropriate policies could potentially enable developing nations to harness substantial advantages from this new phase of technological advancement.
The study also suggests that the socioeconomic repercussions stemming from Generative AI will primarily hinge upon the strategic management of its dissemination. It advocates for the formulation of policies that facilitate a structured, equitable, and inclusive transition process. 
Essential components for effective management include prioritising the input of workers, offering skill development programs, and establishing comprehensive social safety nets. Neglecting these aspects could lead to the possibility that only a select few countries and market participants with adequate preparation will derive advantages from this emerging technology.
The authors of the study emphasise that the ""outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined. It is humans that are behind the decision to incorporate such technologies and it is humans that need to guide the transition process.""

Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society and author of ""Reset: A Leader’s Guide to Work in an Age of Upheaval.”Have a question?Submit it here.Question: With the proliferation of generative AI, I am worried about being replaced. Do you expect the additional productivity AI creates to displace workers? What can I do to ensure I am seen as a valued employee? – WhitneyAnswer: I can understand why you, or any of us, may be apprehensive about being displaced by artificial intelligence! New research reveals that nearly one-quarter (23%) of U.S. workers are concerned that workplace automation will replace their job in the next five years. Workplace automation has already impacted nearly 10% of U.S. workers. AI may displace some jobs, but it is just as likely to result in the creation of new jobs too. Remember that AI is designed to help us, not to replace human connection. AI isn’t all-encompassing; it has its limits. Work will always need the human component because what we create and produce ultimately serves other humans. Even before AI existed, there have always been steps employees could take to demonstrate their value to their organization. That will not change. For instance, you can take on new assignments or projects and volunteer to help wherever needed. Do more than asked and do it well. And be on the lookout for more efficient or cost-effective ways of doing things in your job.It’s also essential to continue to learn and grow your skills by taking classes, receiving training, or taking advantage of other professional development opportunities. Be a problem solver and share your ideas with your manager.Make no mistake, AI will be a reality. We can choose to run from it and limit our opportunities and growth or embrace it to expand our performance, productivity and potential. Careers aren’t linear, so our skill sets shouldn’t be static. The world of work will need people to develop the knowledge and expertise to manage, monitor and measure the output of AI. Explore how AI may be relevant in your role and career. Be proactive and talk with your supervisor about AI and how to better serve customers, clients and the organization.AI is not going anywhere anytime soon, so now is a pivotal time for us to figure out how to leverage AI to our advantage. Don’t let fear of technology blind you to the opportunities it presents for your growth and advancement.Job searchHow deep should I go when discussing a contentious job separation? Ask HRMean boss?Here's how to deal with a difficult or toxic manager: Ask HRHow will my lack of a formal university degree affect my chances of obtaining a new position in the HR field, despite having 15 years of experience as an HR generalist and director and certifications? – KelleyThe challenges you face may depend on the level of HR job you are interested in. Sometimes higher-level HR jobs require a degree, but not always. Your substantial experience, along with your certifications, can offset not having a degree. Research suggests 9 out of 10 employers report being ready to accept candidates without a four-year college degree. In addition, the study also found 66% of employers are open to hiring candidates with a recognized certification.Once you identify a position of interest, review the minimum position requirements. The job posting may list a degree, but if it also includes the words “desired” or “preferred,” then the degree is not a requirement. Tailor your resume specific to the job you are applying for and highlight how your experience directly matches what the company is looking for, such as the skills, knowledge, and abilities to perform certain HR functions. And highlight your achievements in 15 years of HR experience that have been impactful in your previous and current organizations.Even if a degree is required, apply for it. What do you have to lose? You can include in your cover letter why you feel you are the best candidate for the job, despite not having a degree.I hope these suggestions will help you land your next dream job!

Generative AI will augment jobs, not destroy them ILO study findsby Freya LucasAugust 23, 2023

Workforce


Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more likely to augment existing jobs rather than destroy them through the automation of tasks, rather than taking over roles entirely, a new study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has found.
 
The findings are timely as the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector begins to grapple with the logistical and ethical considerations presented by AI in a sector which is so driven by connection and authentic relationships.
 
Generative AI and Jobs: a global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality suggests that most jobs, sectors and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as chatGPT. 
 
Therefore, the greatest impact of this technology is likely to not be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy.
 
For sectors such as ECEC, where administrative tasks such as documenting children’s learning, disseminating information to parents and other stakeholders and complying with regulatory elements, this may prove advantageous. 
 
Clerical work was found to be the category with the greatest technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure. In other occupational groups – including managers, professionals and technicians – only a small share of tasks was found to be highly exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels.
 
Researchers took in a global perspective to reach the findings, with notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development, linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps.
 
They found that 5.5 per cent of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only some 0.4 per cent of employment. On the other hand, the potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries.
 
The potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, the study finds, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation. 
 
This is likely due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high- and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of Generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries.
 
The socioeconomic impacts of Generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed. It argues for the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair and consultative transition. Workers’ voice, skills training and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few, well-prepared countries and market participants will benefit from the new technology.
 
“Outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined,” researchers conclude. 
 
“It is humans that are behind the decision to incorporate such technologies and it is humans that need to guide the transition process”.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is more likely to augment jobs, by automating some tasks rather than taking over a role entirely, a new study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has found.Founded in October 1919 under the League of Nations, the ILO is one of the first and oldest specialised agencies of the United Nations.The study, “Generative AI and jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality”, suggests that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of generative AI, such as ChatGPT.Therefore, the ILO says, the greatest impact of this technology is likely to not be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy.Since Microsoft-backed OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT as a prototype on 30 November 2022, the chatbot has gone viral.Among other capabilities, ChatGPT interacts in conversational dialogue form and provides responses that can appear human. The text-based chatbot can also draft prose, poetry or computer code on command.Tech giants such as Google, Meta, Amazon Web Services, IBM and Oracle have since released their own versions of generative AI models.The Brainy Insights estimates the generative AI market will grow from $8.65 billion in 2022 and reach $188.62 billion by 2032.Highest impactThe ILO study took two principal approaches to the analysis of automation of occupations. The first was to use data on job vacancies to understand how demand for specific skills evolves over time.The second approach was to focus on occupational structures, with the idea of estimating the automation potential of tasks or skills that make up a given job.Clerical work was found to be the category with the greatest technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly-exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure.In other occupational groups – including managers, professionals and technicians – only a small share of tasks was found to be highly-exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels, says the labour body.The study, which is global in scope, documents notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development, linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps.It finds that 5.5% of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only 0.4%.On the other hand, the potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries, ILO notes.The potential effects of generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, the study finds, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation.“This is due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high- and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries,” says ILO.Wait and seeThe paper concludes the socio-economic impacts of generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed.It argues for the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair and consultative transition. Workers’ voice, skills training and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few, well-prepared countries and market participants will benefit from the new technology.The authors note the “outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined. It is humans that are behind the decision to incorporate such technologies and it is humans that need to guide the transition process.”These findings align with some of the most recent literature on generative AI systems with a global focus.A recent study by McKinsey (2023) points to a similar group of “knowledge work” occupations and tasks as having the highest level of exposure, though with a significantly higher suggested level of displacement.The Word Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) global survey, which focused on large enterprises, also lists clerical and administrative jobs among occupations with the fastest expected declines (WEF 2023).Estimates provided by Goldman Sachs (2023) suggest a slightly higher level of potential automation than ILO’s calculations, but with the general conclusion aligning with the organisation’s main finding that “most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI”.Share",BreadcrumbList,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/generative-ai-to-augment-rather-than-destroy-jobs/KzQenvjydEbqZd2r,Generative AI to augment rather than destroy jobs,,,['https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/08/ChatGPT-1-2023.jpg'],,2023-08-22T10:43:01+02:00,2024-05-20T11:36:06+02:00,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Admire Moyo', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/contributors/JAPero3qZBqQb6mG'}]",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'ITWeb', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/contributors/organizations/2010/11/resized/itweb-logo-c.xl.gif'}, 'description': 'Business technology news and information portal for South Africa’s tech professionals and decision makers.'}",,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/nG98Yd7LdA7X2PDJ', 'name': 'Enterprise Solutions'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Generative AI to augment rather than destroy jobs', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/generative-ai-to-augment-rather-than-destroy-jobs/KzQenvjydEbqZd2r'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The burnout levels are higher among Gen X government workers (53 percent), women (50 percent), and lower-income employees (49 percent).Government employees say the top causes of burnout include their workload and staffing shortages, both at 53 percent. Nearly three-fourths of government workers (70 percent) say that increased flexibility in working hours or days would help reduce their burnout.When asked about Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), most government workers (64 percent) indicate they do not expect the emerging technology will impact their stress levels on the job. Yet, a growing body of research indicates that when properly implemented, AI can help improve worker efficiency and productivity. Millennials (31 percent) and male employees (21 percent) are most likely to say that AI can help reduce job stress. These findings are from the 2023 Eagle Hill Consulting Workforce Burnout Survey conducted by Ipsos from August 3-8, 2023. The survey included 1,347 respondents from a random sample of employees across the U.S. including 555 federal, state, and local government workers.""It's encouraging that burnout levels for government employees are trending downward, but worker burnout is still much too high,"" said Melissa Jezior, president and chief executive officer of Eagle Hill Consulting. ""In recent weeks, we've witnessed the immense pressure and stress on government employees battling multiple natural disasters across the nation. Meanwhile, jurisdictions from coast to coast are plagued with teacher shortages and government leaders continue to face chronic problems hiring and keeping employees.""Jezior said, ""It's imperative that government leaders address worker burnout head-on. That means having open conversations with employees to understand the causes of their burnout and collaborating to implement realistic solutions. Workers who are stressed and tired can't perform at optimal levels, and it could push them to look for another job.""""One area to closely monitor will be the impact of more government employees shifting back to in-person work. Our research indicates that government employees value in-person work, but they also want flexibility to alleviate burnout and stress. In fact, we found that government employees are worried about their work-life balance and commuting times that often come with in-person work. Finding the right balance of in-person and remote work will be increasingly important for government managers and leaders,"" Jezior said.The survey's key findings are as follows:When asked how staff shortages are impacting their workload, 87 percent of government workers experiencing burnout said it's covering the workload for unfilled positions, 45 percent said it's training new hires, 42 percent said it's helping others learn their job.Most employees (65 percent) who experience burnout feel comfortable telling their manager or employer they feel burned out.When asked how to reduce burnout, 70 percent said increased flexibility would help, followed by decreasing their workloads (69 percent). Other solutions include offering a four-day work week (67 percent), reducing administrative burdens (61 percent), working from home (60 percent), providing better health and wellness benefits (55 percent), offering more on-site amenities (50 percent), and providing workers with the ability to relocate or work from multiple locations (42 percent).The research also signals that government worker departures are likely to continue with more than one quarter of government workforce (29 percent) saying they plan to leave their job in the next 12 months. The planned departure rates are highest for lower income (41 percent), younger (34 percent), and female (33 percent) government employees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com

However, it casts a widening skill gap within the tech sector. To amplify the capabilities of technology, a bridge must be forged to cultivate the tech environment.Addressing this exigent demand, the ETHRWorld Futures Skills Conference 2023 orchestrated a panel discussion that gathered luminaries from the HR domain across diverse sectors to explore the theme ""Generative AI Ushering In A New Era Of Personalized And Interactive Learning At Scale."" The crux of this discourse revolved around the profound implications of AI and VR tools.Automation in the job sector and Generative AIThe conversation commenced with insights from Raghav Gupta, MD of Coursera India &amp; Asia Pacific, who shared findings from a pre-pandemic study by Oxford University that delved into automation's effects on low-skilled job sectors. He highlighted the shift occurring in high-skilled job landscapes with the advent of Generative AI. As we delve deeper into this technology-driven society, it becomes evident that AI presents a spectrum of opportunities, capable of generating solutions across software development, auditing, marketing, and even sales.Raghav noted, ""Attributes least susceptible to automation include empathy, negotiation, problem-solving, active listening, and digital collaboration."" His statement unveiled both the awe-inspiring potential and the confounding challenges that AI adoption brings.Key takeaways from his presentation The emphasis on the Importance of upskilling due to technology changes, even for high education levels.Even though Generative AI has gripped the economy, still Human skills like empathy, problem-solving, and negotiation remain intact.Reservations persisted concerning the possible advantages of personalized learning with Chat GPT and the direction of future learning trends.Triggers and Impact on Workforce LearningIn another notable discourse, Bidisha Banerjee, SVP of Talent Culture &amp; Employer Branding at Welspun Group, dissected the digital transformations leading to the incorporation of AI, including ChatGPT. This shift extends beyond the IT sector, permeating areas such as marketing, supply chain management, and other spheres.&ldquo;I think there is a sense of FOMO,&rdquo; said Banerjee, When asked about the Dynamic nature of the business environment, she marveled upon the FOMO Factor if humans still distinguish themselves from the captivating world of AI. She acknowledged the presence of new-age technology, being an indispensable part of our lives, the adaption of which will help integrate and amplify the human skillset.Her conclusion resonated: ""Technology won't displace our jobs; instead, it will amplify our efforts, providing room to engage in strategic work.""As the discussion progressed, Ina Bajwa, VP-HR at Tata Communications, unveiled a comprehensive exploration of the transformative technology landscape. She highlighted the business landscape's dynamic shifts over the past four years, catalyzed by the post-pandemic 'great reset,' necessitating adaptability. The solution, as the panelists fervently posited, lies in adopting the platform strategy, driven by the imperative for upskilling and reskilling through Generative AI.Ina emphasized the importance of fostering a value-centric model for employees, focusing on personalized and contextualized learning programs that foster mobility. Amidst experimentation with ChatGPT, the organizational landscape is defined not only by possibilities but also by limitations.Ina's discourse culminated with a powerful statement: ""The global market, currently valued at 8 billion, is projected to reach 126 billion within the next seven years."" She candidly acknowledged the ongoing ""experimentation phase,"" with distinct use cases for generative AI in the learning context continuing to unfold.Evolving Tech Landscape and Skill Dynamics&ldquo;Impacted is a polite way of saying jobs will get eliminated, jobs will change&rdquo;, as said by Raghav, casting a spell that tempts even the most ardent of human creators, to cede that pace with which the change is evident.Drawing attention to an evolving landscape where technology transcends departments, becoming intrinsic to businesses, Raghav cited instances like Microsoft and KPMG's staggering $12 billion alliance, exemplifying a tech-driven metamorphosis even in traditionally unassuming domains like auditing.He underscored a McKinsey report that expanded AI's reach into software, sales, marketing, content generation, research, development, and customer observation.Metrics for Tapping The Business OutcomeFurther, Bidisha delved into a comprehensive report on the metrics followed by the Welspun Group for enhancing the skills of the employees. She emphasized the concept of &ldquo;Skill benchmarking&rdquo; which offers skill tests, such as assessing proficiency in digital transformation. The second alternative that she shared focussed on the projects linked to the learning platform. While she mentioned: &ldquo;At the end of the year we have something like a shark tank where people are to come back with innovative ideas and process improvement, change improvements from the manufacturing floor and other sectors of the industry within our organization.&rdquo; Thirdly, she shared how the Welspun group has incorporated talent and succession outcomes, which help them to generate a knowledge-based outcome to measure competency throughout.Ina shed light on skills development's pivotal role within their organization, stating: ""We've mirrored that internally in terms of program effectiveness."" She highlighted employee progress toward career aspirations, showing a ""3 to 5% increase,"" facilitated by an AI-based ecosystem.Ina accentuated how companies like OpenAI and Google plan to invest trillions into distinct ChatGPT use cases, contextualizing content for global business. The focus on deep skilling was underscored, with learning outcomes directly tied to business impact. Holistic assessments encompassed learner experience, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and adaptive evaluations, ensuring meaningful growth aligned with organizational goals.Wrapping up the discussion, Raghav stressed that overcoming AI-induced challenges requires upskilling of thoughts and ideas. His optimistic note resonated: ""Skills pay the bills."" He concluded, ""Learn or become irrelevant,"" underlining the urgency of adapting to the shifting landscape.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com

The newest tech fad is artificial intelligence (AI). And the face of the technology is ChatGPT which is a large language model that helps people brainstorm, write articles, translate text, conduct research, generate ideas, cheat on exams, or simply just have someone to talk to. With its ability to “speak” in simple, conversational language, ChatGPT is a glimpse of what AI technology is capable of.
AI can generally process certain types of information faster than humans.  Initially, the technology will assist humans with their work. But eventually, AI will slowly replace some of these workers altogether. These workers pay payroll taxes which fund Social Security, Medicare, and state programs. If these workers disappear, then the tax base declines and these safety net programs are in jeopardy. How can the government prepare for this?

For clarification, let’s compare the the tax treatment of human employees and machines. Both the employer and employee equally pay a portion of an employee’s payroll tax which is based on their income. Employers also pay similar employment taxes to the state to fund its unemployment and disability programs. Self-employed people similarly pay self-employment taxes on their income. For 2023, only the first $160,200 of wages or self-employment income is subject to Social Security tax every year.
Also, employers must generally file quarterly employment tax returns with the IRS and the state.
Conversely, if a business purchases equipment that uses AI technology, it is not subject to federal and state employment taxes and return filing requirements. This is because AI is not considered an employee. At least not yet. Instead, the business can opt to take a tax deduction for the full purchase through a Section 179 deduction. Or it can choose to deduct a portion of the cost over a number of years through depreciation. The cost of routine repairs is fully deductible. The cost of major equipment upgrades can be either fully deducted or depreciated.




Due to its nature, AI will not demand things like a living wage or remote work. Nor will it unionize, go on strike, or file employment-related lawsuits.
This is nothing new as businesses have in the part purchased equipment to automate certain tasks and make existing work more efficient. Computers and even smartphones have made computational work easier. But recently, AI has been able to perform creative tasks, such as write poems, essays, articles and even scripts. The use of AI is a point of contention in the 2023 Writers Strike. One demand is that AI can only be used as a tool to help research or facilitate script ideas and not to replace writers.
As AI technology improves, the role of humans in the labor force will change. Workers with skills in robotics or computer science will be in demand and are likely to be highly paid. So in the short run, there may not be a dramatic effect on payroll taxes as young people or those seeking a career change adapt. But older people and those who devoted a great deal of time in their current professions might be unable or unwilling to become robot repairmen.
Assuming that AI technology has advanced enough to threaten the solvency of Social Security, unless the system is fundamentally changed, taxes will have to increase. But who should have to pay the lost payroll taxes?
One option is to have the AI manufacturers pay through an excise or supplemental tax. But this would create three problems. First, it will be hard to determine what technology would be considered AI and thus subject to the tax. Will it need to have sentience or its own consciousness and can it give advice or make decisions? If AI is simply defined as a program that reduces or eliminates the need for human labor, then a lot of everyday items like a computer or a smartphone would be subject to this tax.

The other problem is that the excise tax will be passed on to customers. This assumes there is little to no competition and economic substitutes.
The final and most significant problem is that taxing AI technology could hinder or even destroy its development in the U.S. Experts in the field will move to other countries to continue their work. This could put the U.S. in an economic and even military disadvantage.
Another option is to tax businesses that use AI to replace workers. One way to do it is to reduce or disallow a business tax deduction for the purchase of AI technology (South Korea did this in 2018). Also, maintenance expenses paid can be subject to payroll taxes similar to how employees are paid. Like the manufacturers, businesses will try to pass on the tax to its customers through increased prices although, if the business has a large amount of competitors, it will have to pay the tax to stay price competitive.
The final option is to force taxpayers to pay more. This can be done by raising the age for eligibility to receive social security benefits or increase the payroll and self-employment tax rates. Obviously, people are not going to like having to pay more and wait longer for benefits. Many are living paycheck to paycheck. A forced tax increase could result in reduced spending on other areas. This can have negative collateral economic effects which can last years before the economy adapts.
While AI-driven job displacement could potentially impact social security funding by altering the composition of the workforce, the overall effect depends on a variety of complex factors. If only something was available to quickly digest all of this complex information into advice in a conversational format.

ISLAMABAD: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more likely to augment than destroy jobs by automating some tasks rather than taking over a role entirely, a new study released by International Lab­our Organization (ILO) says.
The study, “Generative AI and Jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality” released on Monday, suggests that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as chat GPT.
“The greatest impact of this technology is likely to not be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy,” the study suggests.
Clerical work was found to be the category with the greatest technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure. In other occupational groups — including managers, professionals and technicians — only a small share of tasks was found to be highly exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels.


Women’s vocations to be affected more by automation, new study says

The study, which is global in scope, documents notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development, linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps. It finds that 5.5 per cent of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only some 0.4pc of employment.
The potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries.
The potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, the study finds, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation.
This is due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of Generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries.
The study concludes that the socio-economic impacts of Generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed. It argues for the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair and consultative transition.
Workers’ voice, skills training and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few, countries will benefit from the new technology.

South African contact centre employees are worried generative artificial intelligenceARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEGetting started with generative AI?
Digicloud’s Google Cloud partners can guide your success! (AI) will take over their jobs, as the industry across the globe increasingly incorporates AI-powered agents into their processes.This is according to analysts, who say generative AI will disrupt the traditional business process outsourcing (BPO) industry by automating more and more tasks for agents, prompting employees to fear their duties may eventually be entirely replaced.However, the BPO industry says generative AI technologies will likely supplement their human agents and not necessarily replace them, as many customers still prefer human interactions, especially for sensitive or complex issues.Employers across the globe are anticipating millions of jobs across industries to be displaced by the growing adoption of emerging technologies in the workplace.Flux Trends researcher and trend-spotter Faeeza Khan explains: “Generative AI is sparking anxiety among call centre workers all around the world. “The Philippines employs roughly 1.6 million BPO workers and is one of the world’s largest centres for BPO. Political and business leaders there are in the process of formulating a plan to deal with AI replacing human jobs. See also Generative AI to augment rather than destroy jobsChatGPT forces SA varsities to rethink plagiarism policies“In March, Google demonstrated new generative AI capabilities for call centres and there are a multitude of customer service platforms to choose from.”Khan points out that while generative AI will play a critical role in SA’s BPO industry, it will enhance roles rather than replace them. This will be done by enabling efficiency through automation of repetitive tasks, improving agent productivity and in turn revolutionising the entire customer operations function.“The incorporation of generative AI in the customer service realm is becoming crucial in order for businesses not to be outcompeted. The benefits are clear. “However, businesses should not ignore the human cost and should make efforts to enable their workforce to perform higher-value work that’s still beyond the scope of AI. Upskilling programmes for BPO workers to gain the necessary expertise is recommended,” she adds.Faeeza Khan, head of research at Flux Trends. SA’s BPO sector has the potential to create 775 000 jobs by 2030, according to a report by consultancy firm McKinsey.A June 2023 McKinsey report reveals generative AI will automate 60% to 70% of employee workloads globally, with the customer centre industry being among the top sectors that will be augmented by the emerging tech.Laurent Leclercq, CTO of BPO solutions provider Merchants, says while generative AI will more likely add value than substitute workers in SA’s BPO industry, it does pose a certain level of threat.“The ongoing adoption of generative AI technologies can pose challenges to job creation in the South African BPO sector, specifically for roles that include routine tasks, are repetitive in nature and can be easily automated. “AI solutions can also be deployed to scale up or down easily, based on demand, without the need for recruitment, training or other overheads associated with hiring human agents. “Once trained appropriately, these systems tend to make fewer errors in repetitive tasks compared to humans. This efficiency can make them preferable for tasks where precision and consistency are crucial,” notes Leclercq.While generative AI can pose challenges to traditional job creation in the BPO sector, it will not necessarily mean the end of jobs in the industry, with many customers still preferring the “human touch”, he adds.According to Leclercq, Merchants approaches the use of generative AI technologies within its contact centres opportunistically and with specific focus on client-driven value requirements.“The emotional intelligence and understanding that humans offer cannot be fully replicated by AI. In essence, the digital economy has elevated the role of contact centre agents from mere problem-solvers to critical brand representatives, equipped with technology and empowered to offer an enhanced and integrated customer experience. “With the ever-increasing rise in cyber threats, human agents also have a key role to play in ensuring dataDATAData Sciences: Your Partner in Innovative IT Solutions.

The complex tasks often required of agents will always require human interaction. “While AI is extremely useful for simple automated tasks, human beings need emotional connection, especially when experiencing heightened emotions,” explains Singh.While CCI South Africa has not incorporated generative AI in its processes, the company plans to do so, he adds. The role of the contact centre agent has evolved significantly over the years, in the advent of the digital economy.“With improvements in technology, the contact centre landscape has evolved even further and is now what is called ‘omni-channel’.Furthermore, I believe the analytic power of AI will help us to better utilise macro-economic factors, and how they interact with human needs and experience to best make use of our local resources. “For the BPO industry, one of these key resources is the massive potential held by the unemployed youth. I believe that through this process, we will be able to further drive job creation using these analytics,” notesSingh.Mithum Singh, MD of CCI South Africa.

Snapchat Introduces “Dreams” with Generative AI: How Does it Work?By  

				Shodi Madian			



		 /  August 22, 2023 


Snapchat, the social media giant known for its quirky filters and unique features, is taking its plunge into the world of generative AI once again. The latest addition to Snapchat’s AI lineup is called “Dreams,” and it’s all about creating captivating images that go beyond the ordinary. In this article, we’ll be taking a deep dive into the ins and outs of Dreams, exploring how it works and functions.
Snapchat’s Generative AI “Dreams”
Earlier this year, Snapchat introduced us to “My AI,” a chatbot powered by generative AI technology. This chatbot was no ordinary text responder; it could send back Snaps, not just text. This feature allowed users to share glimpses of their activities and receive creatively generated snapshots in response, making conversations more dynamic and engaging.
Now, Snapchat is gearing up to take generative AI to the next level with its upcoming feature, “Dreams.”



This exciting revelation comes from the insights of app developer and researcher Steve Moser.
Unlike the previous AI chatbot, Dreams focuses on creating images that transport you and your friends into imaginative worlds.
Imagine being able to stand against the backdrop of a fantastical landscape or sharing a laugh with your friends in a scene straight out of your dreams; that’s what Dreams is all about.

The buzz around Dreams began in the early spring of 2023 when a reverse engineer named Alessandro Paluzzi uncovered this exciting feature. He revealed that Dreams would let users place their personal images into AI-generated worlds. Now, this remarkable feature has earned its spot within the Snapchat app, nestled between the camera studio and direct stories.

Snapchat is working hard to make Dreams a reality. It’s developing features that allow users to either capture new images or upload personal ones.

Once you provide the image, Snapchat’s AI magic steps in.
It takes your picture and crafts a brand-new image that places you in scenarios you’ve only dreamed of.

Remember the app “Remini” that took the world by storm? It allowed users to turn their selfies into polished images suitable for professional platforms like LinkedIn without needing an expensive photoshoot.

Snapchat’s Dreams feature takes a similar approach but with a twist.
Instead of just enhancing your portrait, it transforms your selfie into an image that drops you into imaginative locations and scenarios.

Getting the perfect shot for Dreams

Snapchat’s AI needs a clear starting point to make the magic happen. That means providing clear images with distinct user features.

Blurry photos or ones with too many people won’t work well with Dreams.
Also, having a variety of poses, expressions, and lighting conditions in your pictures will help the AI create even more captivating images.

Sharing Dreams with friends
Additionally, Snapchat has something even cooler in store. Alongside individual Dreams, they’re also working on “Dreams with Friends.” This feature allows you to give your friends permission to join in on the AI-generated fun. Imagine creating shared images with a friend where both of you are immersed in some extraordinary scenario, all thanks to the power of AI.

Get ready to turn your selfies into fantastic dreams and share them with your friends in ways you’ve never imagined before. Welcome to the future of social media, where AI meets creativity in the most captivating way possible.
