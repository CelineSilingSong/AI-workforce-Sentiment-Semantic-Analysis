Finding a new job can be a job unto itself: perfecting a resume, scanning career websites, networking among friends and acquaintances—the dizzying amount of work can turn the excitement of a new career chapter into anxiety. Job searches of the future are going to be a completely different experience, with technology doing most of the heavy lifting.

Conversations with several figures in the field of job search and recruitment—representing behemoths in the industry and smaller players—revealed a job-hunt landscape that will look very different just a few years from now. Though their approaches to matching worker and employer may differ, all agreed that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning would streamline the complexity of matching work to talent and that the job search and recruiting experience of the future will involve more face time and less resume spamming.
The Job Board
About 65% of people look for new jobs within 91 days of being hired at a job—which suggests matchmaking in the search for work may be less than perfect, says Raj Mukherjee, senior vice president of product for Indeed.com, the job search platform that operates in more than 50 countries and has about 200 million visitors to its site per month.
PROMOTED
Those imperfections can only be fixed with data—and lots of it. The sheer amount of information on job skills, salaries and user tendencies makes matching people to positions simply impossible without using AI to crunch the numbers. “We’re generating roughly 25 terabytes of data every single day,” says Mukherjee, “and as we do that the data becomes the foundation of how we use AI and machine learning to improve the experience that job seekers get.”

AI and machine-learning allow services like Indeed to make predictive assessments of factors such as what a salary should be. Calculations hone in on what wages would be appropriate for a particular job, in a specific location, or at a specific company. Exact job title also comes into play.
Indeed’s AI also pulls information from resumes for recruiters using something called natural-language processing, which involves extracting relevant words and phrases from text using computer programs. This is tricky because text data can be relatively unstructured. “It would look at a sentence and try to make sense of that sentence,” says Mukherjee. “It would sort things that the sentence implies.” Listed skills on a job seeker’s resume would be recognized and set aside, he explained, as would companies worked for, years of experience and other elements. This information would then be compiled to make it easier for recruiters to evaluate.

As for the future, Mukherjee says job seekers will likely see a reduction in their research time while looking for work. As AI and machine-learning develop in the field, a service like Indeed should be able to suggest new, much more compatible opportunities based on a job seekers’ work experience, skills, salary, interests and location. A career-focused AI should also tell job seekers whether they are being paid fairly at their current job, with a high degree of accuracy, compared to others in their line of work.
For recruiters, says Mukherjee, weeding out incompatible talent is key. That means gauging skills at the outset, which would require testing on a job search platform—saving time for both recruiter and job seeker.
Skills Above All
Skills testing is also the centerpiece for CodeFights, a four-year-old San Francisco-based firm that offers tech workers a platform on which to practice their coding skills and to use those skills—which are scored and rated on the CodeFights platform. They can connect with prospective employers, who also use the company specifically to find prospective hires. This system of skills-based recruiting opens doors for programmers based largely on their proven talents and offers recruiters a definitive look at what a prospective hire can actually do.
For Tigran Sloyan, CodeFights’ co-founder and CEO, looking for work is a classic matchmaking scenario, similar to ones being facilitated in the transportation market by Uber and in the hotel and short-term rental space by Airbnb. But in the effort to connect workers and employers, complexities abound. There are so many data points to consider: skills, salaries, location, personality, experience, company culture, inaccuracies in resumes or job descriptions. “The more objective data we introduce in technical recruiting—and in recruiting overall—the better all of us will be,” says Sloyan.

Sloyan foresees that job search platforms or services will ultimately become education hubs, offering skills-building services that also rate proficiency, making it easier for job-seekers to prove their quality to recruiters, with whom they would be matched. “Eventually there will be a company that’s teaching the entire world,” says Sloyan. “A company that’s teaching the entire world is doing assessments on a vast scale, and you cannot compete with that kind of company as purely a recruiting company.”
A Layer Of Testing
Assessing skills specific to various industries is the name of the game for Harver, a five-year-old firm based in Amsterdam. Its specialty is having job applicants go through a testing process—chosen by hiring companies—that gauges whether they are a good match for a given position. The firm has made deals with Netflix, Booking.com, OpenTable and Zappos.








Barend Raaff, CEO of Harver.
Harver, Barend Raaff





“A lot of people apply for jobs and they don’t have any clue what the job is really like,” says Barend Raaff, Harver’s founder and CEO. It’s also impossible to predict whether someone would stay in the job and do it proficiently, he added. The firm designs algorithms and testing processes with recruiting clients to predict a good match for a job. Harver began by focusing on high-volume job sectors like call centers and customer-facing roles, and has now begun catering to smaller companies’ recruitment needs. Through the application and testing process, job applicants get a sense of what to expect from a job, and Raaff says that in the future if an applicant is rejected for a job, Harver will suggest positions at other organizations for which he or she is better suited.
Raaff also says the role of recruiter will become easier as the means to gauge talent will be far more robust. The human element, he noted, will still be needed to make the final decision on hiring. “Surgeons 50 years ago had an X-ray picture, and based on an X-ray picture they decided if they would operate,” he explained. Today they have the means to gather greater levels of data on what ails their patients, but the big decisions are still made by humans. “They make the call whether they will operate or not. In recruitment we are heading in the same direction.”
A Deeper Knowledge Equals Efficiency 
At Linkedin, AI is used to sift through job-seeker and recruiter data alike, as well as information on the company’s 500 million-plus registered users, says John Jersin, senior director of product management for the company. “We’ve seen efficiency improvements upwards of 50% in our core products for recruiting already—the number of interactions that it takes to find a candidate that engages in the process, or reaches a certain stage, or find a candidate that gets hired.”
Still, today job and talent search is inefficient, says Jersin: seekers must send out many applications to find a position and recruiters must sort through a high volume of candidates before finding one that is a fit. “The work on AI that we’re doing helps us better understand what ‘fit’ actually means in a way that we can predict it,” notes Jersin. “If we can predict it, we can make the right matches faster and the wrong matches less often.”
In the future, says Jersin, job seekers and recruiters will spend less time on the drudgery of the job market and more time in face-to-face meetings—that is, on both sides, the ideal outcome—largely because AI and machine learning will make matching more efficient. But, says Jersin, there are elements to a job search that are simply incalculable by artificial intelligence. “The thing that will always matter is whether that place clicks for them on an emotional level, whether that job gives them the feeling that they are fulfilled, and whether the people there are the kind of people that they want to work with.”Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Send me a secure tip. Karsten StraussI am a New York City-based journalist and staff writer for Forbes Magazine and Forbes.com covering entrepreneurship and franchising.

In 2020, artificial intelligence will create 2.3 million jobs and eliminate 1.8 million jobs, according to Gartner.The number of jobs affected by AI will vary by industry, and 2019 will see a growing demand for jobs in healthcare, the public sector and education, while manufacturing will be hit with job losses. By 2020, AI-related job creation will cross into positive territory, reaching two million net-new jobs in 2025, the analyst's Predicts 2018: AI and the Future of Work report found.Alibaba CEO declares artificial intelligence and robots 'will kill our jobs' What is AI?Warnings about AI's impact on the economy are constantly in the news, and University of Oxford researchers have predicted that 35% of UK jobs are at risk of automation over the next two decades. But Gartner's findings suggest that AI could also improve the productivity of many roles.""Many significant innovations in the past have been associated with a transition period of temporary job loss, followed by recovery ... business transformation and AI will likely follow this route,"" said Svetlana Sicular, research vice president at Gartner.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITPro""Unfortunately, most calamitous warnings of job losses confuse AI with automation. That overshadows the greatest AI benefit: AI augmentation - a combination of human and artificial intelligence, where both complement each other.""For IT leaders, however, the focus shouldn't simply be on the potential increase in jobs. When considering investment in AI-enabled technologies, they must also consider which jobs will be lost, which will be created and how the technology will transform how employees work on a day-to-day basis. Gartner has previously underlined that CIOs will be responsible for choosing which tasks AI perform, and how it can help human workers.The analyst firm has also predicted that by 2022, one in five workers engaged in non-routine tasks will rely on AI to perform certain jobs. AI has already been applied to highly repeatable tasks, where large volumes of data can be analysed for patterns. But applying AI to less routine work that is more varied will soon start yielding benefits.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

K. Daron Acemoglu, the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics at MIT, is a leading thinker on the labor market implications of artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, and new technologies. His innovative work challenges the way people think about how these technologies intersect with the world of work. In 2005, he won the John Bates Clark Medal, an honor shared by a number of Nobel Prize recipients and luminaries in the field of economics. 
Acemoglu holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from University of York. His master’s degree in mathematical economics and econometrics and doctorate in economics are from the London School of Economics. With political scientist James Robinson, Acemoglu co-authored the much discussed book “Why Nations Fail” (Crown Business, 2012) and “Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy” (Cambridge University Press, 2006). He also wrote the book, “Introduction to Modern Economic Growth” (Princeton University Press, 2008). Acemoglu recently answered a few questions about technology and work.
Q: How do we begin to understand the rise of artificial intelligence and its future impact on society?
A: We need to look to the past in the face of modern innovations in machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, and beyond. The process of machines replacing labor in the production process is not a new one. It's been going on pretty much continuously since the Industrial Revolution. Spinning and weaving machines took jobs away from spinners and weavers. One innovation would follow another, and people would be thrown out of work by a machine performing the job in a cheaper way.
But at the end of the day, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath created much better opportunities for people. For much of the 20th century in the U.S., workers’ wages and employment kept growing. New occupations and new tasks and new jobs were generated within the framework of new technological knowledge. A huge number of occupations in the American economy today did not exist 50 years ago — radiologists, management consultants, software developers, and so on. Go back a century and most of the white-collar jobs today did not exist.
Q:  Do you think public fears about the future of work are just?
A: The way we live continuously changes in significant ways — how we learn, how we acquire food, what we emphasize, our social organizations.
Our adjustments to technology — especially transformative technologies — are not a walk in the park. It is not going to be easy and seamless and just sort itself out. A lot of historical evidence shows the process is a painful one. The mechanization of agriculture is one of the greatest achievement of the American economy but it was hugely disruptive for millions of people who suffered joblessness.
At the same time, we are capable technologically and socially of creating many new jobs that will take people to new horizons in terms of productivity and freedom from the hardest types of manual labor. There are great opportunities with artificial intelligence but whether or not we exploit them is a different question. I think you should never be too optimistic but neither should you be too pessimistic.
Q: How do you suggest people prepare for the future job market?
A: We are very much in the midst of understanding what sort of process we are going through. We don’t even necessarily know what skills are needed for the jobs of the future.
Imagine one scenario. Artificial intelligence removes the need for seasoned accountants to fulfill numeracy-related tasks. But we need tax professionals, for instance, to inform clients about their choices and options in some sort of empathetic human way. They will have to become the interface between the machines and the customers. The jobs of the future, in this instance and many others, would require communications, flexibility, and social skills.
However, I don't know if my hypothesis is true because we haven't tested it. We haven't lived through it. I see the biggest void in our knowledge. People at institutions like MIT must learn more about what is going on so that we are better prepared to understand the future.

The EconomistWhile examining the impact of aging societies on growth, The Economist cites a new study co-authored by Prof. Daron Acemoglu, which shows that “when young workers are sufficiently scarce, manufacturers invest in more automation, and experience faster productivity growth as a result.”

QuartzIn a new working paper, Prof. Daron Acemoglu and his co-author argue that the rise in automation is linked to the aging of the blue-collar population. “The study shows that workers feeling the brunt of automation in lost jobs and lower wages are between the ages of 36 and 55. Those findings should make it easier for policy makers to track down the most affected workers—and help them survive the robot rush,” writes Ana Campoy for Quartz.

It is estimated 236m jobs in China, 120m in India and 73m in the US are going to be eliminated by 2030 (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017) due to the rise of automated activities. Indeed, artificial intelligence and internet of things combined will inevitably eliminate many workforces around the world whereas technology develops. However, there are also plenty of new opportunities being created out of it, data labeling is just one of them.Data labeling is the manual curation of data by humans on machine learning and AI applications. Labeling data is essential because computers have innumerable limitations, and some of them cannot be simply solved without human intervention. Actually, a computer can be programmed to perform hard calculations and automate activities that would be too burdensome to be done manually by us, however the same is unable to tell the difference between a car from a dog in a picture without proper training. In summary, computers use an algorithm to learn based in a dataset, what usually requires the supervision of someone. Roughly we call it supervised machine learning because computers need human supervision to get trained to execute tasks that are tricky for machines, but definitely easy for humans such as image recognition. Hence the need for a data labeler.The workload to train a machine can be endless. Imagine you want to train a model to detect dogs on the street but since dogs can vary greatly in size, color, and shape depending on their breed, you need first of all to make sure that your model will neither present high incidence of false positives nor false negatives. Get in mind, when working in complex real-life projects involving supervised machine learning, it can take weeks or even months to achieve the desired outcome.As programming skills aren’t a requirement initially, pretty much everyone can be a data labeler as far as the candidate enjoys technology and is willing to learn new tools. On top of that, the number of Data Labelers are expected to increase greatly in the upcoming years following the rise of AI and machine learning. Companies like IBM, Google, Facebook and many in the game industry and marketing are already recruiting new people to start immediately.Have you heard about data labeling before?

And deeper understanding of squishy brains could offer a lot more lessons for improving silicon brains, say MIT researchers. That’s the concept behind a new project called the MIT Intelligence Quest, which the university announced today.Intriguing is that it brings together researchers who study both human intelligence and artificial intelligence. The hope is that better understanding both of them will help develop new algorithms and techniques that can be used broadly. The mandate encompasses pretty much everything, including “disease diagnosis, drug discovery, materials and manufacturing design, automated systems, synthetic biology, and finance,” per a statement from the university. As per many big AI initiatives, curing cancer is also on the list of goals.Rather than a separate institute, Intelligence Quest will be a collaboration of researchers from across the university, such as the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines. It also includes not-so-usual suspects, such as the Sloan School of Management and the School of Architecture and Planning. This all builds on MIT’s collaboration with IBM Watson, announced in September 2017, says the university. IBM is known for overhyping and overpromising, especially in medicine.

Artificial intelligence is the way of the future, and visiting lawyer KayFirth-Butterfield is helping shape that future through her work at the World Economic Forum. Mike Houlahan reports.
Artificial intelligence is hard to define, but it is affecting everyone’s lives already and will shape the world’s future, a visiting world leader in the field says.
""I think a lot of people don’t realise what we call narrow AI is already in their homes and computers,"" Ms Kay Firth-Butterfield said.
""I always say that AI is the engine of the fourth industrial revolution. For example, people talk a lot about the changes autonomous vehicles will bring, but you wouldn’t have autonomous vehicles without the underpinning of artificial intelligence.""
An English lawyer, Ms Firth-Butterfield has a background in both law and international relations.
In the United States she became a professor and helped set up AI Austin, a non-profit organisation which encourages practical and responsible design, development and use of Artificial Intelligence — machines which can learn and make decisions without human guidance.
Last September she was headhunted by the World Economic Forum, and now heads its artificial intelligence and machine learning project.
In that capacity she advises world leaders and business executives on AI issues; last week she was in Davos for the WEF’s annual winter meeting.
""It is an amazing privilege to be able to actually create projects that will hopefully make a difference,"" Ms Firth-Butterfield said.
""I’ve moved from thinking about things academically, to the non-profit and trying to make a difference on the ground, and now to actually be able to make a difference by running projects at a national and international level is a huge privilege and I’m delighted to be able to do it.""
Ms Firth-Butterfield calls her part of the WEF a ""do tank, not a think tank"".
It works with together with organisations and governments on AI regulation projects. Three months are spent on planning and scoping and nine months on creating the project.
""If we are working with a country there will also be six months of piloting the regulation or governance structure we have come up with, and if that works well we hope it will serve as a model for other governments.""
At the WEF’s San Francisco Centre of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Ms Firth-Butterfield’s AI and machine-learning team sits alongside seven other AI portfolios — blockchain, drones, autonomous vehicles, medicine, the environment, e-commerce and cross-border data flow, and the internet of things.
""All of us have our specific subject areas, but the cross-cutting themes of the work we are all doing is ethics and values and social inclusion,"" she said.Ads by Scroll Media0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00 
""Whenever I look at a project I look at its impact on those three things.""
Like many thinkers in this area, Ms Firth-Butterfield and her team find themselves battling to keep up with developments in such a fast-moving field, and how to ensure accountability, transparency, bias and privacy concerns are considered as the use of AI expands.
Those creating these new technologies might not have thought of the ethical and legal implications of their work, and governments might not have considered how best to regulate the field.
Greater education about AI and its implications was needed at all levels, Ms Firth-Butterfield said.
""One of our concerns is that the average citizen doesn’t understand enough about artificial intelligence to actually play a proper part in regulation or governance of the technology,"" she said.
""I think we see that also among business leaders who don’t know enough about the way AI could impact their business, and also how it may impact the brand if they do their artificial intelligence incorrectly — by which I mean irresponsibly and not ethically.""
The regulation framework for artificial intelligence is pretty much a blank slate, with tools such as codes of conduct, protocols or global conventions few and far between.
""Not even around lethal autonomous weapons,"" Ms Firth-Butterfield said.
""I think AI will be of huge  benefit to humanity, but I absolutely believe the time is now for us to be mitigating the negative consequences.
""We need to go forward, but also understand the challenges as well.""
While in New Zealand Ms Firth-Butterfield paid a visit to the University of Otago’s AI project.
The Dunedin-based, Law Foundation-funded initiative might seem light years away from the presidents, prime ministers and CEOs Ms Firth-Butterfield usually deals with, but she said national projects such as the one in Otago were vital for the development of a worldwide framework for the implementation of ethical AI.
""AI has its own specific challenges and benefits, and countries need to analyse those and say how will this work for us.
""Each country  needs to create its own artificial intelligence strategy ... and create its own centres of AI excellence, because at that point it will be possible to join in the global conversation.""

Ms Firth - Butterfield is a thinker. Al do not, and will not, think. They are programmed and initiated by human beings. The quality of human intelligence, or lack of it, will determine the future.
