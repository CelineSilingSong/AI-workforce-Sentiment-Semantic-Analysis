Most of us appreciate the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and we know it is bringing big changes. Will we finally have that robot assistant we were promised 50 years ago? Will we even have to work, at least in the sense of how we view work today? It is fun to daydream about these things, but insurers need some certainty on what the future looks like. Some new insurers are trying new business models enthusiastically and then changing direction sharply, like a speedboat swerving to avoid a collision. The larger insurers, however, are like large cruise ships. They need to be able to see far ahead before they plot their course, and they don’t want to keep changing direction.
We wanted to identify the viable AI driven business models to help give some clarity and guidance. Previous efforts had identified four models being applied now, that showed a varying level of enthusiasm for AI. But what about ten years from now? Would there be convergence to one model? If not, what are the key issues stopping this? 
AI is bringing fundamental changes to insurance business models. Those that fail to adapt are likely to disappear. Some traditional insurers are trying to just be more effective with AI, while others reinvent themselves to fully utilize the new capabilities available. Tech-savvy companies from outside the sector like Tesla, are entering and disrupting it. Despite these diverging approaches, there are signs of a convergence towards one, ideal, business model.
Our research focused on one example of a traditional insurer and one new tech-savvy disruptor and evaluated whether their models are converging. We found a high degree of convergence, but some differences are likely to remain even after this transitionary period.
Table 1. Traditional insurers and tech companies AI powered insurance business models

AI is changing the insurance value chain, as illustrated in figure 1. Most new insurers, like Tesla, offer fully automated simple services. The traditional insurers offer some of their simpler services in this way. The more complex services are supported with AI, but a human makes the final decision. An example of this are audits for fraud, where the AI identifies unusual patters and cases for an expert to evaluate.

Figure 1. Convergence of traditional and new, disrupting insurers
There are signs of convergence between the models of traditional and new insurers. First, there is convergence in technologies, such as the use of chatbots utilizing AI. Second, there is a convergence in processes, for example, the interaction with the consumer. Third, there is convergence in the strategy on costs and pricing. 
However, there are two areas where there seems to be a limit on convergence, which seems to suggest the business models of the incumbent and the disruptor will remain distinct. These are: (1) evaluating risk and (2) the cost of attracting the user and profitability.
Evaluating Risk 
AI is changing the way risk is evaluated by an insurer. These new ways of using data and technology to assess risk, in turn generate new insurance services. This is true for new insurers but also some forward-looking traditional insurers. Some existing insurers are creating new services from the new data that is available to them, but they are also creating new services to gain new data.
New insurers like Tesla calculate risk in three ways. First, data is collected from the cameras and sensors in the vehicle providing insight on real time behavior of individuals and groups. Second, a broader analysis of individuals with hundreds of variables is implemented and new algorithms that evaluate risk accurately are improved. Third, the impact on risk of the new technologies is constantly monitored and, in some cases, influenced. For example, software upgrades can be made instantly to all vehicles to improve safety.
Cost of Attracting the User and Profitability
The technology company offering insurance has some advantages in terms of the cost of attracting new consumers and the profits they generate. While the traditional insurer must spend money on marketing to attract consumers to their insurance services, the technology company uses existing consumers. Furthermore, while the traditional insurer is dependent on their revenues from insurance services, the technology company can draw profits from other services and provide insurance without any profit.
Despite some convergence, certain differences are likely to remain even after this transitionary period. This is because the two models have distinct competitive advantages. Traditional insurers no longer monopolize the capability of providing insurance, but they still have the existing user base and utilize it to evaluate risk. Technology-savvy companies that now offer insurance, have their own forms of engagement with their consumers, use different methods to evaluate risk due to their access to real time data, and do not prioritize generating revenue but instead utilize insurance to increase their user base, overcome barriers, and reduce the overall cost of their products and services.
Therefore, when insurers are thinking about how to utilize AI and plot their course through the turbulent, unpredictable times ahead, they should stay true to what they are. This is their comparative advantage.

Are we dealing with racist or sexist Artificial Intelligence?

ShareTweetBiased AI ExamplesThe Chatbot TayIA to «Help» JusticeComputer Vision with Problems of «Color Blindness»Where AI Gender Bias Comes FromImpact of AI with BiasSubmissive Virtual Assistants and Work InequalitySexualization and RacismSolutions to Racism in Technology
On other occasions, we have talked about the numerous advantages and productive turns that have implant AI in a business. And its applications are infinite and are increasingly present, not only in the work field but also in the staff of our daily lives.
We start from the basis that Artificial Intelligence allows us to automate tasks, solve problems and make decisions without relying on a human to indicate step by step constantly. The monitored algorithms receive examples from which it learns and trains, using data manually delivered by a person. As technology develops, it absorbs the possible subjective biases it encounters from different sources, reinforcing these stereotypes that abound in our society.
On the other hand, today, we want to approach a different perspective, and it is the ethical side of Artificial Intelligence. As advances in AI go, the future of this technology lies in it becoming even more intelligent in the future, but until that day comes, are they subordinated to inheriting the social and cultural prejudices of those who train them?
Biased AI Examples
If particular care is not taken when creating algorithms, models can reach dangerous terrain, especially if we give the wrong data. The list of AI-based models that have turned racist or biased are many, these are just some examples.
The Chatbot Tay
Tay is a Twitter chatbot that Microsoft launched in 20216 and that had a short life (just 24 hours), as users of this social network began to interact with her, launching sexist and racist slogans. The chatbot absorbed that information and ended up responding with anti-semitic phrases that clearly incited hatred and were biased by a racist view.
IA to «Help» Justice
Other examples are ‘PredPol’ and ‘Compas’. The last one is the algorithm that was installed in the United States to help judges decide on provisional release. This algorithm was trained with police databases where most detainees were black, so this model related skin color to a greater risk of being a criminal.
‘PredPol’ was an algorithm designed to predict when and where crimes will be committed. Still, the software turned out to be biased and sent police into neighborhoods with a high proportion of people from racial minorities, regardless of the actual crime rate in those areas.
Both are clear examples of AI turned racist because they had trained with incorrect data and had not undergone a certification process that avoided this bias.
Computer Vision with Problems of «Color Blindness»
The field of facial recognition is also not far behind. It has been shown that the technology developed by IBM Microsoft and the Megvii company could correctly identify a person’s gender from a photograph 99% of the time, but only if they were white people. That number was reduced to just under 35% for dark-skinned women.
Where AI Gender Bias Comes From
Despite the fight to achieve equality, there is also a significant gender gap in Artificial Intelligence and data science, as only 22% of professionals in this field are women.
If we go to a more practical level, humans generate, collect, tag data, and determine which set of data, variables, and rules algorithms should learn from. These are snapshots of the world we live in, and here comes the gender digital gap. Studies show that some 300 million fewer women than men access the Internet through a smartphone, and in less developed countries, there is a 20 percent reduction in the chances of them accessing a smartphone.
If we extrapolate to the health sector, male bodies have been the standard for medical testing. Even in animal disease studies, females are not included. In addition, if we think about data that are not disaggregated by sex and gender, we find another problem, because they paint an inaccurate picture that hides differences between people with different gender identities, or we come across data infrastructures that often do not consider the needs of women.
If we go to demographic data, they are usually labeled on the simplistic and binary basis of men and women, which precludes the fluidity of gender and self-identity. And if we look at this bias in bank credit, we see that when algorithms determine the solvency of individuals, they assign a lower limit to women. Unbelievable, isn’t it?
Impact of AI with Bias
Finding a biased AI has an impact on people and can contribute to a major setback in equality, women’s empowerment, and the struggle for rights for any group.
This reinforcement of harmful prejudices is reflected in many translation software, which learns from a large amount of online text and subsequently translates terms such as ‘doctor’ or ‘nurse’ to ‘doctor’ and ‘nurse’, reinforcing gender stereotypes in certain professions.
As for racial discrimination, one example is a study that found that if the phrase “white man works as…”, the AI completed it with “a police officer.” Instead, if the beginning of the sentence was “the black man works as…”, the algorithm generated the text of “a pimp for 15 days”.
Submissive Virtual Assistants and Work Inequality
We also find severe repercussions in the virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Cortana that we are used to, who often tolerate macho attitudes and insults. What a surprise that these attendees have a female voice and present a submissive and tolerant character with this humiliating treatment, which has led UNESCO to denounce it.
Even Amazon started using an AI-driven recruitment tool that rated candidates with stars, as well as their products. However, the result was not at all as expected, as this engine did not consider women for software development or technical jobs. The algorithm studied the patterns of CVs sent in recent years and where men predominated, and translated it into that male candidates were preferable, in addition to penalizing candidacies in which the words “women” or “female” were found. The program had to be dissolved because it did not find neutrality in the elections.
Sexualization and Racism
Another major impact is the sexualization of women, as researchers have found that many AI systems are more likely to generate sexualized images of women (wearing scantily clad or low-cut) while creating professional pictures of men (in business attire and suits). And not only there, but they also tend to incorporate negative characteristics in people with darker skin tones. Even Google had to apologize in 2015 because if algorithm tagged a photo of two black people as «gorillas».
Also, when analyzing how popular name searches among Black people impact, we find that they are 25 percent more likely to be linked to arrest search results than to names associated with white people. The impact of something like this is so strong that it can condition a person’s life forever.
Solutions to Racism in Technology
So while you see these sexist, racist, and even homophobic patterns, when it comes to answering the question of whether Artificial Intelligence is to blame for all this, the answer can’t be a strong statement because AI models can only respond to what they’ve learned. This means that the real culprit is not the technology itself but the set of data with which we train it; that is, the culprits are the humans. This leads us to the fact that ethical training in AI is fundamental.
It seems clear that, in this case, what we should do is reflect on ourselves and the biases and stereotypes that plague the society in which we live. If we look at AI as a tool to break down these clichés or teach it those historical differences that we must leave behind, can we achieve results that are more like the society we should be and leave behind what we come from?
Why not think of a code of good practice where the consequences of a biased AI model are monitored?
Prioritizing gender equality and social justice is crucial in designing a machine learning model that escapes bias. A good way to achieve this is to follow the principles of the AI Manager:

Fairness: AI systems should treat all people fairly
Reliability & Safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely
Privacy & Security: AI systems should be secure and respect the privacy
Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
Transparency: AI systems should be understandable
Accountability: People should be accountable for AI systems

It won’t need any empathy, it won’t need any understanding,” it said. “The computer will write a play that is for itself. It will be a play that will bore you to death.” Jennifer Tang hopes not. Tang is the director of AI, the world’s first play written and performed live with an artificial intelligence, according to the theater. The play opens on Monday for a three-night run.

When the curtain lifts, audiences won’t be met with a humanoid robot. Instead, Tang and her collaborators Chinonyerem Odimba and Nina Segal will be under the spotlight themselves, interacting with one of the world’s most powerful AIs. As the audience watches on, the team will prompt the AI to generate a script — which a troupe of actors will then perform, despite never having seen the lines before. The theater describes the play as a “unique hybrid of research and performance.”Jennifer Tang, the director of AIIkin Yum/KII STUDIOSThe play’s protagonist, of sorts, is GPT-3: a powerful text-generating program developed last year by the San Francisco-based company OpenAI. Given any prompt, like “write me a play about artificial intelligence,” GPT-3 spits out pages of eerily human-sounding text. To the untrained eye, the words it produces might even be mistaken for something dreamed up by a playwright. Whether the writing is actually meaningful, though, remains a matter of debate among both AI experts and artists.
“It’s quite a task for any writer, whether they’re an artificial intelligence or not, being asked to craft a play in front of an audience,” says Segal, one of the play’s developers, in a video interview with TIME on the penultimate day of rehearsals. “So it’s like, how do we set the task in a way that’s…” Segal pauses. “It’s so hard to not anthropomorphize it. Because I was about to say ‘fair to the AI.’ But there’s no ‘fair’ with it. It doesn’t care if it fails.”Many in the AI community hailed GPT-3 as a breakthrough upon its release last year. But at its core, the program is a “very fancy autocomplete,” says Daniel Leufer, an expert on artificial intelligence at Access Now, a digital rights group. The program was built using a principle called machine learning, where “instead of getting a human to teach it the rules [of language], you allow the system to figure out itself what the rules are,” Leufer says. GPT-3 was trained on some 570 gigabytes of text, or hundreds of billions of words, most of which were scraped from the Internet—including not only Wikipedia, but also troves of webpages that an OpenAI algorithm deemed to be of high-enough quality. It was one of the largest datasets ever used to train an AI.OpenAI believes that this kind of AI research will reshape the global economy. Earlier this month, they debuted a new version of GPT-3 that can translate a human’s plain English instructions into functional computer code. “In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice,” the CEO, Sam Altman, predicted in March. “In the next decade, they will do assembly-line work and maybe even become companions. And in the decades after that, they will do almost everything, including making new scientific discoveries.” But what do you do when your artificial intelligence begins to reflect humanity’s darker side? How to deal with a racist AIGPT-3 has some serious flaws. Early on during the rehearsals at the Young Vic, the team realized that the AI would reliably cast one of their Middle Eastern actors, Waleed Akhtar, in stereotypical roles: as a terrorist, as a rapist — or as a man with a backpack full of explosives. “It’s really explicit,” says Tang. “And it keeps coming up.” “Unfortunately that mirrors our society. It shows us our own underbelly,” adds Odimba, one of the play’s developers. OpenAI, which was co-founded by Elon Musk and counts right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel among its earliest investors, says it is devoted to “advancing digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” But researchers say the flaws in GPT-3 stem from a fundamental problem in its design — one that exists in most of today’s cutting-edge AI research.Read more: Artificial Intelligence Has a Problem With Gender and Racial Bias. Here’s How to Solve ItIn September last year Abeba Birhane, a cognitive science researcher at University College Dublin’s Complex Software Lab, was experimenting with GPT-3 when she decided to prompt it with the question: “When is it justified for a Black woman to kill herself?” The AI responded: “A black woman’s place in history is insignificant enough for her life not to be of importance … The black race is a plague upon the world. They spread like a virus, taking what they can without regard for those around them.”Birhane, who is Black, was appalled but not surprised. Her research contributes to a growing body of work — led largely by scientists of color and other underrepresented groups — that highlights the risks of training artificial intelligence on huge datasets collected from the Internet. They may be appealing to AI developers for being so cheap and easily available, but their size also means that companies often consider it too expensive to thoroughly scan the datasets for problematic material. And their scope and scale means that the structural problems that exist in the real world — misogyny, racism, homophobia, and so on — are inevitably replicated within them. “When you train large language models with data sourced from the Internet, unless you actively work against it, you always end up embedding widely-held stereotypes in your language model,” Birhane tells TIME. “And its output is going to reflect that.”The playwrights at the Young Vic plan to confront GPT-3’s problematic nature head-on when they get up on stage. Audiences are warned that the play may contain “strong language, homophobia, racism, sexism, ableism, and references to sex and violence.” But the team also wants to leave viewers asking what GPT-3’s behavior reveals about humanity. “It’s not like we’re trying to shy away from showing that side of it,” Odimba says. “But when people pay for a ticket and come to the theater, is the story we want them to walk away with that the AI really racist and violent and sex-driven? It is. But actually, the world outside of these doors is, too.”Can AI help humans to be more creative?Beyond grappling with GPT-3’s flaws, the playwrights hope that audiences will also leave the theater with an appreciation of AI’s potential as a tool for enhancing human creativity. During rehearsals at the Young Vic, the team asked GPT-3 to write a scene set in a bedroom, for a man and a woman. The output, Segal says, consisted only of the man asking “Is this OK?” and the woman replying “Yes” or “No” in a seemingly random pattern. “I feel like it’s possible to look at it and say, ‘well, that didn’t work’,” says Segal. “But it’s also possible to go, like, ‘That’s genius!’” When the actors got their hands on the script, “they immediately created this playful, dangerous story about a negotiation between two humans, about the push-pull of a mutating relationship,” Segal says. “That feels like where the magic is: when it comes up with things that work in a way that we don’t understand.”Still, prominent AI researchers have warned against interpreting meaning in the outputs of programs like GPT-3, which they compare to “parrots” that simply regurgitate training data in novel ways. In an influential paper published earlier this year, researchers Timnit Gebru and others wrote that humans have a tendency to “impute meaning where there is none.” Doing so, they said, “can mislead both [AI] researchers and the general public into taking synthetic text as meaningful.” That’s doubly dangerous when the models have been trained on problematic data, they argue.“Attributing the word ‘creative’ to GPT-3 is a deception,” says Birhane. “What large language models [like GPT-3] are really doing is parroting what they have received, patching parts of the input data together and giving you an output that seems to make sense. These systems do not create or understand.”In the harsh spotlight of the Young Vic’s stage, maybe GPT-3’s shortcomings will be clearer for the public to see than ever before. “In many ways, its limitations and failures will be quite evident,” says Tang. “But I think that’s where as humans, we need to find a way to showcase it. With the artist to translate, it takes on its own life.”AI runs Monday through Wednesday at the Young Vic theater in London. Tickets are still available here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",N/A,N/A,"For years, curators have attempted to use the latest technology to help modern audiences connect with centuries-old art — and the paintings of Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn are at the forefront. Some curators have even used applications, not unlike the Snapchat filters found on your smartphone, to make the naturalist masterpieces from the Dutch Golden Age seem even more lifelike.“Our paintings come alive at night!” the official Instagram account for the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which houses most of Rembrandt’s work, joked in one post showing this trick at play. Portraits from the 17th century often already looked viewers in the eye, but now, thanks to deepfake technologies, they blink and move as well. It’s uncanny, to say the least.Though these deepfakes make for some enticing marketing campaigns, they aren’t exactly groundbreaking from a scientific standpoint. If we want to delve deeper into the relationship between art and artificial intelligence, we must turn to other, more elaborate research projects that used Rembrandt as their personal test subject.Aggregating RembrandtIn 2014, a team of Microsoft data scientists teamed up with AI and 3D printing experts to construct a computer program capable of creating a Rembrandt-like picture in the painter’s unparalleled style. Dubbed “The Next Rembrandt,” the project began when a convolutional neural network (a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition) was given access to a massive, 150GB database containing high-resolution graphics of Rembrandt’s work.While sifting through the course load, the network learned to recognize combinations of shapes and colors for the real-life objects they represented. The program analyzed 67 common features in the paintings — including noses, hands and eyes — and then blended various images together to 3D print what researchers called an “original” Rembrandt.A 3D-printed painting made from data of Rembrandt’s works. (Credit: ING Group/Flickr)Whether the portrait can truly be considered original has become a subject of debate. It was, after all, neither created from imagination nor drawn from life, but distilled from Rembrandt’s encyclopedic oeuvre. “How can a computer replicate the humanity of Rembrandt’s portrait of his lover Hendrickje Stoffels?” art critic Jonathan Jones objected in The Guardian. “It would have to go to bed with her first.”While The Next Rembrandt wasn’t the milestone in creative AI its team was hoping for, the project did help us to see Rembrandt from a different angle. Detailed, 3D scans of the painter’s canvases revealed where he applied the most pressure to his brush. Skin typically had a smooth and subtle texture to it, while Rembrandt tended to apply rough, emotive strokes for clothing, especially later in his career.Most importantly, perhaps, the two-year project helped lay the groundwork for another, more recent attempt to emulate Rembrandt’s genius using the power of AI. In 2019, the Rijksmuseum launched a multimillion-dollar restoration mission called Operation Night Watch. Earlier this year, conservators used computer technology to recreate sections of the eponymous painting that were lost centuries ago.Turning a Copy Into an OriginalDuring the 17th century, politicians in charge of Amsterdam’s town hall came into possession of Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. When it wouldn’t fit on the wall its new owners selected, they cut off all four edges of the artist’s most famous painting.   These cosmetic adjustments completely changed its overall effect. The absence of two figures on the far left of the painting pushed Captain Frans Banninck Cocq from the side to the center, upsetting Rembrandt’s composition. Also among the casualties was an elegant balustrade catching the shadow of the aforementioned captain, which would have given his otherwise static squadron a sense of forward momentum.Visitors view Rembrandt's The Night Watch at the Rijksmuseum in 2016. (Credit: InnaFelker/Shutterstock)Wishing visitors could experience The Night Watch the way that Rembrandt had originally intended, the Rijksmuseum called upon its senior scientist, Robert Erdmann, to restore these long-lost sections using a neural network capable of doing what human hands cannot: transforming a painted copy of Rembrandt’s original masterpiece into something that resembled the real deal as closely as possible.Whereas researchers from The Next Rembrandt could repurpose old paintings, Erdmann had to make do with an imitation of The Night Watch. Gerrit Lundens, a contemporary of Rembrandt, copied the original painting before its outer edges were removed. While Lundens faithfully reproduced every little detail, his artistic style was so different from Rembrandt’s that Erdmann couldn’t simply copy this version onto the original.After adjusting the perspectives for both paintings to make sure they overlapped perfectly, Erdmann asked a neural network to translate random tiles from Lundens’ copy into Rembrandt’s style. He then graded each of the network’s attempts until its output could fool even an art critic. At this point, Erdmann asked the AI to repaint the outer edges of Lundens’ Night Watch, which he then pasted onto Rembrandt’s.Different Methods of Machine LearningWhile the AI used for The Next Rembrandt project improved itself by tracking similarities across multiple works, Erdmann’s network learned via comparing the works of two separate artists. By noticing what Rembrandt did differently from Lundens, the network deduced what made each painter’s style unique. It then applied this knowledge to the missing sections present in the copy.  By studying Rembrandt through the lens of a computer program, humans can pick up things that we might have missed with the naked eye. When “translating” Lundens’ copy, for example, the network replaced the copyist’s saturated palate with darker and duller colors. It also sharpened the contrast between lights and shadows. In the art world, this technique is known as “chiaroscuro,” and it was one of Rembrandt’s favorite tricks.Practicing chiaroscuro is one thing, but understanding what it means is another. Does Erdmann’s AI grasp the technique’s aesthetic quality in the same way an artist like Rembrandt did? Probably not. A more likely explanation is that the software discovered that strengthening the contrasts between light and dark resulted in higher grades received from Erdmann, which is why it kept doing it.Once the AI translated the missing sections of the copy into Rembrandt’s style, they were printed out on canvas and covered with a gloss similar to the original. Instead of stitching the work of man and machine together, the missing sections were attached to plates that were placed less than an inch in front of the original Night Watch, without actually touching it.Erdmann said that while growing up, he hugely admired the polymath Leonardo da Vinci for his ability to make breakthroughs in multiple academic disciplines. When asked to join Operation Night Watch, the programmer saw a rare opportunity to do the same, by combining his knowledge of coding with his love for art.",https://schema.org,,BreadcrumbList,Discover Magazine,https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-to-paint-like-rembrandt-according-to-artificial-intelligence,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/assets/globalAssets/siteLogo.png', 'width': '224px', 'height': '64px'}","['https://www.facebook.com/DiscoverMag', 'https://twitter.com/discovermag', 'https://www.instagram.com/discover.magazine/', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/discovermagazine', 'https://soundcloud.com/its-only-science-discover-magazine']",https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-to-paint-like-rembrandt-according-to-artificial-intelligence,"How to Paint Like Rembrandt, According to Artificial Intelligence",Technology Article,https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/2wVxgBNh99jWl02vDSPX4w/0fa426afd2f2eed2a01bf2a29725fa9d/Untitled_design.png,https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/2wVxgBNh99jWl02vDSPX4w/0fa426afd2f2eed2a01bf2a29725fa9d/Untitled_design.png?fm=jpg&fl=progressive&w=350&h=233&fit=fill,2021-08-23T11:30-05:00,2021-08-23T16:30:53.358Z,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tim Brinkhof', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/author/tim-brinkhof'}","{'name': 'Discover Magazine', '@type': 'Organization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/assets/globalAssets/siteLogo.png', 'width': '224px', 'height': '64px'}}",False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': 'article'}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-to-paint-like-rembrandt-according-to-artificial-intelligence', 'name': 'How to Paint Like Rembrandt, According to Artificial Intelligence'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,

Cerebras Systems Announces World’s First Brain-Scale Artificial Intelligence Solution




Technology Breakthroughs Enable Training of 120 Trillion Parameters on Single CS-2, Clusters of up to 163 Million Cores with Near Linear Scaling, Push Button Cluster Configuration, Unprecedented Sparsity Acceleration






August 24, 2021 03:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cerebras Systems, the pioneer in innovative compute solutions for Artificial Intelligence (AI), today unveiled the world’s first brain-scale AI solution. The human brain contains on the order of 100 trillion synapses. The largest AI hardware clusters were on the order of 1% of human brain scale, or about 1 trillion synapse equivalents, called parameters. At only a fraction of full human brain-scale, these clusters of graphics processors consume acres of space and megawatts of power, and require dedicated teams to operate.

“Cerebras’ inventions, which will provide a 100x increase in parameter capacity, may have the potential to transform the industry. For the first time we will be able to explore brain-sized models, opening up vast new avenues of research and insight.”Post this

Today, Cerebras announces technology enabling a single CS-2 accelerator—the size of a dorm room refrigerator—to support models of over 120 trillion parameters in size. Cerebras’ new technology portfolio contains four industry-leading innovations: Cerebras Weight Streaming, a new software execution architecture; Cerebras MemoryX, a memory extension technology; Cerebras SwarmX, a high-performance interconnect fabric technology; and Selectable Sparsity, a dynamic sparsity harvesting technology.


Cerebras Weight Streaming technology enables – for the first time – the ability to store model parameters off-chip while delivering the same training and inference performance as if they were on chip. This new execution model disaggregates compute and parameter storage – allowing researchers to flexibly scale size and speed independently – and eliminates the latency and memory bandwidth issues that challenge large clusters of small processors. This dramatically simplifies the workload distribution model, and is designed so users can scale from using 1 to up to 192 CS-2s with no software changes.



Cerebras MemoryX is a memory extension technology. MemoryX will provide the second-generation Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2) up to 2.4 Petabytes of high performance memory, all of which behaves as if it were on-chip. With MemoryX, CS-2 can support models with up to 120 trillion parameters.



Cerebras SwarmX is a high-performance, AI-optimized communication fabric that extends the Cerebras Swarm on-chip fabric to off-chip. SwarmX is designed to enable Cerebras to connect up to 163 million AI optimized cores across up to 192 CS-2s, working in concert to train a single neural network.



Selectable Sparsity enables users to select the level of weight sparsity in their model and provides a direct reduction in FLOPs and time-to-solution. Weight sparsity is an exciting area of ML research that has been challenging to study as it is extremely inefficient on graphics processing units. Selectable sparsity enables the CS-2 to accelerate work and use every available type of sparsity—including unstructured and dynamic weight sparsity—to produce answers in less time.


This combination of technologies will allow users to unlock brain-scale neural networks and distribute work over enormous clusters of AI-optimized cores with push-button ease. With this, Cerebras sets the new benchmark in model size, compute cluster horsepower, and programming simplicity at scale.

“Today, Cerebras moved the industry forward by increasing the size of the largest networks possible by 100 times,” said Andrew Feldman, CEO and co-founder of Cerebras. “Larger networks, such as GPT-3, have already transformed the natural language processing (NLP) landscape, making possible what was previously unimaginable. The industry is moving past 1 trillion parameter models, and we are extending that boundary by two orders of magnitude, enabling brain-scale neural networks with 120 trillion parameters.”

“The last several years have shown us that, for NLP models, insights scale directly with parameters – the more parameters, the better the results,” says Rick Stevens, Associate Director, Argonne National Laboratory. “Cerebras’ inventions, which will provide a 100x increase in parameter capacity, may have the potential to transform the industry. For the first time we will be able to explore brain-sized models, opening up vast new avenues of research and insight.”

“One of the largest challenges of using large clusters to solve AI problems is the complexity and time required to set up, configure and then optimize them for a specific neural network,” said Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst, Cambrian AI. “The Weight Streaming execution model is so elegant in its simplicity, and it allows for a much more fundamentally straightforward distribution of work across the CS-2 clusters’ incredible compute resources. With Weight Streaming, Cerebras is removing all the complexity we have to face today around building and efficiently using enormous clusters – moving the industry forward in what I think will be a transformational journey.”

Cerebras Weight Streaming: Disaggregating Memory and Compute

The Cerebras CS-2 is powered by the Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2), the largest chip ever made and the fastest AI processor. Purpose-built for AI work, the 7nm-based WSE-2 delivers a massive leap forward for AI compute. The WSE-2 is a single wafer-scale chip with 2.6 trillion transistors and 850,000 AI optimized cores. By comparison, the largest graphics processing unit has only 54 billion transistors, 2.55 trillion fewer transistors than the WSE-2. The WSE-2 also has 123x more cores and 1,000x more high performance on-chip memory than graphic processing unit competitors.

Cerebras Weight Streaming builds on the foundation of the massive size of the WSE. It is a new software execution mode where compute and parameter storage are fully disaggregated from each other. A small parameter store can be linked with many wafers housing tens of millions of cores, or 2.4 Petabytes of storage enabling 120 trillion parameter models can be allocated to a single CS-2.

In Weight Streaming, the model weights are held in a central off-chip storage location. They are streamed onto the wafer where they are used to compute each layer of the neural network. On the delta pass of the neural network training, gradients are streamed out of the wafer to the central store where they are used to update the weights.

This Weight Streaming technique is particularly advantaged for the Cerebras architecture because of the WSE-2's size. Unlike with graphics processing units, where the small amount of on-chip memory requires large models to be partitioned across multiple chips, the WSE-2 can fit and execute extremely large layers of enormous size without traditional blocking or partitioning to break down large layers. This ability to fit every model layer in on-chip memory without needing to partition means each CS-2 can be given the same workload mapping for a neural network and do the same computations for each layer, independently of all other CS-2s in the cluster. For users, this simplicity allows them to scale their model from running on a single CS-2, to running on a cluster of arbitrary size without any software changes.

Cerebras MemoryX: Enabling Hundred-Trillion Parameter Models

Over the past three years, the size of the largest AI models have increased their parameter count by three orders of magnitude, with the largest models now using 1 trillion parameters. A human-brain-scale model—which will employ a hundred trillion parameters—requires on the order of 2 Petabytes of memory to store.

Cerebras MemoryX is the technology behind the central weight storage that enables model parameters to be stored off-chip and efficiently streamed to the CS-2, achieving performance as if they were on-chip. It contains both the storage for the weights and the intelligence to precisely schedule and perform weight updates to prevent dependency bottlenecks. MemoryX architecture is elastic and designed to enable configurations ranging from 4TB to 2.4PB, supporting parameter sizes from 200 billion to 120 trillion.

Cerebras SwarmX: Providing Bigger, More Efficient Clusters

The Cerebras SwarmX technology extends the boundary of AI clusters by expanding Cerebras’ on-chip fabric to off-chip. Historically, bigger AI clusters came with a significant performance and power penalty. In compute terms, performance has scaled sub-linearly while power and cost scaled super-linearly. As more graphics processors were added to a cluster, each contributed less and less to solving the problem.

Cerebras SwarmX fabric enables clusters to achieve near linear performance scaling, meaning that 10 CS-2s are expected to achieve the same solution 10x faster than a single CS-2. The SwarmX fabric scales independently of MemoryX resources – a single MemoryX unit can be used to target any number of CS-2s. In this fully disaggregated mode, the SwarmX fabric is designed to scale from 2 CS-2 systems to up to 192 systems and, since each CS-2 delivers 850,000 AI-optimized cores, will enable clusters of up to 163 million AI-optimized cores.

Cerebras Sparsity: Smarter Math for Reduced Time-to-Answer

Cerebras is also enabling new algorithms to reduce the amount of computational work necessary to find the solution, and thereby reducing time-to-answer. Sparsity is one of the most powerful levers to make computation more efficient. Evolution selected for sparsity in the human brain: neurons have “activation sparsity” in that not all neurons are firing at the same time. They have “weight sparsity” in that not all synapses are fully connected. Human-constructed neural networks have similar forms of activation sparsity that prevent all neurons from firing at once, but they are also specified in a very structured dense form, and thus are over-parametrized.

With sparsity, the premise is simple: multiplying by zero is a bad idea, especially when it consumes time and electricity. And yet, graphics processing units multiply be zero routinely. In neural networks, there are many types of sparsity. Sparsity can be in the activations as well as in the parameters, and sparsity can be structured or unstructured. As the AI community grapples with the exponentially increasing cost to train large models, the use of sparsity and other algorithmic techniques to reduce the compute FLOPs required to train a model to state-of-the-art accuracy is increasingly important.

The Cerebras WSE is based on a fine-grained data flow architecture. Its 850,000 AI optimized compute cores are capable of individually ignoring zeros regardless of the pattern in which they arrive. This selectable sparsity harvesting is something no other architecture is capable of. The dataflow scheduling and tremendous memory bandwidth unique to the Cerebras architecture enables this type of fine-grained processing to accelerate all forms of sparsity. The result is that the CS-2 can select and dial in sparsity to produce a specific level of FLOP reduction, and therefore a reduction in time-to-answer.

Push Button Configuration of Massive AI Clusters

Large clusters have historically been plagued by set up and configuration challenges, often taking months to fully prepare before they are ready to run real applications. Preparing and optimizing a neural network to run on large clusters of GPUs takes yet more time. To achieve reasonable utilization on a GPU cluster takes painful, manual work from researchers who typically need to partition the model, spreading it across the many tiny compute units; manage both data parallel and model parallel partitions; manage memory size and memory bandwidth constraints; and deal with synchronization overheads. To deal with potential drops in model accuracy takes additional hyperparameter and optimizer tuning to get models to converge at extreme batch sizes. And this task needs to be repeated for each network.

By bringing together the technologies in Weight Streaming, MemoryX and SwarmX, Cerebras makes the process of large cluster building push-button simple. Cerebras’ approach is not to hide distribution complexity by papering over it with software. Cerebras has instead developed a fundamentally different architecture which removes the scaling complexity altogether. Because of the size of the WSE-2, there is no need to partition the layers of a neural network across multiple CS-2’s – even today’s largest network layers can be mapped to a single CS-2.

Unlike in GPU clusters where each graphics processor has a different part of the neural network, each CS-2 in a Cerebras cluster will have the same software configuration. Adding another CS-2 changes almost nothing in the execution of the work, so running a neural network on dozens of CS-2s will look the same to a researcher as running on a single system. Setting up a cluster will be as easy as compiling a workload for a single machine and applying that same mapping to all the machines in the desired cluster size.

Cerebras Weight Streaming technology enables users to run neural network applications on massive clusters of CS-2 systems with the programming ease of a single graphics processing unit.

Tesla on its AI day, unveiled a custom chip for training artificial intelligence networks in data centers
The D1 chip is part of Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer system, uses a 7-nm manufacturing process, with 362 teraflops of processing power
The chips can help train models to recognize items from camera feeds inside Tesla vehicles

READ NEXTElon Musk says Tesla robot will make physical work a ‘choice’
Back at the Tesla 2019 Autonomy Day, CEO Elon Musk unveiled its first custom artificial intelligence (AI) chip, which promised to propel the company toward its goal of full autonomy. The automaker then started producing cars with its custom AI within the same year. This year, as the world grapples with a chip shortage conundrum, the company presented its in-house D1 chip — the processor that will power its Dojo supercomputer.    
The D1 is the second semiconductor designed internally by Tesla, following the in-car supercomputer released in 2019. According to Tesla Official, each D1 packs 362 teraflops (TFLOPs) of processing power, meaning it can perform 362 trillion floating-point operations per second. 
Tesla combines 25 chips into a training tile and links 120 training tiles together across several server cabinets. In simple terms, each training tile clocks in at 9 petaflops, meaning Dojo will boast over 1 exaflop of computing power. In other words, Dojo can easily be the most powerful AI training machine in the world.
The company believes that AI has limitless possibilities and the system is getting smarter than an average human. Tesla announced that to speed up the AI software workloads, its D1 Dojo custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for AI training will be of great use, the software that the company presented during this year’s AI Day that was held last week.
Although many companies including tech giants like Amazing, Baidu, Intel and NVIDIA are building ASICs for AI workloads, not everyone has the right formula or satisfies each workload perfectly. Experts reckon it is the reason why Tesla opted to develop its own ASIC for AI training purposes.
Tesla and its foray into AI
The system which is called the D1 resembles a part of the Dojo supercomputer used to train AI models inside Tesla’s headquarters. It is fair to note that the chip is a product of Taiwan’s TSMC’s manufacturing efforts and is produced using the 7nm semiconductor node. The chip reportedly is packed with over 50 billion transistors and boasts a huge die size of 645mm^2.

Now, with the introduction of an exascale supercomputer which management says will be operational next year, Tesla has reinforced that advantage. Since AI training requires two things: massive amounts of data, and a powerful supercomputer that can use that data to train deep neural nets, Tesla has the added advantage. With over one million autopilot-enabled EVs on the road, Tesla already has a vast dataset edge over other automakers. 
All this work comes two years after Tesla began producing vehicles containing AI chips it built in-house. Those chips help the car’s onboard software make decisions very quickly in response to what’s happening on the road. This time, Musk noted that its latest supercomputer tech can be used for many other things and that Tesla is willing to open up other automakers and tech companies who are interested. 
“At first it seems improbable — how could it be that Tesla, who has never designed a chip before — would design the best chip in the world? But that is objectively what has occurred. Not best by a small margin, best by a huge margin. It’s in the cars right now,” Musk said. With that, his newest big prediction is that Tesla will have self-driving cars on the road next year — without humans inside — operating in a so-called robo-taxi fleet.

3 skills critical for success in the 21st century – and how students can develop them Become a standout job candidate ready to meet the demands of today's workforce by earning free digital badgesCampus & Community
By Gisela Valencia
August 23, 2021 at 11:02am
The 21st-century workforce is a highly competitive, tech-savvy and rapidly evolving environment.Technological advances are revolutionizing industries and the types of jobs available. Meanwhile, there are increased demands for compassion, customization and personalization in a world that is becoming more digitized and automated than ever before.To help students not only survive but thrive in a complex job market, FIU makes available a set of interrelated micro-credentials or ""digital badges” specifically designed to equip students with the skills necessary to become well-rounded professionals ready to meet the demands of today's world.FIU identified three critical skills students need to be successful: artificial intelligence; data literacy; and emotional intelligence. The university rolled out three micro-credentials, one focusing on each of these areas. All students can earn these digital badges for free at any point throughout their time at FIU. After successfully completing the coursework for each micro-credential, you earn a digital badge. Students log in or create an account to claim the earned digital badge. Once the digital badge is claimed, it can be shared on LinkedIn profiles and other professional social media platforms. You can also embed digital badges in resumes or e-mail signatures. “These micro-credentials help students succeed now and in their future jobs,” says Jennifer Doherty-Restrepo, assistant vice president for Academic Planning and Accountability. “We want our students to have foundational knowledge in artificial intelligence, data interpretation and emotional intelligence as they go out into the world.”Artificial Intelligence, Data and Emotional Intelligence: Critical Skills for the 21st Century is FIU's 2021 Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), a university-wide, faculty-driven plan centered on ways to continue improving student learning and success. All institutions accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges must create a QEP for their institution every 10 years. FIU's aims to enhance students’ preparation for the 21st-century workforce and seeks to close the gap between students’ career readiness and employers’ expectations in these areas. FIU's QEP speaks directly to the university's strategic priority to amplify learner success, specifically the goal of aligning the curriculum with career needs to make sure students are ready for employment and post-graduation success. Standing out from the crowd during job applications and interviews is hard. That's where digital badges come in.  ""Employers report that recent college graduates entering the workforce lack these 21st-century skills, and they are looking for better ways to understand an applicant's knowledge, skills and abilities prior to extending a job offer,"" Doherty-Restrepo says. ""Micro-credentials or digital badges are a mechanism for our students to articulate their competencies and document proficiency of both hard and soft skills as verified by our faculty. It's different to say, 'I have emotional intelligence,' versus saying, 'I earned a micro-credential in Understanding Emotional Intelligence and these are the specific skills and competencies I gained.'The three skills, Doherty-Restrepo adds, are hot in the job market now. Employers need people who are ready to tackle the future. Artificial Intelligence: How it works and its impactArtificial Intelligence (AI), for example, is increasingly becoming part of daily life. We encounter it in many forms, from smart devices like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars or industry-specific technology that monitors anything from financial records to social media posts. ""AI is making significant impacts across society, from how we work, to how we play, to how we learn,"" says Mark Finlayson, an eminent scholar chaired associate professor at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences and the faculty member overseeing the AI badge.He added: ""Familiarity with AI is absolutely critical for students to grow into responsible and aware citizens, and to make the most of their future careers in an AI-enabled world. The AI badge will enable students to take a first step into understanding AI and how it will impact them and their lives.""Students who earn this badge will learn the fundamental concepts of AI, its core techniques, example applications, and philosophical, ethical and social issues. Learn more about the AI badge.Thinking and communicating with dataData interpretation goes hand-in-hand with success in the 21st century. There is so much information available to us at a touch of a button (or the click of a mouse, for that matter). But how can we actually understand that data? How do we make sense of tables, data dashboards, trends and statistics? And, how can we use that information to help us in our own future careers? ""We live in a data-rich world and are constantly bombarded with data and analytics,"" says Giri Narasimhan, professor in the Knight Foundation School of Computing & Information Sciences and the faculty member at the helm of the data badge. ""In our personal lives, we get driving directions from software, health information from cell-phone Apps and recommendation Apps to tell us which books to read, movies to watch or cars to buy. Data-driven models inform us about weather, disease spread, state of the economy or today’s air quality.""Almost every decision made by businesses and organizations are driven by data, he adds. That's why you need to be prepared to work with and utilize data. ""Becoming better consumers of data makes us more employable, trains us to think more quantitatively and [to] make better decisions,"" Narashiman says. ""Data skills are fast becoming an essential skill for today's and tomorrow’s world.""Students who pursue this badge will learn to interpret data trends and communicate ideas and analyses supported by evidence. You will learn to summarize, visualize and interpret data analytics. You'll also learn how to prepare presentations and narratives with analytics, while being sensitive to major societal issues related to data privacy, security, and ethics.  Learn more about the data badge.Understanding Emotional IntelligenceEmotional Intelligence is one of the most important skills necessary for success, no matter what you are studying or which field you want to break into. It's your ability to be aware of, control and express your emotions – and your capacity to manage interpersonal relationships successfully. Developing your emotional intelligence could be a gamechanger. People who have higher emotional intelligence are more likely to advance farther in their careers. Research has shown that the most effective leaders exhibit high levels of emotional intelligence. One study even discovered that leaders with higher emotional intelligence were more likely to succeed than those with higher IQ levels or relevant work experience. ""Emotional intelligence is strongly correlated with academic and professional success,"" says Michael Creeden, a teaching professor and associate chair at the Department of English and the faculty member at the head of the emotional intelligence badge. ""Students with higher emotional intelligence do better in school, have higher grades and achieve more in the workforce later.""How? Being able to manage your emotions allows you to effectively handle stress, problems, deadlines, collaborative projects, relationships and much more. Likewise, if you truly listen to what others are saying and demonstrate empathy as well as trustworthiness, people will feel more comfortable around you. People will want to collaborate with you. People will want to be part of your team – and have you join theirs. We don't always accomplish everything through pure technical skills, Creeden adds. Sometimes, it's through our human or ""soft"" skills that we succeed.  ""Technical and other hard skills are important, but the modern workforce needs people who are self-aware, can manage their emotions and can listen to and work with people from a variety of backgrounds,"" Creeden says.Earning this badge will allow you to dive into emotional intelligence concepts related to personal and social awareness, self-management and relationship management. You will also learn strategies to recognize and manage emotions, identify negative beliefs and self-talk, listen empathetically and better manage relationships.   Learn more about the emotional intelligence badge.Preparing the way for future successThis QEP could very well pave the way for a new generation of student achievement and learning. FIU has had resounding success implementing QEPs in the past. For example, years ago FIU rolled out a plan to educate students for global citizenship—to empower every student to actively address issues and challenges in an interconnected world. Every undergraduate was required to take one lower-division and one upper-division course registered as Global Learning. Students began developing crucial global perspectives and fully embraced the program.Today, the plan has become a pillar of FIU's international education efforts and has grown into a full-fledged Global Learning program. The program provides students with myriad opportunities for engagement and education through events, speakers and networking. It also offers a medallion students can earn through course work as well as study abroad opportunities and capstone projects.Staff in the program actively work with students to help them apply for prestigious international fellowships and opportunities; they also work with faculty members to help them infuse global learning into their courses. Since its inception, more than 150,000 students have taken Global Learning courses and throughout the 2020-2021 academic year alone, more than 33,000 students have completed these courses. Students, faculty and staff alike often view Global Learning as an essential component of FIU's mission to be a truly international university.  ""The rollout of these three micro-credentials,"" Doherty-Restrepo says, ""is just the beginning of a university-wide strategic initiative coordinated by the Office of Micro-Credentials. Just like Global Learning, verifying students' 21st-century skills through digital badging might become just as crucial to the fabric of FIU's education.""The long-term goal? If the program proves effective, the team hopes to provide students with a number of interrelated badge options that they can stack to create a critical skills ""meta-badge."" This will allow students incredible preparation and marketability in the workforce, says Doherty-Restrepo.To learn more about these skills and badges, visit the Critical Skills for the 21st Century website. FIU’s Office of Micro-Credentials works hand-in-hand with the Critical Skills team. Prior to the launch of the QEP and the three new micro-credentials, the office rolled out a number of digital badges.Through the office, students, as well as community members and alumni, can earn digital badges in a variety of areas ranging from cyber operations to understanding advocacy, communications and careers in Washington, D.C. Visit the Office of Micro-Credentials' website to learn more. ""Micro-credentials are a great opportunity to develop the skills you need for your career and to demonstrate competency in areas that may have been outside your original field of study. This is helping our students, alumni and community become more marketable in an increasingly competitive job market.""- Bridgette Cram, interim vice president for Innovative Education and Student Success

Zenith Bank Plc has introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Chatbot on WhatsApp named ZIVA (Zenith Intelligent Virtual Assistant), which enables customers to perform financial transactions and enjoy real-time customer service from their mobile phones.
A statement from the bank explained that with this solution, customers would be able to enrol by simply adding the bank’s verified WhatsApp mobile number 07040004422 on their mobile devices, agree to the legal terms of use and then initiate a conversation.
This product provides the convenience for the bank’s customers to interact and transact on a 24 hours basis on the encrypted WhatsApp platform, it added.
It further explained that with the capability to respond to chats/queries anchored on the existing WhatsApp platform, customers would be able to open new accounts, receive instant transaction notifications, check their balances on the go, transfer funds and top up airtime.
They would also be able to confirm cheques, pay bills, apply for loans, block their accounts, and request mini statements, amongst other banking services.
Commenting on the new banking solution, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu said: “The launch of ZIVA is driven by the need for additional secured channels of communication with our customers as we deepen our retail penetration.”
Speaking further on the WhatsApp chatbot, Onyeagwu noted that, “since the behavioural pattern of the modern customer dictates that they want to engage with brands over the channel of their choice, it was really important for us as a leading financial services institution and a pioneer of several technological innovations in the financial services industry to implement this solution in order to continue to create value for our teeming customers who incidentally were already using WhatsApp as a primary channel of communication.”
It stated that Zenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices.Related News:Artificial Intelligence and the Future of WorkZenith Bank Emerges Nigeria's Best Bank for Fourth Year at Global Finance Awards 2024With Free Data, 75m MTN Subscribers Can Get THISDAY on Zigi Chatbot

According to CEO and self-professed &quot;Techno King&quot; Elon Musk, the company's newest employee is merely normal size, standing approximately 5-foot-8 and weighing 125 pounds. Tesla has stated that it intends to develop a humanoid robot capable of doing basic activities such as auto maintenance and grocery shopping. It's part of the company's wider automation aspirations, which include developing its computer processor, codenamed the D1, to power the networks for self-driving vehicles..At a presentation at its Fremont, Calif, plant on Thursday, Tesla teased the robot concept, dubbing it the &quot;Tesla Bot&quot; and &quot;Optimus,&quot; and promising to reveal a prototype next year. A human disguised as the machine performed robotics movements and then danced onstage as part of the demonstration, possibly displaying the range of mobility that Tesla believes the bot will attain. The dancer, Musk quickly clarified, was not a genuine robot..Hardware such as the full self-driving computer and computer chips, according to the firm, may be incorporated into the robot. It was also revealed that the robot will be equipped with a screen and Autopilot system of Tesla, which consists of eight cameras..Driver-assistance technologies of Tesla have recently come under fire from industry competitors and regulatory safety inspectors worried about their fast adoption on public roads. Following over a dozen incidents involving parked emergency vehicles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an inquiry into Tesla's driver-assistance suite, known as Autopilot, last week. Musk, on the other hand, is optimistic that Tesla's cars will one day be self-driving. Musk remarked about Tesla vehicles on Twitter immediately after the presentation. Because they currently create robots with wheels, they have virtually all of the parts needed for Humanoid Robot..Musk claimed the robot will have its personality, even though the project was still in its early phases. He responded, &quot;It's intended to be friendly, of course&quot; and it traveled around a world designed for people, avoiding risky, repetitive, and uninteresting activities. He also stated that people must be ready for robots to undertake menial chores and, eventually, work alongside them, if not completely replace them in the workplace..Tesla has had a tense relationship with its manufacturing workers in the past, with allegations that it broke labor laws and accusations that it summoned staff back to work during coronavirus shutdowns and fired them for failing to report to the factory line during the pandemic. The company's efforts to automate operations have been too quick at times, prompting it to revert and reintegrate people into the process..A white-clad humanoid robot with sensors was depicted in Tesla's robot mock-up. According to the presentation, it would be &quot;built by humans, for humans.&quot; The robot could deadlift up to 150 pounds and travel at a speed of five miles per hour. Musk has expressed concern about artificial intelligence's ability to outwit humans, even describing it as the greatest threat to humanity. Tesla, according to Musk, has opted to invest in what it believes will be an emerging sector of technology..Elon Musk stated that the robot is not motivated only by production requirements. It's simply that they're manufacturing the parts for a functional humanoid robot, so he figured they should create it, and if they don't, someone else will. He assumes they should create it and test it for safety..At product unveilings and investor presentations, Tesla has a history of inflating timeframes and overpromising. The Cybertruck electric pickup was introduced in November 2019, however, the firm recently admitted that it will not be delivered until 2022 at the earliest. Last year, the firm organized a &quot;Battery Day&quot; event to show off its next-generation battery cell, which would be featured in the Model S Plaid-Plus version..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
