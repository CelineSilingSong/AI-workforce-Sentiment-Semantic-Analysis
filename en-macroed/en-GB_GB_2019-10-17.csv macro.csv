Every day we see continued development of new technologies, new applications, and greater investment in AI, machine learning, and the host of cognitive technologies. While we might be able to easily see how some of these technologies will be implemented in the short term, what does the future hold for widespread adoption of AI? In the 1980s the emergence of portable phones made it pretty obvious that they would allow us to make phone calls wherever we are, but who could have predicted the use of mobile phones as portable computing gadgets with apps, access to worldwide information, cameras, GPS, and the wide range of things we now take for granted as mobile, ubiquitous computing.  Likewise, the future world of AI will most likely have much greater impact in a much different way than what we might be assuming today.

One way of looking into the future that AI might bring is through Cognilytica’s four-part AI enabled vision of the future. In that vision, there are four main aspects in which AI will impact our future lives: the way we work, the way we live, the way we experience the world and our interactions with each other, and the relationship we have with data. (Disclosure: I’m a principal analyst with Cognilytica)

The AI-Enabled FutureCognilytica
The New Workforce & The Always-On Organization

As technology progresses, the nature of work and labor rapidly changes. It is the purpose of technology to eliminate burdensome tasks and improve our daily lives. Technology is meant to increase our productivity, and allow us to live our lives to old age with increasing quality. We have always seen adjustments to the workforce when new technologies become available, especially in the areas of automation and augmentation. It should therefore be no surprise that organizations in industries of all types are looking to AI to change the way that they run their businesses. As such, the adoption of AI will necessarily and unavoidably change the nature of work. 

PROMOTED
This is definitely the case for blue-collar work, which has already seen widespread change with the impact of robotics and automation. Automation has already replaced many positions in the area of manufacturing, but the bigger shift is not on the factory floor, but in the office cubicle. AI is eliminating much of the drudgery and repetitive work that has been farmed to service workers, or is otherwise taking up the time of more highly paid office workers. The use of various forms of process automation, from the less-intelligent, and ill-named robotic process automation (RPA) to the more intelligent cognitive automation forms, it’s clear that AI is here to stay in the organization. In the not-too-distant future, there will be just as many software and hardware bots operating the back and front offices of businesses as there are humans in the organization, and quite likely, many more bots than humans.
One positive aspect in this area of the AI-enabled organization is the realization that AI is making organizations much more responsive to their customer’s needs and desires. AI is making mass-customization possible for many different industries by leveraging the power of machine learning-enabled hyperpersonalization to tailor their offerings and build solutions customized for each individual customer, patient, client, or citizen. Through the use of conversational agents and autonomous systems, organizations are able to provide better customer service and better products and solutions to their customers by leveraging AI to churn through large quantities of data to build more accurate profiles of all of their customers. This impact can be felt even in the healthcare industry where AI is being used to provide personalized medicine and healthcare better tailored to individual patient needs.

Another benefit and change that AI brings is the “always-on organization”. With the use of conversational agents and autonomous bots, there’s very little reason for businesses to close. Even after the humans go home, bots are operating, providing both the expectation and the reality that users can do business at any time they choose. This is not only limited to ecommerce and purely digital operations. The AI-enabled future means 24-hr coffee shops that are fully automated, and banks that no longer operate on “bankers hours”. In the AI-enabled future, businesses simply don’t have hours of operation. They’re always in operation.

The future is Autonomous
AI is empowering the ability for autonomous operation of all types. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is autonomous vehicles, but this is just one specific application of autonomous systems - and not even the best one. In the future, all modes of transportation will become autonomous, and this will bring about a change in the way we think of things like vehicles. If we think of it in conjunction with businesses like Uber or Lyft where you can essentially call a ride on demand whenever, you no longer need to own your own car if you can instead call one and it can show up whenever we need them. Our society is heading in a direction that lets us imagine these possibilities.

Autonomous everything doesn’t just mean autonomous vehicles. It means that we can have autonomous systems and operations of all sorts, from the autonomous software bots we described above performing the perfunctory work required in most processes to the vision of autonomous retail currently being innovated by Amazon Go and others. The combination of computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, predictive analytics, and the world of intelligent sensors and devices means that we will be awash in autonomous systems of all sorts pervasive in our daily lives.
Enhancing the Human Experience
In addition to our work lives, AI will soon be a part of our overall human experience. We will come to use and sometimes rely on AI systems to enhance our daily interactions with each other, expand our creativity, and give us ways to express ourselves that we can’t otherwise do today. In the same way that spell check is part of the daily world of even the most casual of writers, AI will be used to give us powers of language translation and augmented creativity. Already, AI systems are helping those with limited artistic talents compose and produce original and powerful works of art and music.
AI systems are also having a great influence on how we communicate and socialize with each other. Humans are incredibly social creatures and one of the biggest developments to come out of machine learning technology is machine translation that can help humans understand and communicate in many languages. In the AI-enabled future, humans will be able to converse and interact with each other in the native language of choice, not having to worry about miscommunicating intentions. Machine learning models will be able to understand context, nuance, and colloquialisms that help to fill the gaps of human communication. This will make it easier for people who speak two different languages and don't understand each other to be able to carry on a conversation whether it is for business or for travel. AI is going to help us continue to meet our need to connect with others in meaningful ways. 
Changing our relationship with data: Pervasive Knowledge
The internet and mobile phones have completely changed the way we interact with others and the world around us. In the 1980s the concept of “pervasive computing” was nothing more than a pie-in-the-sky vision of everyone having computers available to them wherever they are, with instant access to data and information. It took just a few scant decades to make that vision a reality. Now we carry with us constantly-connected devices that have worldwide access to information. And now through AI, we’re moving beyond the idea of pervasive computing to pervasive knowledge. 
Pervasive knowledge is the idea that not only are we always going to be connected to the worldwide information grid, but all systems will have constant knowledge of what we are doing and how we’re doing it. This is the idea that people will already know things about you because of what is available for them through technology. On the positive side, this could mean a lot for disaster preparedness. If you think of instances such as an Amber Alert or tornado warning, 10 or 15 years ago you didn't get a text message when a kid went missing or a storm was imminent. The idea of pervasive computing made it an assumption that a text message would be sufficient to provide notification. But if you think about this, that’s a particularly non-intelligent way to do things. What if the system already knew that you were or weren’t in the path of a storm, could guide you to a safe place to seek shelter, and would additionally notify first responders if the storm hit the location where you were. This is the idea of pervasive knowledge made tangible, and it will impact everything from the way we shop to the way we live. 
The problem with pervasive knowledge is the “creepy” factor. To many, pervasive knowledge means pervasive surveillance. We don’t want systems to know where we are and what we are doing, yet we freely give this information away with our GPS-enabled phones connected to social media with cameras. While we might accuse governments or companies of tracking us without our consent, we are actually already freely giving this information in exchange for all the modern conveniences afforded by that pervasive connectivity. So too we’ll see people giving information to contribute to pervasive knowledge in exchange for even greater conveniences. 
The AI-enabled future will be a world where there is more access to all types of information and we are going to demand that those who have access to it use it smartly and use it for our benefit. This is going to mean that we're asking more of the people who have custody of this knowledge. We will demand that companies already know about us. We will demand that governments already have access to what they need to know. We won’t be patient with giving people information that we will presume they already should know. The future will be AI enabled and less patient.
We don't really know how soon or in what ways these visions of the AI-enabled future will become a reality, but even the most casual of observers can see that these are inevitable trends. The one thing that is certain is that it’s coming and we’re already heading in that direction. Companies are developing and investing in these technologies now. The future is AI enabled and it’s up to us to figure out what that means for our daily lives.

AI could help work out how many people are in large crowds

Artificial intelligence may be able to settle the debate over how many people attend protests or gatherings.
Vast numbers of people took to the streets of London this weekend to call for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. But exactly how many people were there is up for debate. Protest organisers say there were 1 million people, but when similar claims were made earlier in the year, they were disputed by fact-checking organisations.
A method developed by Reza Bahmanyar at the German Aerospace Center and his colleagues that uses artificial intelligence could help improve counts in the future.Advertisement
To create the system, the team hand-counted nearly a quarter of a million people in 33 images taken from planes, drones and helicopters, then used this to train an algorithm called MRCNet. MRCNet divides each image into small squares and analyses how many people are in each one.

The results are better than other AI-powered crowd estimation systems, proving 15 percent more accurate than its nearest competitor at reaching the correct number in a crowd. The system is much faster than hand annotation, taking 0.03 milliseconds to compute the number of people in each square.
At present, the team have only used the AI in lab conditions, but Bahmanyar hopes to soon mount the system onto planes and helicopters to do real-time counts.
Crowd science is inexact and slow to come up with estimates. “It’s a highly emotive topic,” says Keith Still at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK. Still invented one of the current best methods for measuring crowds, which monitors the routes people take, the density of the crowd and the profile of the participants to get an accurate estimate of numbers.
“I think in the right places, this technology could be really useful,” says Still. “Protest organisers and governments often don’t want real numbers,” he says. “They want marketing numbers. Will they invest in something that punctures their claim?”

In the longstanding argument about whether AI will replace or complement human beings, the new watchword is symbiosis. Most recently, Elon Musk used the term to describe how a brain implant might merge human and digital intelligence. But you don’t need to go full cyborg to achieve a mutually beneficial relationship between humans and AI. Instead, you can reimagine worker roles and business processes to enable people and AI to collaborate and achieve something greater together than they could apart.
Given the swell of fear and questions around AI — from how many jobs will be lost to who will train these new systems — the question of how to achieve human-machine collaboration has taken on new urgency. After all, these mutually beneficial relationships, focused on augmentation rather than displacement, stand to boost business value while lessening risk of people losing jobs.
In order to create a symbiotic AI workforce, organizations will need to use human-centered AI processes that motivate workers, retrain them in the context of their workflow, and shift the focus from automation to collaboration between humans and machines.
To test that proposition, our company’s innovation hub in Dublin, Ireland, conducted an experiment designed to see how human workers might augment the work of an existing AI system and embrace their new roles as AI trainers.
Evolving the AI Trainer Role
Working with a team of design, data, and software experts, and medical coders, we designed, built, and tested a software interface that enabled the medical coders to move from simply using AI to improving it, taking on the tasks of an AI Trainer, a role that teaches AI how to perform and iterate.
Medical coders analyze a patient’s medical chart, taking complex information about diagnoses, treatments, medications, and more, which is translated into alphanumeric codes that are submitted to billing systems and health insurers. This coding is critical not only for billing and reimbursement but also for patient care and epidemiological studies.
At the location where the experiment took place, an AI system had recently been put in place to assist medical coders in examining patient charts. Previously, medical coders read through charts and highlighted relevant information with a pen. AI took some of the heavy lifting out of this process by scanning the charts and finding information about drug treatments to support insurance payments.
We saw the opportunity for the medical coders, who are registered nurses, to further apply their expertise by training the AI system so it could more accurately validate genuine links between medical conditions and treatments. The duty of updating the AI links had until then fallen to a data scientist, who would look for patterns in the manual inputs from the medical coder experts and update the knowledge database accordingly. In the experiment, however, a new and simple-to-use interface allowed the coders to apply their medical expertise (and some basic statistical concepts) to update and validate the links in the AI database.

The resulting symbiotic system enabled the humans and the AI to each work to their strengths. With AI thriving at repetitive, straightforward tasks at high volume and accuracy, the coders were allowed to focus their skills and attention on the more complex cases that require domain expertise, decision-making, and critical analysis.
As their understanding of AI grew, the coders were able to make coding decisions that were beyond the scope of a non-medically trained data scientist. Achieving better outcomes than either the coders or AI system could independently, this workflow not only generates more value in the short term but also holds promise for longer-term improvements in patient care, based in part on the complex connections that coders make.
Enabling Human + AI Collaboration in the Enterprise
Though small in scale, the experiment has big implications for leaders, workers, data scientists, and managers seeking to shape the AI systems and jobs of the future. Turning workers who are merely consumers of AI into producers of AI results in processes that produce outputs of ever-increasing value.
To create these exponentially more valuable symbiotic systems, organizations should keep in mind these basic principles that emerged from our experiment:
Challenge the assumption that AI is always superior to humans. Leaders as well as workers often uncritically accept that assumption. In our experiment, the medical coders initially thought that human colleagues were making errors that were in fact attributable to AI. But as they continued to work with AI and understand its power and limitations, they came to recognize the source of the errors and how to address them. Rather than supplanting human skills, such collaborative systems can increase the value of those skills and improve the performance of AI.









Be open and transparent with workers about your plans for AI and its impact on their future. As we move to a more AI-enabled workforce, not everyone will welcome changes in their roles, skills, and responsibilities — especially when their livelihood is at stake. Workers are much more likely to embrace symbiotic systems than stand-alone AI designed to supplant people. When developing symbiotic systems, help workers who are not familiar with AI to develop a positive relationship with it. In our experiment, medical coders often referred to the AI they were training as a child to whom they were teaching new things.
Harness the intrinsic motivations of workers. The symbiotic medical coding system was designed to draw on the nurses’ desire to apply their medical knowledge. As a result, they felt committed to their new roles, in control of their work, and masterful at it. After working as trainers with the system, eight of the nine medical coders felt more positive about working with AI on a daily basis, and two-thirds felt positive about future job opportunities. Overall, they were motivated both to learn new technical skills and to further enhance their medical knowledge, which points to potential benefits for AI-enabled businesses.
Invest in people. When we think of investing in AI, we tend to think of technology first. That’s important, but people will drive the value for your business. Investing in your employees so they can build AI relationships into their roles is a long-term strategy that can unlock previously untapped expertise and value in your workforce.
For example, AI trainers are one of three new categories of AI-driven business and technology jobs, but many large companies are outsourcing the role. By contrast, our experiment enabled existing employees to apply their skills in a new way to train AI without the need for outsourcing. Further, technical re-skilling was not a prerequisite of working with the new system. In fact, with the right design, AI can be positioned as an easy-to-use tool that enables employees to do their job better.
Focus on function, not sophistication. Successful symbiotic systems will put simplicity before sophistication and value transparency and ease of use over complexity. Data scientists and designers will need to work together closely to create human-centric, symbiotic AI systems that enable human experts, like the nurses in our experiment, to train and continuously improve the systems without extensive training themselves. Meanwhile, data scientists — a scarce resource likely to grow scarcer — can use their time and talents to identify additional business opportunities in an organization’s processes rather than operating and maintaining existing AI systems.
Cocreate and experiment. Once you have identified the process or workflow where people and AI can work symbiotically, make sure all stakeholders work and experiment together from the start. Have designers and data experts collaborate as early as possible to ensure a useful and usable system. Engage users and cocreate with them to make sure their needs and motivations are heard and incorporated into design decisions. Assess how people use the system and measure not just productivity but also the qualitative aspects of the experience. Gather feedback from users; and if you see burnout, boredom, or dislike arising, then react and redesign as needed.

Looking To the Future
Relentless automation that bypasses human input is proving to be a short-term and unsatisfactory application of AI. At the operational level, an exclusive focus on automation leads to inflexible, brittle business processes. Worse, leaving people out of the loop forgoes a rich source of added value and squanders the expert knowledge the organization maintains. Worst of all, it cedes the future to competitors who choose to build symbiotic systems in which humans and machines continually improve each other’s performance.
To build such systems, organizations need to take the long view. With AI washing over virtually every industry these days, leaders are understandably eager to catch the wave in the short term. But they need to ask themselves how to position their workforce to harness the waves to come. That means thinking about and investing in roles and responsibilities that are three to five years away.
By taking this long view, coupled with a willingness to experiment, managers can make space for creativity, test for stakeholder buy-in, and design processes and jobs for maximum collaborative intelligence. As AI and humans get smarter by working together, the system grows organically in the hands of those who work with it most closely. By embracing symbiotic processes, the organization fulfills its ethical obligation to its most valuable asset — its people.

“Jexi” is a what-if movie, that sad brand of stale comedy that’s framed by a conceptually intriguing idea — like “Isn’t It Romantic,” which asked what-if-someone-was-stuck-in-a-romantic-comedy? With major studio comedies frequently tanking at the box office, this type of writing has become increasingly popular as producers search for a unique idea to get people into theater seats. This time, unfortunately, that didn’t work. In its opening weekend, “Jexi” grossed a meager 3.2 million dollars. For the benefit of those who didn’t see it (meaning most of the world) the film’s what-if question is what-if-a-cell-phone-fell-in-love?Phil, played by Adam Devine (“Isn’t It Romantic”), works an unsatisfying job at a Buzzfeed-style website making listicles about cats while pining for something more. When he buys a new phone, its unusually vivacious artificial intelligence software, Jexi, sets out to improve his life, and falls head over heels for him in the process. Of course, these feelings aren’t quite reciprocated, as Phil has fallen in love with Cate (Alexandra Shipp, “Love Simon”) and starts to use his phone less. 
 

Devine and the cast, especially Wanda Sykes (“Bad Moms”), are funny enough to carry mediocre scenes that have been done before in countless other comedies. The science fiction elements, centered around a sentient, emotional AI, are interesting at a base level, asking common but still pressing questions about artificial life and the future of human connection. Jexi herself is also hilarious, delivering expletive-filled rants with the dryness of a taciturn artificial personality like Siri. The movie is a strange combination of science fiction with a social point a la “Black Mirror” and a Lifetime network romantic comedy.The two genres in “Jexi” mix like oil and water. The science fiction is kept wall away from the love story, shoved into a subplot. The film employs elements from two distinct genres with widely different rules and conventions, without considering how they would appear in juxtaposition. Since a balance is never achieved, they manage to diminish the effects of each other. The romance comes off as frivolous and unrealistic, while the sci-fi appears impersonal, just a gimmick in service of the plot.On top of the blithe romance and its science fiction sojurns, “Jexi” clumsily tries to say something about society. It’s a basic message: Technology dependence bad, personal connection good. The opening scene is a montage of Phil diving into a cell phone to escape his parents’ troubled marriage. Then there’s Adam painstakingly working to create the “perfect” Facebook picture, slathering it in filters and emojis. Finally, and most ham-fistedly — a phone literally tries to stop Phil from having a human relationship. This idea would work if “Jexi” had any real humanity, yet everything about it invokes the superficiality of the internet age. The cinematography chokes in colors straight out of Snapchat’s most garish filters, and the music used wouldn’t be out of place in an Apple commercial. The characters are like Instagram personalities, too. They fit their assigned roles perfectly, without any blemishes, and there is never any real depth. Kid Cudi’s awkward cameo furthers the unreality.“Jexi” dispenses surface pleasures perfectly, conjuring brief laughs or mild interest, but in the end, nothing sticks. Its many disparate parts are too underdeveloped and contradictory to work. Satires about similar topics, like the episode “Nosedive” from “Black Mirror,” work because the comedy and science fiction are intertwined, combining to say something meaningful about the human experience. In “Jexi,” they’re too chopped up, which keeps it from saying anything at all. 
 

“Jexi” will be buried in the streaming sludge among other forgotten movies, joining the ever-growing pile of colorful, smiling thumbnails that don’t do much but look pretty. This seems like the most appropriate fate.

Artificial Intelligence Firms in China Face Brunt of Trade Dispute

The Trump administration is taking its issue with trade out
on several different Chinese entities. During the first week of October, the
administration banned 28-Chinese individuals by issuing restrictions with their
Visa’s. During the second week of October, the administration levied a ban on
six Chinese companies that work on artificial intelligence. These companies are
unable to work with US firms, accusing the companies of helping to violate the
human rights of Muslims in China’s northwestern province of Xinjiang.
According to sources, four of the companies, SenseTime,
Megvii, iFLYTEK, and Yitu, make software for facial recognition and voice
transcription. The issue the administration has with these companies is that
have been used in a campaign of repression. The other companies, Hikvision
and Dahua Technology, make surveillance equipment such as cameras that
incorporates artificial intelligence. This has also affected large online shares such as Alibaba, and Baidu.
The goal seems to be to hamper Chinese firms from making
program in artificial intelligence which is part of a broader effort by the
administration to hamper Chinese business. The expansion of the China’s tech
industry has coincided, with a rise in popularity of artificial intelligence.
The advancement in Chinese AI have broadened to areas such as facial and voice
recognition. This has the potential to drive the tech industry in China,
something the US administration is attempting to stifle during a trade war. The
US
Commerce Department added these firms to a trade blacklist this week.
Twenty government and security bureaus in China’s Xinjiang region were also included
in the ban.
The restriction prohibits the Chinese firms from doing business with US companies without a government-granted license. The US administration is now using a new tool in its arsenal against China. The shift in sentiment now targets Chinese human rights issues as opposed to just espionage. For example, Huawei has been the main target of US restrictions, with its 5G technology cited as a particular security worry. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between Chinese and US negotiators which has been weighing on riskier assets. In total, 28 entities were added to the US Department of Commerce list. 
The question for investors is why this matters, Artificial intelligence
technologies have the potential to make companies more productive but it
can also make national defense better equipped to wage wars. Trying to hamper
China’s AI companies could assist the US’s own national security and foreign
policy interest in the short term. The administration is also hoping to exert
tremendous pressure on the Chinese in the hopes that they can create a deal
that is helpful. 
China is still dependent on US and other foreign semi-conductor makers. This dependence has not gone unnoticed, by the US administration and they are keen to capitalize on this issue for their trade negotiations. According to BBC News only  16% of the semiconductors used within China are made in the country and only half of those by local companies.

Currently, this is done manually and as such, the workers run the risk of falling prey to tuberculosis (TB) and respiratory diseases..“A lot of tea workers suffer from TB, cancer etc as they spray the fertilisers and pesticides. We are hopeful that by using drones, we will be able to keep them away from the diseases,” Shetty said at a programme on the sidelines of a workshop of BRS Ventures at Maijan Tea Estate in Upper Assam’s Dibrugarh district..There is a concern about the chemical residues polluting air as fertilisers and pesticides would be sprayed from a height. However, Shetty allayed the fear saying there would be precision spraying..According to the Plantation Labour Act, the workers, engaged in spraying fertilisers and pesticides, should be provided with “protective gears” which include gloves, masks and goggles but few tea estates adhere to the guidelines. Tea workers’ unions alleged that TB and respiratory diseases were very common among tea workers and they killed many workers over the years..The BRS Ventures will use two kinds of robotic drones. Their application is expected to reduce the wastage of fertilisers and improve the quality of tea. One set of drones will scientifically analyse the health of plants, soil conditions and other natural factors while the other will spray fertilisers and target pests..The company also has plans to implant molecular markers in leaves to develop traits for mass production..“We have the technology to implant molecular or genetic markers in plants but tea is a new area for us,” said Avital Tractitman, an executive of Israeli SMX, who is attending the seven-day workshop..The markers help manage a plant’s genes by augmenting resistance to pests and improving the quality and quantity of production..Shetty, who was born in Udupi, assured that the use of technology would not lead to retrenchment..“None of our 26,000 farmers will lose his or her job. We will engage them in different areas,” he said..He used the phrase, “We are here to cooperate” several times in his speech and preferred to call the employees farmers to workers..For technological assistance, the BRS Ventures has tied up with several companies from the US, Australia, Scotland, Israel etc..“We worked on similar projects in Asia and the use of AI improved the quality of lives of the workers and increased production,” Nataraj Balasubramanian of the US-based Smart Farms said. .Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest","{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/good-news/2019/Oct/19/artificial-intelligence-to-improve-tea-quality-and-health-of-workers-in-assam-2050108.html', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/TNIE/import/2019/10/19/original/drone-.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",

Workers should prepare for robotics takeover

Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT  | Technology experts are calling on government and training institutions to prepare the next generation of the workforce for an aggressive world of robotics and artificial intelligence machines.
They say without taking a deliberate policy to skill the next generation of workers, robots and machine intelligence will push millions of people out of industrial, agriculture, financial and infrastructure sectors into a vicious cycle of poverty.
They say the dawn of that machine intelligence has already arrived into the country in the forms of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in the various banking halls, Smartphones, Drones and Hi-tech warfare capabilities.
Solomon King Benge, the Founder of Fundi Bots, a non-profit organization accelerating science learning in Uganda says that general intelligence, Artificial Narrow Intelligence and Super Artificial Intelligence machines, are taking the world by storm.
Most robots and machine intelligence perform pre-programmed tasks using sets of coded instructions. For instance, by studying how former President Barrack Obama speaks, a robot was used to fabricate statements which he never actually said to cause uproar towards him. The experts say, at this rate, it will be easy to frame many people in criminal activities and acts of pornography.
According to Benge, most of the jobs that will be lost to robots and intelligent machines will include manual and very dangerous jobs involving sets of repetitive procedures which humans dread as cumbersome or time-consuming. He cites stamping of big volumes of papers and moving loads back and forth around the rooms, offices or industries.
Benge says the most feared form of artificial intelligence that scientists believe will replace the majority of the human workforce is known as Super Artificial Intelligence, although it is yet to be developed at a global level.
The experts say that for the next workforce to survive the Robotics takeover, the government must put in place favourable mechanisms for training, innovation, orientation and regulation.
Benge adds that the human generation must be highly skilled in creative thinking, hold a high degree of empathy for humanity and develop high levels of competencies in decision making which those machines are ordinarily incapable of executing.
Dr Robinah Nakawunde Kulabako, a Senior Lecturer and Head of the Department of Civil Engineering at Makerere University agrees with Benge’s position. She says there is hope in the coming world of robots and machine intelligence since they are basically trained and programmed to follow basic instructions without critical thinking in unpredicted circumstances.

 

Dr Nakawunde says the government should prepare citizens to capitalize on the weak links of robots and machine intelligence to prevent loss of livelihoods.
“Where Machines have taken over, we will require human intelligence to engage in complex activities beyond the intelligence level of the machines. This will require training, change in policies and legislations” she stated.
Alice Namuli Blazevic, the Head of Technology and Innovation at Katende, Ssempebwa and Company Advocates says the world of robots and machine intelligence will bring better efficiency including wiping out corruption, delays in service deliveries and job creations when harnessed by those who are prepared for it.
The technology enthusiasts were speaking at the geopolitics Conference taking place at Makerere University under the theme: The Machines Are Taking Over.
Silver Kayondo, the Founder of Drone Nerds Africa, a Ugandan technology hub specializing in building drones says the government must take bold steps to understand the unseen opportunities in the emerging technology arena for better data protection and military capability as Africa presents itself as the frontier for testing potent technologies.
“When we ignore what the 4th industrial revolution is bringing towards us; we risk many things with our location in sub-Saharan Africa where many tropical diseases are common. We need to understand the impact with which some of the emerging technologies will bring” he warned.
