Amid widespread anxiety about automation and machines displacing workers, the idea that technological advances aren’t necessarily driving us toward a jobless future is good news.
At the same time, “many in our country are failing to thrive in a labor market that generates plenty of jobs but little economic security,” MIT professors David Autor and David Mindell and principal research scientist Elisabeth Reynolds write in their new book “The Work of the Future: Building Better Jobs in an Age of Intelligent Machines.”

The authors lay out findings from their work chairing the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future, which MIT president L. Rafael Reif commissioned in 2018. The task force was charged with understanding the relationships between emerging technologies and work, helping shape realistic expectations of technology, and exploring strategies for a future of shared prosperity. Autor, Mindell, and Reynolds worked with 20 faculty members and 20 graduate students who contributed research.
Beyond looking at labor markets and job growth and how technologies and innovation affect workers, the task force makes several recommendations for how employers, schools, and the government should think about the way forward. These include investing and innovating in skills and training, improving job quality, including modernizing unemployment insurance and labor laws, and enhancing and shaping innovation by increasing federal research and development spending, rebalancing taxes on capital and labor, and applying corporate income taxes equally.
The first step toward preparing for the future is understanding emerging technologies. In the following excerpt, Autor, an economist, Mindell, a professor of aeronautics, and Reynolds, now the special assistant to the president for manufacturing and economic development, look at artificial intelligence, which is at the heart of both concern and excitement about the future of work. Understanding its capabilities and limitations is essential — especially if, as the authors write, “The future of AI is the future of work.”

To address the time to develop and deploy AI and robotic applications, it is worth considering the nature of technological change over time. When people think of new technologies, they often think of Moore’s Law, the apparently miraculous doubling of power of microprocessors, or phenomena like the astonishing proliferation of smartphones and apps in the past decades, and their profound social implications. It has become common practice among techno-pundits to describe these changes as “accelerating,” though with little agreement on the measures.
But when researchers look at historical patterns, they often find long gestation periods before these apparent accelerations, often three or four decades. Interchangeable parts production enabled the massive gun manufacturing of the Civil War, for example, but it was the culmination of four decades of development and experimentation. After that war, four more decades would pass before those manufacturing techniques matured to enable the innovations of assembly-line production. The Wright Brothers first flew in 1903, but despite the military application of World War I, it was the 1930s before aviation saw the beginnings of profitable commercial transport, and another few decades before aviation matured to the point that ordinary people could fly regularly and safely. Moreover, the expected natural evolution toward supersonic passenger flight hardly materialized, while the technology evolved toward automation, efficiency, and safety at subsonic speeds — dramatic progress, but along other axes than the raw measure of speed.


The ability to adapt to novel situations is still a challenge for AI and robotics and a key reason why companies continue to rely on human workers for a variety of tasks.

More recently, the basic technologies of the internet began in the 1960s and 1970s, then exploded into the commercial world in the mid-1990s. Even so, it is only in the past decade that most businesses have truly embraced networked computing as a transformation of their businesses and processes. Task Force member Erik Brynjolfsson calls this phenomenon a “J-curve,” suggesting that the path of technological acceptance is slow and incremental at first, then accelerates to break through into broad acceptance, at least for general-purpose technologies like computing. A timeline of this sort reflects a combination of perfecting and maturing new technologies, the costs of integration and managerial adoption, and then fundamental transformations.
While approximate, four decades is a useful time period to keep in mind as we evaluate the relationship of technological change to the future of work. As the science fiction writer William Gibson famously said, “The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.” Gibson’s idea profoundly links the slow evolution of mass adoption to what we see in the world today. Rather than simply making predictions, with their inevitable bias and poor results, we can look for places in today’s world that are leading technological change and extrapolate to broader adoption. Today’s automated warehouses likely offer a good glimpse of the future, though they will take time for widespread adoption (and likely will not be representative of all warehouses). The same can be said for today’s most automated manufacturing lines, and for the advanced production of high-value parts. Autonomous cars are already 15 years into their development cycle but just beginning to achieve initial deployment. We can look at those initial deployments for clues about their likely adoption at scale. Therefore, rather than do research on the future, the task force took a rigorous, empirical look at technology and work today to make some educated extrapolations.
AI today, and the general intelligence of work 
Most of the AI systems deployed today, while novel and impressive, still fall into the category of what task force member, AI pioneer, and director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Daniela Rus calls “specialized AI.” That is, they are systems that can solve a limited number of specific problems. They look at vast amounts of data, extract patterns, and make predictions to guide future actions. “Narrow AI solutions exist for a wide range of specific problems,” write Rus, MIT Sloan School professorThomas Malone,and Robert Laubacher of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, “and can do a lot to improve efficiency and productivity within the work world.” Such systems include IBM’s Watson system, which beat human players on the American TV game show “Jeopardy!” and its descendants in health care, or Google’s AlphaGo program, which also bests human players in the game of Go. The systems we explore in insurance and health care all belong to this class of narrow AI, though they vary in different classes of machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, or others. Other systems in use today also include more traditional “classic AI” systems, which represent and reason about the world with formalized logic. AI is no single thing but rather a variety of different AIs, in the plural, each with different characteristics, that do not necessarily replicate human intelligence.
Specialized AI systems, through their reliance on largely human-generated data, excel at producing behaviors that mimic human behavior on well-known tasks. They also incorporate human biases. They still have problems with robustness, the ability to perform consistently under changing circumstances (including intentionally introduced noise in the data), and trust, the human belief that an assigned task will be performed correctly every single time. “Because of their lack of robustness,” write Malone, Rus, and Laubacher, “many deep neural nets work ‘most of the time’ which is not acceptable in critical applications.” The trust problem is exacerbated by the problem of explainability because today’s specialized AI systems are not able to reveal to humans how they reach decisions.

The ability to adapt to entirely novel situations is still an enormous challenge for AI and robotics and a key reason why companies continue to rely on human workers for a variety of tasks. Humans still excel at social interaction, unpredictable physical skills, common sense, and, of course, general intelligence.
From a work perspective, specialized AI systems tend to be task-oriented; that is, they execute limited sets of tasks, more than the full set of activities constituting an occupation. Still, all occupations have some exposure. For example, reading radiographs is a key part of radiologists’ jobs, but just one of the dozens of tasks they perform. AI in this case can allow doctors to spend more time on other tasks, such as conducting physical examinations or developing customized treatment plans. In aviation, humans have long relied on automatic pilots to augment their manual control of the plane; these systems have become so sophisticated at automating major phases of flight, however, that pilots can lose their manual touch for the controls, leading in extreme cases to fatal accidents. AI systems have not yet been certified to fly commercial aircraft.
Artificial general intelligence, the idea of a truly artificial human-like brain, remains a topic of deep research interest but a goal that experts agree is far in the future. A current point of debate around AGI highlights its relevance for work. MIT professor emeritus, robotics pioneer, and Task Force Research Advisory Board member Rodney Brooks argues that the traditional “Turing test” for AI should be updated. The old standard was a computer behind a wall with which a human could hold a textual conversation and find it indistinguishable from another person. This goal was achieved long ago with simple chatbots, which few argue represent AGI.
In a world of robotics, as the digital world increasingly mixes with the physical world, Brooks argues for a new standard for AGI: the ability to do complex work tasks that require other types of interaction with the world. One example might be the work of a home health aide. These tasks include providing physical assistance to a fragile human, observing their behavior, and communicating with family and doctors. Brooks’ idea, whether embodied in this particular job, a warehouse worker’s job, or other kinds of work, captures the sense that today’s intelligence challenges are problems of physical dexterity, social interaction, and judgment as much as they are of symbolic data processing. These dimensions remain out of reach for current AI, which has significant implications for work. Pushing Brooks’ idea further, we might say that the future of AI is the future of work.

Efforts should be undertaken to create AI curricula, and build AI literacy and skills of future generations.A 2019 study conducted by DataChildFutures found that 46% of participating Italian households had AI-powered speakers, while 40% of toys were connected to the internet. More recent research suggests that by 2023 more than 275 million intelligent voice assistants, such as Amazon Echo or Google Home, will be installed in homes worldwide.

A worker's guide to predictions, decisions and collaborationThis is the state of AI in 2022, according to three expertsAs younger generations grow up interacting with AI-enabled devices, more consideration should be given to the impact of this technology on children, their rights and wellbeing.Unlocking the potential of AIAI-powered learning tools and approaches are often regarded as critical drivers of innovation in the education sector. Often recognized for its ability to improve the quality of learning and teaching, artificial intelligence is being used to monitor students' level of knowledge and learning habits, such as rereading and task prioritization, and ultimately to provide a personalized approach to learning.Knewton is one example of AI-enabled learning software that identifies knowledge gaps and curates education content in line with user needs. Algorithms are also behind Microsoft`s Presentation Translator that provides real-time translation in 60 different languages as a presentation is being delivered. This software helps increase access to learning, in particular for students who have a hearing impairment. AI, though not always successfully, is also increasingly used to automate grading and feedback activities. Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesWith such broad potential for use in the education system, forecasts by Global Market Insights suggest that the market value of AI in education will reach $20 billion by 2027.In addition to education, AI is also advancing children's health. In recent years, progress in research on the role of AI in the early detection of autism, signs of depression from children's speech and rare genetic disorders has made headlines. There are also growing examples of the deployment of AI to ensure child safety by identifying online predators and practices such as grooming and child exploitation. Challenges to child welfareDespite the positive applications of AI, there is still a lot of hesitation towards the technology in certain regions. A 2019 survey conducted by IEEE revealed that 43% of US and 33% of UK millennial parents respectively would be comfortable with leaving their children in the care of an AI-powered nurse during hospitalization. In contrast, millennial parents in China, India and Brazil are more receptive to artificial intelligence where 88%, 83% and 63% respectively would be comfortable with a virtual nurse caring for their child in hospital. Similar findings were found for the use of AI-powered robots in paediatric surgery. Scepticism on the widespread use of AI is also present in discussions on children`s privacy and safety. Children's information including sensitive and biometric data is captured and processed by intelligent devices including virtual assistants and smart toys. In the wrong hands, such data could put children's safety at risk. For example, amid security fears, in 2017 CloudPets teddy bears were withdrawn from the shelves following a data breach that exposed private information including photos and recordings of more than two million children's voice messages.DiscoverWhat is the World Economic Forum doing to improve digital intelligence in children? Show moreThe latest figures show that 56% of 8-12-year-olds across 29 countries are involved in at least one of the world's major cyber-risks: cyberbullying, video-game addiction, online sexual behaviour or meeting with strangers encountered on the web. Using the Forum's platform to accelerate its work globally, #DQEveryChild, an initiative to increase the digital intelligence quotient (DQ) of children aged 8-12, has reduced cyber-risk exposure by 15%.In March 2019, the DQ Global Standards Report 2019 was launched – the first attempt to define a global standard for digital literacy, skills and readiness across the education and technology sectors.The 8 Digital Citizenship Skills every child needs Image: DQ InstituteOur System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Media, Information and Entertainment has brought together key stakeholders to ensure better digital intelligence for children worldwide. Find our more about DQ Citizenship in our Impact Story.Serious concerns have also been raised over the use of children's data, such as juvenile records in AI systems, to predict future criminal behaviour and recidivism. Other than posing a threat to privacy, civil society representatives and activists have warned against possible discrimination, bias and unfair treatment.The path towards child-centred AITo ensure that AI is child-centred, decision-makers and tech innovators must prioritize children's rights and wellbeing when designing and developing AI systems. UNICEF and OHCHR have been particularly vocal in this regard. As part of its AI for Children project, UNICEF has worked closely with the World Economic Forum to develop policy guidance on artificial intelligence for children featuring a set of recommendations for building AI policies and systems that, among other things, uphold children's rights to privacy and data protection. As part of its Generation AI initiative and conversations on global standards for children and AI, the World Economic Forum is also spearheading the “Smart Toys Awards” to maximize the learning opportunities of smart toys and minimize the risks posed to safety and children.Rate of automation in the workforce. Image: World Economic ForumEstimates suggest that, by 2065, 65% of children in primary school today will work in positions that have not yet been created. From a practical standpoint, AI should be incorporated into school curricula to equip future generations with coding skills and provide them with adequate AI training. At the same time, children should be taught to think critically about the technology and to inform their judgements about related threats and opportunities. Such efforts should be inclusive of all children and therefore should seek to bridge the digital literacy gap between the Global North and Global South. More global action will be needed to ensure that children's best interests are reflected and implemented in national and international policies, design and development of AI technologies. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence will change the way children interact with their surroundings including their learning, play and development environment. However, it is our responsibility to ensure that this change becomes a force for good.

Call360, a Doncaster-based provider of artificial intelligence analytics to business, has secured its largest ever contract win.
It has been hired by Dyno-Rod, following a competitive tender process. The five-year contract covers the digital channels for Dyno-Rod, which provides plumbing and drains services to millions of households across the UK.
For customers, the data collected will be used to improve service levels, while for Dyno-Rod the data will improve the efficiency of its marketing spend, by highlighting its most and least successful media channels and key words for advertising.
The AI technology works by tracking incoming calls to Dyno-Rod in real time, with the capability of reporting up to 97% accuracy on up to 10,000 calls in just 0.2 seconds.
The algorithms classify the calls into multiple categories, including customer enquiry, booking, customer complaint and job enquiries and they also report on the outcome of every call.
Alastair Donson, franchise improvement manager at Dyno-Rod, said: “The data provided enables us to make commercial decisions backed by the right insight, reducing risk and increasing revenue.
“Customer satisfaction is also improved through a deeper understanding of their journey and adapting our platform to deliver what our customers want.
“Not only does this work for both a national brand and customer but also provides our franchise network flexibility and control at a local level to manage and understand their own local market.”
In the last 12 months Automated Analytics Ltd – which Call360 is part of – has created 10 jobs in technology, business development and sales and marketing at its Doncaster head office.
Following £1.65m funding secured from Maven Equity Finance as part of the Northern Powerhouse Investment Funds – alongside the Dyno-Rod contract – the company is now in a position to accelerate its growth and create a further six jobs.
Mark Taylor, CEO and founder of Call360, said: “This is a major win for us and puts Yorkshire on the map as a hub for excellence in artificial intelligence.
“We have been investing heavily in building out the teams across the business over the last year and with the security that this contract and recent Northern Powerhouse funds bring we are on-course to triple the size of our Doncaster-based workforce within three years.”

If I were to ask someone why they chose a career in information technology, I doubt they would respond with “I love data entry!”, “I could debug code all day long!”, or “Handling tickets is so much fun, I’d do it even if I didn’t get paid for it.”
3 IT tasks that can be automated with AI
Fortunately, AI can help. Here are the top three ways AI can help automate manual IT tasks, thereby freeing up precious resources and benefiting your teams, businesses, and customers.
1. Debugging software
Grace Murray Hopper was a Navy rear admiral and computer programming pioneer who worked on the Mark II computer at Harvard in the 1940s. On September 9, 1947, Hopper traced an error with the Mark II to – of all things – a dead moth in the relay. The insect’s remains were taped in the team’s logbook with the caption, “First actual case of a bug being found.”
While Hopper and her team weren’t the first to use the term “bug” to describe a system glitch, they certainly helped popularize it. Of course, software bugs are decidedly unpopular. IT departments and software engineers have all felt the pain of toiling over lines of code trying to reproduce and locate problems.

To be as good as human engineers, an AI tool would need to possess levels of reasoning and creativity it simply hasn’t yet reached. But AI can still be tremendously effective in exception and anomaly detection. You train it on normal usage and it detects when something is off.
Another advantage AI has over humans is its pattern detection. Let’s say a system is crashing at the same time every week or after memory usage hits a certain level. An AI tool could easily connect the dots. AI can learn which behaviors of your developers and which code patterns that are checked into your repo are correlated to bugs. This can be used to notify developers that they have done something that is likely to break and ask them to check again.
If you had a moth infestation in your home, you could certainly go around swatting them one by one. But wouldn’t it be a lot easier to discover where they hide and put out traps?
2. Predicting future issues
The adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is as true in IT as it is in medicine. Monitoring operations and taking proactive action instead of just reacting to problems as they arise can prevent unexpected downtime and expensive failures.
CIOs and IT professionals are familiar with the value of preventative maintenance to some degree, whether it’s installing software updates or creating backups. That kind of maintenance is done after a certain amount of time has elapsed or usage has been logged. It’s like eating vegetables or getting exercise – they’re sound practices for a company.

Predictive maintenance, on the other hand, is individualized and custom-tailored. It monitors the equipment and its environment, performs tests, and receives equipment feedback to generate individualized predictions. It’s like having a blood test show that you’re pre-diabetic and in response, you design a low-sugar diet.
People may be uncomfortable with the idea of machines watching them all day. But with AI-enabled predictive maintenance, you watch the machines – with other machines.
 Dealing with IT tickets can feel like playing a perpetual game of Whack-A-Mole, but with all of the exhaustion and none of the fun carnival music and prizes.
3. Filtering lower-tier incidents
Dealing with IT tickets can feel like playing a perpetual game of Whack-A-Mole, but with all of the exhaustion and none of the fun carnival music and prizes.
As we all know, some incidents are worth your attention and others aren’t at all. And without a proper way to triage incidents, IT departments become overwhelmed. Enter intelligent filters. They’ve been around for years in search engines and email inboxes, distinguishing between good and bad, important and unimportant. For IT departments, they can distinguish between real incidents and noise.

Using AI techniques like case-based reasoning can help decide which solution to explore first or what additional information to request from a customer to make a diagnosis quickly and accurately. Case-based reasoning systems learn from success and failure, apply sophisticated probabilistic reasoning to identify promising solutions, and create a valuable knowledge base.
With intelligent filters and case-based reasoning, IT managers can better allocate resources for incidents that require human intervention.
While there are numerous existing AI applications that help IT departments – and many more yet to be discovered – debugging, predictive maintenance, and intelligent filtering are three applications of AI that are essential for any great IT department today.
As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our work, any organization that is not actively exploring automating its more manual IT tasks is wasting valuable financial and human capital – and may eventually fall behind.

AI’s J-curve and upcoming productivity boom

This article is part of our series that explores the business of artificial intelligence
Digital technologies, and at their forefront artificial intelligence, are triggering fundamental shifts in society, politics, education, economy, and other fundamental aspects of life. These changes provide opportunities for unprecedented growth across different sectors of the economy. But at the same time, they entail challenges that organizations must overcome before they can tap into their full potential.
In a recent talk at an online conference organized by Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), Stanford professor Erik Brynjolfsson discussed some of these opportunities and challenges.
Brynjolfsson, who directs Stanford’s Digital Economy Lab, believes that in the coming decade, the use of artificial intelligence will be much more widespread than it is today. But its adoption will also face a period of lull, also known as the J-curve.
“There’s a growing gap between what the technology is capable of and what it is already doing versus how we are responding to that,” Brynjolfsson says. “And that’s where a lot of our society’s biggest challenges and problems and some of our biggest opportunities lie.”

Machine learning and higher productivity

According to Brynjolfsson, the next decade will see significantly higher productivity thanks to a wave of powerful technologies—especially machine learning—that are finding their way into every computing device and application.
Advances in computer vision have been tremendous, especially in areas such as image recognition and medical imaging. Talking to phones, watches, and smart speakers has become commonplace thanks to advances in natural language processing and speech recognition. Product recommendation, ad placement, insurance underwriting, loan approval, and many other applications have benefited immensely from advances in machine learning.
In many areas, machine learning is reducing costs and accelerating production. For example, the application of large language models in programming can help software developers become much more productive and achieve more in less time.
In other areas, machine learning can help create applications that did not exist before. For example, generative deep learning models are creating new applications for arts, music, and other creative work. In areas such as online shopping, advances in machine learning can create major shifts in business models, such as moving from “shopping-then-shipping” to “shipping-then-shopping.”
The lockdowns and urgency caused by the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of these technologies in different sectors, including remote work tools, robotic process automation, powered drug research, and factory automation.
“The pandemic has been horrific in so many ways, but another thing it’s done is it’s accelerated the digitization of the economy, compressing in about 20 weeks what would have taken maybe 20 years of digitization,” Brynjolfsson says. “We’ve all invested in technologies that are allowing us to adapt to a more digital world. We’re not going to stay as remote as we are now, but we’re not going all the way back either. And that increased digitization of business processes and skills compresses the timeframe for us to adopt these new ways of working and ultimately drive higher productivity.”
The J-curve

The productivity potential of machine learning technologies has one big caveat.
“Historically, when these new technologies become available, they don’t immediately translate into productivity growth. Often there’s a period where productivity declines, where there’s a lull,” Brynjolfsson says. “And the reason there’s this lull is that you need to reinvent your organizations, you need to develop new business processes.”
Brynjolfsson calls this the “Productivity J-Curve” and has documented it in a paper published in the American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics. Basically, the great potential caused by new general-purpose technologies like the steam engine, electricity, and more recently machine learning requires fundamental changes in business processes and workflows, the co-invention of new products and business models, and investment in human capital.
These investments and changes often take several years, and during this period, they don’t yield tangible results. During this phase, the companies are creating “intangible assets,” according to Brynjolfsson. For example, they might be training and reskilling their workforce to employ these new technologies. They might be redesigning their factories or instrumenting them with new sensor technologies to take advantage of machine learning models. They might need to revamp their data infrastructure and create data lakes on which they can train and run ML models.
These efforts might cost millions of dollars (or billions in the case of large corporations) and make no change in the company’s output in the short term. At first glance, it seems that costs are increasing without any return on investment. When these changes reach their turning point, they result in a sudden increase in productivity.
The J-curve: There will be a period of lull before AI manifests its productivity potential. (Source: “The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies” by Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson)
“We’re in this period right now where we’re making a lot of that painful transition, restructuring work, and there’s a lot of companies that are struggling with that,” Brynjolfsson says. “But we’re working through that, and these J-curves will lead to higher productivity—according to our research, we’re near the bottom and turning up.”
Making the transition to AI
Unfortunately, adapting to AI and other new digital technologies does not run on a predictable path. Most firms aren’t making the transition correctly or lack the creativity and understanding to make the transition. Various studies show that most applied machine learning projects fail. 
“Only about the top 10-15 percent of firms are doing most of the investment in these intangibles. The other 85-90 percent of firms are lagging behind and are hardly making any of these restructuring needed,” Brynjolfsson says. “This is not just the big tech firms. This is within every industry, manufacturing, retail, finance, resources. In each category, we’re seeing the leading firms pulling away from the rest. There’s a growing performance gap.”
But while adopting new technologies is going to be difficult, it is happening at a much faster pace in comparison to previous cycles of technological advances because we are better prepared to make the transition.
“I think what is becoming clear is that it’s going to happen a lot faster in part because we have a much more professional class of people trying to study what works and what doesn’t work,” Brynjolfsson says. “Some of them are in business schools and academia. A lot of them are in consulting companies. Some of them are journalists. And there are people who are describing which practices work and which don’t.”
Another element that can help immensely is the availability of machine learning and data science tools to process and study the huge amounts of data available on organizations, people, and the economy.
For example, Brynjolfsson and his colleagues are working on a big dataset of 200 million job postings, which include the full text of the job description along with other information. Using different machine learning models and natural language processing techniques, they can transform the job posts into numerical vectors that can then be used for various tasks.
“We think of all the jobs as this mathematical space. We can understand how they can relate to each other,” Brynjolfsson says.

For example, they can make simple inferences such as how similar or different two or more job posts are based on their text descriptions. They can use other techniques such as clustering and graph neural networks to draw more important conclusions such as what kind of skills are more in demand, or how would the characteristics of a job post change if you modified the description to add AI skills such as Python or TensorFlow. Companies can use these models to find holes in their hiring strategies or to analyze the hiring decisions of their competitors and leading organizations.
“Those kinds of tools just didn’t exist as recently as five years ago, and I think it’s a revolution that is just as important as the microscope or some of the other revolutions in science,” Brynjolfsson says. “We now have them for social sciences and business to have this kind of visibility. That’s allowing us to make a transition a lot more rapidly than before.”
However, Brynjolfsson warns that not many companies are using these kinds of tools. This is perhaps further testament to his previous point that companies have not yet figured out the right transition strategy and are relying on old methods to restructure and adapt themselves to the age of AI. And at the center of this strategy should be the correct use of human capital.
“You have hundreds of billions of dollars of human capital, of skills walking out the door, and then the company tries to hire back people with the skills that they need. What they don’t realize is that the workers that they let go often had skills that were very adjacent to the ones they’re hiring for,” Brynjolfsson says.
With the help of machine learning, they will have better visibility and knowledge of their “skill adjacencies,” Brynjolfsson says. For example, a company might discover that instead of laying off a bunch of people and looking to hire new talent, perhaps all they need to do is a little bit of retraining and repurposing of their workforce.
“It’s much more expensive to hire somebody fresh than would have been for them to take some of those people who are already in the company and say, if we teach you Python or customer service skills or other skills, you can be doing this job that we’re looking to hire people for,” Brynjolfsson says. “My hope is that, in the coming decade, workers will be in a much better position to take full advantage of their capabilities and skills. And it will be good for the companies too to understand all the assets that they have in there, and machine learning can help a lot with understanding those relationships.”

This is our opportunity to edit out the age-old stereotypes, sexism and discrimination of the labour market, and to create a modern reality that serves the needs of both women and men.”Challenging ideas of ‘women’s work’, providing limited flexibility, risking skills lossThe EU’s body dedicated exclusively to gender equality interviewed almost 5,000 platform workers to understand who they are, why they do platform work, and what challenges they face.   A higher share of women than men told EIGE they do platform work as they can combine it with household chores and family commitments (women: 36%, men: 28%).Yet this flexibility is limited practice, with many working at night, at the weekend, and at hours they cannot choose. Platform workers can also be observed using time-tracking software, which deducts ‘low productivity time’ from pay. Such software can poses a particular threat to those caring for small children.   In platform work, there is a higher share of men doing jobs usually done by women than there is in the traditional labour market. This includes housework (women: 54%, men: 46%), childcare (women: 61%, men: 39%) and data entry (women: 47%, men: 53%).While this can help challenge stereotypes about the type of work done by women and men, EIGE’s survey shows that highly educated women are more likely to do jobs that do not match their level of education, which puts them at greater risk of losing their skills.“New proposed EU legislation to improve the working conditions of platform workers should help bring more of them into formal employment, which will bring rights such as a minimum wage, limits to working time and paid leave.”But in the meantime, EIGE said, EU Member States need to protect the many platform workers whose lack of status as formal employees has made them ineligible for government support during Covid-19, despite the fact that many have faced serious financial difficulties.Artificial intelligence: More women needed   In the EU and the UK, just 16% of those working on AI are women. The share gets smaller with career progression: women with 10+ years’ experience make up just 12% of AI professionals. Male-dominated environments and lack of access to funding may contribute to women leaving the industry.  Algorithms can also replicate bias and discrimination from the ‘real world’. One example is algorithms being trained with biased data to perpetuate discriminatory hiring practices. This can lead to women’s CVs being automatically discarded because their profile doesn’t fit that of people who were hired before – a problem in an organisation mainly made up of men.But AI can also help tackle problems such as gender-based violence. One example is facial recognition that detects photos of human trafficking victims in adverts for sexual services, EIGE said.“To make sure AI works for both women and men, the EU and Member States should conduct gender impact assessments of new technologies, require publicly funded projects to have balanced numbers of women and men, and train engineers and computer scientists in how to avoid bias.” It added that the EU’s proposed ‘Artificial Intelligence Act’ shows promise when it comes to minimising the risk of bias and discrimination in AI.“The EU’s commitment to train more specialists in AI, especially women and people from diverse backgrounds, is also a positive sign.”
