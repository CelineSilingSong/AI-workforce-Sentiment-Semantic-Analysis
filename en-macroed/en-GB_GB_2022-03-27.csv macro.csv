In February 2020, with COVID-19 spreading rapidly around the globe and antigen tests hard to come by, some physicians turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to try to diagnose cases1. Some researchers tasked deep neural networks — complex systems that are adept at finding subtle patterns in images — with looking at X-rays and chest computed tomography (CT) scans to quickly distinguish between people with COVID-based pneumonia and those without2. “Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a race to build tools, especially AI tools, to help out,” says Alex DeGrave, a computer engineer at the University of Washington in Seattle. But in that rush, researchers did not notice that many of the AI models had decided to take a few shortcuts.

Photograph: switas/Getty Images/iStockphotoArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 years oldArtificial intelligence beats eight world champions at bridgeThis article is more than 2 years oldVictory marks milestone for AI as bridge requires more human skills than other strategy gamesLaura SpinneyTue 29 Mar 2022 01.00 EDTShareAn artificial intelligence has beaten eight world champions at bridge, a game in which human supremacy has resisted the march of the machines until now.The victory represents a new milestone for AI because in bridge players work with incomplete information and must react to the behaviour of several other players – a scenario far closer to human decision-making.In contrast, chess and Go – in both of which AIs have already beaten human champions – a player has a single opponent at a time and both are in possession of all the information.“What we’ve seen represents a fundamentally important advance in the state of artificial intelligence systems,” said Stephen Muggleton, a professor of machine learning at Imperial College London.French startup NukkAI announced the news of its AI’s victory on Friday, at the end of a two-day tournament in Paris.The NukkAI challenge required the human champions to play 800 consecutive deals divided into 80 sets of 10. It did not involve the initial bidding component of the game during which players arrive at a contract that they must then meet by playing their cards.Each champion played their own and their “dummy” partner’s cards against a pair of opponents. These opponents were the best robot champions in the world to date – robots that have won many robot competitions but that are universally acknowledged to be nowhere near as good as expert human players.The AI – called NooK – played the same role as the human champion, with the same cards and the same opponents. The score was the difference between those of the human and the AI, averaged over each set. NooK won 67, or 83%, of the 80 sets.Jean-Baptiste Fantun, co-founder of NukkAI, said he had been confident the machine – which the company has been developing for five years – would triumph in thousands of deals, but with only 800 it was touch-and-go.Announcing the results, the mathematician Cédric Villani, winner of the Fields medal in 2010, called NukkAI “a superb French success story”.AI researcher Véronique Ventos, NukkAI’s other co-founder, calls NooK a “new generation AI” because it explains its decisions as it goes along. “In bridge, you can’t play if you don’t explain,” she says.The game relies on communication between partners.AI could decipher gaps in ancient Greek texts, say researchersRead moreExplainability is a hot topic in AI. “Most of what the general public have heard in recent years about machine learning is based on black box systems such as AlphaGo, which is unable to explain to human beings how decisions are being made,” said Muggleton.Instead, NooK represents a “white box” or “neurosymbolic” approach. Rather than learning by playing billions of rounds of a game, it first learns the game’s rules and then improves its play through practice. It is a hybrid of rules-based and deep learning systems. “The NooK approach learns in a way that is much closer to human beings,” Muggleton said.“The pendulum is swinging towards these kinds of methods,” says Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown University in Rhode Island. “Not being able to tell people what’s going on just doesn’t work in our societies.”Even if a person or an AI can’t explain in words what they are doing, Littman says, their behaviour needs to be “legible” to others – enacting rules they understand.This will be critical in domains such as health and engineering. Self-driving cars negotiating a junction will need to be able to read each other’s behaviour, for example.Littman was disappointed the challenge didn’t include bidding, which is where much of the most interesting communication – and deception – happens in bridge.But Nevena Senior, a many-times world bridge champion for England and one of NooK’s challengers, said the contracts the humans and NooK were given to play were sufficiently variable that the card game became as important as the bidding.She said NooK’s creators had done a “magnificent” job. She found that it read its opponents better than the humans did, and was better able to exploit their mistakes.“This is something that humans do after enough experience and I was pleasantly surprised that a robot mimics typical human skills,” she said.Other AI triumphs

0SharesWith the explosion of terms like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in construction, AEC Magazine caught up with Senthil Kumar, CTO and head of AI at start-up Slate.ai to discuss how the technology can assist the complexity in the building industry

Q: Senthil, it’s always great to meet a new face in AEC software. Can you tell us about your previous work and what you do at Slate?
A: I’ve been working on advanced data technology in global software companies for over two decades now. I’ve helped pioneer multiple technological endeavours during that time, including AI, Blockchain, dge, cloud computing, metaverse, IoT, swarm robotics, system autonomy, and Big Data computing in industries spanning autonomous vehicles, fintech, smart buildings and cities, geospatial engineering, insurance, health care, and medicine.
I’ve also helped develop the emerging AI Industry standards, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, and also work in numerous industry think tanks and advisory boards of well-known academia and startups. Recently, my pioneering AI work was cited in the wall street journal and was recognised by the World Economic Forum.
I joined Slate 12 months ago as CTO, to build a new team of engineers and data scientists focused on delivering the most modern software and technology approaches to leverage data across building production.

Q: AI and Machine Learning are often greatly misunderstood. From your point of view, explain what they are?
A: I agree these terms have been misused interchangeably. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computational science that enables the creation of smart intelligent machines and systems. AI offers the promise of a bridge between humans and machines in smarter ways, mimicking human cognition and enabling the creation of a smarter harmonious ecosystem interplay by understanding a human’s needs and intent.
Now, while AI is a broad science, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine on how to learn and helps one build AI-driven applications. In a sense, ML is how computer systems learn and develop their intelligence.

Q: Does that mean you can have AI without Machine Learning?
A: Yes, as much as it may surprise us, we can have AI without ML. While model training, ML methodologies, and selflearning techniques have grown exponentially in recent times, there are aspects of AI that can be on their own without the need for ML to have taken place. An early oft-used method of AI implementation was the use of Decision Trees that break down complex problems into binary evaluations, then traverse those trees to find answers. This is not ML dependent and is widely used to this day.
Other examples of AI that are not ML-dependent include, using machines to solve shortest path problems, constraint solving, chatbots, and aspects of NLP [Natural Language Processing] using stochastic grammar to parse sentence trees. We have to remember that AI is vast in scope and ML is just one of the many techniques that AI uses.

Q: So, from your experience, what are some other common misconceptions about AI?
A: Don’t get me started! I think we’ve all heard that AI systems will probably replace our jobs, making most people redundant. This is a myth that’s heard to this day. Similar arguments have been made during the agrarian and industrial revolutions. The reality is that AI will mostly change existing jobs and create new ones. We have to remember, while on the one hand, a number of jobs might be automated by AI, the main reason that will occur is because those jobs are generally well suited to the way a computational machine works.
Roles that are best suited to human intellect and the supervision systems will continue to thrive and grow. The migration of work from repetitive physical roles towards cleaner, more rewarding careers, that humans are brilliantly well-suited to, started a long time ago, way before we were talking about AI. The overall quality of life and our productivity will only become better with a harmonious Human-Computer interplay, leveraging what machines do well in partnership with what humans do well.
Another misconception is that AI systems can be more impartial than human beings and be objective.
For some time now, creating unbiased and accurate AI has been the aspirational Holy Grail of AI architects. Even though AI systems do not yet have emotional intelligence like humans, they are susceptible to influences. It is imperative to note that AI is based on inputs and inferences from human experts and sometimes fallible data.
Senthil Kumar
Since humans are intrinsically biased in one way or another, so is the AI that has been co-created by humans. These biases can and do get carried over to the systems. A particular issue in the news is the systems that self-train using data from social inputs. They can be extremely susceptible to unintentional or intentional malevolent influences and biases. For example, the early facial recognition systems had biases in identifying ethnicities, and other systems that used social feeds such as twitter were unduly influenced by false propaganda. While technology implementations for AI are advancing swiftly and ethics, particularly for autonomous AI, is improving, we still have a long way to go in creating truly impartial and objective AI systems.

Q: Why did you see building production as the next best place to implement what you’ve learned?
A: While technology has transformed the landscape in several industries, there are aspects of building production that are yet to be touched by technological advancements that have already proved valuable elsewhere. Years ago, in industries such as retail, healthcare, insurance and fintech, we’ve been able to bring about significant changes to improve overall efficiencies, implementing both simple and complex AI implementations.
I joined Slate when I saw that building production is a multi-trillion-dollar industry that impacts the economy in a multitude of ways. Here I can leverage my knowledge of these technologies to create a meaningful and significant altering of the value-map for building.
If we think about this, improvements in construction can have a direct impact on the global economy. The interdependencies in building production are inherently global in scope, involving supplies, technologies, and participants across different countries, making this a truly global phenomenon. No other industry of today presents such a diverse array of unsolved challenges, and I believe many of those challenges can be solved more easily than imagined.
Complexity and unforeseen challenges are the norms in building production. Every aspect of this environment that flexes human and machine intellect is exciting to me, allowing us to employ some of the latest technologies and ideas in a meaningful manner. Just a few examples include: supply chain, and schedule optimisation utilising some of the major advancements in AI, computer vision, and cognitive sciences; Metaverse Augmented Reality applications for digital simulation and digital rehearsals; the ability to predict cost overruns and anticipatory analytics to illustrate when stages of building can be completed.
The interdependencies of construction’s inherently multidisciplinary, multi-dimensional and multi-player ecosystem makes it incredibly interesting [for AI], but also well suited to modern computational solutions
I’m also excited see new ‘smarter’ materials which complement building performance, utilising advancements in polymer science and computational nanotechnology, with multi-dimensional analytical tools that can leverage their potential to reduce carbon in operational performance. What other industry would offer the multitude of challenges this industry poses? All of these are exciting to me as they relate to building production.

Q: AI and chess have become synonymous with explaining what AI can achieve. So, is construction more complicated than, for example, chess?
A: Ah, yes… I might argue that elements of construction are a more complex challenge than a chess game. In a chess game, the player anticipates the moves of the opponent. Not just the next move but several moves ahead of what the opponent may do. This was generally viewed as the peak of challenges to solve with AI. That’s why when [chess computer] Deep Blue beat a human in a chess game there was elation all around.
But, if we think about this, chess has a singular opponent, the game board is defined, the rules are defined. Even though the number of moves can be huge, there is still a finite number of moves an opponent can make with the game pieces. Construction, on the other hand, has inherent complexities. Think of it as a game with an infinite number of opposing moves, multiple opponent players teaming up in unison against the player.
Some of the moves may not even be fully well defined, such as unforeseen political events, supply constraints, surprise government regulations, workmanship constraints. All of these can throw a wrench into the well-designed construction schedule. This can make it significantly more complex than a game of chess.

Q: So, how complicated are the problems in building production? How does the complexity compare with other industries, such as health, finance, and biotech?
A: Well, building production is a daunting challenge. From conception to completion for the comfort and safety of human occupants and operational efficiencies, improving building production is among the most sophisticated and complex legacy industries to improve with technology.
While tremendous advancements have been made in healthcare, manufacturing and finance, the difference between those industries and construction has been the pace of innovation and adoption. The interdependencies of construction’s inherently multi-disciplinary, multi-dimensional and multi-player ecosystem make it incredibly interesting, but also well suited to modern computational solutions. It’s incredible for me to see how many construction decisions are made without the situational context commonly available in other industries from well understood dimensional analysis techniques.
Slate is using AI to aid decision making in AEC
To improve the Decision Value Chain in building production, multi-dimensional analysis can be a very effective strategy. This type of Analytical Reasoning involves data segmentation and contextualisation in varying dimensions.
In the case of building production, a number of challenges can be analysed in cross-sectional contextual patterns of varying dimensions. Real world events across space and time can be correlated into contextual dimensions – causation analysis, co-occurrence patterns of features with events and values of importance.
It could be as simple as computing the optimal time for performing certain construction tasks, or how should a specific work package be formulated and in what sequence should certain events be orchestrated? The ability to foresee and foretell events before they happen as it relates to construction can all benefit from multi-dimensional analysis to improve the decision value chain as it relates to building production.
I was recently asked whether going to Mars is more challenging than construction. For me, I might contest that building production and sustainability on this planet and on Mars when we get there are the more interesting goals.

Q: Where are we in the evolution of AI in construction?
A: We are witnessing the creation of history in our times. Most leaders in construction have recognised that what the 4th industrial revolution did to the invention and patronisation of advanced technologies in traditional industries, the construction spectrum might finally be ready to adopt.
Advancements are being made in a number of AI disciplines, including Convolutional Neuroscience, Realtime Machine Vision, Human-Level Cognition with NLP, intent-based computations, and a favourite focus area of mine, “Speed of Thought” analytics, where, as you think, so shall the machine cater to your intent.
While AI is going mainstream in other markets, adoption of it in the construction space has been lagging. This was not for want of technology or digital data but scepticism around AI, with a bias towards human experience being used as context for most decisions.
Here at Slate, the biggest attitude change we are seeing in construction is happening when organisations are feeling completely overwhelmed with software and data, while not benefiting from the intelligence that the data can provide. Existing software has taken the automation of construction’s legacy workflows as far as they can go. Just knowing how many RFIs you have unprocessed, or how many change orders are stuck is not improving the bottom line.
The current best-in-class software solutions are helping companies try and keep to the schedule and budget frameworks that have not changed significantly for decades. To gain from the digital motherlode of knowledge we are amassing in building production, we need new AI solutions that work with humans before, during and after the critical decisions that can and will improve outcomes, not just maintain current industry performance. We believe our work at Slate will be significant in bringing that value to the industry.

AI is now very much a feature of the workplace, but HR specialists need to be alive to the risks it presents. Unintentional consequences of AI decision-making can include bias, discrimination, unfair treatment and an inability for employees to fully understand and accept decisions. Failure to mitigate these risks can lead to employment tribunal claims being brought and reputational risk to an employer. 
One such issue has recently arisen for MAC, a subsidiary of Estée Lauder in which three make-up artists brought claims that they had been unfairly made redundant because of an automated decision generated by AI software, HireVue.
The three women were informed that they had to reapply for their positions by way of video interview. The AI software analysed the content of the women’s answers and their facial expressions, together with other metric data regarding their job performance. Following the video interview, all three women were informed they were being made redundant, in part due to the algorithmic decision-making (ADM).  
The women complained of the lack of transparency and the fact that when challenged, their employer was unable to explain on what basis they were being made redundant. The company defended its decision, citing the fact that the algorithm assessment only accounted for a quarter of the marks awarded and that the AI software was used in tandem with human decision-making procedures, which overall, produced a fairer outcome. The women received an out-of-court settlement.
Under the GDPR, the law allows employers to make decisions without human intervention, although these are in limited circumstances and require transparency. The above case highlights the risks associated with ADM and how this can lead to serious consequences in an employment context if greater transparency is not provided. 

HR teams need to be alive to the potentially unintended consequences of any automated systems they use. It is important to maintain a human element during any process to counteract problems with bias or bad decisions. Quality control of AI is arguably more important than in other areas given its purpose of learning from the data and its own decisions. If the data input is defective and there is no mechanism for review, an employer could easily experience significant operational, legal, and reputational problems.
When using ADM as part of a process to make staff redundant, HR teams should consider:

Engaging in fact-based comparisons between AI results and human decision results. For example, running the algorithm against the decisions of a human on the same matter to compare results. If bias is discovered, the algorithm should be changed. 


Prioritise transparency by clearly communicating how AI is being used in the workplace. This is particularly important with regards to data protection law, so plain English and non-technical explanations should be used. Greater transparency and understanding by the HR team will facilitate employees being able to raise queries or challenges. 


Ensure there are informal and formal routes for employees to raise queries or challenge decisions.

AI may not yet be robust or reliable enough to make the case for its use in complex HR work, yet the promise of time saved, and its use for mundane work is accelerating AI in the workplace. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has argued for changes in the law on the use of AI at work, in its report, Technology managing people – the legal implications. It is important for HR teams to stay up to date with any legislative changes in this area and ensure any AI process used is subject to regular quality control and review.

Artificial Intelligence is tremendously useful, when applied correctly, to improve fairness, transparency, efficiency and even to correct historical biases, including ethnic and gender biases imposed by humans. However, when applied in a ‘plug and play’ manner, we risk exacerbating social and economic inequality. Christine Chow, Paris Will, and Mark Lewis discuss the implications.

 
From an investor’s perspective
Investors increasingly consider human capital management (HCM) to be a defining factor in delivering business outperformance. In discussions around the ‘future of work’, we acknowledge that the future is already here – the workforce is now more mobile, more diverse, more agile, and increasingly impacted by more data and analytics.
COVID lockdown has accelerated the digital transformation of businesses – from CV screening and AI video interviews, to virtual on boarding and digital workplace interactions. Workers’ activities in a hybrid working environment provide ample opportunities for technologies to improve efficiency, but not all companies are clear and explicit about when and how analytics are used on workers. In a recent BBC episode, AI technologies created for hiring were used in redundancy targeting, with unintended psychological impact on workers and possibly brand and financial impact on employers. In Social Dilemma, a 2020 docudrama, interviews with tech leaders highlighted the dangers of collected information at workplace, including how it affects the human psyche by causing anxiety and depression.
Share Action, a UK-based NGO, established the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) in late 2016 to improve corporate transparency and accountability on workforce issues. WDI is supported by 68 institutions (including HSBC Asset Management) with asset managers covering over US$10 trillion. In 2021, WDI introduced a new indicator, asking companies to describe workforce surveillance measures used to monitor workers and how the company ensures this does not have a disproportional impact on workers’ right to privacy. Proprietary findings can be found in our white paper (see Notes section below).
Beyond surveillance, investors recognise that it is in general difficult to reduce human behaviour down to an algorithm. Where AI works well as a tool is when decision-making rules are quantifiable, and computers can be used to interact almost instantaneously with vast amounts of data. Where AI does not work well as a tool is when the interpretation of human characteristics is contextual and the impact on behaviour is nuanced.
Christine Chow
From an academic’s perspective
A scientific approach to assessing AI decision-making in human capital management (HCM) is to evaluate the level of bias in algorithmic decisions. As AI has been proposed to eradicate human biases in areas such as hiring, promotion, and pay decisions, it must be assessed to ensure that it lessens rather than potentiates human cognitive biases. As research advances in the field and conclusions are made about the adoptability of certain types of AI for HCM, we must be wary of the way that we judge AI, as research has shown that we judge AI in comparison to “perfect” decision-making. This may explain the backlash against adopting AI. The reality is that adopting AI will replace human decisions, which are far from perfect, and often riddled with bias. As such, a better approach in assessing the adoptability of AI for HCM is to directly compare AI and human decision outcomes. AI can be adopted in contexts where it shows less biased decision-making than humans.
The capabilities of AI are thought of in two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI means that it is specific to a task, whereas strong AI is meant to mimic human intelligence and can generalise to other contexts. AI currently performs well in specific contexts but is limited in its generalisability. As such, for HCM, we should take caution in using AI that has been validated in a specific context’s data set. We must keep considerations in mind when thinking about the capabilities of AI for HCM, especially as many of its proposed uses reflect technologies that would require strong AI. In this way companies should set their expectations about what AI can reliably accomplish.
Due to a rapidly changing workplace environment, we recommend using dynamic rather than static AI – algorithms should be continually updated with new data at regular intervals to prevent decisions from being outdated, irrelevant, and worse, unfit for purpose.
Paris Will
From a legal and regulatory perspective
It is surely in the interests of all concerned – especially those who may not have known that they should be concerned – to understand the legal and regulatory implications of introducing and deploying AI systems and processes in and around the workplace. The consequences of failing to understand and address those implications could be very serious for a range of stakeholders.
In trying to understand those implications, the problem is that there is very little law and regulation around the world applying specifically to the use of AI in human capital management. There are prospective laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that are intended to address the subject specifically, most notably a very substantial regulation proposed for the European Union – and not just in the EU, because it will have effect outside the EU, too. But, in many countries there is an existing body of law and regulation that would apply to employers’ use of AI in the workplace.
Unfortunately, when, how, and why that body of law and regulation may apply, and the implications of it applying, aren’t instantly obvious. What is obvious, however, is that there is a growing movement of disquiet about, and resistance to, the use of AI, automated decision-making, and related processes in and around the workplace, and that regulatory and legal challenges are happening – now.

Our white paper seeks to address this problem: first, by addressing board accountability and governance considerations; next by alerting readers to when, how, and why law and regulation will or may apply here; and then by outlining:

a selection of laws and regulations that now apply specifically to the adoption and use of AI in the workplace;
the potential impact of the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act; and
certain existing laws and regulations in various countries that are most likely to apply in such circumstances, but with judicial interpretation and application.

In doing so, we hope that all those concerned – and those who should be concerned – will be better able to understand, plan for, and manage the governance, legal and regulatory, and reputational implications, risks, and exposure that could arise in adopting and relying on AI systems and processes in and around the workplace.
Mark Lewis
 
The paper acknowledges that AI analytics is unlikely to go away in the present and future of work. As such, to make the best and appropriate use of AI in human capital management we need to embrace it with caution and respect for workers:

Board level oversight should focus on clarifying the intent of AI applications; establishing clear processes for AI training and testing, including back testing; ensuring transparency in the use of AI applications and accountability for their outcomes; and requiring competent and thorough due diligence of third-party products in the supply chain that may use AI. Such due diligence is currently often missing, or conducted by people lacking sufficient expertise;
Companies should understand and properly manage the legal and regulatory implications of adopting and relying on AI systems and related processes in the workplace;
Companies should put in place a machine learning platform to create automated and repeatable data preparation processes and feature engineering to ensure consistency over time. The platform should have a data versioning function to keep track of changes in data used, different model experiments and test results. There should be a feedback loop and associated documentation that integrate outcomes and lessons learnt to improve performance over time;
Companies should include a means of redress and clear remediation mechanisms to an accountable human; and
When engaging with companies, investors can ask for the disclosure and explanation of key performance indicators (KPI) highlighted in our paper, which covers hiring, culture, and performance (Figure 1).

From self-driving cars to dancing robots in Super Bowl commercials, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. The problem with all of these AI examples, though, is that they’re not really intelligent. Rather, they represent narrow AI – an application that can solve a specific problem using artificial intelligence techniques. And that is very different from what you and I possess.
Humans (hopefully) display general intelligence. We are able to solve a wide range of problems and learn to work out those problems we haven’t previously encountered. We are capable of learning new situations and new things. We understand that physical objects exist in a three-dimensional environment and are subject to various physical attributes, including the passage of time. The ability to replicate human-level thinking abilities artificially, or artificial general intelligence (AGI), simply does not exist in what we today think of as AI. 
That’s not to take anything away from the overwhelming success AI has enjoyed to date. Google Search is an outstanding example of AI that most people regularly use. Google is capable of searching volumes of information at an incredible speed to provide (usually) the results the user wants near the top of the list.











 
 
 
Similarly, Google Voice Search allows users to speak search requests. Users can say something that sounds ambiguous and get a result back that is properly spelled, capitalized, punctuated, and, to top it off, usually what the user meant.

How does it work so well? Google has the historical data of trillions of searches, and which results the user chose. From this, it can predict which searches are likely and which results will make the system useful. But there is no expectation that the system understands what it is doing or any of the results it presents.
This highlights the requirement for a huge amount of historical data. This works pretty well in search because every user interaction can create a training set data item. But if the training data needs to be manually tagged, this is an arduous task. Further, any bias in the training set will flow directly to the result. If, for example, a system is developed to predict criminal behavior, and it is trained with historical data that includes a racial bias, the resulting application will have a racial bias as well.











 
 
 
Personal assistants such as Alexa or Siri follow scripts with numerous variables and so are able to create the impression of being more capable than they really are. But as all users know, anything you say that is not in the script will yield unpredictable results.
As a simple example, you can ask a personal assistant, “Who is Cooper Kupp?” The phrase “Who is” triggers a web search on the variable remainder of the phrase and will likely produce a relevant result. With many different script triggers and variables, the system gives the appearance of some degree of intelligence while actually doing symbol manipulation. Because of this lack of underlying understanding, only 5% of people say they never get frustrated using voice search.
A massive program like GPT3 or Watson has such impressive capabilities that the concept of a script with variables is entirely invisible, allowing them to create an appearance of understanding. Their programs are still looking at input, though, and making specific output responses. The data sets at the heart of the AI’s responses (the “scripts”) are now so large and variable that it is often difficult to notice the underlying script – until the user goes off script. As is the case with all of the other AI examples cited, giving them off-the-script input will generate unpredictable results. In the case of GPT-3, the training set is so large that eliminating the bias has thus far proven impossible.











 
 
 
The bottom line? The fundamental shortcoming of what we today call AI is its lack of common-sense understanding. Much of this is due to three historical assumptions:

The principal assumption underlying most AI development over the past 50 years was that simple intelligence problems would fall into place if we could solve difficult ones. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a false assumption. It was best expressed as Moravec’s Paradox. In 1988, Hans Moravec, a prominent roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University, stated that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance on intelligence tests or when playing checkers, but difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility. In other words, often the difficult problems turn out to be simpler and the apparently simple problems turn out to be prohibitively difficult.
The next assumption is that if you built enough narrow AI applications, they would grow together into a general intelligence. This also turned out to be false. Narrow AI applications don’t store their information in a generalized form so it can be used by other narrow AI applications to expand the breadth. Language processing applications and image processing applications can be stitched together, but they cannot be integrated in the way a child effortlessly integrates vision and hearing.
Lastly, there has been a general feeling that if we could just build a machine learning system big enough, with enough computer power, it would spontaneously exhibit general intelligence. This hearkens back to the days of expert systems that attempted to capture the knowledge of a specific field. These efforts clearly demonstrated that it is impossible to create enough cases and example data to overcome the underlying lack of understanding. Systems that are simply manipulating symbols can create the appearance of understanding until some “off-script” request exposes the limitation.

Why aren’t these issues the AI industry’s top priority? In short, follow the money.
Consider, for example, the development approach of building capabilities, such as stacking blocks, for a three-year-old. It is entirely possible, of course, to develop an AI application that would learn to stack blocks just like that three-year-old. It is unlikely to get funded, though. Why? First, who would want to put millions of dollars and years of development into an application that executes a single feature that any three-year-old can do, but nothing else, nothing more general?











 
 
 
The bigger issue, though, is that even if someone would fund such a project, the AI is not displaying real intelligence. It does not have any situational awareness or contextual understanding. Moreover, it lacks the one thing that every three-year-old can do: become a four-year-old, and then a five-year-old, and eventually a 10-year-old and a 15-year-old. The innate capabilities of the three-year-old include the capability to grow into a fully functioning, generally intelligent adult.
This is why the term artificial intelligence doesn’t work. There simply isn’t much intelligence going on here. Most of what we call AI is based on a single algorithm, backpropagation. It goes under the monikers of deep learning, machine learning, artificial neural networks, even spiking neural networks. And it is often presented as “working like your brain.” If you instead think of AI as a powerful statistical method, you’ll be closer to the mark.

AI’s long-term success is contingent upon our acknowledgement that people are critical in its design, operation, and use.Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is an emerging discipline intent on creating AI systems that amplify and augment rather than displace human abilities. HCAI seeks to preserve human control in a way that ensures artificial intelligence meets our needs while also operating transparently, delivering equitable outcomes, and respecting privacy.IBM Research’s HCAI strategy is to rigorously investigate and design new forms of human-AI interactions and experiences that enhance and extend human capabilities for the good of our products, our clients, and society at large. To do that, we take an interdisciplinary approach that involves researchers who specialize in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work, data visualization, and design in the context of AI. We explore three important themes that we consider critical for the success of AI systems.Human-AI collaboration and co-creationAdhering to the core value that “human + AI” is better than either one individually, we can develop novel user experiences and visualizations that foster human-AI collaboration. We can also create frameworks for designing or evaluating human-AI interaction models and conduct theoretical work that develops and extends theories of human-AI collaboration or co-creation.Data science offers an excellent example of how people and AI can work together, to augment our ability to glean meaningful insights from data. One of the biggest challenges for data scientists is identifying and analyzing large, disparate data sets in ways that derive new insights that help solve complex problems. To do that, data scientists must build models and measure their performance. Then they optimize those models by tuning their hyper-parameters and evaluate those models for fairness and robustness.We learned that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.Using a human-centered approach, we first sought to understand the attitudes that data scientists had in automating their work. In doing so, we learned that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.1 Those insights led IBM to develop our AutoAI technology, which enables data scientists to produce more, higher-quality machine learning models faster, with fewer errors.2 This also includes novel visualization techniques that make it easier for data scientists to compare pipelines and understand how they rate against different metrics of accuracy and bias.3Responsible and human-compatible AIThis area covers all aspects of how At NeurIPS 2021, we organized the first workshop at NeurIPS on Human-Centered AI, exploring research questions that stem from the increasingly wide-spread usage of ML algorithms across all areas of society. It focused on understanding technical and design requirements for HCAI systems, as well as how to evaluate the efficacy and effects of HCAI systems. The workshop was major step toward building a hybrid field of AI and human-computer interaction.human-centered AI systems can provide positive and beneficial outcomes to their direct users, to those affected by their operation, and to society in general. To achieve these outcomes, HCAI must be fair and unbiased, secure, applied ethically, and used in service of users’ needs.Efforts to develop responsible and human-compatible AI take several factors into account, including the need to understand how people engage with and trust AI systems. There’s also a need to explain the operation of AI models and improve peoples’ understanding of how AI systems operate. An HCAI strategy must also gauge the negative consequences or potential misuse of AI systems, include ways to mitigate human and AI biases, and be able to measure peoples’ perceptions (or misperceptions) of AI systems.Our collaborations with the IBM’s internal business units offer real-world examples of responsible and human-compatible AI. In one instance, IBM Research, the Chief Analytics Office, and the Chief Information Office partnered to create a set of assets that infuse AI into the tools of IBM Sales and our business partner ecosystem, including the SCORE engine.SCORE uses AI techniques to learn from sales data and operational feedback from IBM’s sellers, business partners, and clients to recommend the optimal BP to receive each sales lead.4, 5 Explainable recommendations that provided clear evidence as to why a business partner is recommended were critical to the success of this AI system engendering trust in the system. The deployment and uptake of SCORE has led to $214M in incremental revenue since 2018 and won several prestigious awards.Explainable recommendations that provided clear evidence as to why a business partner is recommended were critical to the success of this AI system engendering trust in the system.As we explore different domains where AI can be applied, such as sales, finance, and human resources, our researcher often leads to a generalizable, deeper understanding that can result in AI design guidelines for ML practitioners. For example, our research team has been developing explainable AI (XAI) guidelines that can be leveraged by practitioners in multiple domains and for multiple use cases. We are also leveraging data visualization approaches to support interpretability, understanding, and interactive explorations of AI models, such as GLTR, a tool to help humans detect automatically generated text, and GenNI, an interactive visual system for high-level human-AI collaboration in producing descriptive text.Natural language interactionConversational user interfaces (CUIs) powered by advanced dialogue systems have grown in popularity, and many intelligent assistants have been developed for business, social, and emotional purposes. Under this theme, we are aiming to understand the kinds of tasks appropriate for this medium, the task effectiveness, and how to design engaging and delightful interactive experiences.In one project, our team is investigating the use of formal and informal styles of language by customer service AI-powered agents, both in speech- and text-based chats. Since the use of formal language is connected to gender in many languages and cultures, we are exploring cases where the machine impersonates either female or male agents and considering a comparison with expectations for human-based customer service.Our initial findings seem to indicate a direction that challenges traditional gender stereotypes of customer service in Brazil. In a Brazilian Portuguese context, we found a preference for human agents to use more formal language but no preferred use of formality for machine speech-based systems, such as Siri or Alexa. However, in the case of text-based chatbots, we saw a strong preference for female-portraying systems using informal language and male systems using formal language.6, 7The next frontiers for HCAIAs the technologies we develop become more intelligent and autonomous, our interactions with those systems will transform. To effectively support true The ACM IUI Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces is the premiere venue for work that spans across cutting- edge artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. From March 21-25, 2022, IBM Research participants presented recent advances related to our Human-Centered AI research agenda. This year, many of our papers focused on generative AI across various areas including code translation, co-creative systems, UX modernization, and explainability.Human-AI partnerships, one important question is how to facilitate the AI system and the user to negotiate a common objective, where traditionally AI solutions focus on optimizing performance or accuracy, these metrics do not encapsulate other objectives, like personalization, fairness and the many other objectives humans trade-off on a day to day basis when making decisions.A second frontier for Human-Centered AI is to investigate and understand the design of AI systems that become creative partners. In the business world, human-AI co-creativity involves subject matter experts working with an AI system generating code, co-designing user experiences, and accelerating scientific discovery.We envision the user experience of creating both physical and digital artifacts will become a partnership in which people will take the role of specification, goal setting, steering, high-level creativity, curation, and governance, whereas AI will augment human abilities through inspiration, creativity, low-level detail work, and the ability to design at scale.Learn more about:Human-Centered AI: We design and investigate new forms of human-AI interactions and experiences that enhance and extend human capabilities for the good of our products, clients, and society at large.Future of Finance: We're working on core technology innovations, from secure and elastic microservices-based hybrid cloud solutions and advanced analytics for finance, to AI blockchain, and quantum computing for the banking industry.Subscribe to our Future Forward newsletter and stay up to date on the latest research newsSubscribe to our newsletterHome↳ BlogDate31 Mar 2022AuthorsWerner GeyerJustin WeiszClaudio Santos PinhanezElizabeth DalyTopicsFairness, Accountability, TransparencyHuman-Centered AITrustworthy AIShareNotesNote 1: At NeurIPS 2021, we organized the first workshop at NeurIPS on Human-Centered AI, exploring research questions that stem from the increasingly wide-spread usage of ML algorithms across all areas of society.

Why diversity in AI remains a challenge and how to fix it


With artificial intelligence set for a global economic explosion, its development must put diversity at its core to avoid discriminating systems

Each year that passes sees artificial intelligence (AI) integrating even further into major institutions. It is set to contribute $15.7tn to the global economy by 2030, which exceeds the current output of China and India combined. This game-changing technology is becoming increasingly embedded in our daily lives, from the devices on our bodies that measure our heart rates to those in our home that play our music.







With AI poised to play an increasingly important role in society, further regulations are likely to be introduced worldwide. Over the past five years, more than 60 countries have developed over 700 AI policy initiatives. Last year, the European Commission introduced its Proposal for a Regulation on a European Approach for Artificial Intelligence (also known as the Artificial Intelligence Act), designed to ban harmful uses of AI and foster more consumer transparency in AI-driven systems and applications.
A particularly challenging issue in AI is the diversity of those programming the technology itself. The World Economic Forum has shown that about 78% of global professionals with AI skills are male, while a study by the AI Now Institute of New York University showed that over 80% of AI professors are men.
Women make up only 15% of AI researchers working at Facebook and 10% of AI researchers working at Google. Also, only 2.5% of Google’s entire workforce and 4% of Facebook’s and Microsoft’s are black. These figures need to change – and quickly.
Beyond the moral imperative of preventing systemic racial and gender discrimination in designing new AI tools, there is also an economic one. Research has demonstrated that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity have been 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability, while ethnic and cultural diversity correlates with a 33% increase in performance.
Different viewpoints optimise AI development when it comes to explainability. This is the ability to explain the predictions made by a machine learning model: being able to understand why a model adopted a particular choice and representing it in a manner that humans can follow. Data cannot simply be fed into a learning system. Instead, the AI system needs to be designed not to omit data simply because it seems atypical based on a few data points.
A diverse AI workforce made up of different races, genders, ethnicities and ages will decrease the likelihood of racial, gender, ethnic and age discrimination by artificially intelligent systems. So how can we address the issue?
Addressing gender diversity starts with attracting more women into the industry as early as possible and helping more female teenagers to consider a career in AI while at secondary school. In 2020, a mere 0.4% of girls in the UK took computer science at A-level and were already under-represented when they reached university. Only 9% of female graduates in 2018 studied a core STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subject, arguably due to a lack of female role models in tech and misunderstandings about what a career in tech entails.
Beyond education, the next step would be to ensure that job descriptions are as inclusive as possible. Research has shown that male-gendered words can affect the willingness of women to apply for a role. Masculine wording could perpetuate a perceived bias towards men, with 44% of women reportedly being discouraged from applying if a role or workplace was described as “aggressive” in a job description.
Once more women are in AI education and employment, it is crucial to foster a culture in which everyone feels included, respected and valued. Culture is an enormous part of why women leave tech, and changing that culture can start with prioritising and developing robust mentoring programmes.
As Jim Boerkoel, co-chair of an undergraduate consortium designed to cultivate future AI researchers has pointed out, two of the most critical levers to fostering diversity in AI are mentoring and cohort-building. These give peers meaningful connections to help their careers evolve and can link them to mentors who make relevant connections and introductions throughout a career.
Mentorship has been demonstrated to increase minority representation at management level from 9% to 24%. The benefits of mentorships also include raising the promotion and retention rates for minorities and women from 15% to 38% compared with employees who were not mentored. Industry leaders must create partnerships with academic institutions to build these mentorship networks early in the career process.
As industry leaders, we must deal with the diversity issues in AI not by zeroing in on a single controversy or debate, but by taking a holistic view of the broader picture, welcoming creative solutions and genuine accountability for the generations to come.

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide
                        While there are, especially in industries like manufacturing, legitimate fears that robots and artificial intelligence could cost people their jobs, a lot of workers in the United States prefer to look on the positive side, imagining which of the more laborious of their tasks could be taken off their hands by AI.According to a recent survey by Gartner, 70 percent of U.S. workers would like to utilize AI for their jobs to some degree. As our infographic shows, a fair chunk of respondents also named some tasks which they would be more than happy to give up completely. Data processing is at the top of the list with 36 percent, while an additional 50 percent would at least like AI to help them out in this.On the other side of the story, as reported by VentureBeat: ""Among survey respondents who did not want to use AI at work, privacy and security concerns were cited as the top two reasons for declining AI."" To help convince these workers, Gartner recommends ""that IT leaders interested in using AI solutions in the workplace gain support for this technology by demonstrating that AI is not meant to replace or take over the workforce. Rather, it can help workers be more effective and work on higher-value tasks.""

What are agents in this context? How are they beneficial to us? We will explore today..	Fetch.ai: Introduction and Purpose.Marketplaces work best when there is no friction in their transactions. Fetch intends to allow users to automate transactions to improve efficiency in this space. They have developed agents that are essentially tools to perform a variety of economic tasks for their users. These autonomous digital agents will perform the majority of the tasks that are currently performed by users. The platform is thus emerging as the foundation of future decentralized digital data marketplaces..Fetch.ai uses a unique consensus mechanism referred to as Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW). It generates new blocks in a manner similar to regular Proof-of-Stake protocols. In UPoW, the order of transactions is determined by the work performed between the generation of two blocks..Based on the Cosmos blockchain’s framework, the Fetch.ai blockchain is an interchain protocol that uses a high-performance smart contract language (Cosmwasm). It allows advanced cryptography and machine learning logic to be implemented on-chain. This enables the Fetch.ai network to function as a layer-2 network for legacy blockchain networks as well as an interchain bridge to the outside world..	FET: Fundamentals.FET is the native token of the Fetch.ai blockchain. It represents value on the network. And serves as the primary medium of exchange for payment of transactions as well as payment to agents for providing services on the blockchain. FET is also required to deploy new protocol agents and pay for their operations. .Users can stake your FET tokens and earn rewards from across the Fetch.ai ecosystem for assisting in the operations of a set of validators. FET token was developed to “find, create, deploy and train autonomous economic agents and is essential for smart contracts, oracles and the transactions needed to deliver the new digital economy.”.FET has a circulating supply of 745 million currently with a maximum supply of 1.15 billion. FET is a top 200 cryptocurrency by market capitalization..	Short Term Technical Analysis.FET is currently trading around $0.45, having risen from $0.3 at the beginning of March. That’s a gain of 50%, clearly indicating a bullish trend that may continue as Bitcoin leads the crypto market into positive sentiment. FET, however, may want to test short term resistances at $0.42 and $0.4, to gain more fuel for an upwards move. To prevent a bearish scenario though, it will certainly need to hold the golden pocket support at $0.36-$0.37..Source: TradingView, Binance.	Future Potential.Fetch.ai is constantly upgrading by stepping into several partnerships, indicating massive potential for the long-term. It has announced a collaboration in research and development with FinTech platform Algbra to bring DeFi services to underserved minority communities. It also entered the non-fungible token (NFT) market, launching the Colearn Paint NFT platform. The platform enables groups of creators to use machine learning to generate NFTs automatically. There’s also a collaboration with LiquidChefs, an on-site food beverage services company, to enable long-term AI-powered supply chain services and increase supply chain transparency through the use of autonomous economic agents..With constant upgrades and lots of developer activity, FET has potential to turn out to be one of the most popular cryptos in the future..Use promocode TNM51 at www.giottus.com/profile#promo after registration to get Rs.51 worth free Bitcoin..Disclaimer: This article was authored by Giottus Crypto Exchange as a part of a paid partnership with The News Minute.

According to a survey, many people want AI to help them in their work but only help them and not take their place

Artificial intelligence (AI) based tech has become a huge part of all our lives in the past few years. It was a way of staying connected while in Quarantine, a means of studying through Zoom meetings, and it was also a way of working from home. AI has certainly helped humans in many aspects of their daily lives and continues to do so. In a survey conducted by Gartner, respondents were asked about how they want AI to perform in nine different categories. The responses differed in 3 terms; the options were that AI takes over the work completely for us. The second was that AI helps them in that work; and the third being that AI would not do anything on behalf of the person who is assigned that task. According to that survey over 70% of people want AI to help them rather than do all the work or do nothing. Those 70% want AI to do simple tasks such as calculations, solving problems, simplifying procedures, doing research work, mistake checking and changing etc. in order to save time and space. In that survey it was also clear that about more than half or 57% of respondents want AI to do only one or two of the above mentioned tasks but a small part of respondents almost 18% want that AI to more than 5 of those tasks. While workers are generally happy with AI coming to help them, they want it to stay as helping only. They don’t want AI to take complete control over their task and they want at least most of the control that their task offers. They also want to be able to control how much of their data is being collected by AI and how much goes as their feedback about them. But with all this positive responses there are bound to be some negative ones as well because contrary to those who want AI in their workplaces there are people who do not want AI to be anything for them or on their behalf. The reasons for not trusting AI were fear of information leaking, Privacy issues, more trust in employer rather than artificial intelligence and the preference of human interaction. According to Gartner the IT people in every company should start campaigning for the use of AI in their workspaces and try to convince their co-workers and the higher management that AI are their friends and are not here to take their place.

AI is a wide term that alludes to the utilisation of specific sorts of investigation to follow through with responsibilities from driving a vehicle to fraud detection..Previously, fraud detection has been done by rules-based calculations which are regularly convoluted and not generally extremely difficult to evade. These strategies risk missing a lot of fraud activities or proceeding to have exorbitant measures of bogus up-sides, where client's cards get declined because of misidentified and dubious ways of behaving. Customary models are likewise entirely unyielding which is an issue in an application where fraudulent are continually tracking down better approaches to sneak by the radar..After the spread of the COVID-19 disaster and with lockdowns implemented, for the time being, organisations and instructive foundations had to proceed with their activities from a distance. This peculiarity prompted an inescapable flood in the reception of advances for everyday work. Accordingly, the nation saw expanded endeavours and occurrences of computerised blackmail. Since the start of the flare-up in March 2020, the incidence of fraud activities rose by more than 28% between March 2020 and 2021 contrasted with the earlier year..During this time of computerised vulnerability, making a worldwide assurance biological system is fast approaching to safeguard clients.

The data is followed in profiles that address the ways of behaviour of every person, vendor, record, and gadget. These profiles are refreshed with every exchange, continuously, to process insightful qualities that give educated expectations regarding future behaviour.Utilising Large Datasets to Develop Models: Research shows that profundity and expansiveness of information are more effective to AI model execution than the intelligence of the calculation.Unrivalled extortion identification is accomplished by examining a wealth of value-based information to successfully get conduct and survey risk, at a singular level.Versatile Analytics and Self-Learning AI: Whenever an examiner explores an exchange, whether the exchange is affirmed as authentic or deceitful – is taken care of once again into the framework to mirror the extortion climate that experts are confronting..Adaptive examination innovations further develop an aversion to moving misrepresentation designs via naturally adjusting to late affirmed case attitudes, bringing about a more exact partition among frauds and non-fraudsters..An integral asset further develops extortion location execution on the edges and stops new sorts of misrepresentation assaults..Advanced associations can recognize robotized and more complicated fraud activities quicker and more precisely by joining managed and unaided AI as a component of a bigger Artificial Intelligence (AI) extortion recognition system..The Banking and Retail ventures are enduring an onslaught and come up against various fraud costs if the contemporary world is overwhelmed with card-not-present exchanges on the web..Email phishing, monetary extortion, fraud, record falsification, and bogus records all add to an enormous number of criminal assaults on weak clients' information, which brings about information breaks..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
