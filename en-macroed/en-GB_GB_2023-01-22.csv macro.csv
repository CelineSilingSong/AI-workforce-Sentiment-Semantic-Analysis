ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-powered writing generator, quickly obliged.The result was impressive. Sure, the tone was inhuman and the structure as sophisticated as a college essay, but the key points, the grammar and the syntax were all spot on. After a bit of a punch-up, it was perfectly passable as a sponsored content article designed to drum up business leads for a software provider ‚Äì an article like the one that I, a professional copywriter, had just spent hours writing.My amusement quickly turned to horror: it had taken ChatGPT roughly 30 seconds to create, for free, an article that I charged ¬£500 for. The artificial intelligence software is by no means perfect ‚Äì yet. For businesses that rely on churning out reams of fresh copy, however, it‚Äôs a no-brainer, isn‚Äôt it?For those unfamiliar with ChatGPT, let me explain. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based chatbot that‚Äôs been trained to interact with users in a natural, conversational way. Unlike traditional language models, ChatGPT can learn to generate responses without explicit instructions on what the correct answer is. Users can make any request ‚Äì from Tell me about Watergate to Write an opinion piece about ChatGPT taking someone‚Äôs job ‚Äì and ChatGPT will produce a response. If you run it through a plagiarism checker, you‚Äôll discover that that content is 100% unique.I instructed ChatGPT to write a version of this article. Here‚Äôs how it opened:
As a copywriter, I‚Äôve spent years honing my craft and perfecting my ability to craft compelling and persuasive copy. But now, it seems that my job is at risk of being taken over by ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.
The developers admit that the software still has limitations. It tends towards the verbose and repetitive (‚Äúhoning my craft and perfecting my ability to craft‚Äù), and minor changes to question phrasing can be the difference between an amazing response and no response at all. The more we use it, however, the better it will become. As ChatGPT told me, it can already ‚Äúreplicate the writing styles of different authors‚Äù and ‚Äúeven be trained to mimic the tone and voice of a particular brand or organization‚Äù.I don‚Äôt claim any superior insight, just a realization that if a company can improve its bottom line by cutting costs in its supply chain, it will. Any sentimental attachment to human-created content is sure to be quickly overridden, I suspect, by the economic argument. After all, AI is super-fast labor that doesn‚Äôt eat, sleep, complain or take holidays.In the near term, writers and editors will still be needed, but fewer of them. A human will prompt AI to generate mountains of copy, only intervening again to fact-check, amend and approve. But how long before the model learns to spot commercial opportunities, generate ideas and put perfect content live without any human involvement?What does this mean for you? PriceWaterhouseCooper predicts that AI will produce a $15tn boost to GDP by 2030. Fantastic, but it also predicts that 3% of jobs are already at risk from AI. By the mid-2030s, this proportion will jump to 30% ‚Äì 44% among workers with low education. That‚Äôs a lot of people who will need to ‚Äúupskill‚Äù, retrain or drop out of the workforce.History has shown that, when technology has replaced humans, we‚Äôve created new purposes for ourselves. But in its eternal quest for self-improvement, is there a danger that AI will continually outpace us by making us redundant more quickly than we can redefine our roles? To take the creative industries as one example, AI is already replacing movie extras, songwriters and audiobook narrators.Some observers have suggested that the introduction of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) ‚Äì paid for by AI-generated wealth ‚Äì is the best bet for the future. In his essay ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law for Everything‚Äù, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, claimed that AI could drive enough economic output to pay every adult in the US $13,500 a year, while dramatically driving down the cost of goods and services.But work isn‚Äôt just income. For many, it‚Äôs meaning. Far from the tyrannical robots and human batteries seen in sci-fi, the real problem we might have to contend with is an epidemic of purposelessness. Even when not twinned with deprivation, a lack of purpose can contribute to depression, anxiety and addiction.Governments are already developing strategies to deal with this seismic shift in the labor market, but I‚Äôd urge individuals to do the same. I certainly will be. As with any revolutionary technology, there‚Äôs much debate over how exactly AI will reshape our lives in the coming decades, and not enough space to do every perspective justice here. But one thing is for certain: change is coming, and those who embrace it and adapt will be best placed to thrive.Or as ChatGPT would say:
The key is to find the right balance between using technology and honing the human touch. Copywriting is an art and it requires creativity, empathy and understanding of the target audience. So, ChatGPT will not take my job, but it will be my partner to create more impactful and persuasive copy.
But it would say that, wouldn‚Äôt it?

  AI applications are summarizing articles, writing stories and engaging in long conversations ‚Äî and large language models are doing the heavy lifting.
A large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other forms of content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets.
Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models. They aren‚Äôt just for teaching AIs human languages, but for understanding proteins, writing software code, and much, much more.
In addition to accelerating natural language processing applications ‚Äî like translation, chatbots and AI assistants ‚Äî large language models are used in healthcare, software development and use cases in many other fields.
What Are Large Language Models Used For?
Language is used for more than human communication.
Code is the language of computers. Protein and molecular sequences are the language of biology. Large language models can be applied to such languages or scenarios in which communication of different types is needed.
These models broaden AI‚Äôs reach across industries and enterprises, and are expected to enable a new wave of research, creativity and productivity, as they can help to generate complex solutions for the world‚Äôs toughest problems.
For example, an AI system using large language models can learn from a database of molecular and protein structures, then use that knowledge to provide viable chemical compounds that help scientists develop groundbreaking vaccines or treatments.
Large language models are also helping to create reimagined search engines, tutoring chatbots, composition tools for songs, poems, stories and marketing materials, and more.
How Do Large Language Models Work?
Large language models learn from huge volumes of data. As its name suggests, central to an LLM is the size of the dataset it‚Äôs trained on. But the definition of ‚Äúlarge‚Äù is growing, along with AI.
Now, large language models are typically trained on datasets large enough to include nearly everything that has been written on the internet over a large span of time.
Such massive amounts of text are fed into the AI algorithm using unsupervised learning ‚Äî when a model is given a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. Through this method, a large language model learns words, as well as the relationships between and concepts behind them. It could, for example, learn to differentiate the two meanings of the word ‚Äúbark‚Äù based on its context.
And just as a person who masters a language can guess what might come next in a sentence or paragraph ‚Äî or even come up with new words or concepts themselves ‚Äî a large language model can apply its knowledge to predict and generate content.
Large language models can also be customized for specific use cases, including through techniques like fine-tuning or prompt-tuning, which is the process of feeding the model small bits of data to focus on, to train it for a specific application.
Thanks to its computational efficiency in processing sequences in parallel, the transformer model architecture is the building block behind the largest and most powerful LLMs.
Top Applications for Large Language Models
Large language models are unlocking new possibilities in areas such as search engines, natural language processing, healthcare, robotics and code generation.
The popular ChatGPT AI chatbot is one application of a large language model. It can be used for a myriad of natural language processing tasks.
The nearly infinite applications for LLMs also include:

Retailers and other service providers can use large language models to provide improved customer experiences through dynamic chatbots, AI assistants and more.
Search engines can use large language models to provide more direct, human-like answers.
Life science researchers can train large language models to understand proteins, molecules, DNA and RNA.
Developers can write software and teach robots physical tasks with large language models.
Marketers can train a large language model to organize customer feedback and requests into clusters, or segment products into categories based on product descriptions.
Financial advisors can summarize earnings calls and create transcripts of important meetings using large language models. And credit-card companies can use LLMs for anomaly detection and fraud analysis to protect consumers.
Legal teams can use large language models to help with legal paraphrasing and scribing.

Running these massive models in production efficiently is resource-intensive and requires expertise, among other challenges, so enterprises turn to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, software that helps standardize model deployment and deliver fast and scalable AI in production.
When to Use Custom Large Language Models
Many organizations are looking to use custom LLMs tailored to their use case and brand voice. These custom models built on domain-specific data unlock opportunities for enterprises to improve internal operations and offer new customer experiences. Custom models are smaller, more efficient and faster than general-purpose LLMs.
Custom models offer the best solution for applications that involve a lot of proprietary data. One example of a custom LLM is BloombergGPT, homegrown by Bloomberg. It has 50 billion parameters and is targeted at financial applications.¬† 
Where to Find Large Language Models
In June 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3 as a service, powered by a 175-billion-parameter model that can generate text and code with short written prompts.
In 2021, NVIDIA and Microsoft developed Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation 530B, one of the world‚Äôs largest models for reading comprehension and natural language inference, which eases tasks like summarization and content generation.
And HuggingFace last year introduced BLOOM, an open large language model that‚Äôs able to generate text in 46 natural languages and over a dozen programming languages.
Another LLM, Codex, turns text to code for software engineers and other developers.
NVIDIA offers tools to ease the building and deployment of large language models:

NVIDIA NeMo LLM Service provides a fast path to customizing large language models and deploying them at scale using NVIDIA‚Äôs managed cloud API, or through private and public clouds.
NVIDIA NeMo framework, part of the NVIDIA AI platform, enables easy, efficient, cost-effective training and deployment of large language models. Designed for enterprise application development, NeMo provides an end-to-end workflow for automated distributed data processing; training large-scale, customized model types including GPT-3 and T5; and deploying these models for inference at scale.
NVIDIA BioNeMo is a domain-specific managed service and framework for large language models in proteomics, small molecules, DNA and RNA. It‚Äôs built on NVIDIA NeMo for training and deploying large biomolecular transformer AI models at supercomputing scale.

Challenges of Large Language Models
Scaling and maintaining large language models can be difficult and expensive.
Building a foundational large language model often requires months of training time and millions of dollars.
And because LLMs require a significant amount of training data, developers and enterprises can find it a challenge to access large-enough datasets.
Due to the scale of large language models, deploying them requires technical expertise, including a strong understanding of deep learning, transformer models and distributed software and hardware.
Many leaders in tech are working to advance development and build resources that can expand access to large language models, allowing consumers and enterprises of all sizes to reap their benefits.

As the legal industry continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it's becoming increasingly clear that generative AI will play a transformative role in how legal services are delivered. From streamlining the contract review process to automating document discovery, generative AI is already being used to improve efficiency and reduce costs in the legal profession. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential impact of this technology. As AI continues to advance, it has the potential to revolutionize the way lawyers work and fundamentally change the legal landscape.


Those are not my words; they are ChatGPT‚Äôs response to the prompt:

Write the opening paragraph for an article about how transformative generative AI will be for the legal industry in the style of Mark A. Cohen, Forbes Contributor.

ChatGPT‚Äôs answer was rendered in seconds, but it‚Äôs impact will linger for a long time. No doubt, this is a common response among those who have tinkered with OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, DALLE- 2, or other generative AI tools. And this is just the beginning‚Ä¶.

PROMOTED
Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, regards the current version of GPT as a work in progress. He recently tweeted: ‚ÄúChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness. it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it‚Äôs a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.‚Äù
Perhaps Mr. Altman‚Äôs ‚Äúcurb your enthusiasm‚Äù message to users is a reminder that ChatGPT is a prototype and that he is well aware of flaws that include occasional factual inaccuracies and gibberish. Or maybe it stems from his knowledge that GPT-4 is slated to be released soon and promises to be a much improved version.

Rob Toews, a Forbes contributor focused on AI wrote: ‚ÄúAs manic as the recent hype around ChatGPT has been, it will be a mere prelude to the public reaction when GPT-4 is released. Buckle up.‚Äù Toews predicts that the new version may be multimodal‚Äîable to work with images, videos and other data modalities in addition to text. That would mean that a text prompt as input could produce an image or take a video as input and answer questions about it in text format.

What‚Äôs Behind All The Buzz? 
ChatGPT is causing a stir for many reasons. It makes AI accessible, practical, easy to use, and versatile for nontechnical users. It provides detailed, intelligent answers (see above) across a wide array of knowledge domains. It is remarkably fast, erudite, fluid, thoughtful, and capable of providing nuanced responses to complex questions. Its mastery of content is rivaled by its ability, when directed, to respond in a specific artistic style or literary voice.
Unlike search engines like Google that produce a list of sources to sift through, review for relevance, and synthesize, ChatGPT curates, integrates, synthesizes, and produces a grammatically correct, well-written, and cross-disciplinary work product‚Äî in seconds .
There is a more visceral reason why ChatGPT has generated such a stir. It is a tool that propels the capability of technology into the realm of human creativity. It blurs the lines separating machine from human. Engagement does not require an ability to code or a technological background. It can engage in ‚Äúconversation‚Äù that can be as wide or in-depth as the prompts. Most of all, its response has a human quality.
ChatGPT has taken us by surprise. In a world where change has become increasingly rapid and constant, ChatGPT stands out for its range, speed, and intelligence. Its eerily human quality is the real mind-blower. No wonder ChatGPT‚Äôs release has produced such a mix of awe, dread and excitement,
ChatGPT Is Front Page News
Since its November 30, 2022 prototype launch by San Francisco based Open AI, ChatGPT has spread like wildfire. It had 1M users within five days of its release and has grown so quickly that users often encounter access delays caused by excessive server demand. That‚Äôs not the half of it.
The New York Times reported Google CEO Sundar Pichai issued a ‚Äúcode red‚Äù in response to the threat ChatGPT poses to Google‚Äôs search business. A Financial Times article reported Microsoft, which had already invested $3B in OpenAI, is in discussions to invest another $10B. When tech Goliaths respond this way, business‚Äîand the rest of the world‚Äîtakes notice.
A Fast Company article by Danica Lo provides a helpful primer on generative AI‚Äôs capabilities and uses. For example, besides its ability to answer complex questions across a wide range of knowledge domains, it can integrate those knowledge bases. The correct prompt enables it to ‚Äúconnect the dots,‚Äù a coveted human quality in today‚Äôs marketplace. It can write and debug computer programs, compose music, write and grade student essays (causing alarm among school systems and academics), and write poetry. Scientists used an earlier version of GPT to create novel protein sequences. One more time with feeling: this is just the beginning‚Ä¶..
McKinsey, among a growing list of leading consultancies, has proclaimed that generative AI tools like GPT and other technological advances could fundamentally change business. They have identified a wide array of use cases including: marketing and sales, operations IT/engineering, risk and legal, HR, and streamlining customer service. But the power of machines alone will not solve humanity‚Äôs wicked problems. Humans beings will play a key role, too. This requires adaptation, a key but often underestimated component of digital transformation.
Generative AI and other tools like robotics and data-insight enabling platforms have the potential to improve business as well as the human experience. To realize that potential requires investment in human beings‚Äî change management, cultural adaptation, lifetime learning, diversity, reevaluating hiring criteria, up-skilling, cross-functional workforces, and integration of the supply chain to cite a few.
The accelerating pace of technological change has heightened the importance and urgency of these human directives. Big business is investing significantly in the human aspect of digital transformation. It knows the success of the digital journey depends not only upon technology and data analytics but also upon human adaptation, creativity, inquisitiveness, agility collaboration, and teamwork. The legal function has a significant role to play in this process. It should lead, not lag. But will it?
How Will The Legal Industry Respond To Tools Like GPT? 
The legal industry seldom coalesces. Its resistance to change is an exception. Law‚Äôs legacy stakeholders‚Äîtenured academics, law firm partners, senior corporate counsel, judges, and regulators‚Äî are united in their opposition to material change. Each has its own style of parry; all pay lip service to ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù while staunchly defending the status quo. The incremental change they acquiesce to seldom benefits end-users or the public at large.
Law is one of the last artisanal industries in a digital world. Erosion of public trust in lawyers; the opaque, torturously slow, protracted, costly, lawyer-centric, unpredictable judicial process; the many failings of legal education ‚Äîto produce economically healthy and fit-for-the marketplace grads among them; the access to justice crisis; the erosion of the rule of law; and the assault on democracy are among the consequences of law‚Äôs stasis. Yet the legal industry stays its precarious course.
The legal market is a tale of two discrete segments: ‚Äúpeople law‚Äù (individuals and SME‚Äôs) and ‚Äúcorporate law‚Äù (large companies and the wealthy). In the short-term, ChatGPT will affect each differently. This is particularly so in people law, especially if tools like ChatGPT remain accessible and affordable. They have the potential to democratize the delivery of legal services, change the role of lawyers, and transform the archaic judicial system.
Richard Susskind, the pre-eminent ‚Äúlegal futurist‚Äù and a good friend, offered: ‚Äúwe are seeing here the makings of a solution to the global access to justice problem - the emergence of tools that will empower people with no legal knowledge to understand and enforce their legal entitlements; systems that will enable people to draft their own documents, secure legal guidance without lawyers, and assess their own legal risks. We are still at the foothills but the road ahead is clear. ‚Äú
ChatGPT builds and expands upon the seminal work of ‚Äúpeople law‚Äù companies like Legal Zoom, Rocket Lawyer, and DoNotPay, each of whom has leveraged technology to enable millions to secure fast, affordable, and lawyer-vetted but lawyer-lite assistance. ChatGPT provides a powerful tool into the hands of users, one that does not require tech fluency. It can help them cut through the opacity and expense of retaining counsel. It can also help to demystify legal process, procedures, and language.
While the public may embrace ChatGPT with open laptops, don‚Äôt expect such a widely enthusiastic response from the corporate sector, especially law firms.
The corporate segment is principally comprised of law firms and corporate legal teams (‚Äúin-house‚Äù). There is a growing divide between the two as to purpose, mindset, relationship with the client and its customers, success metrics, and economics, among other things. Corporate legal teams are generally better acquainted with the enterprise, its leadership, risk profile, supply chain, business strategy, economics, products/services, and other risk factors than their outside counsel.
Corporate legal teams, especially at the senior level, increasingly operate as business leaders with legal backgrounds, not as ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù in the narrow, traditional sense. They speak the language of business, operate cross-functionally, have developed relationships with the C-Suite and key business managers, and operate in a corporate structure, not a partnership one. ‚ÄúPartnering with clients‚Äù is not a catch-phrase for them; it is a reality. So too are words like ‚Äúalignment,‚Äù ‚Äúteamwork,‚Äù ‚Äúvalue creation,‚Äù ‚Äúdigital transformation,‚Äù ‚Äúup-skilling,‚Äù and ‚Äúagility.‚Äù
Most corporate legal teams will cautiously and curiously relegate ChatGPT and other tools to ‚Äúfirst draft‚Äù tasks, at least initially. The top ones, like the DXC legal team led by Bill Deckelman, have long recognized the importance of early adoption of digital technology and principles by lawyers and contracting professionals. Deckelman enthusiastically embraces generative AI‚Äôs emergence and what it portends for the legal function. He shared: ‚ÄúChatGPT represents a paradigm shift in AI, and even more advanced models will be appearing very soon. New applications applying generative AI technology will have the potential to disrupt traditional modes of law practice.‚Äù
Most law firms will regard ChatGPT and tools like it as billable hour killers and an end to client-subsidized junior lawyer training by observing. They will resort to ‚Äúscare tactics‚Äù with clients, warning them of the unpredictability, inaccuracy, and risk of relying on new, relatively untested technology instead of focusing on use cases. Such short-sighted, self-interested, and defensive behavior will likely cause some corporate legal teams to narrowly restrict the universe of generative AI use cases and insist that ‚Äúlawyer oversight‚Äù is required. That is a variation on law firms‚Äô response to emails, e-discovery, and digital transformation more broadly.
One managing partner confided: ‚Äú‚ÄúAdoption comes only when big firms are forced to do so. Just about everything else is window dressing to entice a client in without really making the investments to deliver on the implied promise.‚Äù There are many reasons for this purposefully short-sighted view that is all-too-common among law firms. It will continue until clients exert more pressure to change and/or asymmetric competition enters the legal marketplace (see below).
This presents an opportunity for firms to differentiate themselves to talent, clients, and the corporate world. They can do this by:
> investing in the creation of new practice areas (such as generative AI, data agility, and other burgeoning fields);
>attracting top talent from multiple disciplines by offering an opportunity to work at the ‚Äúbleeding edge‚Äù of law, business, and technology;
providing a sense of purpose;
>liberating lawyers from ‚Äúdrudge work‚Äù that generative AI can do faster, more efficiently, and arguably more reliably and better; and
>investing in agility training and up-skilling to identify and prepare for new opportunities;
>creating client-oriented solutions that advance business objectives and elevate customer experience rather than produce ‚Äúlegal work‚Äù alone.
Joe Andrew, the Global Chairman of the world‚Äôs largest global law firm has said frequently, ‚Äú When big law firms embrace new technology, they not only provide better service to clients, they are more likely to attract the best talent to their firm by lessening the drudgery of the more commoditized components of law. The future of every law firm is literally the talent it attracts and retains.‚Äù
The Big Four and tech Goliaths like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will, increasingly, become key players in a discussion of legal industry transformation. EY made headlines recently by spinning off its consulting practice from the audit function and announcing that consulting intends to morph from a partnership to corporate model. Look for one or more of the other Big Four enterprises to follow suit. They are well positioned to help large enterprises (as well as collaborate with the tech giants) leverage generative AI and other platforms to align the legal function with the enterprise, its workforce, customers, supply chain, and advance enterprise ESG/DEI and other initiatives.
The tech giants may well elect to leverage their technological muscle to expand their existing footprint in the legal industry. They have the brand, capital, data, customer base, war chest, expertise, talent, vision, and transformational experience to fundamentally change the entire legal landscape and to reshape law as we know it. This column has suggested that prospect previously. The emergence of new technologies impacting business and law heightens the probability of Big Tech‚Äôs entry into the legal sector. This will not eliminate lawyers but it will certainly change their roles, tasks, organizational and economic models, backgrounds, training, and customer orientation.
Conclusion
Generative AI, data analytics, robotics, the metaverse, and other platforms are business and social tools, not ‚Äúlegal tech.‚Äù They will quickly become a widely utilized, accepted, and integral part of business and society. This will put pressure on the legal function to shift from defense to offense. Rather than creating reasons to restrict their use, legal will be constrained by business, Government, and social advocates to focus on leveraging them to help create scalable solutions to a wide array of challenges. This will happen sooner than most lawyers think. It‚Äôs good news for business and society, and it will help unlock the latent potential of the legal function if lawyers don‚Äôt stand in the way.

I think we‚Äôre a ways off from that.‚ÄùEven those advocating for generative AI in video games think a lot of the excited talk about machine learning in the industry is getting out of hand. It‚Äôs ‚Äúridiculous,‚Äù says Julian Togelius, codirector¬†of the¬†NYU Game Innovation Lab, who has authored dozens of papers on the topic. ‚ÄúSometimes it feels like the worst kind of crypto bros left the crypto ship as it was sinking, and then they came over here and were like, ‚ÄòGenerative AI: Start the hype machine.‚Äô‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not that generative AI can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be used in game development, Togelius explains. It‚Äôs that people aren‚Äôt being realistic about what it could do. Sure, AI could design some generic weapons or write some dialog, but compared to text or image generation, level design is fiendish. You can forgive generators that produce a face with wonky ears or some lines of gibberish text. But a broken game level, no matter how magical it looks, is useless. ‚ÄúIt is bullshit,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúYou need to throw it out or fix it manually.‚ÄùAdvertisementBasically‚Äîand Togelius has had this conversation with multiple developers‚Äîno one wants level generators that work less than 100 percent of the time. They render games unplayable, destroying whole titles. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard to take generative AI that is so hard to control and just put it in there,‚Äù he says.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World‚Äôs ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon‚Äôt Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenA technique analogous to generative AI will be familiar to a lot of gamers: procedural generation. Togelius says, for argument‚Äôs sake, that he would be happy to say procedural generation is the same as generative AI (he describes their connection as ‚Äúkind of a sliding scale‚Äù). But procedural generation typically doesn‚Äôt use machine learning. Rather than an AI model, it runs on predetermined equations, generating, for example, the gargantuan cosmos of¬†No Man‚Äôs Sky. Developers also use software like SpeedTree, which, as its name suggests, conjures forests. The point is that procedural generation systems still require massive human supervision; developers must keep vigilant for unscalable crevasses or monstrous trees. And it‚Äôs not even clear that replacing procedural generation with generative AI right now would make a noticeable difference.¬†‚ÄúThese things already exist,‚Äù says Togelius. ‚ÄúAnd it works because this content doesn‚Äôt really need to function: It doesn‚Äôt have functionality constraints. Maybe you can replace them with deep-learning-based stuff. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to make a big difference. Perhaps it will make some difference in the long run.‚ÄùThere is a general misunderstanding of where the tech is at, explains Mills. ‚ÄúA fundamental reason why these generative AIs can‚Äôt make something like Night City is because these tools are designed to produce specific outcomes,‚Äù says Mills. ‚ÄúA lot of people seem to be under the impression that these are somehow close to general intelligences. But that‚Äôs not how it works. You‚Äôd need to custom-build an AI that could build Night City, or open world cities in general.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs also a failure to take into account the corporate landscape. Games still employ systems that grew from early technological limitations, like dialog or behavior trees. You can‚Äôt just drop fancy machine learning into game franchises that have developed without generative AI in mind. Games‚Äîin an industry with huge budgets and tight margins‚Äîwould need total redesigns to accommodate and take advantage of this technology.¬†Take, for example, non-player characters. Text-based generative AI tools seem like a great way to deepen conversation, and Togelius has been advising developers intrigued by this very idea. But it‚Äôs not that simple. Characters based on these language models are liable to go off on tangents, discussing topics outside of the game‚Äôs world. ‚ÄúThis is super interesting, but it‚Äôs also super hard,‚Äù says Togelius. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just drop it in there. It‚Äôs not going to work. You can‚Äôt expect the NPCs to behave in¬†Skyrim or¬†Elden Ring or¬†Grand Theft Auto or your typical RPG. You have to design around the fact that they are, in some sense, uncontrollable.‚ÄùNevertheless, there are some peripheral uses for generative AI right now. A good rule of thumb‚Äîone that applies to procedural generation too‚Äîis that the less crucial the content is, the more likely deep learning methods could be helpful. ‚ÄúFor things like text generation, I could use this¬†today to help generate filler for assets that aren‚Äôt really meant to be the focus of the player‚Äôs attention, like prop newspapers and such,‚Äù says Mills.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World‚Äôs ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon‚Äôt Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenAnother appeal is these tools‚Äô low barrier of entry, says Adrian Hon, the CEO and founder of independent games developer Six to Start and the co-creator of¬†Zombies, Run! Procedural generation, at least as the term is typically understood, requires a coder; anyone can use tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. He can see how they could help with prototyping or mood-boarding during a game‚Äôs early concept phase.But, Hon notes, many artists are skeptical of AI. Part of the backlash to the generative AI hype has been that these tools are modeling their output on the work of human creators. Some are even suing Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, claiming that Stable Diffusion, which powers Midjourney, was trained on images¬†used without permission. ‚ÄúObviously, there‚Äôs a whole copyright question. We know about all these suits going on,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut even if they get resolved, I think that there‚Äôll be some real upset among artists, which is understandable.‚ÄùAs with so many discussions about automation, the hype here is detached from current reality (debates over automation usually arise during times of ‚Äúdeep anxiety about the functioning of the labor market,‚Äù¬†writes sociologist Aaron Benanav). But, leaving reality for a second, it‚Äôs notable that much of the conversation around generative AI seems almost to revel at the prospect of replacing humans. Even an innocuous statement promising a boon for indie developers‚Äî‚ÄúA small team can make a world the size of Red Dead‚Äôs,‚Äù for example‚Äîcontains a kernel of this logic, explains Raphael van Lierop, the founder and creative director of independent studio Hinterland. It‚Äôs reductive, suggesting the work of a large part of that large team is mindlessly robotic.¬†‚ÄúThe focus on generative AI is another facet of what feels like an attack on creators and the act of creation, one that is expressed in a lot of different ways in our society right now,‚Äù he says. Reflecting a prevailing mood among artists across mediums, he sees nothing interesting about art made by an AI. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dead end,‚Äù he says.There‚Äôs definitely an unsettlingly inhuman element to all of this, one that you could imagine manifesting as a torrent of AI-generated shovelware run on predatory monetary systems. But at the higher echelons of game development, games created entirely by machines‚Äîones worth playing, at least‚Äîare some way off. ‚ÄúThe way some people say it‚Äôs going to be used, to just suddenly replace people and do the whole job by itself, is bullshit,‚Äù says Togelius. ‚ÄúYou need humans.‚Äù",,,,"https://media.wired.com/photos/63d1756a49591433ecea86ba/3:2/w_2400,h_1600,c_limit/Is-Generative-AI-Poised-to-Revolutionize-Game-Development--Not-Yet-Games.jpg",,https://schema.org/,BreadcrumbList,,https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-video-game-development/,"['https://media.wired.com/photos/63d1756a49591433ecea86ba/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Is-Generative-AI-Poised-to-Revolutionize-Game-Development--Not-Yet-Games.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/63d1756a49591433ecea86ba/4:3/w_2132,h_1599,c_limit/Is-Generative-AI-Poised-to-Revolutionize-Game-Development--Not-Yet-Games.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/63d1756a49591433ecea86ba/1:1/w_1600,h_1600,c_limit/Is-Generative-AI-Poised-to-Revolutionize-Game-Development--Not-Yet-Games.jpg']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Will Bedingfield', 'sameAs': 'https://www.wired.com/author/will-bedingfield/'}]","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}",Generative AI Won‚Äôt Revolutionize Game Development Just Yet,2023-01-25T13:35:18.230-05:00,2023-01-25T13:35:18.230-05:00,culture,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Culture', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/culture/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'video games', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/video-games/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Generative AI Won‚Äôt Revolutionize Game Development Just Yet'}]","There are, at the very least, two interrelated problems with this narrative.

But, leaving reality for a second, it‚Äôs notable that much of the conversation around generative AI seems almost to revel at the prospect of replacing humans. Even an innocuous statement promising a boon for indie developers‚Äî‚ÄúA small team can make a world the size of Red Dead‚Äôs,‚Äù for example‚Äîcontains a kernel of this logic, explains Raphael van Lierop, the founder and creative director of independent studio Hinterland. It‚Äôs reductive, suggesting the work of a large part of that large team is mindlessly robotic.
‚ÄúThe focus on generative AI is another facet of what feels like an attack on creators and the act of creation, one that is expressed in a lot of different ways in our society right now,‚Äù he says. Reflecting a prevailing mood among artists across mediums, he sees nothing interesting about art made by an AI. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dead end,‚Äù he says.
There‚Äôs definitely an unsettlingly inhuman element to all of this, one that you could imagine manifesting as a torrent of AI-generated shovelware run on predatory monetary systems. But at the higher echelons of game development, games created entirely by machines‚Äîones worth playing, at least‚Äîare some way off. ‚ÄúThe way some people say it‚Äôs going to be used, to just suddenly replace people and do the whole job by itself, is bullshit,‚Äù says Togelius. ‚ÄúYou need humans.‚Äù",,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",Hypesters say artificial intelligence will one day automate all the hard work of video game creation.

When ChatGPT was introduced to the general public at the end of last year, many people began to fear that artificial intelligence (A.I.) might soon make their job obsolete. Of course, horse-and-buggy-makers are gone, and farming requires something like one-hundredth of the labor input it used to. That's a good thing: Professions have gone extinct for centuries. New jobs emerge in the wake of old ones. A reshuffled labor market requires workers to gain different skills, while companies focus on solving different problems. That can be tough if you're in your mid-50s and on the receiving end of that technological shift, but it's not a catastrophic obstacle for economies at large.¬† Up until now, machines had been unable to venture into the creative domains long deemed human: the realms of emotion, compassion, creativity, and personality. There are few bestselling novels written by a computer, A.I.-powered inspirational speakers, or robots providing psychological help to clients in need. Some people now fear that A.I. will learn even these soft skills.

Economist Nouriel Roubini devotes a chapter in MegaThreats: Ten Dangerous Trends That Imperil Our Future, and How To Survive Them to A.I. He lists example after example of robots inching closer to overtaking humans at our own game. ""What happens,"" he asks, ""when that technology is actually intelligent? ‚Ä¶ No matter what work you do, artificial intelligence might eventually do it better."" Surely a robot can't connect with an opera audience, or mimic writing that creates that magic bond between author and reader. With this in mind, I looked at two programs in my own fields of writing and translation: OpenAI's ChatGPT, the text-generative A.I. that made such a social media splash in the last two months, and DeepL, developed by a German startup that just raised money at a $1 billion valuation. Both indicate that there's something to this latest bout of technological scare, but that mass employment among knowledge workers is still a ways off.¬† The service Grammarly already helps with language flows. Most word processors have built-in spell check. Even though keeping track of commas and hyphens should be easy, it usually isn't. Writing new content is even more of a stretch.¬† All over social media, I found examples of ChatGPT-generated output that looked humanish. That is, if you count the stumbling and robotic prose you might get from a 12-year-old or a bored college student fulfilling their essay's word requirement via endless rephrasing. Most ChatGPT writing I've seen is dull, shallow, and soulless‚Äînone of the characteristics that make good writing come alive. Roubini thinks mass unemployment due to A.I. is inevitable in the coming years. What the best A.I. writing generators put out is indeed indistinguishable from bad human writing. Bad writers, cheating students, lazy professors, and journalists echoing press releases have clearly met their match. But the more human, creative, authentic storytelling that is the center of all meaningful writing has not.¬† For translation services, progress has been much more impressive. Between some language pairs, Google Translate has already gone from being a complete joke to being quite usable‚Äîeven for technical texts, like legal documents, which were previously Linguee's forte. DeepL noticeably improves on Google Translate's output and was ""originally trained on a database of over a billion translations and queries, plus a method of double-checking translations by searching for similar snippets on the web,"" according to its developer. When I sparingly used DeepL for a recent translation project, it performed miles better than other software. It translated blocks of text much faster than a human ever could but its accuracy, vocabulary, and understanding of context was still subpar, rapidly deteriorating with a sentence's complexity. For single words or phrases, established two-language dictionaries often produced more exact translations. DeepL is an impressive feat of translation progress, of course, but still in need of human supervision.¬† While pessimists like Roubini frequently express fears that this new technology will take away jobs from white-collar workers, content-generating A.I. will probably enhance human labor rather than make it obsolete. Robert Wright and Aleksandra Przegalinska conclude¬†that ""Humans will use AI as yet another tool, much like they have used Acheulean hand axes and satellite-controlled tractors to do more work in less time or with less energy""‚Äîjust like so many other technologies have done before it.

In what appears to be the first major, technology-driven shakeup to the white collar marketplace, artificial intelligence could well be poised to replace human workers in higher-paying, college-degree-requiring jobs.""Before, progress was linear and predictable. You figured out the steps and the computer followed them,"" MIT professor David Autor, an expert on employment and technological change, told The Atlantic's Annie Lowery. ""It followed the procedure; it didn't learn and it didn't improvise.""And that, of course, is where cutting-edge AI is starting to differ. After all, learning new tricks is the tech's Whole Thing ‚Äî thus rendering what were once non-automatable jobs susceptible to mechanization after all.That's right, college grads: not even that wildly expensive degree can save you from the robots now.No One's SafeThe expert sentiment isn't terribly surprising, especially in light of the CNET drama that's unfolded this week. To recap: CNET, unbeknownst to its readers, had been stealthily using very dumb generative AI to publish financial explainers, to much dismay from human journalists. SEO spammers, on the other hand, are thrilled to employ new text-generating AIs to pump out spam.And that's just journalism. AI stands to impact a number of historically white collar markets, in fields ranging from computer science¬†to healthcare .If there's any bright spot, Autor does think that while artificial intelligence will certainly render a lot of human jobs moot, a lot of specialty positions, like reporting, will still be left to humans.""In many ways, AI will help people use expertise better,"" he told The Atlantic. ""It means that we'll specialize more.""Still, getting a ""specialty"" position in the first place is incredibly difficult in the first place, let alone without first holding a job in the entry-level positions that are most likely about to fall to machines first.And sure, the job market, over time, has always adapted to major technological changes.

As I mentioned a few times in this blog, I‚Äôve been working with and teaching about artificial intelligence since the start of my career. This drove much of my interest in cloud computing because AI was not economically viable or accessible until ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù came along.
Interest in AI and its applications inflected about five years ago. Then the pandemic happened and some budgets shifted to speedy cloud migrations. Now that things are returning to normal, AI is back. Most enterprises grasp the fundamental possibilities of AI and are looking to weaponize the technology for their own business.
The technology got way more impressive along the way. Generative AI, for example, went from PhD dissertations to an accessible and free reality with the advent of generative AI services such as ChatGPT.











 
 
 
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that generates new and unique outputs, such as text, images, or audio based on input data and learned patterns. This can include tasks such as text generation, image synthesis, and music composition.

A wide variety of inputs can be made through a chatbot or an API that results in an impressive response. The responses are so impressive that I‚Äôve been fielding calls from journalists who are writing stories on AI replacing workers. It‚Äôs a question I‚Äôve heard for the past 20 years but now there‚Äôs a modern twist. Colleges and universities have new concerns about college students using ChatGPT or similar services to write papers for them. AI creates output that plagiarism detection systems can‚Äôt quickly identify because it‚Äôs not plagiarism.
AI ethical and bias concerns could emerge from certain types of learning data. Will those biases cause unintended negative consequences, such as an automated pattern that denies loans to certain groups of people?











 
 
 
I‚Äôm hearing the following core questions: What types of human tasks can AI replace now or soon? Should I be planning a career change to a job that AI can‚Äôt automate? Is it safe to be a cloud computing architect, cloud developer, cloud operations engineer, devops engineer, cloud project leader, etc.? Those are the job titles of most of you reading this article. Are you at risk?
I think the reality is we‚Äôre well on our way to replacing many human tasks with AI-fueled automation. It‚Äôs just what happens as technology progresses, and it‚Äôs nothing new. Technology is why we no longer have dozens of people in a field to pick crops in the fall. We can check out of the supermarket without interacting with a human. Our cars and trucks can drive themselves.
One thing that I‚Äôve been frustrated with is how the whole IT design and deployment process lacks helpful automation. Oh sure, we have tons of tools, processes, methodologies, and other assets to speed up our journey to an optimized cloud architecture and deployment. However, they don‚Äôt make critical decisions for the architects. Cloud architecture must typically be determined through deep analysis and judgment, which only come through experience. More importantly, creativity and innovation are still required‚Äîthings humans bring to the table.











 
 
 
Of course, humans make many architectural mistakes, such as picking the wrong platform, tools, and services. Humans create architectures that are wholly underoptimized and fail to return value to the business.¬†I addressed that issue recently.
If we turned solution creation over to AI, perhaps we‚Äôd get better decisions. Imagine if the AI system had training data that simultaneously reflected the knowledge of thousands of good cloud architects. Such an AI system could effectively process that knowledge into solutions based on provided business and technology requirements. It may not get you the final answers required to build something, but it could get close enough that it could remove a great deal of the work and potential mistakes.
The most likely path is that tactical AI tools will continue to appear. These tools will focus on specific architectural areas, such as network design, database design, platform selection, cloud-native design, security, governance, use of containers, etc. The output should be as good as, if not better than what we see today because these tools will leverage almost perfect data and won‚Äôt have those pesky human frailties that drive some architecture designs‚Äîemotions and feelings. Of course, some of these AI tools exist today (don‚Äôt tell me about your tool) and are progressing toward this ideal. However, their usefulness varies depending on the task.











 
 
 
Tactical AI tools must still be operated by knowledgeable people who understand how to ask the right questions and validate the designs and recommendations the tool produces. Although it may take fewer people to pull off the tactical component design of a large cloud architecture, the process will not likely eliminate all humans. Remember, many of these mistakes occur because enterprises have difficulty finding skilled cloud pros. Tactical AI tools may also help fix that problem by better syncing the demand and supply of talent.
It‚Äôs easy to predict how this will progress, and it‚Äôs nothing earth-shattering. Design, development, and deployment tools will evolve. They will provide more value and usefulness. Fewer people may be needed overall, but these tools will require talented operators to work correctly. They will focus primarily on the tactical design of cloud architecture components, such as network and security.
So, we still must rely on humans, such as yours truly, to build sound cloud solutions. The smaller problems may have AI solutions, but the larger problem of poetically automating cloud architectures remains a problem not yet solved.











 
 
 
I suspect we‚Äôll still need human cloud architects and solution designers for some time to pull all of this together and ensure that we‚Äôre deploying optimized solutions that return the most value to the business. I don‚Äôt see that being something that can be replaced entirely by AI, but I‚Äôm under no illusion that it‚Äôs unlikely forever.
But let‚Äôs ask ChatGPT: ‚ÄúWill AI replace cloud computing architects?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is unlikely that AI will completely replace cloud computing architects in the near future as while AI can assist cloud architects in tasks such as automated provisioning, monitoring, and scaling of resources, it still requires human oversight and decision-making to ensure that the systems are configured correctly and to ensure that the AI is working as intended. Cloud architects also play a crucial role in overall strategy and design of a cloud computing environment, and tasks that are difficult to fully automate with current AI technology. However, it is possible that AI could automate some of the repetitive and routine tasks that cloud architects currently perform, allowing them to focus on more strategic and higher-level responsibilities.‚Äù
I agree.

Artificial intelligence is here, and it‚Äôs coming for your job. 
So promising are the tool‚Äôs capabilities that Microsoft ‚Äî amid laying off 10,000 people ‚Äî has announced a ‚Äúmultiyear, multibillion-dollar investment‚Äù in the revolutionary technology, which is growing smarter by the day.
And the rise of machines leaves many well-paid workers vulnerable, experts warn.
‚ÄúAI is replacing the white-collar workers. I don‚Äôt think anyone can stop that,‚Äù said Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the department of computing and information sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology.

		Rogue AI ‚Äòcould kill everyone,‚Äô scientists warn as ChatGPT craze runs rampant	





Earlier this month, it emerged that consumer publication CNET had been using AI to generate stories since late last year ‚Äî a practice put on pause after fierce backlash on social media. Academia was recently rocked by the news that ChatGPT had scored higher than many humans on an MBA exam administered at Penn‚Äôs elite Wharton School. After Darren Hick, a philosophy professor at South Carolina‚Äôs Furman University, caught a student cheating with the wildly popular tool, he told The Post that the discovery had left him feeling ‚Äúabject terror‚Äù for what the future might entail.
close dialog     Play/Pause Video              Mute/Unmute Video             Advertisementclose dialogHick¬†and many others are right to be worried, said Chinmay Hegde, a computer science and electrical engineering associate professor at New York University.
‚ÄúCertain jobs in sectors such as journalism, higher education, graphic and software design ‚Äî these are at risk of being supplemented by AI,‚Äù said Hegde, who calls ChatGPT in its current state ‚Äúvery, very good, but not perfect.‚Äù  
For now, anyway. 
Here‚Äôs a look at some of the jobs most vulnerable to the fast-learning, ever-evolving technology.
Education

Professors and teachers could be replaced by AI courses, according to experts. Getty Images
As it stands now, ChatGPT ‚Äî currently banned in NYC schools ‚Äî ‚Äúcan easily teach classes already,‚Äù Shi said. The tool would likely be most effective at the middle or high school level, he added, as those classes reinforce skills already established in elementary school.

		NYC schools block access to ChatGPT over cheating concerns	





‚ÄúAlthough it has bugs and inaccuracies in terms of knowledge, this can be easily improved. Basically, you just need to train the ChatGPT,‚Äù Shi continued.
As for higher education, both Shi and Hegde maintain that college courses will need a human leader for the foreseeable future, but the NYU professor did admit that, in theory, AI could teach without oversight. 
In the meantime, educators are seeing their roles transformed nearly overnight. It‚Äôs already become a struggle to adapt teaching and testing methods in efforts to keep up with the increasingly talented ChatGPT, which, according to Shi, can successfully complete a corner-cutting student‚Äôs coursework at a master‚Äôs level.
Doctoral candidates hoping for a shortcut are likely out of luck: Creating an independent thesis on an area not often or thoroughly studied is beyond AI‚Äôs abilities for the time being, he said.
Finance

AI like ChatGPT could take over spreadsheet-style jobs in finance, experts warn. Getty Images
Wall Street could see many jobs axed in coming years, as bots like ChatGPT continue to better themselves, Shi told The Post.
‚ÄúI definitely think [it will impact] the trading side, but even [at] an investment bank, people [are] hired out of college and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling ‚Äî you can get AI to do that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúMuch, much faster.‚Äù
Shi is certain, however, that crucial financial and economic decisions will likely always be left in human hands, even if the data sheets are not.
Software engineering

Website designers and engineers responsible for comparatively simple coding are at risk of being made obsolete, Hegde warns. 
‚ÄúI worry for such people. Now I can just ask ChatGPT to generate a website for me ‚Äî any type of person whose routine job would be doing this for me is no longer needed.‚Äù 
In essence, AI can draft the code ‚Äî hand-tailored to a user‚Äôs requests and parameters ‚Äî to build sites and other pieces of IT.
Relatively uncomplicated software design jobs will be a thing of the past by 2026 or sooner, Shi said.
‚ÄúAs time goes on, probably today or the next three, five, 10 years, those software engineers, if their job is to know how to code ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think they will be broadly needed,‚Äù Shi said.
Journalism


7

AI is already making its way into newsrooms.  Getty Images
The technology is off to a rocky start in the news-gathering business:¬†CNET‚Äôs recent attempts (and subsequent corrections to its computer-generated stories) were preceded by the Guardian, which had GPT software write a piece in 2020 ‚Äî¬†with mixed results. 
Still, there is one job the technology is already highly qualified for, according to Hegde.
‚ÄúCopy editing is certainly something it does an extremely good job at. Summarizing, making an article concise and things of that nature, it certainly does a really good job,‚Äù he said, noting that ChatGPT is excellent at designing its own headlines.
One major shortcoming ‚Äî salvation for reporters and copy editors, at least for now ‚Äî is the tool‚Äôs inability to fact-check efficiently, he added.
‚ÄúYou can ask it to provide an essay, to produce a story with citations, but more often than not, the citations are just made up,‚Äù Hegde continued. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a known failure of ChatGPT and honestly we do not know how to fix that.‚Äù
Graphic design

In 2021, ChatGPT developer OpenAI launched another tool, DALL-E, which can generate tailored images from user-generated prompts on command. Along with doppelgangers such as Craiyon, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, the tool poses a threat to many in the graphic and creative design industries, according to Hegde.
‚ÄúBefore, you would ask a photographer or you would ask a graphic designer to make an image [for websites]. That‚Äôs something very, very plausibly automated by using technology similar to ChatGPT,‚Äù he continued.
331What do you think?¬†Post a comment.
Shi recently commanded DALL-E to make a cubist portrait of rabbits for the Lunar New Year, which he said came out ‚Äújust amazing.‚Äù But, although it captured the hard-lined, Picasso-derived painting style, Shi noticed that it was not successful with more nuanced techniques ‚Äî exposing a current shortcoming in the tech.
‚ÄúI also asked it to do Matisse-style. It was not as good,‚Äù he added.
Copyright issues are also being generated by image-based AI. Getty Images recently announced legal action against¬†Stability AI ‚Äî Stable Diffusion‚Äôs parent company ‚Äî claiming that the program ‚Äúunlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright.‚Äù

A group of artists has filed a class-action complaint against the companies behind a trio of A.I. art generators, saying the services violated copyright and unfair competition laws.
On January 13, illustrators Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed suit in the Northern District of California against Midjourney Inc, DeviantArt Inc, which is behind DreamUp, and Stability A.I. Ltd, the company that launched Stable Diffusion. They term these text-to-image platforms ‚Äú21st-century collage tools that violate the rights of millions of artists.‚Äù
Chiefly, the artists‚Äô complaint states that A.I. generators have used their artworks without consent or compensation to build the training sets that inform the platforms‚Äô algorithms. In particular, these services rely on the LAION-Aesthetics dataset, created by a German company and commissioned by Stability A.I.
The lawsuit cites a study that found that 47 percent of the LAION-Aesthetics dataset is made up of images from stock photo sites such as Shutterstock and Getty Images, shopping sites including Pinterest, and websites hosting user-generated content such as Flickr and Tumblr. An estimated one of out every 50 images in the dataset (or about 3.3 million images) had been sourced from DeviantArt, according to the complaint.¬†
‚ÄúDefendants are using copies of the training images,‚Äù it reads, ‚Äúto generate digital images and other output that are derived exclusively from the Training Images, and that add nothing new.‚Äù In turn, these generated images, ‚Äúwill substantially negatively impact the market for the work of plaintiffs and the class.‚Äù Both Andersen and McKernan say their art has been used in LAION datasets.

Additionally, the class action asserts that A.I. generators have allowed art to be generated ‚Äúin the style‚Äù of particular artists, thus ‚Äúsiphoning commissions from the artists themselves.‚Äù Because of this ‚Äúunlawful appropriation,‚Äù the plaintiffs claim that the value of their art has been devalued and diluted amid a flood of similar-looking A.I.-generated images. (Andersen recently penned an op-ed in the New York Times, writing that generators have effectively imitated the style of her webcomic.)¬†
‚ÄúDefendants specifically and knowingly used Plaintiffs‚Äô names because these names were uniquely related to specific artistic styles, and Defendants generated valuable business from their ability to sell artworks ‚Äòin the style‚Äô that plaintiffs popularized,‚Äù the suit emphasizes. ‚ÄúThus, the use of plaintiffs‚Äô names contributed value to defendants‚Äô platform and services.‚Äù
The class is requesting the district court award damages pursuant to the stated violations, as well as permanent injunctive relief that includes ‚Äúmaking changes‚Äù to the A.I. image generators.
The Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which represents the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.¬†
A spokesperson for Stability A.I. told Artnet News, ‚Äúwe take these matters seriously. Anyone that believes that this isn‚Äôt fair use does not understand the technology and misunderstands the law.‚Äù Midjourney and DeviantArt did not respond to requests for comment.
Photo courtesy Stability AI Github.
The point on fair use has also been surfaced by Stable Diffusion Frivolous, a website purportedly created by ‚Äútech enthusiasts uninvolved in the case, and not lawyers‚Äù in support of the defendants in the lawsuit.¬†
The site argues that ‚Äúthere are limits to the rights of creators, and the world is better for the existence of fair use,‚Äù a doctrine in U.S. copyright law that allows excerpts of copyrighted material to be used for nonprofit educational purposes, without permission from or payment toward the copyright holder.
Stable Diffusion Frivolous further takes issue with the complaint‚Äôs characterization of A.I. generators as ‚Äúcollage tools,‚Äù stating that these models work on associations or ‚Äúdata distributions‚Äù rather than any form of copying, pasting, or blending. A.I.-generated images, it added, could be considered ‚Äútransformative‚Äù enough to not violate copyright laws.¬†
The group deems the plaintiffs ‚Äúanti-A.I. artists [that fear] being replaced by artists who use A.I. tools in their workflows,‚Äù concluding that ‚Äúthose who refuse to acknowledge advancements in technology and instead fight against them are like whittlers mad at power tools.‚Äù
Stable Diffusion, along with other text-to-image tools including Midjourney and Lensa, have rocketed in use over the past year, with A.I.-generated images swiftly populating social media, art-sharing sites, and at least one art competition. While platforms such as DeviantArt‚Äôs DreamUp have attempted to build in protections for creators rights, artists have emphasized that infringements begin with the training datasets, into which copyrighted images have been scraped.¬†
Most recently, Getty Images, which says it has found more than 15,000 photos from its library in the Stable Diffusion dataset, brought a separate lawsuit against Stability A.I., claiming copyright violations. In an interview with The Verge, Getty Images CEO Craig Peters said the stock image giant is not seeking financial compensation or to halt the development of generative A.I., but legal ‚Äúclarity‚Äù as to the rights of creators and entities.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
AI is a rapidly evolving technology at the forefront of public interest, yet many people don't have a clear picture of what it is. Here we will clear the air surrounding AI and debunk 10 common myths people still believe.




How is it that everybody is talking about artificial intelligence (AI), yet we don‚Äôt yet have friendly robots, like Data from ‚ÄúStar Trek,‚Äù walking among us?
Even today, in 2023, there‚Äôs a lot of confusion about what AI, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are, what ‚Äòintelligent machines‚Äô can do and what the current state of AI technologies actually is.
With constant misinformation, it‚Äôs no wonder so many myths have sprung up. It‚Äôs time to enjoy some good old debunking as we bust the 10 most common myths about AI (Also Read: Is the AI Revolution Going to Make Universal Income a Necessity?).
1. ‚ÄúAI consists of intelligent robots or androids that look like humans.‚Äù
There‚Äôs a lot of confusion between robotics and AI, they are two completely distinct scientific fields which serve different purposes.
Robots are tangible devices served by actuators and sensors to perform a wide range of tasks, such as building, carrying or dismantling products in factories.
AI is software programmed in such a way that it is autonomous enough to make decisions and learn from its mistakes. Although some robots may eventually incorporate AI algorithms, the ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô part is just one aspect of AI.Advertisements




2. ‚ÄúAI, machine learning and deep learning are all the same thing.‚Äù
Although they‚Äôre all parts of the larger AI system, AI, machine learning and deep learning are three different things.
Machine learning is the method through which AI learns from external sources, such as using algorithms to discriminate between data and determine its correct behaviors.
Deep learning is just one possible technique used in practical applications of machine learning. It is based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and works to determine the probability of successful decisions for AI.
3. ‚ÄúAI learns completely on its own.‚Äù
Despite some exaggerated hype about certain AI allegedly able to learn on its own, it is still impossible to find an AI-powered system that has any real-world application capable of growing from zero knowledge without human assistance.
Any system that has to deal with hidden information or uncertainty of any kind cannot be ‚Äòunderstood‚Äô by AI; it still needs to be fed input and data by humans. Also, every bit of information must have a clear purpose. AI cannot make guesses, it works through external sources and previous data; it can‚Äôt conceptualize abstracts like humans.
4. ‚ÄúAI is always better than human employees.‚Äù
The COVID-19 pandemic has required interventions that reduce in-person labor and close contact between humans. AI-powered automation has become a ‚Äòhero‚Äô that not only helped to prevent the virus from spreading, but also provided some much-needed resilience to many sectors plagued by lockdowns and restrictions, such as the supply chain.
While it is true that the move to AI systems has become permanent for a lot of jobs, many of these systems only handle simple and repetitive tasks that could be easily automated. Although they may be more efficient than humans in some instances, AI technologies cannot substitute a human employee in any area that requires creativity, empathy, ingenuity or critical thinking. Some very human things like face-to-face communication cannot truly be replaced by any machine.
AI just isn‚Äôt capable of creating original ideas or independent thinking. Even the most intelligent machines are still just virtual programs and algorithms.
5. ‚ÄúThe power needed to perform all future deep-learning operations is unsustainable.‚Äù
It is undeniable that AI requires a lot of additional computing power to be trained and to perform all its complex, deep-learning operations. It seems in a future where most enterprises will make use of AI to some extent, this problem may grow to epic proportions, making its use potentially unsustainable.
However, AI is actually providing us with the perfect solutions to help tackle issues like climate change. It can help farmers push yields per hectare, improve energy production by reducing power grid waste and inefficiency, reduce carbon footprints and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, bolster strategic planning and decision models on how to tackle climate change and so on.
With additional advancements in computing, like quantum computing, it won‚Äôt be long until we have the power and resources to run even more demanding AI systems.
6. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy for an enterprise to rent the computing power needed to fuel AI operations.‚Äù
Perhaps this one would be true if AWS, Google, Microsoft and Alibaba Cloud weren‚Äôt currently centralizing the vast majority of the computing power available in the world. So, AI developers currently have just two choices: renting at exceptionally high prices or purchasing their own super-expensive hardware (Also Read: The Four Major Cloud Players: Pros and Cons).
A new company called Tatau developed a blockchain-based supercomputing platform that can solve the issue. Their solution allows the aggregation and reselling of the combined resources of a globally distributed network of GPU-based machines.
Imagine cryptocurrency miners, gamers or other high-performance computers dedicating their computing power toward AI development. AI companies can tap into this underexploited source of GPU power to train their machine-learning models at a much cheaper price. Note that this new platform may also provide an answer to the problem highlighted in myth five, since it promotes efficient use of currently untapped resources.
7. ‚ÄúYou need immense amounts of data to train AI.‚Äù
This isn‚Äôt necessarily the case. Sure, you need a lot of data and computing power to train an AI from scratch. And, albeit to a lesser extent, you need terabytes of data to train an AI to perform a complex task, such as driving a car. However, depending on the field of application of the AI, pre-trained neural networks are flexible enough to be retrained in specific areas.
The basic data framework may come from a larger, more general data set, with only the last part of the network needing to be replaced to fill in the blanks. Time has passed since the adoption of early AI, now new AI can generate synthetic datasets that could be used to train other AI. In fact, it has even be proven by MIT that these datasets can be more efficient than traditional ones, paving the way to a world of new possibilities.
8. ‚ÄúAI will replace existing BI tools, making any previous technology obsolete.‚Äù
This myth is a bit of a stretch, to say the least. The majority of modern business intelligence (BI) solutions are highly scalable and often customizable so that any future AI-based model can be easily integrated directly into their platforms.
Companies always prefer to implement only those solutions which come without any risk of workflow disruption, and AI technologies have adapted to this need. Therefore, most AI platforms are implemented via the web so no replacement is necessary or, in the worst-case scenario, can be safely implemented in phases to lessen workflow interruptions.
9. ‚ÄúArtificial neural networks are like biological networks, but mechanical.‚Äù
No artificial neural network can ever hope to reach a fraction of the complexity of the human brain. It‚Äôs like comparing the complexity of a military aircraft to a kite just because they can both fly.
Despite many years of clinical and scientific research, we still fail to understand biological neural networks to their full extent, since neurons fulfil so many different tasks within the human body (think about the difference between a sensory and motor neuron) and even transmit information through many different pathways (using electricity, chemical potential and neurotransmitters).
The majority of AI employed by enterprises are just Narrow AI that possesses simple abilities to react to data triggers. They are equipped with little to no memory or data storage capabilities and only use historical data to inform decisions.
Strong AI and Deep AI that can apply their intelligence and knowledge to solve problems are still largely theoretical and have very little current practical application. To put things in perspective, the Fujitsu-built K, one of the most advanced strong AI, needed 40 minutes to simulate the equivalent of just one second of brain activity!
10. ‚ÄúAI will eventually become intelligent enough to understand that humans are dangerous to it and must be exterminated.‚Äù
Well, we can‚Äôt actually debunk this myth since it‚Äôs not a myth. It‚Äôs a reality. Brace yourselves, because resistance is futile!
Jokes aside, AI has nowhere near the intelligence needed to understand the world around itself and make autonomous, rational decisions (Also Read: Why Superintelligent AIs Won‚Äôt Destroy Humans Anytime Soon).
Each algorithm is developed to perform one task and is not able to do anything outside of that, let alone reach the ability to think independently. Computers use the ‚Äòbrute force‚Äô of their superior computational powers to find a solution to relatively simple issues, but they lack the understanding, perceptive depth and strategic complexity to have a purpose outside the one they‚Äôre programmed for.
While it perhaps shouldn‚Äôt be written off just yet as a total impossibility, there is no real chance of computers developing sentience, at least not for centuries to come. AI will remain nothing more than another ‚Äî albeit, more complex ‚Äî tool for us to use as we please for a long, long time.

ChatGPT: Grading artificial intelligence's writing 











ChatGPT: Grading artificial intelligence's writing
08:02

AI text generator ChatGPT, released to the public late last year, is so sophisticated that it has already demonstrated its ability to write coherent essays, generate sound legal documents and otherwise interact with humans in a convincingly conversational manner.One CEO even treats the tool from parent company OpenAI like a perennially available member of his executive team.""I ask ChatGPT to become aware of where my biases and blindspots might be, and the answers it gives are a really, really good starting point to check your thinking,"" Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of online course provider Coursera, told CBS MoneyWatch.¬† 






He said the tool helps him to be more thoughtful in his approach to business challenges, as well as look at topics from vantage points that differ from his own. For example, last week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Maggioncalda entered the following prompt: ""What should I consider when giving a speech to prime ministers at Davos?""¬†Another useful entry for business leaders would be: ""What should I consider when I am restructuring my company?"" Maggioncalda said.






ChatGPT: Grading artificial intelligence's writing
08:02

Maggioncalda is far from alone in his admiration for the popular tool. Nearly 30% of U.S. professionals say they have already used AI in their work, and industry experts have called it a game-changing creation with wide-ranging implications for businesses and jobs. Some have likened it to innovations like the calculator ‚Äî which changed the way people think, act and teach.¬†


""Where these things really matter is whether it increases the value of human expertise, or whether it mostly substitutes for it,"" MIT labor economics professor David Autor told CBS MoneyWatch.No more first draftsBots will devalue clerical and administrative skills, according to Autor. Chatbots are also already proficient at generating human resources letters, boilerplate text and some advertising copy.""Those things are just going to become easier to do. That kind of semi-expert work will become automated,"" he said.That's bad news for junior and mid-level workers. ""The jobs that are most likely to be displaced [involve] mundane tasks like writing basic ad copy or the first draft of a legal document. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said.


Mihir Shukla, CEO and founder of AI and robotic automation company Automation Anywhere, predicted at Davos that ""anywhere from 15% to 70% of all the work we do in front of the computer could be automated.""What remains to be seen is what kinds of new jobs emerging forms of AI will create. Because while ChatGPT is new, it is only the latest example of the historic cycle of technological innovation, from the printing press and the loom to the smartphone and robotics, that dooms certain lines of work while opening new ones.""We will produce new goods and services with this that create value and new opportunities, and that is much harder to forecast,"" Autor said.¬†

Another member of the executive teamMaggioncalda of Coursera said he relies on ChatGPT as a writing assistant and more substantially as a thought partner.¬†""If you give it a bunch of text, it can summarize it well, put it into bullet points or into different languages,"" he said.¬†He treats ChatGPT like another member of his executive team ""that wears different masks and speaks different voices from different perspectives.""""To a large degree, Chat GPT is like another person there who you're also bouncing ideas off of. It's another point of view and it's there all the time,"" Maggioncalda added


Outsourcing this kind of work to chatbots isn't necessarily a job-killer, though. Instead, in theory, it should free up human workers to focus on more thoughtful ‚Äî and ideally profitable ‚Äî work.¬†For now, AI hasn't replaced humans for Maggioncalda. ""If I could either have my executive team check my blind posts and thinking, I would definitely have them there versus ChatGPT,"" he said.""The world will never be the same""Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer, an expert in text-mining techniques, said he instantly recognized ChatGPT as a revolutionary advance in artificial intelligence.¬†""It's truly an amazing leap in technology and innovation,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""From what we've seen, it was one of those moments that happens very rarely in technology and innovation, where you experience it and you say, 'the world will never be the same as it was before.'""Enter a prompt, like ""What jobs will ChatGPT take?"" and ChatGPT spits out the following answer:¬†ChatGPT is a language model that can be used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as text generation, language translation, summarization, and more. It can be used in industries such as customer service, marketing, and content creation. However, it is important to note that ChatGPT is a tool and it will not take any jobs, it will assist to improve existing jobs and automate certain tasks.

Chatbots have already taken over online customer service roles, and next month, for the first time, an AI-powered ""robot"" lawyer will represent a defendant in court. ChatGPT threatens to replace humans when it comes to tasks that are simple to execute, like following a script or whipping up a standard legal document ‚Äî think an apartment lease, someone's will or a nondisclosure agreement, according to experts.


Nearly 30% of professionals in the U.S. say they have already used  ChatGPT or other AI tools for a work-related task, according to a  recent¬†survey¬†of  4,500 employees by Fishbowl, a social network owned by career services  firm Glassdoor. Workers in marketing and advertising had the highest  rate of adoption, with 37% saying they had used AI, while 35% and 30% of  those in technology and consulting, respectively, also report having  utilized AI.Netzer said that while ChatGPT will usher in radical change, in most cases, it won't replace workers, but rather supercharge their ability to do their jobs efficiently. ""It's primarily an enhancer rather than full replacement of jobs,"" he said. Supercharged workFor example, ChatGPT is adept at helping programmers autocomplete and identify errors in their computer code.""To the extent that we would need fewer programmers, maybe it will take away jobs. But it would help those who program find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said.The same goes for many jobs that require basic writing skills, he said. ""In terms of jobs that require writing, I think of it as a starting point as opposed to fully replacing us. I think it's a great tool to enter a prompt, see what it writes, then add a human touch,"" he added.


For example, ChatGPT could readily be used to generate an email to set up a meeting.¬†""Emails that are simple correspondence, these are the types of tasks I can easily see the machine doing very well. The less creative you need to be, the more it should be replaced,"" Netzer said. ""Why not have them help us send emails to set up meetings when there is hardly any creativity involved?""¬†Of course, this variety of automation already exists in rudimentary form ‚Äî for instance, Google email and chat suggests responses in text conversations. ""Massive consequences""Renowned economist and MIT fellow Paul Kedrosky thinks ChatGPT will have a profound impact on a whole range of industries and roles.¬†It has ""massive consequences for a host of different activities... pretty much any domain where there is a grammar, an organized way of expressing yourself,"" he said on a recent¬†podcast. ""That could be software engineering, that could be high school essays, that could be legal documents, where all of them are easily eaten by this voracious beast and spit back out again."" Software giants are taking note. Microsoft announced Monday is making a ""multiyear, multibillion dollar investment"" in the artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and other tools that can write readable text and generate new images.

What ChatGPT cannot yet do ‚Äî and might never be able to do, many experts think ‚Äî are tasks that require the many gradations of human judgment applied to a range of problems and other cognitive challenges. Take, for example, a chart or table showing an underperforming company's metrics. ChatGPT could summarize the data and tell a user what the chart shows. What it can't do ‚Äî yet ‚Äî is explain why the data is meaningful.¬†


""When I ask ChatGPT what it thinks is going on with this company, it does what junior executives would do, which is they tell me what they see in a table. They say this parameter went down and this one went up in a very clear, coherent manner. But it doesn't move beyond that into the 'so what?'"" Columbia's Netzer said. ""These are the types of tasks that require judgment and that humans are still very valuable in.""

""From what we've seen, it was one of those moments that happens very rarely in technology and innovation, where you experience it and you say, 'the world will never be the same as it was before.'""Enter a prompt, like ""What jobs will ChatGPT take?"" and ChatGPT spits out the following answer:¬†ChatGPT is a language model that can be used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as text generation, language translation, summarization, and more. It can be used in industries such as customer service, marketing, and content creation. However, it is important to note that ChatGPT is a tool and it will not take any jobs, it will assist to improve existing jobs and automate certain tasks.Chatbots have already taken over online customer service roles, and next month, for the first time, an AI-powered ""robot"" lawyer will represent a defendant in court. ChatGPT threatens to replace humans when it comes to tasks that are simple to execute, like following a script or whipping up a standard legal document ‚Äî think an apartment lease, someone's will or a nondisclosure agreement, according to experts.Nearly 30% of professionals in the U.S. say they have already used  ChatGPT or other AI tools for a work-related task, according to a  recent¬†survey¬†of  4,500 employees by Fishbowl, a social network owned by career services  firm Glassdoor. Workers in marketing and advertising had the highest  rate of adoption, with 37% saying they had used AI, while 35% and 30% of  those in technology and consulting, respectively, also report having  utilized AI.Netzer said that while ChatGPT will usher in radical change, in most cases, it won't replace workers, but rather supercharge their ability to do their jobs efficiently. ""It's primarily an enhancer rather than full replacement of jobs,"" he said. Supercharged workFor example, ChatGPT is adept at helping programmers autocomplete and identify errors in their computer code.""To the extent that we would need fewer programmers, maybe it will take away jobs. But it would help those who program find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said.The same goes for many jobs that require basic writing skills, he said. ""In terms of jobs that require writing, I think of it as a starting point as opposed to fully replacing us. I think it's a great tool to enter a prompt, see what it writes, then add a human touch,"" he added.For example, ChatGPT could readily be used to generate an email to set up a meeting.¬†""Emails that are simple correspondence, these are the types of tasks I can easily see the machine doing very well. The less creative you need to be, the more it should be replaced,"" Netzer said. ""Why not have them help us send emails to set up meetings when there is hardly any creativity involved?""¬†Of course, this variety of automation already exists in rudimentary form ‚Äî for instance, Google email and chat suggests responses in text conversations. ""Massive consequences""Renowned economist and MIT fellow Paul Kedrosky thinks ChatGPT will have a profound impact on a whole range of industries and roles.¬†It has ""massive consequences for a host of different activities... pretty much any domain where there is a grammar, an organized way of expressing yourself,"" he said on a recent¬†podcast. ""That could be software engineering, that could be high school essays, that could be legal documents, where all of them are easily eaten by this voracious beast and spit back out again."" Software giants are taking note. Microsoft announced Monday is making a ""multiyear, multibillion dollar investment"" in the artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and other tools that can write readable text and generate new images.What ChatGPT cannot yet do ‚Äî and might never be able to do, many experts think ‚Äî are tasks that require the many gradations of human judgment applied to a range of problems and other cognitive challenges. Take, for example, a chart or table showing an underperforming company's metrics. ChatGPT could summarize the data and tell a user what the chart shows. What it can't do ‚Äî yet ‚Äî is explain why the data is meaningful.¬†""When I ask ChatGPT what it thinks is going on with this company, it does what junior executives would do, which is they tell me what they see in a table. They say this parameter went down and this one went up in a very clear, coherent manner. But it doesn't move beyond that into the 'so what?'"" Columbia's Netzer said. ""These are the types of tasks that require judgment and that humans are still very valuable in.""",,,Is AI bot ChatGPT coming for your job?,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-chatbot-artificial-intelligence-job-replacement/'}",,https://www.cbsnews.com/,,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/chatgpt-grading-artificial-intelligences-writing/'}, 'name': ""ChatGPT: Grading artificial intelligence's writing"", 'description': ""OpenAI's artificial intelligence writing program ChatGPT will, with a few prompts, compose poetry, prose, song lyrics, essays, even news articles.

It¬†generates text responses to text¬†prompts,¬†like a very advanced chatbot.¬†Other generative AI tools make other kinds of content, like audio, images¬†and video. Many have launched in just the past six months.Queensland joins NSW in banning ChatGPT in public schoolsIt's been described as akin to students outsourcing their homework to robots.Read moreFor schools, universities and other educational institutions, the recent emergence of these programs¬†poses¬†the risk that students will ask a machine to write their essays or complete their assignment questions, rather than doing the work themselves.Some have decided to ban ChatGPT. But¬†experts¬†say this is the wrong approach, and¬†students need to learn how to effectively use these tools¬†in order to be employable graduates.In the midst of this debate,¬†Australian workplaces have been quietly experimenting with generative AI.Many who spoke with the ABC say that within a few years ‚Äî¬†by the time today's students graduate ‚Äî¬†these new tools will be¬†essential parts of the white-collar workplace, as much a feature of the office¬†as dusty keyboards, water coolers¬†and small potted cacti.Here's how they're using them.The architecture practiceArchitects at¬†the large Melbourne design practice Gray Puksand use¬†an AI tool named Midjourney,¬†which creates complex images from textual descriptions, using similar technology to ChatGPT.Images like this one: Architects are using images like this to spark their imaginations.(Supplied: Midjourney/Gray Puksand)Midjourney produced this from the text prompt:¬†""low rise parametric building biophilic reference sheet 3d plans sections elevations construction details annotations callouts axis dimensions visual coding"".Jeames Hanley,¬†the practice's digital technology manager, said dozens of architects were using the tool¬†to¬†quickly realise and explore visual ideas.""We have a paid subscription to Midjourney ‚Äî¬†we have 40 staff using it in a shared thread,"" he said.""We are seeing the¬†architects' imaginations being¬†expanded as they can so much more easily visualise the design they are thinking of.""Asked to create a plan¬†for a 100-person office space with desks, focus rooms, meetings rooms and board rooms, plus plants and lots of light, Midjourney¬†produced these¬†variations: They're nowhere close to the finished architectural plan, but these images¬†help with the process of design.(Supplied: Midjourney/Gray Puksand)Although Midjourney is older than ChatGPT, it's still relatively new. A San Francisco start-up of the same name launched it in mid-2022, and has been beta-testing and updating it since.""I don't think it's¬†going to replace anyone, but in terms of efficiency it's¬†going to change our industry,""¬†Mr Hanley said.""Some of our staff will be freed up to work more on the work that excites them,¬†which is the design.""The law firmLast week, Sunshine Coast litigator¬†Kyle Kimball¬†turned to an AI program¬†for help.""People¬†ring up and say, 'this has happened.

Ôªø
In an industry as face-to-face as real estate, an agent‚Äôs use of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate their work might seem like science fiction. But with recent breakthroughs in machine learning, that fiction has quickly become reality for tech-savvy agents.
ChatGPT is a chatbot which uses machine learning algorithms ‚Äî programming ‚Äî to understand written language and then generate responses based on user inputs ‚Äî your chat entries. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022 and is free to use during a research preview period.
The language processing model has galvanized technophiles across industries, including real estate.
Specifically, real estate agents use ChatGPT to craft compelling listing descriptions and content to automate their marketing efforts, such as social media posts, blogs and emails. This tool streamlines agents‚Äô more tedious copywriting and content creation tasks.
Read ahead for tips on how to use this revolutionary productivity tool.
Use ChatGPT to help market listings
While property photos do much of the heavy lifting in selling real estate, a well-written listing description also has the power to make or break a prospective buyer‚Äôs perception of the property ‚Äî and the agent.
An agent knows how to highlight a property‚Äôs standout features and ultimately sell. But to captivate the reader and make the listing feel like home requires fine wordsmithery. At minimum, listing descriptions sell best when they are short, free of errors and contain clear language with plain meaning.
It might take an agent 30 minutes to write and edit a listing description that effectively displays the property‚Äôs amenities and features. ChatGPT does it on command in seconds.
Example: listing descriptions
To produce a listing description, the agent needs to provide ChatGPT some written instruction and context. For example, when a user prompts the following:
A listing description for a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom 1500 square foot home in Sacramento, California with a 2 car garage and granite countertops. 
ChatGPT responds:
This 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home in Sacramento, California boasts a spacious and well-appointed open concept living and dining area with large windows and natural light. The kitchen is a chef‚Äôs dream with granite countertops, ample storage and modern appliances. The bedrooms are located on the opposite side of the home, with ample closet space and natural light. The master bedroom features an en-suite bathroom with dual sinks and granite countertops. Additionally, this property features a 2-car garage. This home offers the perfect combination of style, comfort, and functionality. Don‚Äôt miss out on the chance to make it yours!
As you may have noticed, the AI added extra features not named in the initial request. Agents always need to examine the response for accuracy ‚Äî OpenAI warns the large language model is still under development and may generate incorrect information.
Additionally, all AI models are liable to inherit the biases of their creators and the data on which they are trained. Whether an honest mistake by an agent or a chatbot, discrimination in real estate advertising carries steep penalties. Agents need to review responses for outdated language like ‚Äúmaster bedroom‚Äù ¬†in the example above.
Fine-tuning the chatbot with more specific detail about the property‚Äôs features produces the best listing descriptions. For instance, when prompted with additional home features:
A listing description for a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom newly remodeled home with vaulted ceilings, a large backyard, and new windows in San Diego, California.
ChatGPT delivers a more detailed listing description:
This newly remodeled 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom home in San Diego, California boasts a bright and open floor plan with vaulted ceilings throughout. The home has been fully updated with new windows that allows plenty of natural light to flood the interior spaces. The kitchen has been completely remodeled with new appliances, cabinetry and countertops, perfect for any home chef. Each of the 4 bedrooms offer ample space and comfort, providing the perfect oasis for rest and relaxation. 
The property has a large backyard, perfect for entertaining, relaxing or enjoying the beautiful San Diego weather. A great space for hosting BBQs and gatherings with friends and family. 
The home‚Äôs central location provides easy access to all San Diego has to offer, from world-renowned beaches to delicious dining and nightlife options. Whether you‚Äôre looking for an investment property or a place to call home, this newly remodeled home is a must-see!
At its best, the chatbot gives an agent compelling copy to flaunt those new windows, vaulted ceilings and expansive backyard. The property, by the chatbot‚Äôs clever sleight of language, is imbued with personality.

Social media
Real estate agents are also incorporating AI writing algorithms such as ChatGPT to curate their online presence.
An agent‚Äôs digital marketing strategy might include content for:

social media platforms;
blogs;
email; and
their real estate agent website.

Social media is the premiere ecosystem agents use to stay visible and strengthen their personal brand with clients. Real estate agents know the importance of soliciting new clients and keeping tabs on past clients.
Popular social media sites for agents include:

Facebook;
Instagram;
TikTok;
LinkedIn;
Pinterest; and
YouTube.

Some sites are more text-based (Facebook and LinkedIn), image-based (Instagram and Pinterest) and others are video-based (TikTok and YouTube).
An agent uses ChatGPT to create social media content by prompting the chatbot to:

generate ideas for promotional content related to your brand;
write content tailored to target formats and audiences; and
refine and expand that content with additional prompts.

Example: social media
An agent might write the chatbot the following command:
Ideas for social media posts for agents.
ChatGPT‚Äôs response:

Share testimonials and success stories from satisfied clients
Offer helpful tips and advice for buying or selling a home
Share photos and virtual tours of your current listings
Share local market updates and statistics
Promote open houses and upcoming events
Share helpful resources such as home buying/selling guides
Share your own personal story and why you became a real estate agent
Showcase your community involvement and local partnerships
Share industry news and updates
Showcase your team and highlight their accomplishments

When the agent decides to use one of these ideas, they can prompt ChatGPT for more detailed information, such as:
Write a social media post from an agent offering helpful tips and advice for buying a home. 
ChatGPT‚Äôs response:
Attention first-time home buyers! The home buying process can be overwhelming, but with the right knowledge and preparation, it can also be an exciting and rewarding experience. Here are a few tips to help make your home buying journey a success:

Get pre-approved for a mortgage before you start searching for a home. This will give you a better idea of your price range and help you make an offer more quickly when you find the right home.
Make a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves for your new home. Prioritize your needs and wants so you can focus your search on homes that meet your criteria. 
Hire a professional real estate agent who has experience in the area you are looking to buy. They can provide you with local market knowledge and help you navigate the buying process.
Be prepared to move quickly when you find the right home. In a competitive market, you need to be ready to make an offer as soon as you find the perfect property.
Don‚Äôt forget the home inspection! It‚Äôs important to have a professional inspect the home before you close to make sure you know what you are buying.

Buying a home can be stressful but with the right mindset and with the right professional help, you will find your dream home. Let‚Äôs work together to make your dream home a reality. #HomeBuyingTips #FirstTimeHomeBuyer #RealEstateAdvice 
Refining that post is as easy as including a specific neighborhood, target demographic, and ‚Äî of course ‚Äî your personal contact information and branding. This step will be different for every agent ‚Äî even between a single agent‚Äôs marketing campaigns.

Blogs
Blogs demonstrate an agent‚Äôs expertise in a particular area of real estate.
An agent may post their blog to their agent website, another hosting platform or both. Blogs are similar to social media marketing since many platforms are free and yield valuable exposure to the agent from both past and new clients.
An agent can control the tone of a ChatGPT-created blog by splitting the task up into smaller parts and editing for language between each. For instance, an agent might refine their strategy by asking the chatbot to:

come up with ideas for new blogs and manually select your most valuable topics;
draft an outline for a blog which targets a specific demographic or area; and
write full-length informative blogs, supplemented with your personal experience.

This is particularly effective for agents providing niche services, since less content (and competition) exists in smaller markets. Agents can still query the chatbot in this way to provide ideas on blog topics for that specialty. For example, an agent might prompt:
Come up with some blog ideas for a real estate agent in Los Angeles who specializes in commercial property for investors.
ChatGPT‚Äôs response:

‚ÄúThe Top Commercial Real Estate Markets in Los Angeles for Investors‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy Los Angeles is a Smart Choice for Commercial Real Estate Investment‚Äù

Email
Unlike blogs and social media, email marketing is a more direct and reliable way of maintaining relationships with past and prospective clients.
Time-tested content creation ideas for your real estate marketing emails include:

advertising listings of properties;
solicitations to new potential clients;
upcoming events and open houses;
real estate news and market trends;
home maintenance and finance tips;
emails related to a client‚Äôs transactions, such as reminders and follow-ups; and
seasonal and holiday messages.

Just as with social media outlets, ChatGPT helps you generate email marketing ideas or helps you write the content with prompts. When prompted with:
Write an email marketing campaign from a Fresno real estate agent. Make the email message related to Memorial Day.
ChatGPT responds:
Dear [Name],
As Memorial Day approaches, we are reminded of the sacrifices made by our military heroes and their families. As a real estate agent in Fresno, I am honored to help those who have served our country find their dream homes.
This Memorial Day, I want to extend a special offer to all active and retired military personnel. If you are in the market to buy or sell a home, please contact me and I will work hard to ensure you receive the best deal possible.

Agent website
Ultimately, your professional website is the only platform you control 100%. With social media mostly free, real estate professionals of all specialties often overlook this facet of their digital footprint.
Consider these examples of effective content for your agent website:

your biography;
reviews from past clients;
press releases on successful sales or other professional achievements;
videos displaying your brand and services;
property listings; and
neighborhood information.

Like blog posts, press releases show off your expertise and experience in your service area. Try this ChatGPT prompt for a press release covering a home sale in San Francisco, California:
Write me, a real estate agent, a press release for a $1.4 million home I sold in San Francisco. 
ChatGPT‚Äôs response:

Lead generation
ChatGPT is no stranger to the elevator pitch. Agents can leverage ChatGPT to woo new clients by prompting it to craft a killer introduction.
For example, an agent gives the following directions:
Act like a real estate salesperson. Write a sales pitch for a seller and let them know you can do a complete comparative market analysis to find the best price for their property.
And ChatGPT responds:
Hello, are you thinking of selling your property? I am a professional real estate salesperson and I can help you get the best price for your home. One of the first steps in the process is to do a complete comparative market analysis. This will give us a clear understanding of the current market conditions and help us to determine the best price for your property.
I have access to the latest data and trends in the market, and I will use this information to create a customized marketing plan that will target the right buyers for your home. I also have a network of contacts and resources that will help to ensure that your property is seen by as many potential buyers as possible. 
I will work closely with you throughout the entire process to ensure that you get the best price for your home and that the transaction goes smoothly. My goal is to make this process as stress-free as possible for you, so you can focus on your next move.
If you‚Äôre interested, I would love to schedule a meeting with you to discuss how I can help you get the best price for your property. Thank you for your time.
Recruiting agents
As the public‚Äôs interest in real estate wanes during periods of high prices and tight credit, brokers can use ChatGPT to help recruit agents and automate the tedious writing required of the hiring process.
A broker writes these directions:

The candidate should have these qualities: a positive, energetic attitude, self-motivated, disciplined, consistent, knowledgeable of sales, willingness to learn, and adaptable. Write a job ad that will attract this type of hire and that highlights my diligence to train the right candidate.

Drawbacks and limitations
Despite its potential, natural language processing models aren‚Äôt foolproof. A few notable drawbacks and limitations to ChatGPT include:

the quality of its answers (output) depends on the detail you include in the directions you enter (input);
authoritative-sounding responses may contain incorrect information or unlawful advice;
limited knowledge of events or trends after 2021;
a tendency to overuse specific words and phrases; and
not requesting clarification when it doesn‚Äôt understand user prompts, leading to wild guesses and inaccuracies.

Due to the chatbot‚Äôs inclination to give false (but accurate sounding) information, agents need to verify the response and edit to remove inaccuracies.
AI empowers smaller agents and brokers to do more with less. Agents with the knowledge (but not the capital) to attract clients and close transactions are best positioned to benefit from this revolutionary tech.
