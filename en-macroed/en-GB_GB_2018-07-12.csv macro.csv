In honor of Amazon Prime Day, let’s take a look at the inner workings of this company that is pushing the bounds of innovation, not only with Amazon Prime, but the many other cutting-edge management strategies.

The company that sets the tone for so many aspects of customer experience is breaking down internal barriers and showing how other companies can do the same. Amazon, a leader in customer experience innovation, has taken things to the next level by reorganizing the company around its AI and machine learning efforts.

 
Amazon Uses An AI Management Strategy Called The Flywheel
PROMOTED
Amazon’s approach to AI is called a flywheel. In engineering terms, a flywheel is a deceptively simple tool designed to efficiently store rotational energy. It works by storing energy when a machine isn’t working at a constant level. Instead of wasting energy turning on and off, the flywheel keeps the energy constant and spreads it to other areas of the machine.

At Amazon, the flywheel approach keeps AI innovation humming along and encourages energy and knowledge to spread to other areas of the company. Amazon’s flywheel approach means that innovation around machine learning in one area of the company fuels the efforts of other teams. Those teams use the technology to drive their products, which impacts innovation throughout the entire organization. Essentially, what is created in one part of Amazon acts as a catalyst for AI and machine learning growth in other areas. Amazon is no stranger to AI. The company was one of the first to use the technology to drive its product recommendations. But as AI and machine learning grow, the flywheel approach has become a keystone to Amazon’s expanding business – a central stone at the summit of the company, connecting the organization together. This is particularly unique at a time when many companies silo their AI efforts and don’t integrate them into the overall company.
AI Is Not Located In One Particular Office At Amazon – It’s Everywhere
AI isn’t located in a single office at Amazon, and information is spread throughout departments. Machine learning technology is used by the product recommendation team to improve its product forecasts, and those insights are shared throughout the company. AI and machine learning powers three popular Amazon products: Alexa, the Amazon Go Store, and the Amazon recommendation engine.

The Amazon Echo, which features AI bot Alexa, has been one of the company’s most popular forays into machine learning. Amazon faced an uphill battle at the beginning, especially as it was one of the first companies to try its hand at creating a voice-powered virtual assistant that could fit on a countertop. Once the technology started to come together, divisions across the company realized that Alexa could be beneficial for their products. Some of the first skills for Alexa were integrations with Amazon Music, Prime Video, and personalized product recommendations from an Amazon account. Many companies now have Alexa skills that add value to the customer’s life such as Liberty Mutual and Capital one. Liberty Mutual provides auto insurance information and Capital One allows customers to make a payment through their Amazon device.
The cashier-less Amazon Go store also took advantage of the wealth of data to track customer shopping trends. Data from customers’ smartphone cameras tracks shopping activities and not only helps Amazon Go, but can also be shared with the machine learning team for continued development.
AI also plays a huge role in Amazon’s recommendation engine, which generates 35% of the company’s revenue. Using data from individual customer preferences and purchases, browsing history and items that are related and regularly bought together, Amazon can create a personalized list of products that customers actually want to buy.

 
Creating A Cohesive Customer Experience With Artificial Intelligence
Data from these three main pillars of the company work together to create a cohesive customer experience. A customer can visit the Amazon Go store to get a few items for dinner, ask Alexa to look up a recipe and the product recommendation engine can determine that the customer likely needs to purchase a certain type of sauce pan. Instead of fighting against each other, different divisions share their innovative knowledge to provide a customized and cohesive customer experience.
Amazon has come a long way since its early beginnings in AI and machine learning. The company now sells its machine-learning approach through Amazon Web Services to clients including NASA and the NFL. By taking advantage of AI advancements and applications in other areas of the company, it offers personalized AI solutions to large and small businesses.
In a world where so many companies are hung up with bureaucracy and silos, it is refreshing to see Amazon break down the walls to encourage innovation and growth throughout its entire organization. If other companies want to succeed and stay on the cutting edge of new technology, they might also want to consider a new organizational approach like the flywheel.

But it warned there would be ""winners and losers"" by industry sector, with many jobs likely to change. Opinion is split over AI's potential impact, with some warning it could leave many out of work in future.The pessimists argue AI is different to previous forms of technological change, because robots and algorithms will be able to do intellectual as well as routine physical tasks.Northern jobs 'most at risk from robots'Automation 'puts half of NI jobs at risk'However, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Major new technologies, from steam engines to computers, displace some existing jobs but also generate large productivity gains. ""This reduces prices and increases real income and spending levels, which in turn creates demand for additional workers. ""Our analysis suggests the same will be true of AI, robots and related technologies, but the distribution of jobs across sectors will shift considerably in the process.""PwC said about seven million existing jobs could be displaced by AI from 2017-2037, but about 7.2 million could be created, giving the UK a small net jobs boost of around 200,000.Some sectors would benefit disproportionately, however, with jobs in health increasing by 22%, scientific and technical services by 16% and education by 6%.By contrast manufacturing jobs could fall by 25%, transport and storage by 22% and public administration by 18%, PwC said. Digital skills""As our analysis shows, there will be winners and losers,"" said Euan Cameron, PwC's AI lead in the UK. ""It's likely that the fourth industrial revolution will favour those with strong digital skills, as well as capabilities like creativity and teamwork which machines find it harder to replicate.""A growing body of research claims the impact of AI automation will be less damaging than previously thought. In April, the OECD criticised an influential 2013 forecast by Oxford University that found about 47% of jobs in the US in 2010 and 35% in the UK were at ""high risk"" of being automated over the following 20 years.The OECD instead put the US figure at about 10% and the UK's at 12% - although it did suggest many more workers would see their tasks changing significantly.AI 'poses less risk to jobs than feared'Northern jobs 'most at risk from robots'Automation 'puts half of NI jobs at risk'",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E176/production/_99381775_robot-ma.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44849492,,,,,,,,

The victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential campaign and the successful “Leave” campaign in the UK Brexit referendum led the Oxford English Dictionary to select “post-truth” as word of the year for 2016. Since then, anti-elite populism across the North Atlantic has continued to gain victories, chief among them the 2018 victory of the Five Star Movement in Italy. As governments, foundations, academics, political activists, journalists, and civil society in democratic societies struggled to understand the overwhelming political results alongside the apparent information disorder, most observers’ eyes fell on technology. Social media, bots, hyper-targeted behavioral marketing — all have been seen as culprits or at least catalysts in public conversations. Technology has altered the foundations of news and media, and as trust in media continues to decline, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and algorithms have come to play a critical role not only as threats to the integrity and quality of media, but also as a source of potential solutions.The core threats to information quality associated with AI include:Algorithmic curation. Most commonly known as the “filter bubble” concern, algorithms designed by platforms to keep users engaged produce ever-more refined rabbit holes down which users can go in a dynamic of reinforcement learning that leads them to ever-more extreme versions of their beliefs and opinions.Bots. Improvements in automation allow bots to become ever-more-effective simulations of human participants, thereby permitting propagandists to mount large-scale influence campaigns on social media by simulating larger and harder-to-detect armies of automated accounts.Fake reports and videos. Improving automated news reporting and manipulation of video and audio may enable the creation of seemingly authentic videos of political actors that will irrevocably harm their reputations and become high-powered vectors for false reporting.Targeted behavioral marketing powered by algorithms and machine-learning. Here, the concern is that the vast amounts of individually-identifiable data about users will allow ever-improving algorithms to refine the stream of content that individuals receive so as to manipulate their political opinions and behaviors.Our approach to this set of issues is through the analysis of very large datasets, covering millions of stories, tweets, and Facebook shares, across diverse platforms reflecting national presidential politics in America from April 2015 to the present. The results of our work suggest that emphasizing the particular and technological, rather than the interaction of technology, institutions, and culture in a particular historical context, may lead to systematic overstating of the importance of technology, both positive and negative. Many studies do not attempt to address the impact of AI and other technologically-mediated phenomena that they identify and measure, but rather are focused on identifying and describing observable practices. In our own work, we have repeatedly found bots, Russian influence campaigns, and “fake news” of the nihilistic political clickbait variety; in all these contexts, we have found these technologically-mediated phenomena to be background noise, rather than a major driver of the observed patterns of political communication. Excessive attention to these technology-centric phenomena risks masking the real political-cultural dynamics that have confounded American political communication.Studying media ecosystemsWe study propaganda and disinformation in political communication through the lens of media ecosystems. The springboard for our research is a tool built in a decade-long collaboration between our Berkman Klein Center team and our colleagues at MIT Media Lab’s Center for Civic Media: Media Cloud. Media Cloud enables us to discover media network structures that form around specific topics and to shed light on media frames, attention, and influence. Our early work centered on discrete legislative and regulatory controversies, such as net neutrality and the SOPA-PIPA bills. As election year approached in 2016 we turned our attention to the presidential race.Initially, we analyzed the 18 months leading up to the November 8 vote. The Columbia Journalism Review published our preliminary findings in February 2017, and we followed with a more complete analysis of pre-election media in August of last year. Since then we have expanded our research to include analysis of the election’s aftermath, and have combined the election-period study with a review of the first year of the Trump presidency into a book coming out with Oxford University Press in September 2018, entitled Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics. With the support of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, we focused attention on the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on political public media. This work is motivated by the need to better understand the character, scope, and origins of the issue as an essential element in crafting corrective measures. Here we summarize our preliminary conclusions as well as the work of a growing number of researchers investing in this space.Disinformation problems are fundamentally political and social — not technologicalOur research leads us to conclude that political and social factors, not technology, are at the root of current media and information quality problems in American political communication. We analyze the linking, tweeting, Facebook sharing, and text of four million stories related to presidential politics published over a period of nearly three years before and after the 2016 presidential election. Relying on this data, we mapped out media source networks in open web media (online news, blogs, etc.) and on Twitter to learn how media sources clumped together based on similar cross-media linking and sharing patterns. This revealed a startling finding: media sources are, as many have observed, deeply polarized; but they are aligned in a distinctly asymmetric pattern. There is, as it turns out, not a simple left-right division in American political media. Instead, the divide is between the right and the rest of the political media spectrum. Media sources ranging from those with editorial voices that lean towards the center-right, such as the Wall Street Journal, all the way to distinctly left voices such as Mother Jones or the Daily Kos, comprise a single interconnected media ecosystem. In this portion of the media spectrum, attention is normally distributed around a peak focus on mainstream professional journalism outlets and journalistic values and mainstream professional journalism continue to exercise significant constraint on the survivability and spread of falsehoods. By contrast, there is a large gap between media sources in this broad center to center-left to left cluster and media sources on the right. Moreover, attention on the right increases as one moves further from the center, and peaks around media sites that are exclusively right-wing.Network map based on Twitter media sharing from January 22, 2017, to January 21, 2018. Nodes are sized by number of Twitter shares.When we took a closer look at the substance and practices of journalism from the center of the spectrum to its poles, we found major differences in behavior. Media sources on the left and right extremes of the spectrum are prone to sacrificing accuracy in favor of partisan messaging, making them also prone to the spread of disinformation. However, the accountability and fact-checking mechanisms in the media structures on the center and center-left provide a barrier against further propagation and a check on shoddy reporting from the left. Media outlets that strive for objectivity and balance are less susceptible to spreading disinformation.The leading media in the right-wing cluster follow a distinctly different strategy, and repeatedly amplify and accredit, rather than dampen or correct, bias-confirming falsehoods and misleading framings of facts. We find that insular conservative media lack the will or capacity to adhere to objectivity and accuracy in their reporting. Infowars, Gateway Pundit, and conservative political clickbait are a problem, but a bigger problem is when Drudge Report, Breitbart, and Fox News — conservative media sources with much larger audiences — amplify conspiratorial and deceptive stories. This creates a significant gap in information quality for readers of conservative-leaning sources of news relative to those who consume media sources outside the right-wing ecosystem, including left-wing sites.Algorithmic curation and filter bubblesIt is important to understand that if filter bubbles or algorithmic curation were the primary reason for polarization, we would expect to see symmetric patterns of attention clustering by populations of audiences and publisher — all of whom are at the same technological frontier. The stark asymmetry between the right and the rest strongly suggests that differences in political culture and, we argue in our book, institutionally-driven media history of right-wing media, particularly talk radio and Fox News, drove the right into a media dynamic we call the propaganda feedback loop. This occurred before major Internet sites developed; Internet sites adapted to that already-operative media dynamic, rather than causing it.Indeed, when we compare the pre-election coverage and the post-election coverage, attention on the left has shifted more to the center, while attention on the right has remained as right-oriented. Fox News has become more prominent online relative to Breitbart, but at the price of becoming more purely focused on right-oriented content than it was during the election. Fox online has lost hyperlinks from the center-right and center even more than from the center-left and left, and gained links from the right. This pattern is not the simple product of algorithmic filter bubbles. Compared to influence metrics based on social media attention, weblinks are more insulated from platform-imposed algorithms as they reflect the judgment and linking decisions of web authors, rather than attention and sharing patterns of audiences. Nonetheless, the asymmetric polarization appears by this measure too, and it is by this measure that Fox itself has moved to the right since the 2016 election.BotsOver the course of the year we have developed our own versions of several of the most widely-used bot-detection algorithms. We reran all of our analyses after removing accounts that were identified as “bots” by various methods. Although we do in fact identify a good number of accounts that would be considered “bots” by many of these definitions, the overall architecture of communication we observe remains unchanged whether we include these accounts or not. Without stronger evidence that particular major communications dynamics have been swayed by bots, our macro-level observations leave us skeptical as to the importance of bots. Moreover, using micro-scale case studies, we observe bots as background noise rather than as impactful interventions.Functional and structural differencesToday’s media ecosystems are of course inseparable from technology, but if technology was at the core of the disinformation problem, we would expect to see as much disinformation on one side of the spectrum as the other. And yet, that’s not the case. The asymmetry we observe in the structure and practices of media across the U.S. political spectrum is evidence that the dynamics and problems in modern day media cannot be explained by technology alone.Our caution should not be taken as clear evidence that algorithms are unimportant. There is little doubt in our minds that algorithms and machine learning impact media manipulation and disinformation. In large-scale digital media platforms, algorithms serve a curatorial role and act as gatekeepers, and are subject to gaming and manipulation in ways that human editors are not. In our own research, we have seen, for example, that Twitter is littered with disinformation and false accounts, some of which are bots and others sockpuppets. Moreover, we observe that the spread of disinformation is worse on Facebook than on Twitter, and on Twitter than on the open web. Moreover, we observed that, as Facebook was making its algorithm changes over the year, certain of the worst offenders on both the left and the right lost prominence and attention, although new offenders quickly took their place. In our current work we continue to monitor the differences across platforms and to find measures by which to assess the effectiveness of algorithm changes on Facebook or Twitter on the spread of disinformation and misinformation, and, perhaps most importantly, to assess the impact of these changes on the media ecosystem as a whole.Diagnoses, conclusions, and interventions should be based on systemic observations of impact, rather than individual observations of “bad behavior”The media manipulation problem and the public attention afforded it have created an environment of urgency. Insights and research are key to mitigating some of this pressure, but the temptation to leap to assumptions of impact from any observable phenomenon is hard to resist. We are naturally drawn to the novel: trolls, clickbait factories, social media algorithms, targeted advertising, psychographic profiling, and Russian interference captivate the imagination and compel question and inquiry. Identifying instances of such interventions is technically challenging, and when we see hard work bear fruit it is tempting to attribute high importance to these observations. Nonetheless, without a baseline against which to assess the impact of one or several of these phenomena, it is impossible to justify assigning them the importance that they currently receive, or to design interventions that properly address the actually important interventions rather than those that are observable and salient.Putting these novelties into perspective is hampered by our ability to fully and accurately measure media consumption. Audiences reached by misleading and false articles and media sources is measured in the millions. As prolific as this sounds, as described previously this ultimately is a small portion of content and exposure. A second point of uncertainty relates to impact and persuasion — there is scant evidence that false media stories have any impact in changing behavior.A prime example is Russian efforts to influence election-related discourse. Although information around the number of accounts, posts, and impressions seems to be updated regularly, current numbers draw into question the true significance of their reach. In October 2017, Facebook revealed that approximately 80,000 pieces of content published by the now infamous Russian-operated Internet Research Agency were introduced to 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Their subsequent likes and shares increased the reach of the posts to 126 million Facebook users. This is indeed a big scary number. But what we don’t know is how much user attention this content commanded among the many billions of stories and posts that comprised the news feeds of U.S. voters, or if it changed any minds or influenced voter behavior. For example, using one of the tools we developed for this project, we can track the appearance of a given string across Facebook public facing pages, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and the first few posts in 4chan discussions on a timeline down to the minute or second (depending on the platform). Using that utility, we tracked a particular story with strong indications of Russian influence (about John Podesta participating in satanic rituals), and compared all accounts to both the congressionally-released list of Russian Twitter accounts and an additional list of tens of thousands of accounts that are highly likely to be Russian bots or sockpuppets. While we did observe that 5–15% of the accounts were of such provenance at any given minute, the timing and pattern of their participation was unremarkable — a background presence of more-or-less stable existence, rather than a strategic intervention in either timing or in direction, and they therefore did not seem to play an important role in increasing the salience of the story in total or by tweeting it specifically at the major actors who were central in propagating the lie — Wikileaks, Infowars, or, ultimately, Sean Hannity.It is critical not to confound the observation of a novel phenomenon with its actual impact in the world; newness is no proxy for impact. Indeed the discovery of such phenomena is important, but the messaging around the discovery should not be conflated with evidence that the discovered behavior in fact had impact.The rapid advancement of technologies that digitally manipulate sound, images, and videos is a source of growing anxiety. It is too soon to predict whether synthetic media will exacerbate media disorder and epistemic crisis, but if fabricated media are shared, consumed, and interpreted in ways similar to the current versions of deceptive media, it will be spread or contained by the same influential social, political, and media entities. The fantastical nature of the claims that were widely believed by significant numbers of voters — nearly half of Trump voters gave some credence to rumors that someone associated with the Clinton campaign was running a pedophilia ring — suggests that social identity, much more than any technical indicia of truth, are the foundation for beliefs and attitudes about political matters.Our work greatly benefits by consciously focusing on the disinformation forest, rather than on its individual trees. With an eye toward the long-term dynamics between institutions, culture, and technology, we look at algorithms and technology as a relatively new element integrated into the dynamics of broader media systems while keeping grasp of many more traditional vectors and structures. We look across media and across platforms, considering the enduring influence of radio and cable alongside broadcast television and social media platforms. Indeed, a combination of open web media publication and social media network mapping greatly enhances our understanding of the likely impact of bots, sockpuppets, political clickbait, foreign intervention, and microtargeting. Although prolific in absolute terms, the role of these modern vectors of disinformation plays an important but modest role in the overall media ecosystem.It doesn’t look like AI is coming to the rescue anytime soon, if everThere are a number of ways in which AI may help us to address information quality issues, including:Automated detection and flagging of false stories; algorithmic tools to point readers to corrections and fact-checking.Algorithmic tools to detect and defend against coordinated attacks by propagandists.Computational aids to “nudge” of readers and users to expose themselves to media and reporting outside of their echo chambers, thus opening their eyes to a broader range of viewpoints.Despite the strong advances in the field, there is little indication at present that these tools will be able to serve as independent arbiters of truth, salience, or value. Repeatedly in our work, we have seen that stories built around a kernel of true facts, framed and interpreted in materially misleading ways are more important than stories made of clear falsifiable claims. Moreover, the meaning of stories often emerges from the network of stories and frames within which they are located. Stories and their interpretation — and misinterpretation — draw upon and act through existing social and political structures and narratives. As seen in existing applications, AI is effective at channeling and amplifying sentiments and interests of affinity groups, and helping people in ways that they want to be helped, but no present efforts appear to be able to diagnose the level of subtlety involved in the most important present disinformation campaigns we have been studying.Systemic responses are required to address systemic issuesSo what do we do about all of this? There is no silver bullet, but the best thing we can do is to continue to work toward systemic responses to the systemic problems undermining today’s media ecosystem and information quality. We must continue to focus attention on rebuilding and strengthening the political and civic institutions that undergird a well functioning democracy. The insights described here draw primarily on research conducted in the United States, but we need ecosystem-based analyses of media systems in more countries to understand how the vulnerabilities, resilience, and dynamics differ across different political and cultural contexts.Strengthening media accountability mechanisms is vital, and tamping down disinformation and media manipulation is an integral part of the everyday hard work of democracy and governance. But given the perils of placing constraints on political speech, taking a careful and cautious approach to regulation is essential. It is important to be similarly circumspect in what we require of social media companies in addressing disinformation.Last but far from least, there is still much work to be done in understanding the nature, reach, and impact of disinformation, as well as monitoring and evaluating targeted efforts to inoculate readers and inhibit the spread of disinformation. An area of particular concern is the increasing concentration of research capability and political outreach capability in a few private hands. We must continue efforts to bolster public interest research initiatives and develop and implement structures that allow researchers access to key sources of data with mechanisms in place to ensure robust and ethical research standards.The development, application, and capabilities of AI-based systems are evolving rapidly, leaving largely unanswered a broad range of important short- and long-term questions related to the social impact, governance, and ethical implementations of these technologies and practices. Over the past year, the Berkman Klein Center and the MIT Media Lab, as anchor institutions of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, have initiated projects in areas such as social and criminal justice, media and information quality, and global governance and inclusion, in order to provide guidance to decision-makers in the private and public sectors, and to engage in impact-oriented pilot projects to bolster the use of AI for the public good, while also building an institutional knowledge base on the ethics and governance of AI, fostering human capacity, and strengthening interfaces with industry and policy-makers. Over this initial year, we have learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities for impact. This snapshot provides a brief look at some of those lessons and how they inform our work going forward.

				Artificial intelligence-enabled strategic themes and scenarios will be hallmarks of leading education practices.

With the rapid pace of innovation continually disrupting business models, and in many cases entire industries, how will online learning keep up to provide the relevant courseware for today’s and tomorrow’s workforce? This will be essential for economic growth and to support a thriving, college-educated workforce that’s equipped with the very latest knowledge, ideas and technology.
In the future, I believe that institutions at the forefront of online education will be recognized via several capabilities which will have digitally transformed today’s EdTech market. They will include a powerful combination of omni-channel learning pathways, cognitive courseware, virtual counselors and AI-enabled course development and grading.
These innovations, underpinned by artificial intelligence (AI), will help to provide students the ultimate choice in their courseware – including up-to-the-minute courses on high-interest/high-growth subject matter – as well as highly-innovative digital services that support them every step of the way to help maximize their success and personal objectives.











 
 
 
Projecting ahead 5 to 10 years, the following AI-enabled strategic themes and scenarios are some of the aspects I believe will be hallmarks of leading practice:

Omni-choice learning pathways
Firstly, online education will have evolved beyond omni-channel (anytime, anywhere) to omni-choice whereby students will be able to select and configure every pathway in their learning journey to personalize and customize their near-term and long-term learning plan and approach to their unique situation, needs and interests.
As an example, with self-driving cars commonplace – learning will be conducted at home, in class or on the road during lengthy commutes, with students able to pick up and resume their online courses on any device in any location and in any duration and format. AI will help to hyper-personalize this omni-choice functionality so that students can focus more on their actual learning and less on the mechanics of their learning.











 
 
 
Cognitive courseware
Online classes will have evolved from simulations with limited permutations, to more sophisticated interactive, technology-based experiences (e.g. North Star Learning Group’s I-L-X with “hundreds of thousands of paths through the games”) to enable students to learn by doing and from the decisions they’ve made.
Digital strategy advances from other industries such as healthcare, where the traditional delivery model is being disrupted and moving into the home via technologies such as wearables and IoT, will be regularly applied to the education sector to bring the institution into the 21st century. 
As an example, emotionally-intelligent virtual assistants (see “virtual counsellors” below) will monitor student attentiveness and verbally suggest when students should take a break or switch to a different learning modality. They will also help “at risk” students stay on track.











 
 
 
Hybrid classroom/online courses will maximize the best of both worlds and will be customized and personalized down to the individual student while still being consistent and coordinated for multiple students and teachers. In addition, there will be considerable blurring of digital/physical learning options, techniques and possibilities (e.g. 3D printing, digital twins, AR/VR) with students no longer making distinctions between one or the other.
Virtual counsellors
Virtual counsellors, available in a variety of interaction styles including voice, wearable, AR/VR and even humanoid robotics, will help students with guidance and mentorship across every step of their higher education and continuing education journey from institution and course selection, to course engagement and completion, to career planning and even to employment / gig economy suggestions, analysis and match-making.
Rather than replacing human counsellors, they will augment the work of the counsellor so that human counsellors can focus on most meaningful and strategic work activities (much like the present-day, emotionally-intelligent Amelia virtual agent can handle level 1 phone support, but hand over to a human agent for more complex support requirements as and when needed).











 
 
 
AI-enabled course development & grading
With the gig economy (freelancing) having overtaken traditional full-time employment by 2027, the academic market will have industrialized the production of online courseware to quickly develop and deploy online learning courses that meet the fast- and ever-changing needs of freelancers as they compete in the global labor market.
As an example, course developers at leading institutions will utilize AI technologies to help them quickly assemble their courseware and reduce the manual effort required by up to 80 percent. This frees up course developers and administrators to be more strategic and plan their portfolio roadmaps in close collaboration with business and community partners.
Trainable AI (much like “trainable” collaborative industrial robots from Rethink Robotics), will be able to observe a physical class via machine vision and thereafter create a template or blueprint for the online equivalent of the course. This will speed online course creation and the ability for leading institutions to produce up-to-the-minute courseware.











 
 
 
In addition, AI-enabled course grading will be at highly advanced stage in 5 to 10 years where course administrators will be confident of the fairness and accuracy of automated free-text grading algorithms due to advances in machine learning, semantics and natural language processing. If they have questions about a student’s grade, they will be able to speak with the AI system, understand the rationale, and adjust as and where necessary.
Digital ecosystems and purpose-driven objectives
While the future of learning technology will be very different from today’s environment, I believe the brand and reputation of the institution delivering the courseware will be as important, if not more so, than it is today. Students will look for courseware that’s leading-edge in terms of its subject matter, digital delivery and support mechanisms (to give them the best in experience, price, selection and availability), but will also look at the pedigree of the institution, faculty and staff and what they – and their alumni – stand for in their community.
I believe the most successful institutions will be those that develop a robust and respected innovation ecosystem of educational, business and community partners, a world-class faculty and staff, and who achieve market success by offering a vast selection of digitally-sophisticated courseware that keeps pace with a rapidly-changing world.











 
 
 
Leading institutions will embrace both business-driven and purpose-driven objectives and constantly strive to improve the world around them. Digital strategy, innovation, emerging technologies (including 3D printing, AI, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, blockchain and IoT), and collaborative ecosystems may be some of the tools and methods, but ultimately it will be the people involved – working towards a shared vision – who will make the difference.

A schematic of the bionic hand the team have built.
University of Göttingen






The work carried out by the team and published in Science Robotics, shows that with the help of machine learning, fluid motion of prosthetics can be achieved. At the moment, movement of prosthetics is controlled by motors that are stimulated with external signals from surrounding muscles in the amputee. In the new bionic hand, however, the patient’s intentions are interpreted by a human-machine interface which then sends signals to the prosthetic.  Senior author of the paper Professor Dario Farina from Imperial College’s Department of Bioengineering says, ‘When designing bionic limbs,  our main goal is to let patients control them as naturally as though they were their biological limbs . This new technology takes us a step closer to achieving this.’
The bionic hand relies on eight electrodes to pick up weak electrical signals from the stump of the amputee which then sends signals to a miniature computer in the prosthetic. The machine learning algorithm in the computer interprets the signals and provides the set of instructions needed for the bionic hand to move in the way the patient wants. Not only can it move in the way the patient wants, but the speed of the movement can also be controlled which provides a more natural feeling. Farina says, ‘The new bionic hand is not only more natural, but it is also superior in terms of functionality in daily tasks than what’s currently available to patients.’ Check out the short video below of the comparison of conventional bionic hands and a machine learning bionic hand.
PROMOTED





Farina says, ‘Following this clinical study, we hope to have this available on the market for patients within three years.’ Before the bionic hand was tested, there was an initial training phase where the patient could train the machine learning algorithm to interpret their own electronic signals. In future prototypes, the aim is to get rid of this initial training phase. On top of this, the team would like to have the bionic hand receive signals from the patient via wireless technology and have greater control over the individual movement of the fingers. This could be the ‘next generation’ of prosthetics and the future is looking very bright. Watch this space.

Dressing well is an art. But today, Artificial Intelligence can drive what you wear  and how you wear it

",,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/Vp81luEXDz3lWuvvYVYIdO/Can-artificial-intelligence-and-fashion-create-a-smart-stitc.html,,en,"If Sex And The City were made today, we would likely see a few changes in the plot—the cast would be more racially diverse, Carrie would be a high-flying fashion influencer with a blog instead of a column, and the quartet of friends would certainly swap endless tours of Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue for online shopping and fashion apps. This is 2018, and the world is addicted to online shopping, our choice of #ootd is driven by a technological ecosystem where store inventory is displayed on phones and the touch-and-feel experience of old-fashioned shopping is replaced by cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence.Imagine an online web store, or app. Picture this: hundreds of products in various categories—from workwear to lingerie—displayed in photographs, videos and 360-degree models, queries and customization requests processed by chatbots, try-before-you-buy options and new product recommendations based on shopping history. These finer details that make up a satisfying customer journey are made possible by harnessing machine learning.Artificial Intelligence can work both ways—enabling discovery for consumers in a market cluttered with choices and empowering brands and creators to market their products effectively. Delhi-based fashion discovery app Findow addresses both parties in the transaction. Founder Zarine Bajaj describes her platform as “Zomato for fashion”, allowing customers to find fashion brands and stores based on geo-tagged information, trend reports and feedback from other users. Simultaneously, Findow’s smart technology platform is designed to help retailers automate everyday operations, from product inventory and order processing to customer relations. “The app is a great help for new designers, as we enable them to manage their business better,” says Bajaj, adding that her team is also working on virtual store formats to connect brands seamlessly with customers. Earlier this year, Artificial Intelligence start-up Vue.ai, whose clients include Levi’s, Diesel, Cosabella and Tata CLiQ, launched a product to analyse garments and generate human models, negating the need for hours of catalogue photography and digitalization. Much of Artificial Intelligence’s role in fashion retail is aimed at automating the mundane activities that consume hours of human labour, says Atul Rai, founder of Staqu Technologies, a Gurugram-based start-up that has developed image-matching systems, automated meta-tag filters and visual searches for online fashion retail brands. “I believe human beings should not have to spend hours doing repetitive activities,” he says. “For instance, users look for products using certain tags (attributes) and e-commerce sites hire curators to do the work. But the same work can be done through Artificial Intelligence much faster.” AI is also applied to traditionally customer-facing personnel roles. Bengaluru-based tech start-up AskSid works primarily with brands in Europe, creating chatbots and facilitating multi-channel conversations that enable brands to understand consumer requirements based on data. “The bots must be intelligent, building the conversation,” says Sanjoy Roy, co-founder of the start-up. “For that, we must be domain experts who understand fashion ontology.” AskSid draws from a repository of over 40,000 actual consumer conversations to create information and talking points which are fed to the bots. The chatbots are trained to answer questions, but also discover new ones. Roy cites an example from one of their clients, whose customers requested images of the back of a garment. The brand was able to address the concern because it had data extracted from automated conversations between customers and bots.AI’s impact goes beyond the online experience. In February, American fashion brand Tommy Hilfiger partnered with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, to explore the role of AI in trend-forecasting and design. The Reimagine Retail project required students to use IBM Research AI tools and Hilfiger image libraries and create future-smart designs. There’s also Jacquard by Google, a weaving technology that enables communication, navigation and audio features in clothing—its first design is a trucker jacket created by Levi’s with snap buttons on the sleeve that connect the garment with the Jacquard app; however, critics have pointed out that the jacket must offer more functions to justify the price ($350; around  ₹ 24,000) it commands.Internationally, stores like Rebecca Minkoff and Nordstrom have experimented with smart mirrors which customers can use to browse other looks in the store, while adidas employs the Run Genie tool in select stores to recommend shoes based on how much a customer walks. Some stores also employ heat-map analysis from camera networks to assess customer behaviour and drive sales. Artificial Intelligence can certainly ease some of the mundane activities that the retail business entails. But chatbots don’t have every answer, Roy acknowledges. “When human intervention becomes necessary, we connect it to the executive in the most seamless manner possible,” he says. AI application is still in its early stages, especially in India, says Bajaj. “AI is undoubtedly the next big move but one can also sense the fashion industry’s hesitation in adapting it in its entirety, especially among upcoming retail brands and fashion designers. The transition will come once they start introducing themselves to better formats for the development of their brand,” she adds. The potential of AI is on the rise, and the future promises more advance technologies. Amazon is already testing cashier-less stores in the US and Rai says research could make it possible for consumers to upload their image online and try on garments. “We might even have clothes designed by AI in the future,” he adds.
