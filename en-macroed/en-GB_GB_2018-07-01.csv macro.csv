So hard, in fact, that some startups have worked out it’s cheaper and easier to get humans to behave like robots than it is to get machines to behave like humans.“Using a human to do the job lets you skip over a load of technical and business development challenges. It doesn’t scale, obviously, but it allows you to build something and skip the hard part early on,” said Gregory Koberger, CEO of ReadMe, who says he has come across a lot of “pseudo-AIs”.“It’s essentially prototyping the AI with human beings,” he said.This practice was brought to the fore this week in a Wall Street Journal article highlighting the hundreds of third-party app developers that Google allows to access people’s inboxes.In the case of the San Jose-based company Edison Software, artificial intelligence engineers went through the personal email messages of hundreds of users – with their identities redacted – to improve a “smart replies” feature. The company did not mention that humans would view users’ emails in its privacy policy.Being human: how realistic do we want robots to be?Read moreThe third parties highlighted in the WSJ article are far from the first ones to do it. In 2008, Spinvox, a company that converted voicemails into text messages, was accused of using humans in overseas call centres rather than machines to do its work.In 2016, Bloomberg highlighted the plight of the humans spending 12 hours a day pretending to be chatbots for calendar scheduling services such as X.ai and Clara. The job was so mind-numbing that human employees said they were looking forward to being replaced by bots.In 2017, the business expense management app Expensify admitted that it had been using humans to transcribe at least some of the receipts it claimed to process using its “smartscan technology”. Scans of the receipts were being posted to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourced labour tool, where low-paid workers were reading and transcribing them.“I wonder if Expensify SmartScan users know MTurk workers enter their receipts,” said Rochelle LaPlante, a “Turker” and advocate for gig economy workers on Twitter. “I’m looking at someone’s Uber receipt with their full name, pick-up and drop-off addresses.”Even Facebook, which has invested heavily in AI, relied on humans for its virtual assistant for Messenger, M.In some cases, humans are used to train the AI system and improve its accuracy. A company called Scale offers a bank of human workers to provide training data for self-driving cars and other AI-powered systems. “Scalers” will, for example, look at camera or sensor feeds and label cars, pedestrians and cyclists in the frame. With enough of this human calibration, the AI will learn to recognise these objects itself.In other cases, companies fake it until they make it, telling investors and users they have developed a scalable AI technology while secretly relying on human intelligence.How to start an AI startup1. Hire a bunch of minimum wage humans to pretend to be AI pretending to be human2. Wait for AI to be invented— Gregory Koberger (@gkoberger) March 1, 2016
Alison Darcy, a psychologist and founder of Woebot, a mental health support chatbot, describes this as the “Wizard of Oz design technique”.“You simulate what the ultimate experience of something is going to be. And a lot of time when it comes to AI, there is a person behind the curtain rather than an algorithm,” she said, adding that building a good AI system required a “ton of data” and that sometimes designers wanted to know if there was sufficient demand for a service before making the investment.This approach was not appropriate in the case of a psychological support service like Woebot, she said.“As psychologists we are guided by a code of ethics. Not deceiving people is very clearly one of those ethical principles.”Research has shown that people tend to disclose more when they think they are talking to a machine, rather than a person, because of the stigma associated with seeking help for one’s mental health.A team from the University of Southern California tested this with a virtual therapist called Ellie. They found that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were more likely to divulge their symptoms when they knew that Ellie was an AI system versus when they were told there was a human operating the machine.Man 1, machine 1: landmark debate between AI and humans ends in drawRead moreOthers think companies should always be transparent about how their services operate.“I don’t like it,” said LaPlante of companies that pretend to offer AI-powered services but actually employ humans. “It feels dishonest and deceptive to me, neither of which is something I’d want from a business I’m using.“And on the worker side, it feels like we’re being pushed behind a curtain. I don’t like my labour being used by a company that will turn around and lie to their customers about what’s really happening.”This ethical quandary also raises its head with AI systems that pretend to be human. One recent example of this is Google Duplex, a robot assistant that makes eerily lifelike phone calls complete with “ums” and “ers” to book appointments and make reservations.After an initial backlash, Google said its AI would identify itself to the humans it spoke to.“In their demo version, it feels marginally deceptive in a low-impact conversation,” said Darcy. Although booking a table at a restaurant might seem like a low-stakes interaction, the same technology could be much more manipulative in the wrong hands.What would happen if you could make lifelike calls simulating the voice of a celebrity or politician, for example?“There’s already major fear around AI and it’s not really helping the conversation when there’s a lack of transparency,” Darcy said.Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Silicon ValleynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedScientists make DNA discovery that could help find pancreatic cancer cureBlue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi HasanLiveTrump reportedly to reveal vice-presidential pick today; Schumer calls Trump case dismissal ‘breathtakingly misguided’ – liveDid Donald Trump just win the election?Arwa MahdawiFlorida judge dismisses criminal classified documents case against Trump",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since China has 731 million internet users, almost twice the U.S. population, Baidu’s data set is capable of fueling AI algorithms to make them even better. With this focus on artificial intelligence, Baidu is exploring some very intriguing applications for artificial intelligence and machine learning including in their offices where facial recognition technology makes standard ID cards unnecessary and allows you to order tea from a vending machine.

They have also recruited top AI talent including one of the world’s most notable AI pioneers Lu Qi, who was previously a Microsoft executive before he became Baidu’s COO in January 2017. Qi will step down in July 2018 for personal reasons. Although he was only at Baidu for a short time, he helped chart a clear strategy for the company’s AI operations that will continue. Here are a few ways Baidu uses artificial intelligence and machine learning.
DuerOS is Baidu’s voice assistant
Since Baidu can leverage its expansive data set, its voice assistant called DuerOS has accumulated more conversation-based skill sets than Alexa, Siri or Cortana. Partnering with other tech companies is one way Baidu hopes to accelerate innovation. They have teamed up with more than 130 DuerOS partners, and the voice assistant is in more than 100 brands of appliances such as refrigerators, TVs, and speakers. Since homes in India, Japan, Europe, and Brazil are more like homes in China, there may be better opportunities for DuerOS to globalize since Alexa, Cortana and Echo are optimized for American households. At CES 2018, Baidu debuted its DuerOS-powered smart screen called Little Fish VS1. This technology can recognize and respond to individual faces.

Mobile partners to accelerate AI-powered devices

Unlike its competitors, Baidu was steadfast in its commitment to desktops and missed the shift to mobile. To survive, Baidu needed a new strategy and artificial intelligence technology provided just the platform to turn the business around. That’s one of the reasons Baidu has committed so aggressively to AI investment. Today, AI products and services are priorities to make them the core of the company’s future. Now, they are partnering with Huawei to develop an open mobile AI platform to support the development of AI-powered smartphones and Qualcomm to optimize its DuerOS for IoT devices and smartphones using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Mobile Platform.
Self-driving cars
Even though automated driving is currently against the law in China, Baidu is working on autonomous-driving technology. Through the program called Apollo, Baidu’s artificial intelligence technologies are made available to car makers for free as a brain for their cars. In exchange, Baidu gets access to the data to make their algorithms smarter. It is hoped that Apollo will give any car manufacturer a fair shot at creating a viable product, just like Android did for smartphone makers. Even with this accelerated approach, it is expected that fully autonomous cars won’t be in production until 2020-2021.

Deep learning in the medical field
To find tumors and early warning signs for cancer, pathologists look at biopsied tissues magnified to 40X, but they are searching for micrometastases that can be as small as 1000 pixels in diameter. Deep learning-based algorithms can now be used to process the images and locate possible micrometastases. Baidu has developed a deep learning solution to predict if the cells are normal or cancerous. The results of using the algorithms in this way are promising—a lower number of false positives, better tumor localization scores, and improved efficiency. Computer vision that results in better detection of disease (or at least equal to human medical professionals) is a very compelling form of artificial intelligence, and one Baidu is actively working on.
Baidu recently spun-off its financial services arm on the heels of selling off other business units such as its food-delivery service Waimai and IQiyi  Inc., a streaming video service comparable to Netflix. These moves are intended to streamline operations so Baidu can invest aggressively in artificial intelligence initiatives such as autonomous vehicles and voice assistants. By leveraging partnerships, its unique space in Chinese culture that is less averse to AI, the Chinese government’s support as well as an enormous population that creates the data that allows AI insights, Baidu’s bet on AI might just be the ticket to its long-term success.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

The use of artificial intelligence in our everyday lives is on the increase, and it now covers many fields of activity. Something as seemingly banal as avoiding a traffic jam through the use of a smart navigation system, or receiving targeted offers from a trusted retailer is the result of big data analysis that AI systems may use. While these particular examples have obvious benefits, the ethical and legal implications of the data science behind them often go unnoticed by the public at large.
Artificial intelligence, and in particular its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, may only be neutral in appearance, if at all. Underneath the surface, it can become extremely personal. The benefits of grounding decisions on mathematical calculations can be enormous in many sectors of life, but relying too heavily on AI which inherently involves determining patterns beyond these calculations can also turn against users, perpetrate injustices and restrict people’s rights.
The way I see it, AI in fact touches on many aspects of my mandate, as its use can negatively affect a wide range of our human rights. The problem is compounded by the fact that decisions are taken on the basis of these systems, while there is no transparency, accountability or safeguards in how they are designed, how they work and how they may change over time.
Encroaching on the right to privacy and the right to equality 
The tension between advantages of AI technology and risks for our human rights becomes most evident in the field of privacy. Privacy is a fundamental human right, essential in order to live in dignity and security. But in the digital environment, including when we use apps and social media platforms, large amounts of personal data are collected - with or without our knowledge - and can be used to profile us, and produce predictions of our behaviours. We provide data on our health, political ideas and family life without knowing who is going to use this data, for what purposes and how.
Machines function on the basis of what humans tell them. If a system is fed with human biases (conscious or unconscious) the result will inevitably be biased. The lack of diversity and inclusion in the design of AI systems is therefore a key concern: instead of making our decisions more objective, they could reinforce discrimination and prejudices by giving them an appearance of objectivity. There is increasing evidence that women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and LGBTI persons particularly suffer from discrimination by biased algorithms.
Studies have shown, for example, that Google was more likely to display adverts for highly paid jobs to male job seekers than female. Last May, a study by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency also highlighted how AI can amplify discrimination. When data-based decision making reflects societal prejudices, it reproduces – and even reinforces – the biases of that society. This problem has often been raised by academia and NGOs too, who recently adopted the Toronto Declaration, calling for safeguards to prevent machine learning systems from contributing to discriminatory practices.
Decisions made without questioning the results of a flawed algorithm can have serious repercussions for human rights. For example, software used to inform decisions about healthcare and disability benefits has wrongfully excluded people who were entitled to them, with dire consequences for the individuals concerned. In the justice system too, AI can be a driver for improvement or an evil force. From policing to the prediction of crimes and recidivism, criminal justice systems around the world are increasingly looking into the opportunities that AI provides to prevent crime. At the same time, many experts are raising concerns about the objectivity of such models. To address this issue, the European Commission for the efficiency of justice (CEPEJ) of the Council of Europe has put together a team of multidisciplinary experts who will “lead the drafting of guidelines for the ethical use of algorithms within justice systems, including predictive justice”.
Stifling freedom of expression and freedom of assembly
Another right at stake is freedom of expression. A recent Council of Europe publication on Algorithms and Human Rights noted for instance that Facebook and YouTube have adopted a filtering mechanism to detect violent extremist content. However, no information is available about the process or criteria adopted to establish which videos show “clearly illegal content”. Although one cannot but salute the initiative to stop the dissemination of such material, the lack of transparency around the content moderation raises concerns because it may be used to restrict legitimate free speech and to encroach on people’s ability to express themselves. Similar concerns have been raised with regard to automatic filtering of user-generated content, at the point of upload, supposedly infringing intellectual property rights, which came to the forefront with the proposed Directive on Copyright of the EU. In certain circumstances, the use of automated technologies for the dissemination of content can also have a significant impact on the right to freedom of expression and of privacy, when bots, troll armies, targeted spam or ads are used, in addition to algorithms defining the display of content.
The tension between technology and human rights also manifests itself in the field of facial recognition. While this can be a powerful tool for law enforcement officials for finding suspected terrorists, it can also turn into a weapon to control people. Today, it is all too easy for governments to permanently watch you and restrict the rights to privacy, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement and press freedom.
What can governments and the private sector do? 
AI has the potential to help human beings maximise their time, freedom and happiness. At the same time, it can lead us towards a dystopian society. Finding the right balance between technological development and human rights protection is therefore an urgent matter – one on which the future of the society we want to live in depends.
To get it right, we need stronger co-operation between state actors - governments, parliaments, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies - private companies, academia, NGOs, international organisations and also the public at large. The task is daunting, but not impossible.
A number of standards already exist and should serve as a starting point. For example, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights sets clear boundaries for the respect for private life, liberty and security. It also underscores states’ obligations to provide an effective remedy to challenge intrusions into private life and to protect individuals from unlawful surveillance. In addition, the modernised Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data adopted this year addresses the challenges to privacy resulting from the use of new information and communication technologies.
States should also make sure that the private sector, which bears the responsibility for AI design, programing and implementation, upholds human rights standards. The Council of Europe Recommendations on human rights and business and on the roles and responsibilities of internet intermediaries, the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, and the report on content regulation by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, should all feed the efforts to develop AI technology which is able to improve our lives. There needs to be more transparency in the decision-making processes using algorithms, in order to understand the reasoning behind them, to ensure accountability and to be able to challenge these decisions in effective ways.
A third field of action should be to increase people’s “AI literacy”. States should invest more in public awareness and education initiatives to develop the competencies of all citizens, and in particular of the younger generations, to engage positively with AI technologies and better understand their implications for our lives. Finally, national human rights structures should be equipped to deal with new types of discrimination stemming from the use of AI.
It is encouraging to see that the private sector is ready to cooperate with the Council of Europe on these issues. As Commissioner for Human Rights, I intend to focus on AI during my mandate, to bring the core issues to the forefront and help member states to tackle them while respecting human rights. Recently, during my visit to Estonia, I had a promising discussion on issues related to artificial intelligence and human rights with the Prime Minister.
Artificial intelligence can greatly enhance our abilities to live the life we desire. But it can also destroy them. It therefore requires strict regulations to avoid morphing in a modern Frankenstein’s monster.

Consider yourself lucky if you happen to be studying machine learning, data science, business intelligence, or any other field that relates to AI. While automation slowly eats away at human jobs, the demand for AI talent continues to grow at an accelerating pace.
According to employment search platform Indeed, AI-related job postings have doubled in the past three years. 
“When it comes to the future of work, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are poised to impact nearly every facet of the workforce in some way,” says Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, Chief Economist at Glassdoor, another prominent employment directory website. “These technologies are being used for popular services like customer service chatbots at Bank of America, easy-to-search images on Facebook, and even automated fashion suggestions for apparel shoppers on Amazon.”
An increasing number of industries and domains are waiting to be disrupted and enhanced by machine learning and deep learning. Here are a number of exciting venues worth exploring if you’re interested in using your AI chops to develop game-changing technologies.
#1 Self-driving cars — Volkswagen
The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!Your email address*I agree to TNW storing and processing my personal data to receive the requested newsletter(s). For more information check out TNW's Privacy Policy.*In a foreseeable future, AI algorithms will replace human drivers in cars. The technology still has challenges to overcome, and every once in a while we read about crashes and incidents that involve self-driving car test programs. But the industry is poised on ironing the kinks and rolling out self-driving cars to the masses in the next few years. And they’re looking for talented AI experts to help improve their self-driving cars technologies.
The field of autonomous driving has drawn the interest of not only big and emerging tech companies but also traditional car makers. Among them is German automotive giant Volkswagen, which has recently increased its involvement in the AI industry. The company has its own AI labs, where its experts on working on a range of projects, including the enhancement of the way self-driving cars see and react to events that happen around them.
In 2017, Volkswagen partnered with graphics chipmaker Nvidia to expand its AI projects. In early 2018, the carmaker partnered with self-driving car startup Aurora to accelerate the development of its fleet of self-driving cars.

# 2 Banking — JPMorgan Chase
AI algorithms perform best where there’s an abundance of quality data. And there are very few domains that have as much historical and structured data as the financial industry. There are many ways that AI can help make financial institutions become more efficient at providing services to their customers. Some examples include detecting and preventing fraud, algorithmic trading, and providing banking assistance to customers. In addition to many fintech startups that work on specific AI solutions, we’re seeing several large financial institutions and banks gradually transform into tech companies in their own right, acquiring startups and AI talent to develop their own solutions and maintain their competitive edge in a fast-changing market.
An example is JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, and among the leading financial institutions employing technology and AI algorithms in different fields. The firm recently hired Manuela Veloso, the former head of Carnegie Melon University’s Machine Learning Department, as its first head of artificial intelligence research. The company’s tech budget for 2018 topped $10 billion, and AI will be a good part of it. “Looking five to 10 years out, the pace of technological innovation will only quicken as artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, distributed ledgers and big data will all shape our future,” Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto said in a letter to shareholders in April.
JPMorgan has already rolled out several AI-powered services for its clients, including the use of AI algorithms to help investors make better investment and trade decisions.
#3 Healthcare — Philips
From making healthcare services available to more people to diagnosing and treating diseases faster and with more precision, health institutions are leading various projects to employ AI in medicine and healthcare. At Philips, a long-standing tech company and a global leader in health technology, you’ll be able to work on AI solutions that will reshape the entire health care cycle, from assisting health care providers to achieve better outcomes to helping consumers manage their own health and adopt healthier lifestyles. 
Philips’ focus is on combining AI and other technologies to understand and constantly adapt to the changing healthcare needs, a concept it calls “adaptive intelligence.” The company follows the vision that AI doesn’t replace healthcare professionals but augments their abilities and that enables 24/7 healthcare whenever, wherever needed. 
In an interview with the Journal of mHealth, Jeroen Tas, Chief Innovation and Strategy Officer at Philips said, “Supporting clinicians by streaming data, interpreting data, providing effective visualisations, detecting deviations from normal, providing early warnings – these are all areas where we can use AI to focus on supporting the clinicians to make the right decision at the right time.”
Philips is especially well-positioned to achieve this goal because it has a long history of developing hardware and software solutions for consumers, patients, clinicians and health institutions.  The company also has many years of experience in AI research in the field of medicine and healthcare. Philips already has several working AI-powered solutions at different levels, including research, diagnosis and treatment, home care and population health management. 
Some examples include HealthSuite Insights, Philips’ platform for data scientists, which enables them to create and access quality health data sources and create analytical models for different purposes such as diagnosis and treatment. CareSage is another AI-powered solution offering predictive analytics. It helps prevent avoidable hospital admissions and emergency room visits by aggregating different health data sources and performing predictive analytics. 
IntelliSpace Console gathers real-time information from connected health devices in the complex ICU setting and combines them with data obtained from hospital information systems and health records to help clinicians with predictive insights of the patient’s health and support them with timely and effective treatment decisions.

#4 Computer vision — Panasonic
As our robots and AI algorithms become increasingly involved in interactions with the physical world, they need to better understand what’s going on around them. The field of computer vision is a subset of AI that helps computers analyze the content of images and video and distinguish different objects. Computer vision is an important part of AI-powered technologies such as self-driving cars, security cameras, social media, healthcare, banking and more. The cool part of becoming involved in computer vision is that you get to work on a variety of interesting projects in different fields.
One of the companies actively involved in developing computer vision technology is Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic, which collaborates with research centers and universities to develop deep learning technologies. Panasonic is working on several interesting computer vision projects for special purposes, such as better pedestrian detection for autonomous vehicles and automatic inspection of dams through highly detailed image analysis.
#5 Cybersecurity — Palo Alto Networks
As organizations continue to generate more and more data every day, security and IT teams are finding it increasingly difficult to protect networks and prevent data breaches. According to estimates, an average organization has to process over 200,00 security events every day. Hopefully, AI and machine learning can advance security teams by perusing through data at ultrafast speeds and finding alarming patterns that need further investigation by a human analyst.
This is a fast-evolving field and many companies are employing AI to enhance their security systems to be able to respond to the growing needs of the market. Among them is Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise security company based in Silicon Valley, which has been integrating AI into its cyber threat detection and prevention software in the past year. 
Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks introduced Magnifier, a behavioral analytics solution that uses machine learning algorithms to investigate network traffic and discover stealthy activity that might be hiding a data breach. The company is working on many other projects and is on the lookout for AI talent.
#6 Emotion detection — Affectiva
In recent years, thanks to advances in natural language processing (NLP), we’ve all become used to accomplishing tasks through voice and conversational interfaces. Millions of people use Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google and AI-powered assistants to find answers to questions, set up alarms, play music, read emails, do shopping, turn on the lights and air conditioners, or lock and unlock doors.
The next step in AI chatbots and digital assistants is understanding intent and context, which will enable them to engage in more meaningful conversations and perform much more complicated tasks. This is the focus of many large tech companies as well as AI startups, and they’re all looking for the right talent to help them propel their efforts forward. One such company is Affectiva, a Boston-based MIT Media Lab spin-off focused on building AI that can understand and respond to human emotions.
In 2017, Affectiva released an AI platform that could measure emotion through sensing and analyzing facial expressions. The technology is already being used in several verticals and use cases. The company now aims to expand its AI research and development team and extend its emotion-sensing technology beyond the face to leverage human speech.

#7 Training — Deeplearning.ai
If there’s one thing the world needs, it’s more AI experts. In the near future, a lot of jobs will depend on the work and knowledge of people who are versed in the different fields that relate to artificial intelligence. 
There are several organizations that are hiring AI experts for educational programs. Among them is Deeplearning.ai, the organization founded by Andrew Ng who was also the co-founder of Google Brain and the former chief scientist of Baidu. Ng also has a long history of teaching AI and co-founded Coursera, the online training platform that hosts his famous introductory machine learning course.
Deeplearning.ai, Ng’s new venture, will be focused on teaching deep learning, which at the moment is the most popular field of AI. So, if money is not what you’re after and you want to share your knowledge, helping develop courses to train more people in machine learning and deep learning might be one of the most productive ways to put your AI skills to use.

Artificial Intelligence or AI has enabled us to recreate, to an extent, the human thought process to programs that refine their decision making process and evolve with time to make better decisions. As the application of AI expands to a multitude of fields of applications; logistics systems, communication networks, manufacturing systems, security setups, traffic control etc. Its inclusion in every new and novel field of application is greatly contemplated and looked forward to.One such novel field is drone logistics. Drones have been around for a lot of time, but due to the optimization of their control systems in the last decade, their domestic usage has risen up by a very steep curve. The article is focused on discussing the usage of AI on drone systems:            How does it apply to drone systems?            How does it increase a drone network’s efficiency?            How does it expand endeavors possible with drone technology?Intelligently Programmed Drones Systems of drones operate in an organized way, with set time, paths for each drone, timely and trustworthy data transfer within the individual drones etc.Most drones are operated by a pilot or user who controls the drone’s path and direction of the camera mounted on the drone. While it is applicable for photographers or people who use drones for recreational purposes, the commercialization of drone technology and its application in different markets has called for the need of automation for the following reasons:    Repetitive tasks performed by drones    Simplicity of tasks removing the need for a human operator    Accuracy of performance of a programmed/fixed task.Let us understand how autonomous drones work.Having the program stored and communicated by a microcontroller, a single, individual drone is programmed to follow a set path according to a set of pre-programmed principles. This could be for example while detecting obstacles using sensors (ultrasonic, infrared etc.) to avoid obstacles, deliver its package or perform any other task it is being utilized for at the designated location. Whether planted in the drone or decided by the drone using the criteria defined by its programmer, the drone completes its mission and returns to its point of take-off or launch, all the while recording any data necessary.Artificially Intelligent Drone Systems Autonomous drone systems can work without AI, so why do we need it? Well, autonomous systems may not need a pilot to operate the drones all the time, but they do need a programmer. A programmer has to work all the time to make the drone’s operation more and more efficient and effective; artificial intelligence can move this responsibility to the drone itself and make it a lot more efficient as the drone will now observe the course of its operation and make changes in its program to achieve the same task allotted to it without the need for human involvement. Given enough tries or iterations, either in real time operation while performing the task or in virtual reality or simulations, the drone can improve upon its program again and again and move towards the best possible or the optimum solution or method for achieving any given task.Let us take an example of a security drone that is designed to observe different people in a mall and classify them according to gender, age, height etc. The drone will be programmed with face detection and image recognition programs that are used to recognize and observe people with a camera. A person manually processing the images captured by the drone on the other hand, may have to work for countless hours to perfect this program to achieve accurate results. An artificially intelligent drone, however, will do it by itself; it will start observing facial hair and compare other features of specimens/people with facial hair with those without them and improve its classification on the basis of gender. It can ‘look’ at the skin of the people and their height to constantly improve its classification of people based on their age. This is an example of an artificially intelligent drone learning how to survey people.A recent example of researchers using AI and drones to identify human behaviour used a combination of deep learning algorithms trained with 20,000 images and a support vector machine was recently published. The drones were able to successfully identify if two individuals were engaging in violent behaviour based on the angles of their limbs.We can, therefore, identify some novel benefits of using artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies with drone systems:Real time data: The data that would normally take days or weeks to be processed and made available can be filtered and processed by artificial intelligence in real time, continuously being updated and communicated.Automated data capturing: Automated data processing opens up a new world for looking over complex physical structures and analyzing the captured data for defects. This can be applied to cell towers, wind turbines and general infrastructure inspection. Automated drones capture the images or other information required quickly, without having to deploy personnel to the top of the cell tower — today it is a manual process and requires individuals to access cell towers, thus exposing them to risks which potentially may cause fatalities. Automated drones can also scan blades on wind turbines without a human piloting the drone. Furthermore, it can carry trained AI models that can be used to quickly detect defects and provide recommendations on whether maintenance is necessary, without having to rely on archaic methods, such as a telescope.Shortening construction project length: Drones combined with AI trained models for detecting all objects and activities inside a job site will eventually automate the process of understanding and predicting the daily changes on a construction site, and will give customers data to better plan and allocate resources more efficiently including optimizing routes for construction equipment travelling across the site and creating a daily deployment schedule for machinery and people.Improving human operation: AI can measure the current efficiency of a driver or operator, and create a model of the most efficient operator from which newly hired operators can learn. It effectively transfers their experiences, through visual simulations, examples of hand movements, among other ways.Public Safety: Through the use of object recognition and reiterative learning, drones may be used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to recognise and preempt risky, antisocial and violent behaviours.Learning on the JobThere are a myriad of examples of drones using AI to improve efficiency and safety.Skycatch, for example, have been operating AI drones on over 5,000 building sites in Japan, scanning the ground to create maps of the terrain, as well as the location of vehicles and and equipment. The drones are able to complete in 15 minutes what can take a team of humans several days.The fixed wing UX11 drone developed by Delair uses deep learning to carry out in-flight calculations, speeding up the data processing chain when carrying out long-range mapping and surveying tasks. This improves workflow and reduces time spent covering large areas.In Kyoto Japan, researchers used a publicly available deep learning package to process aerial images of photos taken by a UAV to identify tree crowns. With am 87% success rate, they showed that the tedious task of traipsing through forests to count individual trees could be sped up and made safer through use of drones and AI.A Final WordThere are numerous application for drones and AI that will in time make daily tasks safer, more efficient and cheaper to perform. The question of ethics of some of these applications has been the subject of public interest. The recent involvement of Google’s Tensorflow in an AI development project with the US Department of Defense’s Project Maven drew considerable negative media attention as well as outcry from Google staffers. Google has since withdrawn from the project but it cannot be ignored that for as long as drones continue to be used for military purposes, they will draw upon AI to perform those missions with increasing accuracy.

A third camp – probably the largest – are happy to admit that the forces of change which are at work are too complicated to predict and, for the moment, everything is up in the air. Previous large-scale changes to the way we work (past industrial revolutions) may have been disruptive in the short-term. However, in the long term what happened was a transfer of labor from countryside to cities, and no lasting downfall of society.
However, as author Calum Chace points out in his latest book 'Artificial Intelligence and the Two Singularities'  this time there’s one big difference. Previous industrial revolutions involved replacing human mechanical skills with tools and machinery. This time it’s our mental functions which are being replaced – particularly our ability to make predictions and decisions. This is something which has never happened before in human history, and no one exactly knows what to expect.
PROMOTED
When I recently met with Culum Chase in London, he told me “A lot of people think it didn’t happen in the past, so it won’t happen now – but everything is different now.

“In the short run, AI will create more jobs as we learn how to work better with machines. But it’s important to think on a slightly longer timescale than the next 10 to 15 years.”
One guiding idea has always been that as machines take care of menial work (be that manual labor, augmenting the abilities of skilled professionals such doctors, lawyers, and engineers, or making routine decisions), humans will be free to spend their time on leisure or creative pursuits.

However, as Chace says, that would require the existence of the “abundance economy” – a Star Trek-like utopia where the means of filling our basic needs - sustenance and shelter - are so highly available that they are essentially free.
Without this happening, humans will find themselves in a situation where they have to go out and compete for whatever paid jobs are still available to humans in the robot-dominated workforce. As a simple example, a fully automated farm would, in theory, provide food at a far cheaper cost than one staffed with human farm hands, machinery operators, administrative staff, distributions operatives and security guards. However, if the owner of the farm still parts with his goods to the highest bidder, there would be inequalities in how that food is distributed among the populace and the potential for a poverty-struck underclass which lacks access to adequate sustenance. Nothing new there – of course, this underclass has always existed throughout history. However, it doesn’t exactly fit with the idea of the Star Trek utopia we need to have in place before we can comfortably hand the reigns to the machines.
This makes it something of a “chicken and egg” problem, and the ideal way for it to play out would seemingly be a gradual and managed transition to a smart machine-driven economy. This process would involve careful oversight of which human roles were being automated, and ensuring that the “plentiful” resources are in place to support those who unfortunately do find that they are being replaced, rather than merely “augmented.”
The problem is that this would require two elements: A concerted and informed effort from governments and regulators to understand the scale of the challenge and enable the right framework for it to happen. And an acceptance by those leading the charge – the tech industry – that there is a more important motive than profit for getting the change right.
Neither of those seems likely to happen any time soon. Despite the “make the world a better place” ethos, big tech’s overriding aim is still to generate growth and profit for their enterprises.
Also, managing the political change could be an even tougher job than persuading a tech CEO that she shouldn’t be focusing on revenue or profits.
“People aren’t stupid,” Chace says, while discussing how automated driving systems look set to erode the employment opportunities for humans whose trade is driving.
“They will see these robots driving around taking people’s jobs, and think ‘it won’t be long until they come for mine’ – and then there will be a panic. And panics lead to very nasty populist politicians, of the left or the right, being elected.”
Chace also doesn’t believe that the concept of universal basic income – currently being trialed in some Scandinavian countries – is the right answer, or at least not in its current form.
“The problem with universal basic income is that it’s basic. If all we can do is give people a basic income, we’ve failed, and society probably isn’t saveable.”
A future where the majority of humans live a subsistence-level income funded by the fruits of a robotic labor force, while a “1 percent” upper class – those in control of the robots – build their empires and reach for the stars – isn’t appealing to those with an egalitarian mindset. However, it could be the direction we’re heading in.
However, argues Chace, it’s not too late to plot a better course.
“We’ve all got a job to do – to wake up our political leaders who are not thinking about this, and wake up our tech leaders – who seem to be deeply in denial.
“If we do grasp the challenge we can have an amazing world for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, a world where machines do the boring stuff and humans do the worthwhile, interesting stuff.”

How AI Is Disrupting the Banking Industry

It’s an exciting time for financial services. A veritable smorgasbord of new, interrelated technologies are brewing up a perfect storm of disruption in the industry, including blockchain, data science, cloud computing and biometrics. Arguably, however, it is the significant advancement being achieved in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) that is having the most transformational impact on banking. In turn, AI is expected to permanently change the industry in profound ways during the coming months and years.
Few business sectors are currently more focused on developing AI for its own betterment than banking, as financial institutions seek to gain a competitive edge on their peers by implementing the technology to achieve improvements in speed, cost, accuracy and efficiency, as well as meet customer needs in an altogether more comprehensive manner. Much of the anticipation surrounds the ability of machines to replicate, and often exceed, what humans are able to do in banking. By collecting and utilising data to identify a whole host of patterns, moreover, those machines can become more adept at predicting activity that will ultimately make banks more efficient, from the front office to the back end.
The banking sectors being influenced by AI 
In terms of improving the customer experience, it is perhaps the chatbots that are currently the most visible form of AI being adopted across the sector. These automated service assistants are providing customers with the convenience of resolving their queries via an online messaging system, perhaps using their laptops or smartphones, instead of having to visit a branch. Through machine-learning techniques, more importantly, chatbots are improving consistently with regards to their ability to accurately identify the customer’s issue(s) and respond with the appropriate solution(s). As such, today they can recognise tens of thousands of variations on common questions a customer is likely to ask.
Chatbots are now practically an industry standard, and while they may not be able to perform more complicated tasks, they are undoubtedly improving their capabilities. In January, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) launched its in-house bot Ceba to more than a million customers, and which at last count could boast of being able to perform 200 tasks. But CBA expects that by the end of the year, this number will hit the 500-mark, while Ceba will also be able to successfully discern 500,000 different ways customers may ask for different banking activities. And then there’s Nina, Swedbank’s AI chatbot, which has been in operation for around two years. In addition to answering customer questions on an online chat platform, Nina can also pass on more complex calls to members of staff. The bot has managed to achieve a 78-percent first-contact resolution within the first three months, in addition to a customer adoption rate of 30,000 conversations per month during this time. 
But in terms of AI development and what could ultimately be achieved in banking, chatbots appear to be just the beginning. At the other end of the complexity scale is the usage of bots on the trading floor, primarily as a way to help traders perform more competently. In sectors such as algorithmic trading, AI algorithms can be developed in order to produce highly refined investment strategies. As opined last year by Michael Harte, Barclays’ group head of innovation, the clearest use case for AI in banking is “in large algorithmic trading”, which means “using vast amounts of high velocity data to outsmart the competition and to provide better instruments and value to customers”. AI is proving especially useful in high-frequency trading, which is a specific type of algorithmic trading characterised by high order rates and often ultra-fast trade execution. Given the short window of time in which trading opportunities present themselves in such markets, robots can be programmed to more efficiently capitalise on such opportunities than humans.
Swiss bank UBS last year debuted its two new AI systems on the trading floor, one of which is a system that analyses reams of market data to identify trading patterns, and thus formulates new strategies for trading volatility for the bank’s clients. Through machine learning, therefore, the system can improve its trading performance, which should ultimately translate into greater market returns for UBS’ trading division. The second is a relatively more straightforward protocol that was jointly developed with Deloitte and which addresses the post-trade allocation preferences of the bank’s clients. The system scans through emails sent by clients to identify their requests for splitting up large block trades among their various funds, before executing the transfers. By doing so, a 45-minute task can now be accomplished in just a few minutes, thus freeing up time for bankers to focus on more important jobs.
Indeed, management of customer data appears to be one area in which AI adoption is progressing comparatively quickly. The UBS emails are just one form of such data; others include news articles, recorded phone conversations and legal documents, with JPMorgan Chase’s contract intelligence (COIN) being an example of the latter. While manual review of the approximate 12,000 commercial credit agreements per year is estimated to take 360,000 hours, or 173 years, the use of COIN reduces that time down to just a matter of a few seconds. Clearly the time and cost implications of such a powerful analytical tool can be substantial. 
Similarly, AI is making considerable inroads on the compliance and security aspects of banking. With money laundering continuing to be a persistent problem for the global banking industry, there is now much anticipation over what technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, data mining and analytics can do to combat this threat, especially now that banks are being fined more frequently due to failings/inadequacies in their anti-money-laundering infrastructures. HSBC is among the keenest to explore such options—in April, it was revealed that following a successful pilot, the bank had partnered with big data startup Quantexa to utilise AI software to counter money laundering. According to Quantexa’s press release, “The technology will allow HSBC to spot potential money laundering activity by analysing internal, publicly available, and transactional data within a customer’s wider network”.
Moreover, the new venture follows another AI-based HSBC partnership last summer with startup Ayasdi to automate anti-money-laundering investigations that were previously being conducted by thousands of humans, according to the bank’s COO Andy Maguire. The aim of the initiative is to improve efficiency in this area, especially given that the overwhelming majority of money-laundering investigations at banks do notfind suspicious activity, which means that engaging in such tasks can be incredibly wasteful. In the pilot with Ayasdi, however, HSBC reportedly managed to reduce the number of investigations by 20 percent without reducing the number of cases referred for more scrutiny.
In addition to having an impact on specific divisions with the bank, AI is also playing a crucial role in changing banks’ inner organisational structures. For instance, US banking giant Wells Fargo announced last year the establishment of a new AI Enterprise Solutions team, which would operate under a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group. According to the bank’s official announcement, the group aims “to help increase connectivity for the company’s payments efforts, accelerate opportunities with artificial intelligence, and advance application programming interfaces to corporate banking customers”, with the ultimate goal of helping the company “create innovative digital banking experiences”, as well as make it easier for customers to achieve their financial goals.
A profound impact on banking-industry employment awaits?
While there is much expectation over the positive change that AI can bring, there is also considerable trepidation surrounding the technology. One of the most frequent concerns being raised is the high degree of substitutability bank employees are likely to have with robots. As machines continue to become more advanced, those jobs that involve significant repetition such as bank tellers are likely to be at risk first, before jobs that require more complexity begin to be threatened. According to Lex Sokolin, who is the global director for fintech research firm Autonomous Next, AI adoption across the financial-services industry could save US companies up to $1 trillion in productivity gains and lower overall employment costs by 2030. Sokolin also predicts that such changes in financial services will only be gradual until 2025, before accelerating from then until 2030.
And according to a recent Autonomous Next report, banking and lending will see the biggest transformation, with $450 billion in savings being potentially achievable—as well as a whopping 1.2 million jobs being at risk; followed by insurance with $400 billion in savings and 865,000 jobs under threat; and finally the investment-management sector, in which 460,000 jobs could go while $200 billion in savings could transpire. What’s more, of those AI-induced banking-job losses, 70 percent will be in the front office—485,000 tellers, 219,000 customer-service representatives and 174,000 loan interviewers and clerks; and they will be replaced by chatbots, voice assistants and automated authentication and biometric technology. In other areas of the bank, 96,000 financial managers and 13,000 compliance officers will be let go in favour of AI-powered anti-money-laundering, anti-fraud, compliance and monitoring tools. AI-based credit-underwriting and smart-contracts technology will also be responsible for the shedding of 250,000 loan officers.
Moreover, such fears regarding employment are confirmed by some of the world’s most reputable banking leaders. Ex-Citigroup head Vikram Pandit, for example, expects that AI could render as many as 30 percent of banking jobs obsolete in the next five years, asserting that AI and robotics “reduce the need for staff in roles such as back office functions”. Japan’s Mizuho Group plans to replace 19,000 employees with AI-related functionality by 2027, and recently departed Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan had once considered replacing almost 100,000 of the bank’s personnel with robots.
At the same time, however, conflicting data suggests that the proliferation of AI will be accompanied by a rise in banking jobs. A recent study from Accenture found that by 2022, a net gain in jobs of 14 percent is likely to materialise among those companies that effectively utilise AI, along with a 34-percent increase in revenues. With complex algorithms likely to be employed by AI, banking shareholders, regulators and other parties with vested interests are unlikely to be assured if there is no one around to explain the workings and methodologies of the machines. Such a view seems to be demonstrably supported by Mr. Ken Wong, head of AI Lab (Fintech and Innovation Group) at Singapore’s OCBC Bank, who recently acknowledged that his bank has made more hires related to AI since last year: “Besides data scientists, who develop AI algorithms and models, we are also hiring more engineers to manage these AI applications, and business managers who understand how to leverage AI within the business to increase efficiencies and improve customer experiences.”
It may also be the case that only the most mundane jobs such as data entry will be sacrificed for machine superiority. New jobs are likely to be created around the AI software in such fields as compliance to ensure regulators are provided with sufficient communication and explanations of the AI being implemented. What’s more, Accenture sees AI as being a likely catalyst for liberating humans to be able to work on more interesting and complex jobs. Its survey of 1,300 bank employees found that 67 percent of respondents expect AI to improve their own work-life balance, while 57 percent expect the rise of the machines to actually help their own career prospects.
Whilst a rise in job numbers associated with higher AI-adoption rates seems ideal, however, some evidence suggests that most financial institutions are not yet fully confident in how to effectively apply the technology for the best results. This may go some way towards explaining the ambiguities of the aforementioned numbers and trends. New research from capital-markets research and consulting firm TABB Group, conducted on behalf of augmented-intelligence-solutions provider Squirro, for example, found that 67 percent of banks are actively using AI today, despite the fact that 87 percent of those exploring the technology remain unsure of how to deploy it effectively. As Miguel Rodriguez, vice president of customer success at Squirro, observed, the report “has shown that banks are increasingly receptive to using AI and machine learning in their organisation, but it also highlighted what needs to be done to ensure maximum value is gained”.
AI has become something of a buzzword, not just in banking but for many industries. But behind the hype lies the potential for genuine transformation in the way the banking industry—and indeed, the world—functions. And with specialised hardware being equipped with ever-increasing processing power to enable more robust AI systems, as well as vastly improved infrastructure to mine and feed data to such systems for even greater capabilities, the banking industry is now realising the extent to which machine intelligence can positively redefine how it operates. Of course, several questions remain, such as how exactly banks can co-ordinate AI’s awesome power with the customer’s need for human interaction when needed. Nevertheless, some dramatic changes now loom on the horizon for banking.

Thank! There is a serious misconception that AI in finance means forecasting the stock market and that “everyone does it” when in fact, operations, marketing and security have the greatest impact. There is also a serious problem when financial companies seek to hire someone to improve their work and gain machine learning experience. As a result, they have a scientist who spends most of his time with Excel macros! Not an ideal situation for either side.

State Bank of India, the India's largest lender, has SBI Intelligent Assistant (SIA) -- a smart chat assistant, evolved from the ""cutting edge technology of artificial intelligence, that efficiently resolves queries of NRI customers, similar to that of a bank representative.  ""It provides instant solutions on everyday banking queries in the chat box on the SBI portal,"" the state-run lender said.  The bank is also in the process of instituting an 'Innovation Centre' that will explore how emerging technologies such as AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can help in making internal banking processes more efficient. Another state lender Bank of Baroda has evolved an innovative concept by setting up of hi-tech digital branch equipped with advanced gadgets like artificial intelligence robot named Baroda Brainy and Digital Lab with free Wi-Fi services.  Private sector banks too are using the advance innovative technology for improving workforce productivity and enhancing the customer experience.  ""The Indian banking industry is on a rapid digital journey and has been adopting technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning which will reshape the future.  ""The Indian banks are using AI as a tool to detect human behaviour, increase efficiency in automated processes and reduce cost for iterative activities,"" said Tobias Puehse, vice president, Innovation Management, Digital Payments and Labs, Asia Pacific, Mastercard.  Allahabad Bank said that its app 'emPower' is scheduled to get major enhancements like Chatbot and artificial intelligence based e-commerce payments.Supratim Chakraborty, Associate Partner, Khaitan &amp; Co, said that given the immense competition in the banking sector, push for process driven services and the demand from customers to provide more customised solutions, many banks are opting for technologies using AI.  However, the complexity involved in these technologies creates several regulatory challenges.  ""Justice Srikrishna Committee has opined that the biggest challenge in regulating emerging technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things lies in the fact that they may operate outside the framework of traditional privacy principles,"" said Chakraborty. He opined that RBI will have to play a more proactive and dynamic role in framing regulations to balance the business interest of banks and at the same time ensure customer privacy and information protection. When asked about the implications of use of new technology, Kalpesh Mehta, partner, Deloitte India, said that investing in the right AI technology can have a major impact on bank's operational efficiency and that its success boils down to the customer impact above all else. ""Indian banks are making AI investments in areas that are data intensive, systematic and critical to the bank's focus on profitability, customer experience, productivity and compliance,"" he said. According to a global consultancy firm PwC, in this era of technology disruption, enterprises are under immense pressure to digitise operations, and they see a future where human work can be augmented through the use of software robotics. These enterprises, the report said, are beginning to view a digital workforce as part of their digital transformation strategy by combining elements of robotic process automation (RPA), AI and analytics to automate business processes.","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@etcio.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,

The technology itself is getting better and smarter day by day, allowing more and newer industries to adopt the AI for various applications. Banking sector is becoming one of the first adopters of AI. And just like other segments, banks are exploring and implementing the technology in various ways.The rudimentary applications AI include bring smarter chat-bots for customer service, personalising services for individuals, and even placing an AI robot for self-service at banks. Beyond these basic applications, banks can implement the technology for bringing in more efficiency to their back-office and even reduce fraud and security risks.Unsurprisingly, research firms are bullish on the potential of AI in banking. According to Fintech India report by PwC in 2017, the global spending in AI applications touched $5.1 billion, up from $4 billion in 2015. There is a keen interest in the Indian banking sector as well.Advent of AI banking in IndiaAccording to Accenture’s recent Accenture Banking Technology Vision 2018 report, 83% of Indian bankers believe that AI will work alongside humans in the next two years — a higher than the global average of 79%. “93% bankers in India said they increasingly use data to drive critical and automated decision-making. More partner-supplied customer data means a higher degree of responsibility for banks. Yet, 77% Indian bankers agree that most firms are not prepared to confront impending waves of corrupted insights from falsified data,” said the report.“AI is not new to India. Research institutions and universities have been working with various AI technologies for decades, and especially in the area of social transformation. With enabling technologies becoming a lot more accessible and inexpensive, AI is now becoming mainstream, with large enterprises and start-ups looking at different opportunities. Our research shows that the adoption of AI has the potential to add nearly $1 trillion to the Indian economy in 2035. AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, and a lot more needs to be done to realise its full potential,” says Rishi Aurora, managing director, financial services, Accenture.“Application of AI and ML (machine learning) to different functions within the banking industry has enabled them to offer a far more personalised and efficient customer service. By achieving that, banks have also been able to gain better insights into their customers’ preference and expectations from the bank. Accordingly, automation of back-end workflows has shown better outcomes. According to various industry reports, more than 36% of large financial institutions are already investing in such technologies, and close to 70% are planning to in the near future,” according to Darshan Shah, MD, South Asia, LenddoEFL, a Singapore-based fintech company.Not just customer supportState Bank of India, the largest bank in India, last year conducted “Code for Bank” hackathon to encourage developers to build solutions leveraging futuristic technologies such as AI and Blockchain into the banking sector. Private banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have already introduced chat-bots for customers service. Some have even gone ahead with placing robots for customers service. Last year, Canara Bank installed Mitra and Candi robots at some of its offices.“Payment companies are using AI to offer personalised payment experience to consumers. By applying AI and analyzing past payment patterns, payment systems can prompt the preferred payment instrument which best suits a purchase at the time of checkout. Say a consumer avails EMI option frequently for his big-ticket purchases, then the best EMI option is made available to the consumer at the time of checkout. Such personalised consumer experiences drive up consumer spending and creates stickiness to the product consumers are using,” saidVarun Rathi, cofounder and COO, Happay, a Bangalore-based start-up focused on digital payment solutions.Pune-based Persistent Systems’ chief architect, corporate CTO, Abhay Pendse lists out some common uses of AI in banks:Fraud Detection: Anomaly detection can be used to increase the accuracy of credit card fraud detection and anti-money laundering.Customer Support and Helpdesk: Humanoid Chatbot interfaces can be used to increase efficiency and reduce cost for customer interactions.Risk Management: Tailored products can be offered to clients by looking at historical data, doing risk analysis, and eliminating human errors from hand-crafted models.Security: Suspicious behaviour, logs analysis, and spurious emails can be tracked down to prevent and possibly predict security breaches.Digitization and automation in back-office processing: Capturing documents data using OCR and then using machine learning/AI to generate insights from the text data can greatly cut down back-office processing times.Wealth management for masses: Personalized portfolios can be managed by Bot Advisors for clients by taking into account lifestyle, appetite for risk, expected returns on investment, etc.ATMs: Image/face recognition using real-time camera images and advanced AI techniques such as deep learning can be used at ATMs to detect and prevent frauds/crimes. Not without challengesA wide implementation of a high-end technology like AI in India is not going to be without challenges. From the lack of a credible and quality data to India’s diverse language set, experts believe a number of challenges exist for the Indian banking sector using AI.According to Accenture’s Rishi Aurora, “A key challenge is the availability of the right data. Data is the lifeblood of AI, and any vulnerability arising from unverified information is a serious concern for businesses. Imagine for example, the risks that could arise from KYC compliance AI systems if the data sources are incorrect. Or consider the efficacy of a fraud detection AI system without the right kind of data. Structured mechanisms for collecting, validating, standardizing, correlating, archiving and distributing AI relevant data is crucial.”Abhay Pendse echoes the sentiment, stating, “India has 150+ languages with sizable spoken population. Applications which use speech to text or text to speech rely on natural language processing (NLP) libraries and techniques. Banks can use the existing technologies to start with to support some major Indian languages, but in order to effectively reach out to wider population in India, much more progress is required on NLP front.”“Data access and data privacy is a central aspect of any AI work banks do. These aspects will be of paramount importance with introduction of regulations in Europe such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). GDPR regulation is currently applicable to European citizens, but India and other countries have their own data privacy regulations. Banks in India will have to build AI systems with GDPR and similar privacy regulations in mind,” he said.Experts also have also stressed the need for more skilled engineers to drive the segment.“The biggest challenge is the scarcity of trained human resources; the existing workforce is not familiar with latest tools and applications. Secondly, the AI technology is a big threat to redundant employees in the banking sector. The mass adoption of AI may cause a grave unemployment problem in the sector,” said Rachit Chawla , CEO of Finway Capital, a Delhi-based non-banking financial company.“One of the important challenges that is faced by Industry and not just banks in India is unavailability of people with right data science skills. With only small number of good data scientists available to do AI work, the industry needs to work with universities in India to develop skilled data scientists as well as develop in-house training programs to train employees on data science skills.Also identification of right use cases for AI implementation with the help of domain experts and data scientists can help banks in successful implementation of AI technologies for banking functions,” Abhay stressed.",,,,en,Artificial Intelligence in Indian banking: Challenges and opportunities | Mint,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}"
