Photograph: AlamyMicrosoft This article is more than 4 years oldMicrosoft sacks journalists to replace them with robotsThis article is more than 4 years oldUsers of the homepages of the MSN website and Edge browser will now see news stories generated by AIJim Waterson Media editorSat 30 May 2020 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 May 2020 07.13 EDTShareDozens of journalists have been sacked after Microsoft decided to replace them with artificial intelligence software.Staff who maintain the news homepages on Microsoft’s MSN website and its Edge browser – used by millions of Britons every day – have been told that they will be no longer be required because robots can now do their jobs.Around 27 individuals employed by PA Media – formerly the Press Association – were told on Thursday that they would lose their jobs in a month’s time after Microsoft decided to stop employing humans to select, edit and curate news articles on its homepages.Employees were told Microsoft’s decision to end the contract with PA Media was taken at short notice as part of a global shift away from humans in favour of automated updates for news.One staff member who worked on the team said: “I spend all my time reading about how automation and AI is going to take all our jobs, and here I am – AI has taken my job.”The individual added that the decision to replace humans with software was risky, as the existing staff were careful to stick to “very strict editorial guidelines” which ensured that users were not presented with violent or inappropriate content when opening their browser, of particular importance for younger users.The team working on the Microsoft site did not report original stories but still exercised editorial control, selecting stories produced by other news organisations – including the Guardian – and editing content and headlines where appropriate to fit the format. The articles were then hosted on Microsoft’s website, with the tech company sharing advertising revenue with the original publishers.Manual curation of news stories also ensured that headlines were clear and appropriate for the format, while encouraging a spread of political opinions and avoiding untrustworthy stories, while highlighting interesting articles from smaller outlets.Some of the journalists now facing redundancy had longstanding experience in the industry, while for others it offered a foot in the door and a job in an industry which has seen wave after wave of cuts. They now face a tough challenge to get jobs elsewhere when the whole industry is looking to cut costs. Other teams around the world are expected to be affected by Microsoft’s decision to automate the curation of its news sites.In common with other news organisations, PA Media is facing tough financial challenges and has had to furlough some staff and ask others to take pay cuts. The company has expanded outside its traditional news agency business, recently buying stock image business Alamy shortly before the pandemic devastated the media industry.A spokesperson for the company said: “We are in the process of winding down the Microsoft team working at PA, and we are doing everything we can to support the individuals concerned. We are proud of the work we have done with Microsoft and know we delivered a high-quality service.”A Microsoft spokesperson said: “Like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis. This can result in increased investment in some places and, from time to time, re-deployment in others. These decisions are not the result of the current pandemic.”Many tech companies are experimenting with uses for Artificial Intelligence in journalism, with the likes of Google funding investment in projects to understand its uses, although efforts to automate the writing of articles have not been adopted widely.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingPress AssociationNewspapers & magazinesNews agenciesnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNever doubt the instincts of Donald Trump, who just appointed ‘never Trump guy’ as his running mateMarina Hyde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan began his career as a consultant at Accenture, and has served a variety of business analyst and project management roles in technology and defense. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  We see evidence dating back to 2017 that Johnson & Johnson has been regularly publishing about their investments and initiatives related to artificial intelligence. At present, Johnson & Johnson does not seem to boast any mature, deployed applications with the firm itself, but its AI-related investment initiatives indicate their aspirations. According to an analysis by FiercePharma, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is the largest pharmaceutical firm by revenue, bringing in $82.1 billion in 2019. It’s a global healthcare behemoth with significant investments in life sciences spanning pharmaceuticals, consumer healthcare, and medical devices. However, its pharma group has seen the lions’ share of J&J’s success, outperforming its other units with notable sales expansion in oncology and immunology. J&J claims to be investing in data science competency throughout the firm. Piyush Mathur – Global Head of Workforce Analytics, Data Strategy, and Governance at Johnson & Johnson – summarized these efforts in a 2020 interview with i4cp: Across the enterprise, data science is one area we’ve been focusing on—it impacts every single function. We’ve started an overarching initiative across J&J called the Data Science Council. There are fifteen of us on the council made up of members from supply chain, R&D, finance, HR and the commercial side, all thinking about how to develop this skill within each function. In this article, we’re going to take a look at the known AI-related investments of Johnson & Johnson in the two areas where they seem to be most active today. Drug Development – J&J’s involvement with the Melloddy life science consortium, and their Quickfire emerging tech startup challenge. Robotic Surgery – New services and platforms for automating surgery procedures, which may increasingly be powered by and integrated with artificial intelligence. Drug Development Investments We found 2 examples of Johnson & Johnson’s AI-related investments supporting drug development: Melloddy The Melloddy project — which stands for Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery — is the first initiative we’ve seen that connects data from the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies to support drug discovery. Johnson & Johnson is one of 10 pharmaceutical firms forming the research consortium. Each contributed €10m of “in-kind” assets to fund the program. Source: Melloddy Melloddy aims to leverage the world’s largest collection of small molecules with known biochemical or cellular activity to enable more accurate predictive models and increase efficiencies in drug discovery. The group claims to use “federated learning”, a decentralized type of machine learning, to allow partners in the program to enhance predictive machine learning models on decentralized data from each contributor, without exposing their own proprietary information. JLABS Quickfire Challenge Johnson & Johnson’s innovation laboratories (JLABS) is vetting new technologies with a series of what it is calling Quickfire Challenges. According to a recent JLABS press release, the purpose of the Quickfire Challenges is to overcome the adoption and regulation challenges of applying AI, VR/AR, blockchain, and other emerging technologies in healthcare. The program claims to offer access to mentors and experienced health tech innovators to help companies develop solutions ideas. The JLABS site lists 44 Quickfire Challenges, which award winners with grant funding from ~$10,000-$400,000 and can also include mentorship or residency at JLABS. Only one of these events was titled with a specific focus in AI, the 2017 Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery QuickFire Challenge. Three winners were awarded: Source: Johnson & Johnson Innovation Laboratories   Envisagenics highlights the details of its winning Quickfire Challenge entry here:  More recent challenges hosted at global innovation hubs like Boston and Seoul have also given AI top billing among the events’ focus areas. That said, we only found one AI-driven solution among Quickfire Challenge winners since 2019. ImagoWorks, one of two awarded winners of the Seoul Quickfire Challenge, received approximately US$134,000, one year of residency at the Seoul Bio Hub, and one year of mentorship and coaching from JLABS science, technology and commercialization experts. This Seoul-based company aims to improve surgical outcomes by purportedly applying AI and geometrical modeling technology with its 3D medical/dental software platform. The firm remains in the early stages of development. We found the ImagoWorks CEO’s profile on Linkedin, but no company profile, no employees, no website, and no product demos. Robotic Surgery Investments Johnson & Johnson is still in the early stages of developing surgical robotics capabilities that may see widespread use in production. However, its late-2019 acquisition of multiple surgical robotics companies demonstrates a healthy and growing appetite to capitalize on a new paradigm of “digital surgery”. Verb Surgical On Dec 20, 2019, Verb Surgical was acquired by Johnson and Johnson for an undisclosed amount. According to information provided on Verb Surgical’s site, it was founded in 2015 as a joint venture between Google and Johnson & Johnson, with the stated goal of providing new tools for surgeons that will empower improved outcomes, taking them beyond conventional laparoscopy and robotics. Since then, it has received a broad mandate and millions in funding to “democratize surgery.” The company’s stated vision is to create a single, connected platform to replace often-complicated integrations of single-point solutions that don’t provide intelligence. Verb is proposing a new paradigm called “digital surgery”, which is about translating technology and information into actions that have the potential to improve clinical outcomes. If successful, the platform would enable surgeons to prepare for, perform, and follow up on surgery cases in one place, significantly leveling up the amount of actionable information at hand for surgeons. This may include capabilities for sharing procedure data, best practices, and patient data. We found ample evidence of Verb’s grand ambitions as well as strong funding and support for its research. But so far no demos and few details about the specific service functions under development have been published. Per IPqwery, the intellectual property of Verb Surgical includes 61 registered patents primarily in the ‘Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene’ category. Also, in Verb’s most recent press highlight, Ashley McEvoy – EVP and worldwide chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s medical device segment – stated that “both the Auris-I platform and Verb – have conducted end-to-end procedures in multiple different indications in general surgery. We’ve gotten very good feedback from over 30 plus surgeons and we’re going to take the absolute best of all of those as we, in parallel, advance both of those programs.” She also stated that J&J is engaged in active discussions with regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe to advance these technologies. As of today, we found exactly one job opening for a deep learning engineer at Verb Surgical, as well as tens of other research engineering and data science roles among its 399 employee profiles and 21 job listings on Linkedin. If Verb’s vision for digital surgery comes to fruition, its platform could create new space for AI-driven solutions. For example, brand new data-sets could be used to train machine learning systems to improve healthcare outcomes. Also, robotic surgery devices could also be made more adaptable by implementing learning systems to facilitate control of the robotic components themselves. Auris Health Auris Health – also mentioned in McEnvoy’s statement above – received $733.3M in funding before it was acquired by Johnson & Johnson on Feb 13, 2019, for $3.4 billion. The Silicon Valley company was founded in 2017 by Dr. Fred Moll, co-founder of Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). Auris received FDA clearance this year for a teleoperated robotic endoscopy system to diagnose lung disease called ARES (Auris Robotic Endoscopy System).  Auris states: The company’s aim is to “diagnose and treat lung cancer in a single setting”. Its “Monarch Platform improves upon existing, minimally invasive techniques by integrating robotics, micro-instrumentation, endoscope design, sensing, and data science into one platform to enable new categories of care.” We found no explicit examples of exactly how Auris is leveraging AI, but – like Verb – we found many full-time data science and machine learning roles among its 556 listed employees on Linkedin. In Summary Johnson & Johnson is in the early stages of a long-term plan for integrating AI with its enterprise. Its recent pattern of investment and acquisitions, as well as its stated goals, hint at a data-driven future for J&J’s drug discovery and robotic surgery businesses, which may prove fertile ground for future growth and integration of AI technologies and services.

They may be discouraged by fears that A.I., with its efficiency, will take away people’s jobs. They may question the ability of machines to be creative. Or they may have a desire to explore A.I.’s uses — but aren’t able to decrypt its terminology.This all reminds me of when people were similarly skeptical of another technology: the camera. In the 19th century, with the advent of modern photography, cameras introduced both challenges and benefits. While some artists embraced the technology, others saw cameras as alien devices that required expertise to operate. Some felt this posed a threat to their jobs.But for those artists willing to explore cameras as tools in their work, the aesthetic possibilities of photography proved inspiring. Indeed cameras, which became more accessible to the average user with advancements in technology, offered another technique and form for artistic endeavors like portrait-making.Art matters because as humans, we all have the ability to be creative. With time, the art we create evolves, and technology plays a crucial role in that process. History has shown that photography, as a novel tool and medium, helped revolutionize the way modern artists create works by expanding the idea of what could be considered art. Photography eventually found its way into museums. Today we know that cameras didn’t kill art; they simply provided people with another way to express themselves visually.This analogy is crucial to understanding the potential for artificial intelligence to influence art in this century.As machine learning becomes an increasing part of our everyday lives — incorporated into everything from the phones we text with to the cars we drive — it’s only natural to ask what the future of art in such an A.I.-dominated society will be. This question becomes even more relevant as machines step into the artistic realm as creators of art. In summer 2019, the Barbican Centre in London presented A.I.-produced pieces in a show called “A.I.: More Than Human.” And in November later that year, over one million people attended an exhibition exploring art and science at the National Museum of China in which many works were created using algorithms.ImageAn illustration depicting Leonardo da Vinci created by Ai-Da.Credit...Niklas Halle'n/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesI founded the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University in 2012. As an A.I. researcher, my main goal is to advance the technology. For me, this requires looking at human creativity to develop algorithms that not only understand our achievements in visual art, music and literature, but also produce or co-produce works in those fields. After all, it is our capacity to expand our creative skills beyond basic problem-solving into artistic expression that uniquely distinguishes us as humans.Human creativity has led to the invention of artificial intelligence, and now machines themselves can be forces of creativity. Naturally we are curious to see what A.I. is capable of and how it can develop. During the past eight years at the lab, our researchers have realized that A.I. has great potential for solving problems in art. For example, as an analytical tool, machine intelligence can help distinguish authentic paintings from forged ones by analyzing individual brush strokes.A.I. can also make sense of art by helping uncover potentially similar influences among artworks from different periods. In one test, machine learning was able to identify works that changed the course of art history and highlight new aspects of how that history evolved.Beyond digesting information, machines have also been able to create novel images — nearly entirely on their own — that viewers are unable to distinguish from works made by human artists. A.I. is even able to compose music that you can listen to on Spotify.Artists have long integrated new technologies into their practices. A.I. is no exception, yet there is a fundamental difference. This time, the machine is its own source of creativity — with the ability to comb through vast amounts of historical and social data, artificial intelligence can produce truly novel and uncanny imagery that is beyond our imagination. This element of surprise is the force that can advance artistic mediums in new directions, with the machines functioning not only as tools for artists, but also as their partners.But can an artificially intelligent machine be an artist in its own right? My answer is no.ImageAi-Da, a humanoid robot, and Aidan Meller, her inventor, present an oil painting in Oxford, England, created by artists based on a sketch by the robot.Credit...Niklas Halle'n/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhile the definition of art is ever-evolving, at its core it is a form of communication among humans. Without a human artist behind the machine, A.I. can do little more than play with form, whether that means manipulating pixels on a screen or notes on a musical ledger. These activities can be engaging and perceptually intriguing, but they lack meaning without interaction between artist and audience.In recent years I’ve been blessed to work with an increasing number of artists interested in exploring A.I. in their practices. I’ve dedicated myself to this work by developing Playform, a platform that allows artists to experiment with artificial intelligence without having to understand or navigate the algorithms and terminology behind the technology.Once such technological barriers are lifted, artists can make amazing things happen. Some of them use the technology to create images for artworks or for virtual reality projects. Many use A.I. to find inspiration. Others feed images of their own into the computer, using machine intelligence like a workshop to better understand their style.I’ve noticed that new technologies are often met first with skepticism before eventually being embraced. I see the same trajectory emerging for artificial intelligence. Like the camera, A.I. offers a means for artists and non-artists alike to express themselves. That makes me confident that smart machines can only help, not hurt, human creativity.

And most practitioners know the huge processing power and energy consumption needed to train pretty much any noteworthy neural network. That is to say, for the field to develop further, a new type of hardware is needed.Some experts consider that the quantum computer is that hardware. But even though it holds great promise, quantum computing is a technology that will take many decades to develop. Physics theories are not yet mature enough to enable the development of useful and cost-efficient devices.Neuromorphic computing, on the other hand, will take less time and resources to develop and will be very useful and cost-efficient, both regarding the cost of device development and the energy costs for processing power.As most readers don’t know what neuromorphic computing is, I will describe this new technology in this article, along with what it will enable us to do, in the “much-nearer-that-quantum” future.

Executive Summary
The drone industry is now in its golden age and its growth promises to be exponential.1 Even though humanitarian aid workers have used this technology for a decade, the expansion of its market as well as the development of technology are pushing more and more organizations to equip themselves with this device. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as remotely piloted aircraft or “drones” are small aircraft that fly by remote control or autonomously.2 This report focuses on the usage of unarmed civilian drones and UAVs. Future reports can explore the impact and development of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles and ground drones.
In 2014, OCHA highlighted in its Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Humanitarian Response policy paper3 the different uses of drones in humanitarian action demonstrating the increasing use of this technology. Additionally, the uses of drones in humanitarian action can be summarized by six categories identified by the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action in its report Drones in Humanitarian Action (2016)4: Mapping; Delivery of essential products to remote or hard-to-reach locations; Search and Rescue (SAR) ; Support for damage assessment; Increased situational awareness; and Monitoring changes (such as urban and camp growth, agricultural use or the construction of roads or infrastructure). This report will shed some light on how AI powered drones are improving and modifying these uses.
Rapid adoption can be explained through a combination of the opportunities modern drones present  and the ever-increasing artificial intelligence (AI)-related capacities they can leverage. On one hand, their use is simplified and empowered through autonomy. On the other hand, the improved performance in visual analytics makes it possible to rely on aerial drone imagery.
This report aims to highlight the extent to which AI increases the capabilities of drones. Thanks to the generalization of deep learning methods, drones are further capturing the environment in which they operate, allowing increasingly complex missions. This technology is also making it possible to significantly improve drone visual recognition as well as  image analysis. Since use of AI algorithms requires high computing power, its application often takes place post flight. This performance will be highlighted through three case studies:

Drones for Emergency Response to wildfires in Northern California (November 2018)


Drones for Emergency Response to Cyclone Idai by UNICEF in Malawi (March 2019)


Drones for Emergency Response to Cyclone Idai by WFP in Mozambique (March 2019)

The report also explores the potential future functionalities of drones. As advances in on-board computing power enable AI algorithms to run during flights, some experts envision further added value for the use of drones in humanitarian missions. Although some of the issues raised by OCHA in 2014 have been addressed, this report highlights the new/exacerbated challenges identified in relation to the use of artificially intelligent drones. These operational and ethical issues are fundamental and the humanitarian community, which has well-established principles, must systematically take them into account. This report is informed by scholarly and news articles, as well as 18 interviews with a diverse range of experts in the AI, UAV and humanitarian fields. They work in different branches of the United Nations, in academia, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, and private sector companies.

The message, which she forwarded to me, was from a handful of corporate Walmart employees calling themselves the “Concerned Home Office Associates.” (Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, is often referred to as the Home Office.) While it’s not unusual for journalists to receive anonymous tips, they don’t usually come with their own slickly produced videos.The employees said they were “past their breaking point” with Everseen, a small artificial intelligence firm based in Cork, Ireland, whose technology Walmart began using in 2017. Walmart uses Everseen in thousands of stores to prevent shoplifting at registers and self-checkout kiosks. But the workers claimed it misidentified innocuous behavior as theft, and often failed to stop actual instances of stealing.They told WIRED they were dismayed that their employer—one of the largest retailers in the world—was relying on AI they believed was flawed. One worker said that the technology was sometimes even referred to internally as “NeverSeen” because of its frequent mistakes. WIRED granted the employees anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.Trending NowWill AI Enhance or Hack Humanity? - Fei-Fei Li & Yuval Noah Harari in Conversation with Nicholas ThompsonThe workers said they had been upset about Walmart’s use of Everseen for years, and claimed colleagues had raised concerns about the technology to managers, but were rebuked. They decided to speak to the press, they said, after a June 2019 Business Insider article reported Walmart’s partnership with Everseen publicly for the first time. The story described how Everseen uses AI to analyze footage from surveillance cameras installed in the ceiling, and can detect issues in real time, such as when a customer places an item in their bag without scanning it. When the system spots something, it automatically alerts store associates.“Everseen overcomes human limitations. By using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, computer vision systems, and big data we can detect abnormal activity and other threats,” a promotional video referenced in the story explains. “Our digital eye has perfect vision and it never needs a day off.”In an effort to refute the claims made in the Business Insider piece, the Concerned Home Office Associates created a video, which purports to show Everseen’s technology failing to flag items not being scanned in three different Walmart stores. Set to cheery elevator music, it begins with a person using self-checkout to buy two jumbo packages of Reese’s White Peanut Butter Cups. Because they’re stacked on top of each other, only one is scanned, but both are successfully placed in the bagging area without issue.AdvertisementThe same person then grabs two gallons of milk by their handles, and moves them across the scanner with one hand. Only one is rung up, but both are put in the bagging area. They then put their own cell phone on top of the machine, and an alert pops up saying they need to wait for assistance—a false positive. “Everseen finally alerts! But does so mistakenly. Oops again,” a caption reads. The filmmaker repeats the same process at two more stores, where they fail to scan a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day chocolate box with a puppy on the front and a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush. At the end, a caption explains that Everseen failed to stop more than $100 of would-be theft.False PositivesThe video isn’t definitive proof that Everseen’s technology doesn’t work as well as advertised, but its existence speaks to the level of frustration felt by the group of anonymous Walmart employees, and the lengths they went to prove their objections had merit.In interviews, the workers, whose jobs include knowledge of Walmart’s loss prevention programs, said their top concern with Everseen was false positives at self-checkout. The employees believe that the tech frequently misinterprets innocent behavior as potential shoplifting, which frustrates customers and store associates, and leads to longer lines. “It’s like a noisy tech, a fake AI that just pretends to safeguard,” said one worker.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe coronavirus pandemic has given their concerns more urgency. One Concerned Home Office Associate said they worry false positives could be causing Walmart workers to break social distancing guidelines unnecessarily. When Everseen flags an issue, a store associate needs to intervene and determine whether shoplifting or another problem is taking place. In an internal communication from April obtained by WIRED, a corporate Walmart manager expressed strong concern that workers were being put at risk by the additional contact necessitated by false positives, and asked whether the Everseen system should be turned off to protect customers and workers.Before Covid-19, “it wasn’t ideal, it was a poor customer experience,” the worker said. “AI is now creating a public health risk.” (HuffPost reported last week that corporate Walmart employees were concerned about Everseen’s technology putting store associates at risk amid the pandemic.)When Covid-19 reached the US, Americans rushed to stock up on food and household essentials at Walmart, and sales soared. Workers soon began falling sick; at least 20 Walmart associates have now died after contracting the coronavirus, according to United For Respect, a nonprofit that advocates for retail workers and that is crowdsourcing Covid-19 infection rates and working conditions at Walmart stores across the country. Last month, United For Respect said hundreds of Walmart employees participated in a national strike demanding safer working conditions and better benefits.A spokesperson for Walmart said the company has been working diligently to protect customers and its workforce, and believes the rate at which associates have contracted Covid-19 is lower than that of the general US population. They denied that false positives caused by Everseen were a widespread issue, and said the company had not considered turning the system off due to concerns about Covid-19.“We assess our technology regularly, and as evident with the large scale implementation of Everseen across the chain, we have confidence it is currently meeting our standards,” the spokesperson said in an email. Just prior to the start of the pandemic, Walmart said it made significant improvements to its Everseen system, which resulted in fewer alerts overall. The spokesperson declined to answer questions about what the updates may have entailed.The spokesperson also noted that there are a number of different reasons an associate might intervene during a self-checkout transaction, like when a customer has problems with their credit card. The company said it has taken a number of steps to ensure people are protected during these interactions, including regularly cleaning self-checkout kiosks and providing employees with protective equipment. In addition, workers are given handheld devices that allow them to handle most interventions from a distance, the company said.Do you know more about Walmart's use of AI? Email the author Louise Matsakis at louise_matsakis@wired.com.Everseen declined to answer questions about its technology. In a statement, a spokesperson said the company “accurately and effectively identifies potential theft [sic] is why retailers have successfully deployed it at thousands of locations to date, with many more installations planned.” They added that Everseen typically accounts only for less than 10 percent of total interventions at self-service checkouts. In a separate statement, the spokesperson said “Everseen is committed to helping its customers deliver the best possible experience for shoppers and store associates, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-checkout offers the benefits of a generally contactless shopping experience, allowing for proper social distancing and avoiding manned-lanes in busy stores with limited staff available.”But the Concerned Home Office Associates said their worries about Everseen long predate the pandemic. Emails obtained by WIRED show that other corporate employees raised issues about the technology failing to prevent theft in both 2017 and 2018. The employees said they were particularly vexed by Walmart’s continued investment in Everseen because NCR Corporation, which makes the majority of Walmart’s registers, had acquired an Everseen competitor called StopLift. They considered the acquisition an endorsement, and were confused as to why StopLift’s technology wasn’t being further explored.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDWhat’s more, the workers said an internal Walmart research and development group, the Intelligent Retail Lab (IRL), created its own anti-theft software they believed was more accurate than Everseen’s, according to information they were given internally. One Walmart employee said the technology, the existence of which was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, is now being tested in roughly 50 stores.Walmart declined to answer questions about its internal anti-theft software, but did not dispute WIRED’s reporting. “At an enterprise level, there are a number of tests happening at any given time across our footprint of nearly 5,000 stores,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The goal of IRL is to build AI capabilities that can be transferred to additional stores. We regularly test capabilities built internally in a small number of stores.”Rising ShrinkEverseen’s technology was designed in part to help solve a persistent problem with self-checkout. While allowing customers to scan and pay for their own items cuts down on labor costs for retailers, it has also led to more inventory loss, or “shrinkage,” due to shoplifting, employee theft, and other problems. “Theft through self-checkout lanes is exponentially higher than through traditional checkout lanes,” says Christopher Andrews, a sociology professor at Drew University and the author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreIn the past, Walmart and other retailers relied on weight sensors to prevent shoplifting through self-checkout, but those were prone to error and frustrated customers. Some stores are now turning instead to firms like Everseen, which promise to reduce shrink and increase customer satisfaction by relying instead on surveillance cameras and machine vision. Everseen has said that it works with a number of major retailers. Amazon uses similar technology in its Amazon Go convenience stores, where a network of cameras automatically log the products customers take. (Amazon is now licensing its “Just Walk Out” tech to other companies.)During the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath, self-checkout may become even more important for stores, as customers look for low-risk ways to shop. NCR corporation said it’s now helping retailers modify its equipment to be as touchless as possible: for example, by reconfiguring machines so that customers can insert a debit or credit card without needing to press the “credit card” payment option. “It is fascinating to see self-checkout become poised as a public health strategy, in addition to things like cashless payment,” says Alexandra Mateescu, a researcher at the nonprofit institute Data & Society, who has written about the effects of new technology on retail workers.“Self-checkout is just one of the ways that we’ve offered customers solutions to get the items they need safely during this time, in addition to other options like delivery, pickup, touchless payment at the register and shopping online,” the Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. “Customers are using this option now, as much as ever, and we will continue to work hard to ensure the in-store experience for our customers is safe, affordable and convenient, as well as safe for our associates.”Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Walmart uses Everseen in thousands of stores to prevent shoplifting at registers and self-checkout kiosks. But the workers claimed it misidentified innocuous behavior as theft, and often failed to stop actual instances of stealing.
They told WIRED they were dismayed that their employer—one of the largest retailers in the world—was relying on AI they believed was flawed. One worker said that the technology was sometimes even referred to internally as “NeverSeen” because of its frequent mistakes. WIRED granted the employees anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.
The workers said they had been upset about Walmart’s use of Everseen for years, and claimed colleagues had raised concerns about the technology to managers, but were rebuked. They decided to speak to the press, they said, after a June 2019 Business Insider article reported Walmart’s partnership with Everseen publicly for the first time. The story described how Everseen uses AI to analyze footage from surveillance cameras installed in the ceiling, and can detect issues in real time, such as when a customer places an item in their bag without scanning it. When the system spots something, it automatically alerts store associates.
“Everseen overcomes human limitations. By using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, computer vision systems, and big data we can detect abnormal activity and other threats,” a promotional video referenced in the story explains. “Our digital eye has perfect vision and it never needs a day off.”
In an effort to refute the claims made in the Business Insider piece, the Concerned Home Office Associates created a video, which purports to show Everseen’s technology failing to flag items not being scanned in three different Walmart stores. Set to cheery elevator music, it begins with a person using self-checkout to buy two jumbo packages of Reese’s White Peanut Butter Cups. Because they’re stacked on top of each other, only one is scanned, but both are successfully placed in the bagging area without issue.
The same person then grabs two gallons of milk by their handles, and moves them across the scanner with one hand. Only one is rung up, but both are put in the bagging area. They then put their own cell phone on top of the machine, and an alert pops up saying they need to wait for assistance—a false positive. “Everseen finally alerts! But does so mistakenly. Oops again,” a caption reads. The filmmaker repeats the same process at two more stores, where they fail to scan a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day chocolate box with a puppy on the front and a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush. At the end, a caption explains that Everseen failed to stop more than $100 of would-be theft.
False Positives
The video isn’t definitive proof that Everseen’s technology doesn’t work as well as advertised, but its existence speaks to the level of frustration felt by the group of anonymous Walmart employees, and the lengths they went to prove their objections had merit.
In interviews, the workers, whose jobs include knowledge of Walmart’s loss prevention programs, said their top concern with Everseen was false positives at self-checkout. The employees believe that the tech frequently misinterprets innocent behavior as potential shoplifting, which frustrates customers and store associates, and leads to longer lines. “It’s like a noisy tech, a fake AI that just pretends to safeguard,” said one worker.
The coronavirus pandemic has given their concerns more urgency. One Concerned Home Office Associate said they worry false positives could be causing Walmart workers to break social distancing guidelines unnecessarily. When Everseen flags an issue, a store associate needs to intervene and determine whether shoplifting or another problem is taking place. In an internal communication from April obtained by WIRED, a corporate Walmart manager expressed strong concern that workers were being put at risk by the additional contact necessitated by false positives, and asked whether the Everseen system should be turned off to protect customers and workers.
Before Covid-19, “it wasn’t ideal, it was a poor customer experience,” the worker said. “AI is now creating a public health risk.” (HuffPost reported last week that corporate Walmart employees were concerned about Everseen’s technology putting store associates at risk amid the pandemic.)
When Covid-19 reached the US, Americans rushed to stock up on food and household essentials at Walmart, and sales soared. Workers soon began falling sick; at least 20 Walmart associates have now died after contracting the coronavirus, according to United For Respect, a nonprofit that advocates for retail workers and that is crowdsourcing Covid-19 infection rates and working conditions at Walmart stores across the country. Last month, United For Respect said hundreds of Walmart employees participated in a national strike demanding safer working conditions and better benefits.
A spokesperson for Walmart said the company has been working diligently to protect customers and its workforce, and believes the rate at which associates have contracted Covid-19 is lower than that of the general US population. They denied that false positives caused by Everseen were a widespread issue, and said the company had not considered turning the system off due to concerns about Covid-19.
“We assess our technology regularly, and as evident with the large scale implementation of Everseen across the chain, we have confidence it is currently meeting our standards,” the spokesperson said in an email. Just prior to the start of the pandemic, Walmart said it made significant improvements to its Everseen system, which resulted in fewer alerts overall. The spokesperson declined to answer questions about what the updates may have entailed.
The spokesperson also noted that there are a number of different reasons an associate might intervene during a self-checkout transaction, like when a customer has problems with their credit card. The company said it has taken a number of steps to ensure people are protected during these interactions, including regularly cleaning self-checkout kiosks and providing employees with protective equipment. In addition, workers are given handheld devices that allow them to handle most interventions from a distance, the company said.
Everseen declined to answer questions about its technology. In a statement, a spokesperson said the company “accurately and effectively identifies potential theft [sic] is why retailers have successfully deployed it at thousands of locations to date, with many more installations planned.” They added that Everseen typically accounts only for less than 10 percent of total interventions at self-service checkouts. In a separate statement, the spokesperson said “Everseen is committed to helping its customers deliver the best possible experience for shoppers and store associates, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-checkout offers the benefits of a generally contactless shopping experience, allowing for proper social distancing and avoiding manned-lanes in busy stores with limited staff available.”
But the Concerned Home Office Associates said their worries about Everseen long predate the pandemic. Emails obtained by WIRED show that other corporate employees raised issues about the technology failing to prevent theft in both 2017 and 2018. The employees said they were particularly vexed by Walmart’s continued investment in Everseen because NCR Corporation, which makes the majority of Walmart’s registers, had acquired an Everseen competitor called StopLift. They considered the acquisition an endorsement, and were confused as to why StopLift’s technology wasn’t being further explored.
What’s more, the workers said an internal Walmart research and development group, the Intelligent Retail Lab (IRL), created its own anti-theft software they believed was more accurate than Everseen’s, according to information they were given internally. One Walmart employee said the technology, the existence of which was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, is now being tested in roughly 50 stores.
Walmart declined to answer questions about its internal anti-theft software, but did not dispute WIRED’s reporting. “At an enterprise level, there are a number of tests happening at any given time across our footprint of nearly 5,000 stores,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The goal of IRL is to build AI capabilities that can be transferred to additional stores. We regularly test capabilities built internally in a small number of stores.”
Rising Shrink
Everseen’s technology was designed in part to help solve a persistent problem with self-checkout. While allowing customers to scan and pay for their own items cuts down on labor costs for retailers, it has also led to more inventory loss, or “shrinkage,” due to shoplifting, employee theft, and other problems. “Theft through self-checkout lanes is exponentially higher than through traditional checkout lanes,” says Christopher Andrews, a sociology professor at Drew University and the author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.
In the past, Walmart and other retailers relied on weight sensors to prevent shoplifting through self-checkout, but those were prone to error and frustrated customers. Some stores are now turning instead to firms like Everseen, which promise to reduce shrink and increase customer satisfaction by relying instead on surveillance cameras and machine vision. Everseen has said that it works with a number of major retailers. Amazon uses similar technology in its Amazon Go convenience stores, where a network of cameras automatically log the products customers take. (Amazon is now licensing its “Just Walk Out” tech to other companies.)
During the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath, self-checkout may become even more important for stores, as customers look for low-risk ways to shop. NCR corporation said it’s now helping retailers modify its equipment to be as touchless as possible: for example, by reconfiguring machines so that customers can insert a debit or credit card without needing to press the “credit card” payment option. “It is fascinating to see self-checkout become poised as a public health strategy, in addition to things like cashless payment,” says Alexandra Mateescu, a researcher at the nonprofit institute Data & Society, who has written about the effects of new technology on retail workers.
“Self-checkout is just one of the ways that we’ve offered customers solutions to get the items they need safely during this time, in addition to other options like delivery, pickup, touchless payment at the register and shopping online,” the Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. “Customers are using this option now, as much as ever, and we will continue to work hard to ensure the in-store experience for our customers is safe, affordable and convenient, as well as safe for our associates.”

 Portrait of Napoleon I created with the help of artificial intelligence © Bas Uterwijk



An astonishingly “life-like” image of Napoleon appeared on social networks this week. It was created with the help of artificial intelligence by dutch photographer Bas Uterwijk. Napoleon.org wanted to find out more about how the artist created this image and we are delighted to share with you the answers he kindly provided.
See the portrait in high definition
Bas Uterwijk: I will tell a little about myself and the procedure I have used:
I am a photographer from Amsterdam with a background in computer graphics, special effects and 3D animation. About a year ago I started (as a hobby) creating images using a neural network. I am working with computer models that are trained on a huge variety of human faces. Through Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning this software [Artbreeder] is able to create near photo-realistic portraits based on my input combined with what it knows about human faces and the way light behaves in photography.
After I did a convincing restoration of Billy the Kid as an experiment, I started to work with inputting different paintings and sculptures to create famous people that lived before the invention of photography. The software I work with is developing fast and although I first tried doing Napoleon last year, the results were nice but not so perfect that I wanted to share it online. This month I picked up that particular project again and produced the image you have seen. The software is very good at some things but not perfect and it doesn’t work automatically so there is a lot of additional work and experimentation involved. I am constantly learning and chances are that this will not be the last version of Napoleon I will do. At the moment I am working simultaneously on several other historical people.

Although I try to keep my personal input to a minimum, the portraits I make are artistic impressions. I try to let the facts I can find about a person’s face weigh in the eventual representation, but I am no scientist and don’t claim any historical accuracy. It also really depends on what material I can find online and how much is known. Because of the many depictions and even photographs of descendants in the case of Napoleon the results will be much closer to the “truth” than an impression of let’s say Jeanne d’Arc or Cleopatra of whom most depictions spring mostly from the mind of artists! Here is a selection of portraits of Napoleon that I used. Some took a prominent role in the process, for others the weight was minimal.
Below is one of many trees that I have made [in Artbreeder] while trying to find Napoleon’s face. A new face gets added when either crossbreeding with another painting or saving an intermediate face after adjustment with sliders. These sliders control physical appearance parameters like hair and eye colour, age, width, height etc. In the end it is the artist that decides which is the “right” direction so the human component is decisive for the end result.

The automotive industry is a key driver and user of artificial intelligence (AI), which is fast percolating to different work areas. Now German major Durr has developed Advanced Analytics, the first market-ready AI application for paint shops. 
This intelligent solution, which combines the latest IT technology and mechanical engineering expertise, identifies sources of defects and determines optimal maintenance schedules. It also tracks previously unknown correlations and uses the knowledge to adapt the algorithm to the plant using the principle of self-learning. Advanced Analytics is the latest module from the DXQanalyze product series. First practical applications are showing that the software from Durr optimises plant availability and the surface quality of painted bodies.
Why do body parts exhibit the same defects with an unusually high frequency? When is the latest that a mixer in the robot can be replaced without causing machine stoppage? Precise answers are important for sustainable economic success. Because every defect or every unnecessary maintenance procedure that can be avoided saves money or improves the product quality. “Before there were very few precise conclusions that would enable the early detection of quality defects or failures. And if there were, they were generally based on a painstaking manual data evaluation or trial-and-error attempts. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes this much more accurate and automatic,” explains Gerhard Alonso Garcia, Vice President MES & Control Systems at Dürr.
The new self-learning Advanced Analytics plant and process monitoring system adds to DXQanalyze. The digital product series from Durr already included the Data Acquisition modules for acquiring production data, Visual Analytics for visualising it, and Streaming Analytics. The latter lets plant operators analyse in close to real time whether there are deviations from previously defined rules or target values in production using a low-code platform.
Durr's AI application Advanced Analytics identifies sources of defects and determines optimal maintenance schedules.
AI application with its own memory
What makes Advanced Analytics special is that the module combines large quantities of data including historical data with machine learning. In the figurative sense, this means that the self-learning AI application has a memory. This means that it can use information from the past to both recognise complex correlations in large quantities of data and predict an event in the future with a high degree of accuracy based on the current condition of a machine. There are multiple applications for this in paint shops, whether at component, process, or plant level.
Durr software reduces plant downtimes through predictive maintenance, repair information.
Reducing plant downtime with predictive maintenance
When it comes to components, Advanced Analytics reduces downtimes through predictive maintenance and repair information, for example by predicting the remaining service life of a mixer. If the component is replaced too early, it increases the spare part costs and repair overhead unnecessarily, while leaving it too long to replace a component can result in quality problems during coating and machine stoppages. Advanced Analytics starts by learning the wear indicators and the temporal pattern of the wear using high-frequency robot data. Since the data is continuously recorded and monitored, the machine learning module individually recognizes aging trends for the respective component based on actual use and calculates the optimum replacement time.
Machine learning simulates continuous temperature curves
Advanced Analytics improves quality at process level by identifying anomalies, for example by simulating the heat-up curve in the oven. Up to now, manufacturers only had data determined by sensors during measurement runs. However, the heat-up curves that are of vital importance for surface quality of the car bodies vary since the oven ages during the intervals between the measurement runs. This wear causes fluctuating ambient conditions, for example, in the strength of the air flow.
“These days, thousands of bodies are produced without us knowing the temperatures to which the individual bodies were heated. Using machine learning, our Advanced Analytics module simulates how the temperature varies under different conditions. This gives our customers a permanent proof of quality for each individual body and lets them identify anomalies,” says Gerhard Alonso Garcia.
Higher first-run rate increases equipment effectiveness
At plant level, the DXQplant.analytics software is used with the Advanced Analytics module to increase overall equipment effectiveness. The artificial intelligence tracks system defects such as recurring quality defects in model types, specific colours, or on individual body parts. This permits conclusions about which step in the production process is responsible for the deviations. Such defect and cause correlations make it possible to increase the first-run rate by allowing intervention at a very early stage.
Plant and digital expertise expertly combined
Developing AI-capable data models is a very complex process. Machine learning does not work by feeding unspecified amounts of data into a 'smart' algorithm, which then spits out an intelligent result. Instead, relevant (sensor) signals must be collected, carefully selected, and supplemented with structured additional information from production. With Advanced Analytics, Durr has developed a piece of software that supports different use scenarios, provides a runtime environment for machine learning models, and initiates model training. “The challenge was there was no generally valid machine learning model and no suitable run-time environment we could have used. To be able to use AI at plant level, we combined our knowledge of mechanical and plant engineering with the knowledge of our experts from the Digital Factory. This resulted in the first AI solution for paint shops,” explains Gerhard Alonso Garcia.
With Artificial Intelligence, systematic errors in the painting process can be detected, thus OEE can be increased by allowing intervention at a very early stage.

Interdisciplinary knowledge pays dividends
Advanced Analytics was developed by an interdisciplinary team of data scientists, computer scientists, and process experts. Durr also entered into cooperation partnerships with several leading automotive manufacturers. This allowed the developers to access real-life production data and beta site environments in production for different application cases. First the algorithms were trained in the lab using a large number of test cases. Next, the algorithms continued learning on-site in real-life operation and autonomously adapted to environment and use conditions. The beta phase was recently successfully completed and showed the potential of AI.

The future of work has always been a popular topic for discussion, especially among HR and payroll practitioners. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown many countries have experienced are fast-tracking discussions towards more practical interventions to prepare the workforce for what will be the new normal.
“Even though many aspects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the digitalisation of workforces have been theoretical, the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic has forced management to rethink their approaches to employees and how they use technology to not only improve productivity but reinvent traditional processes,” says Ian McAlister, GM at CRS Technologies.




More than just technology
Consider artificial intelligence (AI), for example. Globally, 37% of companies have deployed AI solutions – up 270% from four years ago – and with spending on AI only expected to continue growing, some are concerned that this will result in significant job losses.
While it will make certain job roles redundant, McAlister believes it also presents an opportunity to reskill and upskill employees to be better prepared for a digitally-driven work environment. “While AI will see many subtle and not so subtle changes to job roles and skills over the coming years, throughout this the people element will remain critically important.
“Even with all the technological advances that 4IR will deliver, humans will continue to be the fundamental element to ensure its success. Just as with the industrial revolution and even the advent of the Internet, people will be repurposed to deliver on new roles and responsibilities, better reflective of the modern organisation. Automation will empower these workers to deliver more strategic value by taking care of much of the menial administration-intensive components of their daily responsibilities.”
Far from resulting in a massive job cull, the arrival of the ‘robots’ in recent times have not taken work away from people. The world’s unemployment rate last year was 5.4% and has remained between 5% and 6% for the last decade and a half. Consequently, it appears that it is not a lack of work that is the problem, but how employees leverage technology to improve the bottom-line that needs to be refined.
People-centric
“No technology will work successfully without human involvement,” McAlister continues. “Machine-learning delivers an element of automation, but it is still ultimately guided by the insights and experiences of people. Even if there is massive disruption at hand due to the current global crisis and the influx of 4IR technologies, this will likely contribute to an increasing reliance on team-based structures, increasingly virtual workplaces that are geographically agnostic, and the diversity of skills previously unimaginable.”
The lockdown has illustrated how many job functions can still be performed while working remotely. Virtual meetings and online group collaborations have become standard business practice. The resultant flexible work environment will likely continue even post-lockdown with many companies looking at implementing such policies in more direct ways.
“This could have a massive impact on office space, with organisations able to reduce their leases by moving into smaller buildings that cater to workers who have to be on site. A rotation system can also be implemented where employees work at hot desks and swop out with others who might be operating remotely. The spin-off from this could be the introduction of fibre access allowances to employees, given the money the business is saving on rent.”
“With traditional career paths changing so rapidly across the entry-level all the way through to middle management, companies must become more adaptable to this fast-moving environment,” McAlister concludes. “The future of the workforce and even the workplace might be guided by 4IR innovation, but it will still be informed by human experiences and the value individuals bring to the business from an experiential perspective.”
