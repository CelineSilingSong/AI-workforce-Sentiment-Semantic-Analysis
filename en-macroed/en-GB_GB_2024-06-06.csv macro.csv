And that 79% of business and technology leaders expect GenAI to drive substantial transformation over the next 3 years—with 31% saying it will happen in less than a year. GenAI is here to stay. So, what does that mean for you?  Revolutionary era, revolutionary solution These leaps forward in AI technology have made it possible to build not just GenAI-powered tools but a true GenAI assistant. An intelligent, proactive product that can itself make use of GenAI tools to complete substantive, sophisticated, multi-step work, just as you could expect a colleague to do.  This is why we believe that within 3 years, every professional will have one. But do you know which GenAI assistant is right for your work? The answer is CoCounsel. Our professional-grade assistant brings the power of GenAI to complete the task at hand, from within the products you already use every day. CoCounsel works alongside you, ready to perform sophisticated research, analyze dense and voluminous information, and produce a variety of content—in minutes. With CoCounsel, for the first time, you can delegate complex work to AI and trust the results. Today, CoCounsel lives within our law firm and corporate legal solutions, including Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel and Practical Law Dynamic with CoCounsel. Checkpoint Edge with CoCounsel, our first generative AI product for tax professionals, is in beta, with CoCounsel Audit and CoCounsel Advisory on their way. Early work is beginning on CoCounsel Fraud Detection and CoCounsel Investigators for risk & fraud professionals. And we’ve begun integrating with customers’ most-used third-party programs, such as Microsoft 365 and database management solutions, with Microsoft Word, Outlook, and SharePoint integrations in beta.  CoCounsel: The GenAI for professionals Learn more >  Your future GenAI colleague is already on the way  Today’s CoCounsel is just the beginning. Our vision for this transformative product is guided by the principle of “less is more” when it comes to solving problems with technology. That’s why we’re developing a single, simple way to tap into all Thomson Reuters GenAI capabilities. So even as we build more CoCounsel skills and more third-party integrations that you can use in more places, the experience for you will become less and less complex.  Over time, today’s separate products, which now include CoCounsel, will be simultaneously accessible through one CoCounsel chat interface. You’ll simply tell the GenAI assistant what you need to accomplish, and it will remember the overall context of the work and draw from its vast, common “pool” of capabilities across products to get the job done. The experience for you will be a single, ongoing “conversation” with an intelligent, proactive assistant—CoCounsel. The result? More time for you to do the strategic work machines can’t do, so you can better serve your clients, increase your competitive edge, and grow your business.  The most important for a solution professionals can count on—and what we mean by “professional-grade”—is that it addresses concerns regarding the safe and responsible use of GenAI in your work. CoCounsel is rooted in our market-leading, verified databases of content, understands professional standards, and can deliver reliable results at superhuman speed. And most important, it’s encrypted end-to-end, so your data—and your customers’—remains private and secure.  This is professional-grade generative AI.   The skill you’ve been waiting for—CoCounsel Drafting   This summer, CoCounsel Drafting will join CoCounsel’s broad set of skills, enabling you to create documents seamlessly and efficiently, by uniting Thomson Reuters content, your content and expertise, and the power of GenAI within Microsoft Word.  At launch, CoCounsel Drafting will assist legal professionals, connecting Practical Law Dynamic with CoCounsel, soon followed by a full roadmap of capabilities supporting litigation needs, with connection to Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel.  Revolutionize drafting with generative AI Draft faster than ever before with CoCounsel Drafting from Thomson Reuters – built on the content you know and trust. Lock in promotional pricing today CoCounsel Drafting will solve the problem of wondering where to start, by connecting to your content, finding relevant past work, and letting you validate and select the right document for the task at hand. The next difficult part of drafting is review and negotiation, and CoCounsel Drafting will be there to help you understand how a redlined document deviates from a standard, then map those changes against a playbook, flagging risks, identifying key missing language, and providing suggestions for alternatives. Finally, CoCounsel Drafting will check for common errors, missing definitions, numeration issues … all the last-step work that must happen before you get your document out the door. The professional landscape is evolving, fast, and those who win in the end will choose the right partner for their ongoing GenAI journey. Thomson Reuters CoCounsel is already leading the way, but even more importantly, we have a concrete, long-term vision we’re uniquely equipped to deliver on, to deliver ever-simpler experiences and ever-increasing benefits.Get going on your GenAI journey. Watch our webinar about today’s CoCounsel and our vision for this transformative product. Watch on-demand webcast >   Never miss an update on AI for your work.

From the arrival of the telephone to online banking and mobile payments, many waves of transformation have swept through the banking, insurance and finance industries.

But AI – and generative AI, in particular – promises to be the most transformational of them all.


If you’re only familiar with tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney that generate words and images, then you probably think they are very cool but might not quite grasp how they will change the world – or even your job!

But the truth is they are just the tip of a technological iceberg that will automate many routine tasks, streamline internal business processes and augment the way we work on a daily basis. According to an Accenture report, banking and insurance are the two industries set to be the most heavily impacted.

So, if you’re in the money game, read on to find out how your job could soon change, as well as learn about some of the broader changes this could mean for society.

 What Is GenAI And Why Is It So Important For Finance?
The term “generative AI” (GenAI) refers to tools powered by algorithms that can create new content based on existing data. ChatGPT may have taken the world by storm with its ability to write anything from prose and poetry to complex computer code, but its potential uses go far beyond.
Of particular relevance to banking and finance professionals is its ability to interpret data, from simple statistics to vast spreadsheets filled with huge amounts of real-time transactional information.

Rather than presenting information as complex graphs or charts that then have to be interpreted, AI can quickly highlight what is important and what is just noise that can be ignored. Importantly, these interpretations can be personalized depending on the role of the person they’re intended for.

This means professionals will spend less time on routine information-based tasks and more time making decisions and strategizing, as well as on face-to-face business. One survey found that 75 percent of junior financial services workers believe up to a quarter of their workload could be automated by AI.
So here’s a rundown of how generative AI will be integrated across specific tasks and responsibilities that are critical to keeping the financial world ticking!
How Will Generative AI Change Finance Work?
Generative AI tools will streamline transaction processing by automating many of the routine tasks such as data entry, validation and reconciliation. As GenAI systems become more powerful and accurate, this will mean banks and other financial institutions can offer faster, more reliable and perhaps even cheaper services to their clients.
All financial services institutions dedicate significant resources to detecting and preventing fraud. This involves analyzing potentially millions of transactions and flagging those with specific characteristics that indicate fraud. GenAI can do this far more quickly than any human and can also report results in a way that makes it simple for a human risk assessor to step in and understand why a particular transaction could be suspicious.
Managing investments is another important element of financial services, and generative AI algorithms can assist with analyzing markets, assessing the performance of companies and other assets, identifying trends and evaluating the effectiveness of investment strategies. Investment managers can then spend more face-to-face time with their clients, getting a better understanding of their needs and requirements.
Insurance underwriting is likely to be revolutionized by generative AI, which is able to understand and interpret information around risk, providing more detailed and accurate assessments that will help underwriters make more informed decisions. It can also be used to generate synthetic data, which follows the patterns and rules of real-world data, to fill holes when there is not enough real-world data available.
For those working on the regulation and compliance side of financial services, generative AI will help with analyzing and interpreting complex regulatory texts and legal documents. This means banks and insurers will more quickly identify risks of costly and damaging breaches.
Customer services will also be heavily impacted by the GenAI revolution. We may have found chatbots and automated customer service systems frustrating in the past. But a new generation of ChatGPT-like chatbots, powered by large language models (LLMs), will answer many questions more quickly and efficiently than human operators, improving customer satisfaction and retention rates. Rather than meaning human customer service agents are redundant, they will have more time for complex and sensitive work.
The Future Role Of Financial Professionals
As generative AI increasingly transforms information-based work across the finance industry, the role of finance professionals in society will shift, too.
The traditional view of the highly pressured analyst working late into the night, hunched over a monitor and interpreting charts and statistics, will hopefully become a thing of the past.
Many will find that unique human abilities, such as communication, interpersonal skills, strategic decision-making and teambuilding, will become increasingly important to their career progression.
The time saved by automating routine tasks can instead be used to build firmer relationships with clients and colleagues. Additionally, there will be more chances to pursue ongoing learning and skills development, creating professionals capable of adapting to the changing nature of their business.
This is a change that everyone, not just those in financial services, will have to prepare for. Those who embrace it now – in the relatively early years of the AI revolution – will set themselves up for more fulfilling and rewarding careers.

<p>The Department of Teacher Education, Section for English and Foreign Languages, offers a full-time, 3-year position as a Ph.D. candidate to take part in the project “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” in cooperation with<a href=""https://www.ntnu.no/ilu/forskning/nted-digit/nted"" target=""_blank""> the research group on technology and learning in education: NTED-DIGIT</a>. The project leaders are <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tom.nurmi"" target=""_blank"">Associate Professor Tom Nurmi</a>, <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fredrik.rokenes"">Associate Professor Fredrik Mørk Røkenes</a>,  and <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/han.han"" target=""_blank"">Postdoctoral Researcher Han Han</a>.</p>

<p>Although AI has the potential to be a tool in climate modeling and remediation efforts, its extractive resource and supply chain costs, e-waste pathways, and carbon footprint actively contribute to pollution and global warming. This project examines how language education can be a site of critical information literacy around environmental climate research and the cost/benefits of AI technologies. The “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” project explores how AI ed-tech (e.g., text-to-image generators DALL-E/MidJourney) influences students’ epistemic beliefs about environmental climate research and (mis)information in English in the school while also investigating the pedagogical potential of current trends in AI-climate-related natural sciences and humanities projects (e.g., biodiversity monitoring, pollution detection, AI in eco-literature, etc.).  </p>

<p>For a position as a Ph.D. candidate, the goal is to complete a doctoral education and obtain a doctoral degree. The Ph.D. candidate will be affiliated with the research group New Technologies and Educational Design (NTED-DIGIT) and connected to the group’s research activities (seminars, workshops, conferences, etc.). NTED-DIGIT’s main objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>develop new knowledge about emerging technologies, formative design, and learning processes at all levels of education.</li>
	<li>investigate the use of information and communications technology for teaching and learning using diverse methodological approaches.</li>
	<li>explore the development of teachers’ professional digital competence across subject disciplines and educational contexts.</li>
	<li>identify the impact of digitalization on processes related to teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research to explore AI’s influence on perspectives about controversial scientific topics, such as environmental climate research, which is an emerging area of research in language education that presents challenges and opportunities for students’ epistemic beliefs. The use of generative AI tools to generate and influence online information and manipulate perceptions is expanding, especially in English, thus increasing the importance of developing students’ critical literacy in language education.  The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research about how (mis)information in environmental climate research and artificial intelligence (AI) in language education in different language education contexts, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school and teacher education. The candidate should pursue practices with emerging AI-powered technologies (for instance, popular science texts and resources about climate research influenced by content creation tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E/MidJourney) and study how student knowledge is relevant to the design of language teaching. This research will contribute to the discourse of environmental humanities, language education, and AI technologies in education.</p>

Moreover, 43% of CEOs said they will use gen AI to inform strategic decisions. Companies worldwide are recognizing the benefits of gen AI and its crucial role in their success. This is driving a new era of work, productivity and opportunities across industries. AI is projected to enhance human productivity and unlock an astounding $16 trillion (https://apo-opa.co/4c8KytI) in value by 2030. In perspective, the fifth largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 was about $3.7 trillion. When combined with automation technology, gen AI can help clients improve interactions with customers and partners, as well as boost operational efficiency and productivity.  Slow but steady AI adoption in AfricaThis is not just a global phenomenon; half of the African CEOs surveyed in our IBM report (https://apo-opa.co/3yOCZdH) expect to realise significant value from advanced AI and analytics. However, adopting AI is not without its obstacles. Many businesses on the continent and beyond are grappling with a multitude of challenges. Globally, 82% of IT professionals say IT complexity is impeding success in deploying AI, while 55% of business leaders (https://apo-opa.co/3yLNA93) lack key information regarding their technology spending decisions. In Africa, many organizations face barriers such as costs, market and regulatory factors, workforce readiness, infrastructure, skills gap, ethics and governance. Become an AI-first organization to stay aheadTo overcome these challenges, organizations must move to an AI-first approach, where AI is integrated into their business strategy across the lifecycle. Being AI-first enables businesses to be value-creators rather than solely value users. Companies that will lead their respective industries for the next decade or two will be the ones that decide to be AI-first. That is why we launched watsonx (https://apo-opa.co/4catrIm) in 2023 to develop trusted AI and drive innovation for organizations in every sector or industry. Building an open-source AI community is a core part of our AI strategy. At our recent THINK conference, we further enhanced watsonx’s data and automation capabilities to make it more open, cost-effective, and flexible for businesses.  We achieved this by releasing a family of IBM Granite code models to the open-source community. We launched InstructLab (https://apo-opa.co/4catsfo) with Red Hat, to enhance large language models and open the doors for those with minimal machine learning experience to contribute. We also announced IBM Concert (https://apo-opa.co/4cattQu) that uses AI-powered automation to help businesses to discover gaps, prioritize insights, reduce complexity and streamline operations for more innovation and cost-effectiveness.Putting IBM AI solutions and watsonx to work across industriesSince the launch of watsonx, we have over 700 client pilots running and managing over 1,200 AI models globally. We have also increased the accessibility of watsonx by making it available (https://apo-opa.co/3XbtlvD) on AWS Marketplace, reaching 92 countries worldwide, including 18 in Africa. To name a few examples, we are leveraging watsonx’s geospatial foundation model built from NASA’s satellite data to ensure climate resilience with the Government of Kenya (https://apo-opa.co/4c76YvI) watsonx is enabling local scientists to track and visualize tree-planting activities to assist the government’s goal of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. Working with Neostream Technology, an IBM business partner based in Kenya, we successfully deployed and integrated IBM Instana with M-GAS – a premium provider of liquefied petroleum gas in the country. The deployment of Instana has provided real-time monitoring and visibility. This has empowered M-GAS to track critical business applications with granular application-level insights. This has empowered M-GAS to address issues across all layers of their technology stack that previously could not be delivered by traditional monitoring tools. Lastly, Instana’s intuitive interfaces and customizable dashboards have offered rapid issue identification and resolution, fostering team collaboration, minimizing downtime, and enabling M-GAS to intervene proactively to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to their customers.In the Middle East, we partnered with the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority to launch an open-source Arabic Large Language Model, ALLaM on watsonx (https://apo-opa.co/4catuUy).  This has enabled the deployment of Arabic gen AI models, which opens the possibility of building AI models for Africa using the continent’s rich and diverse languages. Globally, working with Transport for London (https://apo-opa.co/3XebtAe), we deployed IBM Maximo to assist in managing the day-to-day maintenance efforts for more than 10,000 internal technicians within the London Underground. Above ground, the software enables the tracking, support and oversight of numerous contractors – helping extend existing equipment’s life and keeping commuters happy.Across the world, organizations are leveraging IBM’s AI business solutions to solve business challenges. Their use cases range from banking and financial services, energy, telecommunications, climate change and sustainability, customer services and entertainment to name a few.The right partnerships and governance are keyThe adoption of gen AI is accelerating across enterprises as organizations aim to gain a competitive edge and unlock new opportunities. To achieve this, organizations need to have a robust AI strategy and the right level of investment. They also need to establish and implement clear and consistent standards or guardrails concerning the utilisation of AI across all strategic focus areas. Most importantly, they need the right partner who understands the overall business objective and how to overcome barriers preventing AI adoption. Such collaborative partnerships are critical for developing robust data and AI strategies, filling the skills gaps, and guiding the organizational change necessary for successful AI adoption.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of GITEX Africa.Media filesDownload logoThis Press Release has been issued by APO.

Here’s how job seekers can adaptJun 6, 2024AI skills are becoming increasingly important for jobs.Image: Unsplash/Nicole WolfAndrea WilligeSenior Writer, Forum AgendaShare:Our ImpactWhat's the World Economic Forum doing to accelerate action on Jobs and the Future of Work?Crowdsource InnovationGet involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scaleThis article is part of: Centre for the New Economy and SocietyAI skills could soon rival experience when employers select job candidates.Research from Microsoft, LinkedIn and PwC underlines how quickly AI is changing profiles and suggests how job seekers need to adapt to succeed.The World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance and Education 4.0 framework focus on deploying AI effectively and responsibly and ensuring that education systems provide the next generation of workers with AI skills training.AI aptitude could soon rival experience when choosing between job candidates. This is according to a new international study by Microsoft and LinkedIn on labour and recruitment trends due to the rise of generative AI. The research also predicts the rise of AI super users as the labour market – which has already undergone significant change in recent years – will shift again. The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report draws on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, hiring trends from LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 productivity data and research with Fortune 500 companies.AI is becoming the rule rather than the exception in the workplace. Image: Microsoft, LinkedInGenerative AI could give job candidates an edgeThe research reveals that three-quarters of people surveyed use generative AI at work, with the majority (78%) bringing their own AI tools into the workplace, especially in small and medium-sized businesses. AI emerges as a tool to help people deal with an increased pace and volume of work that more than two-thirds of respondents struggle with (68%), helping them offload menial tasks. However, many of those drawing on AI at work fear that doing so might make them look replaceable (53%) and worry that AI could replace their jobs (45%).But it looks like the opposite could be the case.AI skills could make or break a job candidate’s chances to clinch a role.  Image: Microsoft, LinkedInOver the past eight years, hiring for technical AI roles was up 323%, and businesses are now turning to non-technical talent with the skills to apply generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. Two-thirds of business leaders surveyed say they wouldn’t hire a candidate without AI skills. Nearly three-quarters said they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. AI jobs have been growing rapidly since the early 2010s.  Image: PwCAI specialist skills command a premiumThis trend is consistent with PwC’s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer, which found that jobs requiring AI specialist skills are growing 3.5 times faster than all jobs combined. The exponential need for AI-qualified staff has been on an upward trajectory since 2016 – well before the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI models. Moreover, PwC’s analysis of half a billion job ads from 15 countries shows that, on average, AI specialist jobs command up to a 25% premium in pay. While technologists see some of the highest wage premiums, AI skills also pay dividends for professionals such as lawyers, sales and marketing managers, and accountants. This further underlines that AI skills are needed across roles and industries. The top three occupations that have added AI to their skills and aptitudes on LinkedIn are creatives: content writers, graphic designers and marketing managers. Following hot on their heels are entrepreneurs and business professionals, along with the web and software developers you might more naturally expect to find on the list.Roles requiring AI skills will command a wage premium. Image: PwCThe rise of the AI super user Workers clearly understand the role of AI for advancing their career prospects. More than three-quarters of people surveyed for Microsoft and LinkedIn’s 2024 Work Trend Index felt that AI skills will be necessary for staying competitive in the job market. They also view AI knowledge as a way to get promoted faster (69%) and broaden their job opportunities (79%). And people are acting on it: attendance of LinkedIn Learning courses on AI for non-technical professionals has increased 160% in the past six months. Have you read?How to build the skills needed for the age of AIWhy we must bridge the skills gap to harness the power of AIThis is the one skill we all need in the age of AIThe research predicts that AI upskilling – whether through formal learning or simply by using AI tools in the workplace – may lead to the rise of ‘AI power users’.Power users are those who are ahead of the curve in terms of their AI use. They use it several times a week at work, benefitting from making their workload more manageable, boosting their creativity or helping them focus on the most important work. It also makes them feel more motivated and enjoy work more.Workers are upskilling to add AI to their repertoire as employers make AI skills a recruitment priority across sectors and roles.  Image: Microsoft, LinkedInHow to become an AI power user? If the research findings are anything to go by, then becoming an AI power user is the way to go to further career progression. So, what are the habits that mark out a power user? According to the 2024 Work Trend Index, it’s some of the following:Experiment with different ways of using AI: power users are more than two-thirds more likely than other survey respondents to do so.Always ask yourself, “How can AI help?”: power users are nearly 50% more likely to pause to explore what AI could contribute before tackling a new task, to keep trying if they don’t get the perfect response the first time (+30%), for example, by researching new prompts (+56%).‘Bookend’ your working day with AI: 9 in 10 power users use AI tools to start their day and get set up for the next day.Redesign your ways of working with AI and save time: power users are much more likely than other respondents to use AI for a wide range of tasks, including catching up on meetings, analyzing information, designing visual content, brainstorming ideas and even interacting with customers.Redesign business processes with AI: power users don’t just stop at reorganizing their own ways of working; they are also 66% more likely to redesign entire business processes and workflows in the organization using AI tools.AI power users are emerging. Image: Microsoft, LinkedInGetting business and education ready for the AI futureWith PwC finding that skillsets for what it terms ‘AI-exposed occupations’ are changing 25% faster than in roles where AI is less relevant, adopting some, if not all, of these habits could dramatically improve people’s future career development.However, the findings also mean that organizations and educational systems must do major work to prepare the current workforce and future generations for an AI-driven world of work. As part of its mission to build more resilient, productive, equitable and human-centric workplaces, the World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance focuses on deploying AI effectively and responsibly. The Education 4.0 framework aims to ensure education and training systems teach AI skills and leverage AI for better learning.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on this topicSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

	A total of 36 percent of U.K. citizens, or 18 million people between the ages of 16 and 75, have used a generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini or Midjourney, according to new research from advisory and consulting firm Deloitte. That is up from 26 percent recorded in 2023, its Digital Consumer Trends 2024 survey of 4,150 U.K. adults aged 16-75 found.

	“Just over a third (36 percent) of generative AI users use it once a week or daily. This is equivalent to 13 percent of all people in the U.K.,” the firm highlighted in the report. “Four percent of all people in the U.K. claim to use generative AI daily (versus 3 percent in 2023). Two in five (41 percent) of generative AI users are extremely infrequent users, at less often than once per month.”

	And 26 percent of respondents only tried it once or twice. “They may have experimented but seen little utility in the technology,” Deloitte highlighted.

	The number of Brits who have used generative AI at work is up 66 percent to seven million from four million last year, according to the research. “Given that many organizations still lack an official stance on use and/or a governance structure, many of these employees may have used GenAI outside of the purview of their management,” Deloitte noted.



	What are the top usage cases at work? Generating ideas (44 percent) and searching (41 percent) are the most common applications. The latter sees people “looking up information” using generative AI. “This is likely concerning given its propensity to ‘hallucinate,’ which is a function of being a probability engine rather than a knowledge model,” Deloitte warned. “Hallucinating” refers to generative AI producing mistakes.

	“A subset of consumers remain underinformed about how generative AI works and its drawbacks,” Deloitte highlighted. “While 25 percent of those who are aware of GenAI think it is always correct, an even greater 36 percent of users think it is always correct.” Concluded the firm: “A robust governance structure and employee training are important to mitigate these risks.”

	Warned Paul Lee, partner and head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Deloitte: “While the most popular uses tend to be generating ideas and looking up information, these may not be optimal applications of GenAI, given known issues such as hallucination. Employers need to step up and invest in tools and governance to better support their staff in using this technology.”

	









	Added Costi Perricos, partner and global generative AI lead at Deloitte: “Whether organizations have supportive or strict policies on the use of generative AI, it is clear that improving business AI fluency is vital.”

AGI has recorded the highest rise; this year, 65% of respondents revealed they use AGI in at least one business function, up from 33% last year.AGI is a subset of AI capable of generating content such as images, text and video in response to prompts, utilizing deep learning from large language models (LLMs). OpenAI’s ChatGPT was the first AGI model to burst onto the scene, and since then, the sector has skyrocketed.McKinsey found that businesses are increasingly using AI in multiple business functions, with 50% using it in two functions while 27% are using it in at least three.Businesses prioritize AGI applications in the functions where they can create the most value, the study found. This is often in customer-facing applications where content and data are critical. It found marketing and sales to be the most impacted, with 34% of the respondents reporting AGI use in the sector. Product and service development was second at 23%, with 17% of businesses using it in IT.Critically, AGI is creating value. The sharp rise in the adoption of the technology has sparked questions on whether the vast investment would yield any returns for deployers.According to the study, 53% of businesses that integrated AGI in marketing and sales recorded an increase in revenue—for one in five businesses, the growth was over 6%. Human resources had the lowest revenue increase at 33%.Additionally, technology cuts costs for businesses, with HR being the most impacted—one in six companies using AGI in software engineering slash costs by up to 20%.With the rising adoption of AGI, concerns about job losses are increasing daily. While projections of millions of job losses by companies like Goldman Sachs (NASDAQ: GS) have been debunked, industry bodies and regulators warn that the technology could disrupt employment dynamics globally.One study in Australia found that AGI developers have largely ignored the interests of workers and their employers. The study debunked claims that workers oppose AI, stating, “In fact, they see opportunities for improving many parts of their work, especially around reducing the burden of menial, repetitive tasks.”However, the expertise and experience that these workers can offer in the AI development process has largely been ignored.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data. Check out CoinGeek’s coverage on this emerging tech to learn more why Enterprise blockchain will be the backbone of AI.Watch: AI is for ‘augmenting’ not replacing the workforce width=""562"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"">New to blockchain?

See our ethics statement.Creatives are fearful of how Adobe’s adoption of generative AI will impact their privacy and rights over their work. Illustration by Haein Jeong / The VergeA recent notification from Adobe about a terms of service update caused outrage online once many people — forced to accept the new terms for continued access to its apps and services — interpreted it to mean Adobe was permitting itself free rein to access and use their work to train AI models.  Specifically, the notification said Adobe had “clarified that we may access your content through both automated and manual methods” within its TOS, directing users to a section that says “techniques such as machine learning” may be used to analyze content to improve services, software, and user experiences. The update went viral after creatives took Adobe’s vague language to mean that it would use their work to train Firefly — the company’s generative AI model — or access sensitive projects that might be under NDA.

Adobe has now published a blog to address those concerns and assure its users that this isn’t the case. “Our commitments to our customers have not changed,” Adobe said in its statement, affirming that the company doesn’t train Firefly on customer content or assume ownership of a customer’s work. “Firefly generative AI models are trained on a dataset of licensed content, such as Adobe Stock, and public domain content where copyright has expired.”A before and after comparison of the TOS update (which you can see below) shows that very little about the policy has actually changed. The inclusion of “machine learning,” particularly, while vague, isn’t new and has been present in the TOS for years. One explanation for this is that variations of AI technology that pre-date Firefly have long been used in tools like Photoshop’s Content-Aware Fill and Lightroom’s Select Subject. Confusingly, however, the updated language within the TOS has actually been live since February, with Adobe having only recently notified users of the change.Here’s a comparison that displays (in pink) what was actually changed within Adobe’s TOS back on February 17th. Image: AdobeAdobe’s chief product officer, Scott Belsky, acknowledged on X that the wording within the notification is “unclear” and said the company’s legal team was working to address concerns about the vague language within the policy. “Adobe has had something like this in TOS for over a decade,” said Belsky. “But trust and transparency couldn’t be more crucial these days.”Adobe has developed something of an “image” problem as it’s grown over the years, especially among individual creatives who no longer feel the company has their best interests at heart. It’s been criticized for dropping its one-time purchase model in favor of recurring subscriptions and accused of creating a monopoly over the creative software industry — which concerned regulators enough to effectively force the company to abandon its attempt to acquire Figma last year. While similar software is available from other brands like Affinity, Adobe’s is typically considered the “industry standard” and difficult to avoid using in professional environments.RelatedZoom rewrites its policies to make clear that your videos aren’t used to train AI toolsNotably, Adobe has also developed a mountain of generative AI tools and services since introducing its own Firefly model in March 2023, enthusiastically promoting them as a means for people with limited creative experience to quickly produce content at scale. I imagine that sounds very attractive to businesses, but not so much to creative professionals who are anxious about their job security. It’s easy to see why so many feel betrayed by the company, especially when Adobe seemingly struggles to enforce the generative AI policies it introduced to protect them.That breakdown of trust brings us here. While this viral drama surrounding Adobe’s TOS “update” may blow over, hoards of creatives are watching the company like a hawk. Adobe will have to find an effective way to address those trust issues if it wants independent creators, who have come to expect the worst from the company, to see it as the friend it claims to be rather than a foe.Comments12 Comments / 12 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe next next thing in AI and AR | The Vergecast

        If You’re Job Hunting And Using Generative AI, This Is What You Should And Shouldn't Do
    
        AI generated / Worldcrunch
    SPONSORED CONTENTJOBBIOKirstie McDermottJune 06, 2024A new study shows that those using AI more often are seeing greater productivity gains than those who haven’t yet adopted it.ChatGPT, for example, can be used for translations and idea generation as it can draft and edit emails, reports and presentations. It can also assist with managing your calendar by setting reminders, and help to organize tasks to help you stay on top of your schedule and deadlines.It has even added a new function where you can plug in documents and spreadsheets to make yourself yet more efficient.New data from Asana and Anthropic has found that 66% of workers using generative AI report improved productivity, with 88% of those using it every day saying it has made them more productive.3 global roles hiring right nowSoftware Developer, Oracle, SeattleIT Security Manager - R&D (H/F), Atos, ÉchirollesSoftware Engineer, Associate, BlackRock, EdinburghThose who use generative AI for nine or more use cases are twice as likely to report productivity gains compared to those who use AI in only two or fewer use cases.One area that is seeing rapid adoption of generative AI technologies is hiring. Not only did a recent IBM survey of more than 8,500 global IT professionals find that 42% of companies are using AI screening ""to improve recruiting and human resources"", but applicants themselves are also making use of the technology.This makes sense, according to recruitment professional Owen Murray, founder and CEO of urhired.ie. “Sending a generic CV to multiple positions will not work,” he states. “Tailoring your CV for every position is essential to increase your application-to-interview conversion rate.”This is a great use case for generative AI as it can streamline this process. Copy the job description into your tool of choice, and then prompt it to identify keywords. Next, upload your resume, and ask it to edit this based on the keywords for the role.By doing this you’ll instantly produce a more optimized document which will help you get through companies’ screening processes––and hopefully lead to an interview.That’s a definite do, but what else should you be doing, and what should you definitely avoid?Essential dos and don’tsSo while you can definitely use AI tools to help you create individualized resumes and cover letters for each job you apply for, you should make sure that you review carefully before sending. This is because AI-generated content can sometimes contain errors, inaccuracies, or generic statements that may not reflect your unique qualifications and personality.You can also use generative AI as a job hunting assistant. It can locate relevant job opportunities by analyzing job boards, company websites, and social media platforms. It can suggest roles that match your skills, experiences, and career goals too.What you should then avoid is use of AI tools to blanket-apply for a huge range of jobs, simply because it is easy to do. Hiring managers and HR professionals are wise to this now, and will likely send your application into the trash if they think it reads like an AI wrote it.While it may be tempting, avoid using AI to fabricate or exaggerate your skills, experiences, or qualifications. Misrepresenting yourself may lead to an interview, but once you’re in the seat, you won’t have real life examples and case studies to back this up.Another area you can make use of generative AI’s skills is for interview preparation. AI can simulate job interviews, allowing applicants to practice and improve their responses. AI chatbots can ask common interview questions, provide feedback on answers, and even suggest improvements. Done right, this can help you build confidence and prepare for a host of interview scenarios.Accelerate your job hunt today by searching thousands of open roles on the Worldcrunch Job BoardWorldcrunchJobbio 1WorldcrunchJobbio 1SPONSORED CONTENTJOBBIO","[{'@type': 'Person', 'description': '', 'identifier': '20479170', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://worldcrunch.com/res/avatars/default'}, 'name': 'Worldcrunch', 'url': 'https://worldcrunch.com/u/anaworldcrunch'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'description': '', 'identifier': '26618464', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://worldcrunch.com/res/avatars/default'}, 'name': 'Jobbio 1', 'url': 'https://worldcrunch.com/u/jobbio1'}]",2024-07-08T09:37:24Z,2024-06-06T15:46:47Z,"If You’re Job Hunting And Using Generative AI, This Is What You Should And Shouldn't Do","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 600, 'url': 'https://worldcrunch.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52424518&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C31%2C0%2C32', 'width': 1200}","{'@id': 'https://worldcrunch.com/sponsored/job-hunting-using-ai-advice', '@type': 'WebPage'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://worldcrunch.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzUxOTk3Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjUzNjkyN30.4LhON3Od1II-5EUl6Kr3fuJaVnJ2z1G99hKUFdqKB5E/image.png?width=210'}, 'name': 'Worldcrunch'}",Sponsored,,,,,,,,,,,,https://worldcrunch.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52424518&amp;width=210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It should be the first draft of a first draft that you then shape and mold into your own voice and shows your dedication to the role.""HR business partner Daniel Space, aka DanFromHR, said that in his experience from an employers' side, AI can be used as a tool to help applications, resumes and cover letters, as it ""creates content so much faster and it's far easier to react and adjust something than to create it from scratch"".It can also help people who struggle at articulating their achievements to ""tailor and focus their message,"" he said. But he warned not to ""overuse it or lean on it too much"".While employers are not, in his experience, ""penalizing"" applicants who use AI, they will ""favor candidates that ensure it's personalized to the individual"" rather than copy-pasting a ChatGPT prompt.""The purpose of a resume is to stand out, but if 100 people all used ChatGPT to write a resume to the same job description, you are again just one more qualified person among 100,"" he argued.""The best way to view it as a tool. Use it to brainstorm, use it to give you a starting ground, but make sure you edit, update and personalize it,"" he said.And Justin Marcus, CEO of www.bigfourtalent.com, asked: ""As long as it is honest and not a writing position they are applying for, why penalize someone for using a service that helps them better articulate their background?""He said: ""The better route would be to use AI to help you better articulate sections of your resume at a time, then proof it and make sure it sounds more human.""According to a survey by Statista, approximately 70 percent of those companies surveyed claim to use AI in business operations as of 2024.At the same time, 63 percent of respondents claimed to use it in both internal and external communications, and just under half used it in human resources and training.",,,,Should you use AI for job applications?,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'The 7 Red Flags To Look Out For On A Job Ad, According To Business Experts', 'description': ""Applying for jobs requires a tremendous amount of time and effort, so it's crucial to know which openings are worth the investment.

As our attention and resources focus on generative AI, (gen AI) one question that keeps coming up for me is how companies can use gen AI to address a persistent pain point, new hire on-boarding. Nearly every company, regardless of size or industry has some process for new hire on-boarding, but Gallup research finds only 12% of new employees strongly agree their organization does a great job on-boarding new hires. That’s 88% who are feeling let down just days or weeks into their new job.


Designing a compelling new hire on-boarding experience can lead to greater employee engagement and satisfaction. Gallup research finds employees who state they have an exceptional new hire on-boarding experience are 3.3 times as likely to strongly agree their job is as good or better than expected.

The result of a poorly conceived on-boarding experience can lead to employee attrition. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), employee turnover can be as much as 50% in the first four months for hourly workers and 50% in the first 18 months for senior external hires.

PROMOTED
As I think about these research findings, I see an opportunity to re-design new hire orientation to include generative AI, (genAI.) For a growing number of organizations, the new hiring imperative is being literate in using gen AI in one’s job. The 2024 Work Trend Index from Microsoft and LinkedIn finds 77% of leaders say new hires will get greater responsibilities due to their knowledge of how to effectively use gen AI in their job role. In addition, 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate who has gen AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. But given the continuing talent shortage do companies really have this choice?

Designing a new hire on-boarding process which incorporates gen AI provides an opportunity to enhance and personalize the on-boarding process. Employees can not only learn about the company culture and values but also how to activate gen AI in an employee’s workflow, ranging from text to image generation, assistance in creative ideation, and analyzing data. One of the immediate benefits of using gen AI in the on-boarding process is to personalize the on-boarding experience, so new hires see communication that is meaningful to them, whether they are Gen Z, Millennials, Veterans, or Working Moms. AI powered solutions are already happening with LinkedIn’s new AI powered tool where users can assess a fit for a new role in seconds or iSpring’s eLearning solution where AI supports quiz generation. According to iSpring’s recent research, most businesses prefer to do their staff training in-house and this means relying on mentors as subject matter experts. This presents an opportunity for AI to assist HR leaders in creating professional learning materials while saving on instructional design fees in the design process. Leveraging the power of gen AI can also support new hires by personalizing the communication and designing quizzes to identify skill gaps and assess knowledge.

Research by Brandon Hall Group finds organizations with a strong onboarding experience improve new hire retention by 82 percent and productivity by over 70 percent. But only 29% of new hires feel supported and prepared to excel in their jobs.

So how can you think about combining your need to re-design your new hire on-boarding experience with including gen AI to enhance this process? My suggestion is the RAPID model developed for training HR team members in AI. This is depicted below:

This framework starts with the business problem an HR team uncovers and then sets out to identify opportunities to address this business problem while also building gen AI literacy.
Recognize Urgency
HR leaders can start by identifying the problem they are solving for and then collecting data on this problem. In the case of re-designing new hire on-boarding, this can range from addressing a need for greater personalization in the on-boarding process to aligning this process to the needs and expectations of employees in key job roles. In addition, with the expansion of gen AI across organizations, this is also an opportunity to embed gen AI literacy training into the on-boarding experience.
Analyze Insights
Assess the results of your data collection. For example, as I wrote in 13 HR Jobs of the Future, ING collected data on the problem of engaging employees in what they called the pre-onboarding process, the time from accepting an offer to starting a new job. This time can stretch from weeks to months. Sander de Bruijn, Head of Global Employee Experience at ING, addressed this problem by re-vamping the pre-onboarding process to incorporate personalized communications for managers to send to new hires during this time, so they felt welcome even before they started their job.
Plan for AI Literacy
Before designing the new hire on-boarding program, your organization should conduct a comprehensive assessment of your AI readiness and the anticipated future AI needs that employees will need training on. This will guide your design process and ensure that using gen AI in this process will be relevant to the needs of your employees. Think of gen AI as a tool to improve the employee experience and not a replacement for your HR team members.
Identify Activation Plan
Embedding gen AI training into your new hire on-boarding program is only the first step. This training should go beyond what is gen AI and how to create prompts, to how to activate gen AI into employee workflows. This can start by showing new hires use cases for how to incorporate gen AI into creating first drafts of documents or using gen AI to practice having crucial conversations in preparation for a performance review.
Deploy New Solution
As you design the new hire on-boarding program, identifying key metrics will be critical to your success. The key metrics to consider can include fewer resignations in the first 6-18 months, greater speed to competence for new hires, greater satisfaction with the job, greater impact on the business goals and reduction in the amount of post on-boarding support needed for new hires. Interestingly, research from iSpring poses an interesting question, how can the re-design of new hire on-boarding favorably impact the employer brand?
While gen AI will help HR leaders with candidate outreach by performing targeted candidate searches and candidate engagement by personalizing relevant content to job seekers, embedding gen AI into the new hire on-boarding process provides HR leaders an opportunity to favorably impact their employer brand. Candidates should know once they accept an offer, they will be experiencing gen AI training starting on their first day of new hire on-boarding. A recent survey of full-time workers finds 98% want some type of training in gen AI funded by their employer.
While Conference Board research finds 56% of workers are using Gen AI at work with one in ten using gen AI daily, only 26% say their employer has a policy on effective use of gen AI with another 23% saying some policy of using gen AI is under development, but has not been approved yet. By embedding gen AI training into new hire on-boarding, companies can also incorporate gen AI policies in the on-boarding experience.
Building gen AI literacy training and showcasing ways to activate this into new hire on boarding is a powerful way workers can not only learn about the vision, values, and culture of the organization, but also build their gen AI skills. By embedding gen AI training in new hire on-boarding employers can use this as a vehicle for increasing attraction of new candidates and improving employee retention.

<p>Recent data from Indeed, the leading global matching and hiring platform, show that job opportunities utilising generative artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing. By the end of March, one in every 190 Singapore job postings are related to generative AI. The posting share has almost doubled over the past three months.</p>

<p>“Singapore also appears to have embraced these technologies faster than its global peers. The share of Singapore job postings mentioning GenAI is 4.3 times higher than the United States, 4.7 times higher than the United Kingdom and 6.5 times higher than Australia. It is early stages but Singapore may be establishing itself as a hub for GenAI expertise,” said <strong>Callam Pickering</strong>, APAC senior economist at Indeed.</p>

<em>The journalism industry <a href=""https://theconversation.com/saving-the-news-media-means-moving-beyond-the-benevolence-of-billionaires-222677"">has been under immense economic pressure</a> over the past two decades, so it makes sense that journalists have started experimenting with generative AI to boost their productivity.</em>

An Associated Press survey published in April 2024 asked journalists about the use of generative artificial intelligence in their work. <a href=""https://blog.ap.org/ap-survey-reveals-ais-impact-on-newsrooms"">Nearly 70% of those who responded</a> said they had used these tools to generate text, whether it was composing article drafts, crafting headlines or writing social media posts.

A May 2024 global survey conducted by the public relations firm Cision found the slice to be somewhat smaller – <a href=""https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/journalists-ai-cision-state-of-the-media-report-2024-facebook-tiktok-instagram/"">47% of journalists</a> said they’d used generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard in their work.

But does the adoption of the technology pose any moral questions? After all, this is a business where professional ethics and public trust are especially important – so much so that there are <a href=""https://ethics.journalism.wisc.edu"">fields of study</a> devoted to it.

Over the past few years, my colleagues and I at <a href=""https://www.umb.edu/ethics/"">UMass Boston’s Applied Ethics Center</a> have been researching the ethics of AI.

I think that if journalists are not careful about its deployment, the use of generative AI could undermine the integrity of their work.
<h4>How much time is really saved?</h4>
Let’s start with an obvious concern: AI tools are still unreliable.

Using them to research background for a story will often result in <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/technology/chatbots-hallucination-rates.html"">confident-sounding nonsense</a>. During a 2023 demo, Google’s chatbot, Bard, famously spit out <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/08/tech/google-ai-bard-demo-error/index.html"">the wrong answer</a> to a question about new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope.

It’s easy to imagine a journalist using the technology for background, only to end up with false information.

Therefore, journalists who use these tools for research will need to fact-check the outputs. The time spent doing that may offset any purported gains in productivity.

But to me, the more interesting questions have to do with using the technology to generate content. A reporter may have a good sense of what they want to compose, <a href=""https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/07/google-wants-you-to-let-its-ai-bot-help-you-write-news-articles/"">so they will ask an AI model to produce a first draft</a>.

This may be efficient, but it also turns reporters from writers into editors, thus fundamentally altering the nature of what they do.

Plus, there’s something to be said for struggling to write a first draft from scratch and figuring out, along the way, whether the original idea that inspired it has merit. That’s what I am doing right now as I write this piece. And I’m sad to report that I discarded quite a few of the original arguments I wanted to make, because as I tried to articulate them, I realised that they didn’t work.

In journalism, as in art, generative AI emphasises – indeed fetishises – <a href=""https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-dall-e-2-and-the-collapse-of-the-creative-process-196461"">the moment in which an idea is conceived</a>. It focuses on the original creative thought and relegates the tedious process of turning that thought into a finished product – whether it’s through outlining, writing or drawing – to a machine.

But the process of writing out a story is inseparable from the ideas that give rise to it. Ideas change and take shape as they are written out. They are not preexisting entities patiently floating around, perfectly formed, simply waiting to be translated into words and sentences.
<h4>AI’s undermining of a special relationship</h4>
To be fair, only a portion of the journalists in both surveys were using generative AI to compose drafts of articles. Instead, , such as writing newsletters, translating text, coming up with headlines or crafting social media posts.

Once journalists see that the AI is quite talented at writing – and it is getting <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/180395/ai-artifical-intelligence-writing-human-creativity"">better and better at it</a> – how many of them will resist the temptation?

The fundamental question here is whether journalism involves anything more than simply conveying information to the public.

Does journalism also entail a kind of relationship between writers and their readers?

I think it does.

When a reader regularly follows the analysis of someone writing about the Middle East or about Silicon Valley, it is because they trust that writer, because they like that writer’s voice, because they have come to appreciate that writer’s thought process.

Now if journalism involves that kind of relationship, does the use of AI undermine it? Would I want to read journalism created by what amounts to an anonymised aggregation of the internet any more than I would want to read a novel created by an AI or listen to music composed by one?
<h4>Undermine integrity</h4>
Or, stated differently, if I read a piece of journalism or a novel or listened to a musical piece, which I thought was created by a human being, only to find out that it was largely generated by an AI, wouldn’t my appreciation or trust of the piece change?

If the practice of journalism is based on having this kind of relationship with the public, the increased use of AI may well undermine the integrity of the practice, particularly at a time when the industry <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2023/10/24/americans-trust-in-media-plummets-to-historic-low-poll"">is already dealing with trust issues</a>.

Being a journalist is a noble calling that, at its best, <a href=""https://democracyfund.org/idea/how-we-know-journalism-is-good-for-democracy/"">helps sustain democratic institutions</a>. I assume that this nobility still matters to journalists. But most readers probably would not trust AI to uphold the social role that journalism plays.

AI does not care that “<a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-washington-post-introduces-its-new-slogan/"">democracy dies in darkness</a>”; it does not care about speaking truth to power.

Yes, those are cliches. But they are also widely held precepts that sustain the trade. Journalists neglect them at their peril.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

								Labor Department has ‘a leg up’ on artificial intelligence, new CAIO says							

								Though the agency isn’t pursuing a “big-bang approach” when it comes to AI, Mangala Kuppa says DOL is poised to scale those systems quickly.

A shout-out from the White House doesn’t happen to federal agencies every day, but the Department of Labor got a turn in March when it was lauded in a fact sheet for “leading by example” with its work on principles to mitigate artificial intelligence’s potential harms to employees. 
Mangala Kuppa, who took over as DOL’s chief AI officer this week after previously serving as its deputy CAIO, believes the agency has even more to be confident about when it comes to its work on the technology, possessing a “leg up” on scaling AI quickly.
In an interview with FedScoop, Kuppa pointed to DOL’s previous efforts to modernize internal operations and customer-facing services as part of the department’s journey to implement emerging technologies like AI. Having foundational building blocks and existing infrastructure, along with existing AI applications, has made it “easier” for the agency to scale up, she said. 
“It’s not a ‘big bang’ approach,” said Kuppa, who also serves as DOL’s chief technology officer. “Another aspect that we take very seriously in modernizing is [to] take this opportunity to not just update the technology, but also take this opportunity to re-engineer the business process to help the public.”

Kuppa pointed to an internal shared services initiative that designated the agency’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to be a “shared services provider for all Departmental IT services.”  That process, Kuppa said, has allowed the department to keep an inventory of all systems and technologies and understand where the legacy systems or opportunities for improvement might exist.
“Using that methodology, we’ve been looking at all high-risk systems, because maybe the technology is very legacy and outdated,” Kuppa said. “We’ve been using that methodology to start those modernization initiatives.”
By considering the age of the technology, the operations burden, security vulnerabilities, regulation compliance and other parameters, DOL came up with a methodology that scores each mission system to determine if it is a candidate for modernization. The agency then looks at the scores on a consistent basis and revises based on new information that becomes available.
These systems can be major: the DOL’s Employment and Training Administration, for example, which provides labor certifications when a company files for hiring an immigrant workforce, was scored for modernization.
“Being an immigrant, I wasn’t aware DOL had a hand in my immigration journey there,” Kuppa said.

The Technology Modernization Fund has played an “instrumental” role in the department “finding the resources to modernize,” Kuppa said.
She gave the example of using TMF funds to expedite temporary visa applications, which is expected to save 45 days of cycle time for processing labor certification applications.
According to a case study on the TMF site, that project contributed to $1.9 million in annual cost savings, and a key part of the innovation allowed the application forms to auto-populate with the previous year’s information.
“Usually all immigrants eventually start filing for permanent visa applications,” Kuppa said. “Again, you have to repeat the process of labor certification, and so we had two different systems not communicating with each other.”
For Kuppa, modernization is ultimately an exercise in reimagining where new technologies can ultimately be most helpful.

“We have great partnership, we work very closely with our programs and then we have these dialogues every day, in terms of the system’s development lifecycle,” she said. “And that’s how we approach modernization.”

The DOL’s publication of these Principles follows in the footsteps of the EEOC and the OFCCP’s recent guidance on AI in the workplace and mirrors, in significant respects, the letter and spirit of their pronouncements. 
While not “exhaustive,” the Principles” should be considered during the whole lifecycle of AI” from ”design to development, testing, training, deployment and use, oversight, and auditing.”  Although the DOL intends the Principles to apply to all business sectors, the guidance notes that not all Principles will apply to the same extent in every industry or workplace, and thus should be reviewed and customized based on organizational context and input from workers.
While not defined in the Principles, EO 14110 defines artificial intelligence as set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3): “A machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.  Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.” 
Good News and Bad News of AI
The DOL notes that implementation of AI in the workplace will create demand for workers to gain new skills and spur training to learn how to use AI in their day-to-day work. In addition, the guidance notes that AI will also continue creating new jobs, including those focused on the development, deployment, and human oversight of AI. 
As the guidance warns, however, AI-augmented work also poses risks to workers, including the loss of autonomy and direction over their work and a potential decline in job quality:  “The risks of AI for workers are greater if it undermines workers' rights, embeds bias and discrimination in decision-making processes, or makes consequential workplace decisions without transparency, human oversight and review.” Moreover, in its final dire prediction, the guidance notes that the use of workplace AI also risks displacing workers from their jobs.
The Principles  
The DOL posits the following Principles to employers to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks of its implementation:

Worker Involvement: Ensure workers, especially from minority groups, are not only informed about the use of AI but have “genuine input in the design, development, testing, training, use and oversight of AI systems” used in the workplace. 
 Ethical AI Development: Design and deploy AI systems to safeguard workers. This Principle can be understood to mean that AI systems should not be biased or create algorithmic modeling that may result in disparate treatment of protected individuals or otherwise harm workers.
  AI Governance and Oversight: Establish clear, communicated procedures and oversight for workplace AI.
 Transparent AI Use: Employers must openly communicate their use of AI to employees and applicants for employment. While the DOL does not elaborate on this Principle, employers should provide applicants and employees with notice on employment applications, company websites, and/or employee handbooks of the use of AI. 
 Protecting Workers' Rights: Ensure AI systems respect workers' rights. This may be read in conjunction with rights established under any applicable union or employment contracts as well as applicable law. 
 Empowering Workers with AI: Use AI to empower and enhance job quality for workers.  The AI tool or system should “assist,” “enable” and “complement,” work, rather than replace workers generally or negate human oversight.
 Supporting Workers Impacted by AI: Assist and train workers during AI-related job changes.
 Responsible Worker Data Use: Minimize data collected, used, or created by AI systems. Use of such data should be “only” to support “legitimate business aims” and handled and secured responsibly. 

Takeaways
The Principles are not enforceable regulatory mandates, but are likely to be considered by the DOL in investigatory endeavors in response to an applicant or employee complaint with regard to the development or deployment of AI in the workplace and certainly may come under consideration in negotiated collective bargaining, as both employee and union representatives will take particular note of these Principles as regulatory guideposts.

AI writing tools can aid in the creative process, identify grammatical and spelling errors, and ultimately enhance content development efforts. Using AI to aid in job applications is advantageous, provided the applicant is truthful about their qualifications, skills and employment history.”Todd Brown, director of people and culture, United Communications“On the one hand, AI tools can be helpful for streamlining the application process, ensuring resumes are formatted correctly and keywords are optimized. … However, what truly sets applicants apart is their unique voice and genuine enthusiasm. AI-generated content often lacks the personal touch that resonates with our hiring team. We value candidates who take the time to tailor their applications, showcasing their specific skills and experiences relevant to the role.""Sean Buck, senior vice president, JE Dunn Construction“The answer to that question lies in how it was used. If it was used in a way that adds additional context or information in a thoughtful way or shows some creativity on the applicant’s behalf, it is positive. If AI was used to generate information in lieu of taking the time and effort to be thoughtful in how you present yourself, it would be a red flag for us. At the end of the day, we are looking to hire people that are humble, hungry and smart. We have not run across a computer yet that fits that description.”Danielle Vezensky, HR Manager, Mechanical Resource Group“Professionals proficiently using AI to generate natural-sounding and well-organized content is a strength. However, applicants must also support the same level of clarity and context presented in their application with genuine knowledge and competency; if not, that’s a red flag you can’t ignore when hiring. Using AIto boost efficiency and clarity is now the norm, so we must become proficient at using AI asa tool rather than a crutch.”Matt Gerber, chief strategy officer, Provisions Group“Using AI in a job application can be a plus and a minus. On the positive side, if AI is used to enhance a resume or application truthfully, it can effectively communicate a candidate’s capabilities, making it easier for both automated systems and recruiters to understand their strengths. On the downside, the widespread use of AI will complicate the hiring process by creating a flood of overly optimized applications, making it harder for employers to sift through and find genuinely suitable candidates.”Laura Lustig, VP of Human Resources, Currax Pharmaceuticals“This can be a plus or minus, depending on how the applicant deploys the functionality. An applicant who utilizes AI to assist with creating a resume that is professional and showcases the applicant’s relevant experience is using the functionality wisely. Using AI to entirely compose a resume that is inconsistent with their experience or inaccurate is a poor practice. … AI tools need to be used appropriately and responsibly to ensure the outputs are genuine and honest.”Stacy Muth, chief of staff, S3 Recycling Solutions“I wouldn’t say it’d be a minus, but I don’t feel it’d be a plus. Here at S3 we like to get to know the real person we’re considering bringing on — that not only do they meet job requirements, but also that they’d be a good fit culture wise. I feel that AI would take away from that versus getting to know the person themselves.”Rob Lowe, executive managing director, Stream Realty Partners - Nashville“Plus. It’s critical that each member of our team have strong writing and communication skills; however, engaging in AI or other new technologies is an indication of an employee’s awareness and willingness to learn what’s next.” Mary Jo Innis, president & CEO, The R.O.W. Group“Using AI on a job application can be viewed both positively and negatively. On the positive side, it demonstrates that the applicant is tech-savvy and knows how to utilize various resources to enhance their application. However, on the negative side, it does not fully represent the applicant’s true self, and may come across as impersonal.” Vic Alexander, chief manager, KraftCPAs“The best answer is probably ‘both.’Technology is crucial in business, and it changes so fast now. We should use every resource available to do our jobs better and more efficiently. But we also need critical, independent thinkers who can make quick, smart decisions and effectively discuss complex information with clients. We want people on our team who can master all those skills.”Stephanie Richerson, partner and chief people officer, Puryear & Noonan CPAs""Could be both — but an overall plus for using recent technology and being efficient, both of which are imperative in the public accounting industry.""Rebecca Hill, director of operations, The Anderson Group Real Estate Services“Honestly, I understand that it might be the new way of life for everyone to use AI, but it’s a minus for us. We want to know someone’s open and honest statements and background, skills, accomplishments, in their own words.” Jack Brown, chief deputy register of deeds, Davidson County Register of Deeds“It would cut both ways. It shows a technological acuity that any employer would be short-sighted not to value. But it also would trigger immediate questions in our interview process about how the applicant thinks he or she would utilize AI in our office. There would be a fine line between technological savvy and over-reliance on something that would not provide our customers the level of service and results they require.”Kevin Murphy, COO, Vertek Solutions Inc.""It is a plus. As a technology company, we are focused on thinking outside the box, and AI helps us do that. As long as the application is accurate and truthful, I think AI can be a great resource.""Nicole Anderson, director, Employee Engagement; OMNIA Partners“Embracing AI on job applications demonstrates adaptability and forward-thinking, both of which are highly valued in our organization. Omnia Partners is committed to solving challenges in an industry that’s ripe for innovation, making AI implementation a definite plus.”Velaire Woolsey, chief of staff, Event Logistics Inc.“Usage of AI alone would not constitute as a plus or minus to the candidate. However, the way in which it was utilized can be telling of the candidate’s skill set. If information acquired from AI is copied and pasted into the application, it can reveal the candidates lack or originality, inattention to detail and more. Alternatively, if a candidate used it to enhance their message, that can be a positive skill that can be utilized in the workplace to enhance the company as well.”Chad Emmitt, business development manager, Covenant Constructors“It is a plus if his/her application was derived from their own ideas and thoughts and they used AI to make it better. The reason I say that is because No. 1, they care about producing the best work possible. And No. 2, they realize using the latest technology affords people/companies a competitive edge. Conversely, if the applicant relies too heavy on AI they risk losing authenticity and producing an inflated application that could create unrealistic expectations from the potential employer.”","{'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/bio/2501/Carol+Smith', 'image': 'http://media.bizj.us/view/img/1932061/smithcarolpinstripemug.jpg', 'name': 'Carol Smith', 'jobTitle': 'Research Director', 'worksFor': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Nashville Business Journal'}, 'description': ""Carol Smith compiles market research on Nashville companies, producing weekly industry lists and related content, as well as the year-end compilation, Book of Lists.

Its existence is not merely an offshoot of modern computing, but a dynamic and continuously evolving domain that stretches the boundaries of how machines interact with and process information.AI is recognized for its ability to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and perception. However, it is not a direct replication of human intellect. Instead, AI creates a unique paradigm where machines operate with a level of autonomy that’s informed by their programming, algorithmic structures, and iterative learning capabilities.The development of AI has been driven by numerous innovations and theoretical advances. It has grown from simple programmed instructions to more sophisticated neural networks that can learn from data inputs. Viewing AI as an entity with semblance to human intelligence is a misnomer; it reflects aspects of human reasoning within the confines of its designed capabilities.In the landscape of technology, AI is a multifaceted phenomenon that defies a singular archetype. Its applications span from rudimentary automation tasks to complex decision-making processes that challenge our conventional understanding of machine interaction. As researchers and developers continue to delve deeper into AI’s potential, it becomes clear that this pioneering technology will remain at the forefront of the digital revolution, blurring the lines between machine efficiency and human-like ingenuity.Important Questions Related to the Evolution of Artificial Intelligence:1. What are the different generations of AI?
AI has evolved through several generations, starting with rule-based systems that do not learn from their environment, to machine learning where algorithms can learn from data, and the current wave of AI, which encompasses deep learning and neural networks that mimic the structure and function of the human brain.2. How has AI impacted the job market?
AI has both displaced and created jobs, automating mundane tasks while generating new roles in AI development, data analysis, and ethical governance. The long-term impact on employment is a subject of extensive debate and research.3. What are the ethical implications of AI?
Concerns include privacy, bias in decision-making, accountability, and the potential for AI-enabled systems to be used in malicious ways. Establishing ethical guidelines and governance structures is an ongoing challenge in the conquest of integrating AI into society effectively and responsibly.4. Can AI surpass human intelligence?
This question revolves around the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) —the hypothetical ability of an AI to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in an autonomous, flexible manner like a human being. Currently, AI is specialized and excels at specific tasks, but AGI remains a theoretical endeavor, sparking diverse opinions among experts.Key Challenges and Controversies:– Data Privacy and Security: As AI systems process vast quantities of data, ensuring the privacy and security of this information is a significant challenge.
– Explainability: AI decision-making processes, especially in complex neural networks, are often opaque, leading to the “black box” problem where it’s difficult to understand how an AI arrived at a particular decision.
– ;Ethical Use: The use of AI in surveillance, warfare, and other sensitive areas raises ethical questions about how these powerful tools should be controlled and by whom.
– Regulation: Finding the balance between nurturing innovation in AI and protecting the public from potential abuses is a considerable regulatory challenge.Advantages and Disadvantages of AI:Advantages:
– Increased Efficiency: AI can operate 24/7 without fatigue, significantly enhancing productivity.
– Enhanced Accuracy: AI systems can surpass human performance in precision tasks, such as medical diagnostics or data analysis.
– Scalability: AI can handle growing amounts of work as data volumes increase, which is vital in the ‘big data’ era.Disadvantages:

Tom Brady is endorsing artificial intelligence'' as a method of preparation for his new job, the retired quarterback is revealing. Per BizTech Magazine, the 46-year-old GOAT says he's utilize AI while studying for his new job as an NFL color commentator.FanStreamSports.com""I'm about to start my broadcasting career on Fox, and I’m using AI in the preparation for that so I can better understand the matchups, the plays, and different situations that come up in the game,"" Brady said.There are plenty of ""AI'' jokes to be made in the world of sports journalism regarding some outlets that skim the edges of credibility, but we'll stay above that fray while looking forward to ex-Patriots and Bucs icon Brady making his broadcasting debut in Week 1 when the Dallas Cowboys play at the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Sept. 8.Brady is also seeking TV broadcasting advice - and getting it - from what some might think is an unusual source: The guy he's replacing.""I had a chance to speak with Tom a couple of weeks ago, and he was just kind of picking my brain about the prep and the industry and what to expect and whatnot,"" Olsen said via USA Today.Interesting that Olsen, who's been the lead play-by-play broadcaster for FOX's NFL coverage over the last few years but is now getting bumped by Brady, would be so cooperative.But they do remain on the same team, even though Olsen will move down to the No. 2 FOX team, and relative to Brady's chair, out of the spotlight.Brady On Roast: 'I Wouldn't Do That Again'Read MoreBrady On Roast: 'I Wouldn't Do That Again'Read MoreAnd how will Brady do? Surely Olsen thinks good things, but does add, ""I don’t think there’s any real correlation between being a great player or an average player, and how that correlates to being a great broadcaster or an average broadcaster.""I think we’ve seen examples on both ends of that spectrum. So, we’ll see how it all plays out.”By Mike FisherMike Fisher has covered the NFL since 1983.

You have almost definitely heard of generative AI. Whether it’s been more recently after OpenAI’s announcement of the scarily-human ChatGPT 4o, or more generally in the last year or so as AI tools have become more widely accessible – and controversial – it’s hard to escape the Generative AI bubble. 
And there’s a good reason why; Generative AI is incredibly versatile and can be used for a range of functions, whether as a tool for writing essays, creating images or even helping to plan a holiday – and that’s just scratching the surface of what these GenAI-powered tools are capable of. With that in mind, what actually is generative AI and how does it work? 
Keep reading to find out what generative AI is and how it works.

What is generative AI?
Generative AI is the use of artificial intelligence that uses large language models and machine learning to not only understand the input it’s given, but create an entirely new output, including (but not limited to) text, images and music. 
For example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT is a generative AI model that can create stories, menus and more, based solely on a user prompt. 
This content, although ‘new’, is actually based on the vast amounts of training data GenAI tools are fed. That’s where some of the controversies come into play, as there isn’t an easy way for creatives (writers, painters, photographers, etc) to object to training AI using their work.

How does generative AI work?
All generative AI models, whether it’s a chatbot, image generator or otherwise, are fed with vast amounts of content, called training data. The model is then programmed with an algorithm which analyses the patterns in its training data in order to understand what the user wants, allowing it to generate solutions.
How can I use generative AI?
One of the reasons why generative AI has become so widely known is its user-friendliness. Instead of being an inaccessible piece of tech, a lot of tools can be free to use and easy to work with, whether that’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot or lesser-known tools like Perplexity. Just head over to the site in question, sign up and start getting creative. 
All of the above focus mainly on answering queries and analysing data, but there’s DALL·E 3 if you want to generate images, Synthesia if you want to create video content and invideo if you want to create entirely AI-generated social media videos – and that’s just scratching the surface of the plethora of GenAI tools available in 2024. 
Once you’ve decided on the GenAI tool you want to use, it’s as simple as telling it what you want in as much detail as possible. The model will then, based on its training data, generate content according to your prompt. Enjoy getting creative!

<p><strong>You have almost definitely heard of generative AI. Whether it’s been more recently after OpenAI's announcement of the scarily-human <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-chatgpt-4o-the-chatbot-update-explained-4528377"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ChatGPT 4o</a>, or more generally in the last year or so as AI tools have become more widely accessible – and controversial <strong>–</strong></strong> <strong>it's hard to escape the Generative AI bubble.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>And there's a good reason why; Generative AI is incredibly versatile and can be used for a range of functions, whether as a tool for writing essays, creating images or even helping to plan a holiday - and that's just scratching the surface of what these GenAI-powered tools are capable of. With that in mind, what actually is generative AI and how does it work?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep reading to find out what generative AI is and how it works.</p>

<h2 id=""h-what-is-generative-ai"">What is generative AI?</h2>



<p>Generative AI is the use of artificial intelligence that uses large language models and machine learning<strong> </strong>to not only understand the input it's given, but create an entirely new output, including (but not limited to) text, images and music. </p>



<p>For example, OpenAI’s <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-chatgpt-4297405"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ChatGPT</a> is a generative AI model that can create stories, menus and more, based solely on a user prompt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This content, although ‘new’, is actually based on the vast amounts of training data GenAI tools are fed. That's where some of the controversies come into play, as there isn't an easy way for creatives (writers, painters, photographers, etc) to object to training AI using their work.</p>

<h2 id=""h-how-does-generative-ai-work"">How does generative AI work?</h2>



<p>All generative AI models, whether it’s a chatbot, image generator or otherwise, are fed with vast amounts of content, called training data. The model is then programmed with an algorithm which analyses the patterns in its training data in order to understand what the user wants, allowing it to generate solutions.</p>



<h2 id=""h-how-can-i-use-generative-ai"">How can I use generative AI?</h2>



<p>One of the reasons why generative AI has become so widely known is its user-friendliness. Instead of being an inaccessible piece of tech, a lot of tools can be free to use and easy to work with, whether that's <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-chatgpt-4297405"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-google-gemini-2-4398999"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Google Gemini</a>, <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-windows-copilot-4335746"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Microsoft Copilot</a> or lesser-known tools like <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"">Perplexity</a>. Just head over to the site in question, sign up and start getting creative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the above focus mainly on answering queries and analysing data, but there's <a href=""https://openai.com/dall-e-3/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"">DALL·E 3</a>&nbsp;if you want to generate images, <a href=""https://www.synthesia.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"">Synthesia</a> if you want to create video content and <a href=""https://invideo.io/make/tiktok-video-editor/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"">invideo</a> if you want to create entirely AI-generated social media videos - and that's just scratching the surface of the plethora of GenAI tools available in 2024. </p>



<p>Once you've decided on the GenAI tool you want to use, it's as simple as telling it what you want in as much detail as possible. The model will then, based on its training data, generate content according to your prompt. Enjoy getting creative! </p>

Every company worth the ground it’s occupying yearns to be an innovative place. Many have extensive, well-planned initiatives, and stage motivational confabs and training sessions to achieve just that. Yet, new data shows no one has really upped their innovation game in recent years. Will artificial intelligence provide a boost, or is it yet just another costly technology to be tacked somewhere onto the process?


It’s still too early to say whether generative AI — often portrayed as a mechanized font of innovation — can deliver on the high expectations people have for it. At this point, only eight percent are implementing at scale, a new report published by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggests. More than half report they are still experimenting with the technology.

There is only a small degree of innovation “readiness” among companies, which BCG defines as a “strong link between business strategy and innovation strategy.” Only 12% have attained this. Innovation activity — the number of projects going through the funnel — has remained steady, “evoking a troubling image: zombie innovation systems just going through the motions.”

PROMOTED
In assessing AI’s long-term potential in super-charging innovation, hope springs eternal for the BCG team, which urges companies to reshape “their innovation systems with gen AI.” The potential benefits of generative AI, which can pull together data and content and deliver logical concepts in a matter of seconds, will be too compelling to ignore.

“It can inspire and challenge teams,” the BCG co-authors write. “It can take critical time out of processes, freeing staff to focus on more value-added activities. And it’s likely to become table stakes for any ambitious innovator, making it an increasingly important dimension of an organization’s innovation readiness.”

While only eight percent have generative AI at work across their enterprises, there is no shortage of excitement over its potential in the near term. It already is among the top three of investment plans for the year ahead, as cited by 89% of executives, the survey also shows. Currently, 86% report that their companies are at least experimenting with gen AI as an innovation tool.

At the same time, no one should depend on generative AI alone to deliver innovation miracles. “Reshaping your innovation function with gen AI is only a first step, and one that, given technological progress, never really ends,” the report’s co-authors caution. Plus, every industry has its different needs and nuances.
Ultimately, the most important point is that generative AI will only deliver competitive advantage and growth when the actual products and services it helps produce hit the ground, they continue. At least 21% of companies in BCG’s research indicated they are getting close, reporting they have implemented generative AI “with impact” in an innovation-related use case.
The top innovators identified by BCG are 1.5 times more likely to have implemented generative AI in one or more applications, and five times more likely to be applying the technology at scale.
They are doing so with a combination of both generative AI and traditional, or predictive, AI. Traditional predictive AI supports analytical decision making and optimization, while generative AI “boosts creativity, developing content, and distilling the essence of vast troves of information.”
The BCG analysts provide guidance on delivering successful AI that have a material impact on the business:


Start off with quick wins. “It’s a great way to start gaining traction, identify champions, and spotlight small-scale applications with greater potential. For instance, companies can use ChatGPT to write first drafts of reports, or take advantage of Zoom’s automated meeting summaries.”
Rethink critical internal functions. Generative AI “becomes a powerful new addition to the business transformation toolbox, freeing staff to work on more value-added activities.”
Build and sell new things. Leverage generative AI to enable “new products, services, and business models—and enhancing the attractiveness of existing ones.”
Test strategic assumptions. Shared strategic assumptions may cover customers, competitors, business economics, competitive advantage, and technology. Generative AI, “lacking emotional bonds and biases, can help by bringing an external perspective, making connections you might have missed that support or undermine your convictions.”
Generate images, UX designs, 3D models, and videos. “GenAI is a huge help in the process of exploring and refining ideas.”
Identify and explore innovation domains. Generative AI “can help innovators connect the dots to identify and develop a richer understanding of the shifting landscape of demand.” Generative AI can “look for patterns in online and social media, strengthening trend analysis capabilities.”
Develop ecosystem insights. Employ generative AI to gain perspectives on the market at large. For example, one company, “eager to identify new and interesting applications of its technology, is using gen AI to rapidly summarize, categorize, and extract key themes from its—and its competitors’—patent citation networks, including automatically generating summaries of the product offerings of the corporate patent owners.”
Employ AI to enhance creativity, generate new product and service ideas. This is an “iterative cycle of ideation, design and prototyping, and testing and validation,” the BCG analysts point out. “It’s where new products, services, and business models are born and perfected. GenAI is a great support for the divergence phase of any focused ideation exercise. By adjusting the ‘temperature,’ it can rapidly complement the inventory of human-generated ideas with a universe of options ranging from more near in to more far out.”


Generative AI promises to unlock some of the innovative potential of many organizations. But it needs to be seen as a tool — not a replacement — that can amplify and guide human-inspired ideas and ventures.

We’re seeing a wave of new generative AI tools that can write text, generate images, create music and more. Some can even write computer code, which makes sense when you think that computer code is just another type of language. From a well-known, generic tool like ChatGPT to specific AI coding tools created for developers, new tools are rapidly emerging that offer code suggestions and even write entire code. And it can all be done based on natural language prompts or by learning from existing code.


Naturally, this is already changing the work that software developers do. But what are the long-term implications of this? Will we even need software developers in the future? Read on to find out.

What Can Generative AI Do?
Generative AI can accelerate and automate the software development process in several ways:

PROMOTED



Gathering requirements: All software development starts by identifying requirements (such as “user wants to do X, Y and Z”). Generative AI can aid this process by generating a list of requirements. It can also be used to review requirements and check that nothing has been missed.
Generating code: Generative AI can turn natural language instructions into functioning code, which essentially turns English (or whatever your native tongue is) into a computer programming language.
Completing code: As coders type, a generative AI tool can suggest code completions, which saves coders time, especially when working on repetitive or mundane tasks. As an added advantage, this can help to reduce human error.
Reviewing code: Generative AI can also be a useful tool when it comes to reviewing software. For example, a generative AI tool can check through existing code and suggest improvements or create alternatives that are more efficient. It can also analyze code according to coding style guidelines to ensure code is consistent.
Fixing bugs: Generative AI can be used to identify and fix bugs in code to create a better end product.
Testing software: Generative AI can carry out many of the testing phases, such as generating test cases, generating test code and analyzing test results.
Predicting how software might fail: Looking ahead, generative AI may also be able to predict how systems and software might fail before the code goes into production—and tell developers how to fix it.


All of which means that generative AI can aid the work of coders, programmers and developers and speed up the software development process. In one example, coders at software company Freshworks have been using ChatGPT to write code—and, in the process, cut the development time from around 10 weeks down to less than a week. According to a GitHub study, developers who used the GitHub Copilot generative AI tool coded up to 55% faster than those who didn’t.

But how good is generative AI at creating computer code? Well, when the Alphabet-owned DeepMind lab pitted its AlphaCode AI model in competition against human coders, AlphaCode’s performance roughly corresponded to “a novice programmer with a few months to a year of training.” It's not bad at all for an AI. Given that generative AI’s capabilities are progressing so fast, we can expect the technology to catch up with more experienced developers in the not-so-distant future.

What Does The Future Look Like For Software Developers?
So does this mean we won’t need human software developers in the future? No, I don’t believe so. But it does mean they will increasingly work alongside AI, just as other professionals will. Almost all jobs will be affected or augmented by AI-driven automation to some extent, and software development is no different.
Admittedly, the work of junior coders could potentially be at risk as more development tasks are automated by AI. However, I see an even bigger application of generative AI than simply automating the work that junior coders would otherwise do. I see generative AI adding enormous value as a copilot or co-coder for even the most experienced programmers—especially when you consider that generative AI can be used to gather requirements and debug codes, make sure that code adheres to certain requirements and write the code itself. That takes some of the more repetitive and mundane tasks off developers’ plates, allowing them to focus on more valuable tasks.
And let’s not forget that, for someone like a higher-level developer or programmer, writing code isn’t the main thing they do all day. In fact, writing code may take up as little as 20% of their time, with the rest spent on gathering requirements, testing, meetings, collaborating with users, overseeing projects and other tasks.
What’s more, even when using generative AI tools to automate or help with programming work, we’ll still need experienced developers to write detailed prompts that get the best out of the AI. (You could argue writing detailed prompts that tell the AI exactly what you want it to do is just another form of programming.)
But the biggest takeaway from this is that rather than simply automating the more tedious aspects of software development and speeding up software development, generative AI will help developers work smarter, tackle more complex problems and come up with more creative solutions. It could therefore prove to be a game-changing tool for programmers.

Specifically, 48% of lawyers in UK firms and 50% of in-house lawyers support this stance. In contrast, 36% of UK firm lawyers and 44% of in-house lawyers believe government regulation is necessary. This preference for government regulation is notably higher than in the US and Canada, where only 26% of lawyers surveyed support government oversight of AI.
Kriti Sharma, Chief Product Officer for Legal Tech at Thomson Reuters, highlighted the potential benefits of generative AI when used responsibly. She stated, ""Generative AI can augment the work of lawyers, improving productivity and efficiency, which can address issues like burnout and enhance access to legal services and justice.""
Despite the enthusiasm for AI, lawyers express significant concerns about its use, particularly regarding inaccuracy and data security. The report identifies the primary barriers to AI adoption among lawyers as:

Potential for inaccurate responses (74%)
Concerns about data security (68%)
Complying with relevant laws and regulations (63%)
Privacy and confidentiality of information entered into AI tools (58%)
Ethical and responsible use of AI tools (50%)
Dependency on technology, potentially reducing critical thinking and creativity (50%)

Sharma acknowledged these concerns, emphasising the importance of trusted legal AI tools and the advantage they provide to firms that adopt them. ""Lawyers are cautious about risking the quality of their work, but those who embrace specialised legal AI tools grounded in trusted content will likely outpace their competitors,"" she said.
Thomson Reuters has recently introduced CoCounsel, a comprehensive AI assistant designed to answer complex legal research questions using trusted legal information while ensuring proprietary data remains secure.
Additional findings from the report show that among lawyers whose firms and departments use generative AI, the technology is primarily utilised for:

Document review (91%)
Legal research (83%)
Document summarisation (74%)

Moreover, 85% of in-house lawyers believe generative AI will enable them to bring more work in-house over the next five years, offering significant cost savings for legal departments.
While the concerns about AI—such as inaccuracy and data security—persist, Sharma notes that these issues are gradually being addressed as AI technology becomes more integrated into law firms and in-house legal departments. She concludes, ""AI won't replace lawyers, but those who leverage AI-powered tools will gain a competitive edge over those who don't.""

Published: 10 Jun 2024


 
OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, sparking a tremendous amount of interest in artificial intelligence. ChatGPT gained so much attention that generative AI (GenAI) became a dominant theme in the tech world in 2023.







Microsoft backed OpenAI at the start of 2023 by pledging a multimillion-dollar, multiyear investment to accelerate OpenAI's development of its AI technology.
Google made its GenAI move in March 2023 with Bard. In February 2024, Google rebranded Bard as Gemini when it debuted an improved version of the AI chatbot.
ChatGPT and Gemini are largely responsible for the considerable buzz around GenAI, which uses data from machine learning models to answer questions and create images, text and videos. OpenAI and Google are continuously improving the large language models (LLMs) behind ChatGPT and Gemini to give them a greater ability to generate human-like text.

GenAI is still rapidly evolving, and models don't always return correct answers. Despite the common occurrence of AI hallucinations -- wrong answers generated by AI -- in both ChatGPT and Gemini, the tools are being adopted by businesses and consumers seeking to automate time-consuming tasks.

What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is the AI-powered chatbot that made GenAI the hot technology of 2023. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, ChatGPT reached 1 million users within five days of its release on Nov. 30, 2022.
Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the model ChatGPT is based on, finds patterns within data sequences. Its AI language model produces responses to user queries and serves as the interface that lets users communicate with the language model. As of May 2024, GPT-4o is an available default in the free version of ChatGPT. Users can still choose to use GPT-3.5, which was the previous default. A more robust access to GPT-4o as well as GPT-4 is available in the paid subscription versions of ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise. GPT-4 was generally considered the most advanced GenAI model when it became available, but Google Gemini Advanced provided it with a formidable rival.
Popular applications for ChatGPT include content generation of emails, social media posts and blogs; text summarization; language translation; code generation; learning and education; building virtual assistants; simulation and training; research assistance; and building games and other entertainment applications.
ChatGPT is multimodal, meaning users can use images and voice to prompt the chatbot. ChatGPT Voice -- available on iOS and Android phones -- lets users hold conversations with ChatGPT, which can respond in one of five AI-generated voices.
ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus are targeted at individual users. The free version of ChatGPT is available through web browsers and mobile devices. Developers can also embed ChatGPT APIs in their software applications for their users to access.
ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per user, per month. The full version of GPT-4o, used in ChatGPT Plus, responds faster than previous versions of GPT; is more accurate; and includes features such as advanced data analysis. GPT-4o can also create more detailed responses and is faster at tasks such as describing photos and writing image captions. And while GPT-3.5 was only trained on data up to January 2022, GPT-4o has been trained on data up to October 2023.
Another advantage of a ChatGPT Plus subscription is that it guarantees ChatGPT access even during peak usage times. Response times for free ChatGPT are limited by bandwidth and availability. ChatGPT Plus also provides integrated access to OpenAI's Dall-E 3 text to image GenAI model.
OpenAI sells ChatGPT Team and ChatGPT Enterprise to businesses. ChatGPT Team is available for $25 per user, per month billed annually. It includes everything in ChatGPT Plus but allows more messages during a defined time limit. It can also share GPTs with other workers, has a faster response time than ChatGPT Plus and includes an admin console. ChatGPT Enterprise has unlimited high-speed access to GPT-4; more advanced administration, customer support and analytics capabilities; expanded content windows for longer inputs; and has the fastest response time of all the ChatGPT versions. ChatGPT Enterprise pricing varies depending on usage.


What is Google Gemini?
Gemini is Google's GenAI model that was built by the Google DeepMind AI research library. The Gemini AI model powered Google's Bard GenAI tool that launched in March 2023. Google rebranded Bard as Gemini in February 2024, several months after launching Gemini Advanced based on its new Ultra 1.0 LLM foundation. In May 2024, Google first offered users of Gemini Advanced access to the newer Gemini 1.5 Pro model.
Gemini is designed to retrieve information as a simple answer, similar to the way smart assistants like Alexa and Siri work. It uses LLMs to reply to prompts with information it has already learned or can retrieve from other Google services.
Google Gemini is multimodal -- it understands audio, video and computer code as well as text. Google has paused Gemini's image generation feature because of inaccuracies, however. Google's statement disclosing the pause pledged to re-release an improved image generation feature soon.
Gemini's capabilities are integrated into Google's search engine and available in Google Workspace apps such as Docs, Gmail, Sheets, Slides and Meet. Gemini for Google Workspace is the new name for Duet AI for Google Workspace, which was Google's answer to the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant. Google Gemini is available through an app on Android phones and in the Google app on iOS.
Gemini Advanced is part of the Google One AI Premium plan subscription service that costs $19.99 per month in the United States. Google One AI Premium also includes 2 TB of storage.
Gemini Advanced is a more powerful AI version than Gemini Pro, which remains available for free. Gemini Advanced with Gemini Pro 1.5 provides a large context window of 1 million tokens, enabling analysis of larger data sets.
Google suggests Gemini Pro and its AI capabilities is the better choice for development, research and creation tasks, and if you're looking for a free chatbot. It brings AI to simple tasks for personal use. For those willing to pay the subscription fee, Google recommends Gemini Advanced for professional applications, more demanding workflows, enhanced performance and more cutting-edge capabilities. Google Advanced will also include early access to new features.
Gemini Nano, another part of the Google Gemini family, is used in devices such as Google's Pixel 8 Pro smartphones.



A snapshot of the differences between ChatGPT and Gemini.







What are the main differences between Gemini and ChatGPT?
ChatGPT and Google Gemini have become increasingly similar. Both have a free service, a nearly identically priced subscription service, and similar interfaces and use cases. The differences are largely under the hood -- in their language models.
They're also used for many similar functions, and work by users typing in a query to get a response. Both raise privacy concerns about how user data can be used. However, they differ in their training models, data sources, user experiences and how they store data.
Training models
ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. Gemini has three sizes: Gemini Pro for a wide range of tasks, Gemini Ultra for highly complex tasks, and Gemini Nano for mobile devices. Gemini Pro 1.5, which powers the subscription Gemini Advanced version, is faster and more advanced than the model used for the free Gemini service.
Data sources
The main difference between ChatGPT and Gemini is the data sources used to train their LLMs. GPT-4o uses predefined data that goes up to October 2023. Gemini draws on data pulled from the internet in real time. It is tuned to select data chosen from sources that fit specific topics such as coding or the latest scientific research.
User experience
ChatGPT users can log onto the free ChatGPT with any email account. ChatGPT also includes an API that developers can use to integrate OpenAI LLMs into third-party software. It lacks a Save button, but users can copy and paste answers from ChatGPT into another application. It does have an Archive button that can list previous responses in ChatGPT's left-hand pane for quick retrieval.
Because ChatGPT is text-based, it can't include images, videos, charts or links in its answers. It also lacks the ability to search the internet.
Because of OpenAI's close partnership with Microsoft, ChatGPT can be used through Windows apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Also, Microsoft's Copilot AI assistants use the GPT-4 language model.
Gemini Pro's interface gives users a chance to like or dislike a response, opt to modify the size or tone of the response, share or fact-check the response, or export it to Google Docs or Gmail. Gemini also has a ""review other drafts"" option that shows alternate versions of its answer. Gemini also lets users upload images, but its ability to create images is on hold until Google improves that feature.
Data storage and privacy
Both ChatGPT and Google Gemini store user data.
ChatGPT stores all prompts and queries entered. Users can review previous conversations through its archive feature. Although users can delete responses and conversations, the chatbot might continue to use these responses in its LLM for training. This raises privacy concerns when users enter personal data or proprietary information. OpenAI also discloses that ChatGPT gathers geolocation data, network activity, contact details such as email addresses and phone numbers, and device information.
According to OpenAI's privacy policy, it collects any personal information a user provides. This includes account information such as name, contact information, payment card information and transaction history. OpenAI also might disclose geolocation data to third parties such as vendors and service providers, and to law enforcement agencies if required to do so by law.
OpenAI said the user retains ownership rights of input data and owns the output, but it ""may use Content to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, comply with applicable law, enforce our terms and policies, and keep our Services safe.""
Gemini stores conversations in a user's Google account for 18 months, but users can change the retention period to three months or 36 months in their activity settings. Gemini conversations can also appear in searches, raising privacy concerns.
Google discloses that it collects conversations, location, feedback and usage information. The Google Privacy Policy claims Google uses collected data to develop, provide, maintain and improve services, and to provide personal services such as content and ads. Customers can delete information from their account using My Google Activity, or by deleting Google products or their Google accounts.
Google said it will share information to third parties with user consent and law enforcement when required.


Which chatbot is better?
There is a bit of a GenAI arms race going on now, with OpenAI and Google making updates to their models. Google has been especially aggressive, perhaps because ChatGPT came out first and Gemini must play catch-up. With each new version of the LLMs, Google and OpenAI make significant gains over their previous versions.
Generally, ChatGPT is considered the best option for text-based tasks while Gemini is the best choice for multimedia content. However, there are other considerations, as noted in earlier sections of this article. Users can try the free versions to determine which works better for them.
There have been several in-depth reviews about the chatbots worth noting:

Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and BerriAI benchmarked Gemini Pro against GPT-3 and GPT-4 on 10 diverse language tasks with the goal of providing an impartial in-depth analysis. They found Gemini's strengths included performance on long, complex reasoning chains and translating into non-English languages. On the downside, it struggled with mathematical reasoning -- especially with large numbers -- showed bias on multiple choice questions and aggressive content filtering blocked many responses. In summary, the researchers concluded Gemini Pro did not match GPT-3 and GPT-4, but ""exhibits strengths in handling complexity and reasoning depth.""
Ethan Mollick, an associate professor who studies AI at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, performed what he called ""tasting notes"" of Gemini Advanced vs. GPT-4. Mollick concluded that Gemini Advanced is the first advanced AI model that can compete with GPT-4. He said each has its strengths and weaknesses -- for example, GPT-4 uses code in a more sophisticated way and is better at hard verbal tasks while Gemini is better at explanations and search. But both ""are weird and inconsistent and hallucinate more than you would like.""
Bernard Marr, a futurist and author of Generative AI in Practice, pointed out in a Forbes article that ChatGPT is designed to be more conversational while Gemini processes information and automates tasks more efficiently. Marr's conclusion after using ChatGPT and Gemini is that ChatGPT-4 is the more powerful chat interface but ""Gemini is closing the gap …"".
Neither ChatGPT nor Gemini are perfect, and their developers admit that. Both generate hallucinations and even warn users of that in their responses.
Both of the chatbots include a disclaimer on the bottom of their prompt screens. Gemini's reads: ""Gemini may display inaccurate info, including about people, so double-check its responses."" ChatGPT advises: ""ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.""
The Gemini FAQ on Google's website offers this valuable advice that can apply to all AI tools:

Gemini can't replace important people in your life, like family, friends, teachers or doctors.
Gemini can't do your work for you.
Gemini can't make important life decisions for you.
 



Generative AI alternatives
GenAI is a fast-moving technology. Besides the updates to ChatGPT and Google Gemini, other companies are working on AI projects. These include AI21 Labs' Wordtune, Anthropic's Claude, Glean, Jasper, Open Assistant and Writesonic's Chatsonic. China's Baidu search engine uses AI with an application called Ernie Bot. Many productivity applications and SaaS products also incorporate GenAI assistants.


Comparison of ChatGPT vs. Gemini responses
We asked ChatGPT 3.5 and Google Gemini Pro the same requests and prompts to see how their responses would compare. The results are as follows:
Idea generation
Prompt: What are the five hottest IT trends an IT professional should know about?

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's idea generation response to the five hottest IT trends.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's idea generation response to the five hottest IT trends.





Thoughts: ChatGPT's answers were more general while Gemini drilled down into specific areas -- for example, generative AI vs. AI/ML and cybersecurity mesh vs. cyber security. ChatGPT's inability to reference data past January 2022 limits its effectiveness when looking for trending information. Gemini snuck in a few extras under ""Bonus trends.""
Creating content
Prompt: Write a two-paragraph summary explaining cyber-resiliency challenges.

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's content generation response to explain cyber-resiliency challenges.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's content generation response to explain cyber-resiliency challenges.





Thoughts: Both did a good job of explaining and summarizing a complex issue in two paragraphs, but Gemini included more specifics about the challenges and what can be done about them.
Planning
Prompt: What are the best cloud computing conferences to attend?

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's planning response for the best cloud computing conferences to attend.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's planning response for the best cloud computing conferences to attend.





Thoughts: ChatGPT listed more conferences, but its list was a bit dated as several of its conferences have been renamed. Gemini offered greater detail and broke its list into specific areas of expertise.
Developer assistance
Prompt: List 10 frequently used SQL queries for querying a PostgreSQL database.

Dave Raffo

ChatGPT's response for developer assistance on frequently used SQL queries for querying a PostgreSQL database.






Dave Raffo

Gemini's response for developer assistance on frequently used SQL queries for querying a PostgreSQL database.





Thoughts: The lists were similar, although they used different terms in some cases. A nice feature was the code embedded in the responses. We shortened Gemini's response to fit on one page, but its longer version included embedded code.

They are designed to interact with users in a conversational manner, often through text-based interfaces like messaging apps and website chat windows.These intelligent software leverage natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user input. They can analyze users’ messages, interpret the intent behind the messages, and generate appropriate human-like responses, allowing for more engaging interactions with users.Types of AI chatbotsThere are two main types of AI chatbots:1. Rule-based chatbots: These chatbots follow predefined rules and patterns to respond to user inputs. They are programmed with specific responses based on keywords or phrases and are limited in their capabilities. They require extensive manual input to cover various user queries and scenarios.2. Machine learning-based chatbots: ML-based chatbots utilize machine learning algorithms to learn from data and improve their responses over time. They are trained on large datasets of conversations and can use techniques such as deep learning to generate more contextually relevant and accurate responses. They have the ability to adapt and handle a wider range of user inputs.1.

Some users even have pre-release access to a one-million-token context window, which is about 700,000 words. This makes it even better for those looking to summarize their long-form text or other related purposes.Additionally, Claude 3 is pretty decent at providing factual answers across various niches, as it shows a strong understanding of complex topics. For advanced customization, Claude offers features like style adaptation, which mimics specific writing styles, and fine-tuning options to adjust parameters such as tone, formality, and target audience​. And, for research and analysis, Claude can summarize complex documents, provide overviews, answer specific research queries, and compare different subjects, making it an excellent tool for researchers and analysts​.

On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites. Again, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.Similarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.Although Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.2. Microsoft translatorGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own. The Microsoft Translator provides text, voice, and document translation across multiple languages. In our opinion, you’ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft’s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time. Microsoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite.

The company introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will be rolled out to the tech giant’s latest operating systems starting this fall. New generative-AI models will help Apple users write work memos and highly personalized text; create images and emoji; connect and organize photos, calendar events, and emails.The tools supposedly rely on the context of what’s happening on your device: They’ll be able to identify which contacts you are referencing and pull information from a range of apps. Apple offered a quintessentially Apple example in its marketing video: The senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, plays a busy dad who uses Apple Intelligence to figure out whether a last-minute meeting will conflict with his daughter’s play. The tool pulls information from his calendar, scans a PDF his daughter sent him, and looks at the traffic on Apple Maps to figure out if he can make it on time. This, Apple stresses, is not some wonky enterprise-software solution—“This is AI for the rest of us,” Federighi declares.It’s a helpful line, because it articulates how Apple sees itself: not just as a manufacturer of phones and laptops and a prestige movie-and-television studio, but as the central technological force mediating the overscheduled lives of upwardly mobile achievers. Apple Intelligence promises to synthesize all your disparate texts, emails, calendar invites, and photos for you. At one point in the conference keynote, an executive noted that Siri can now do in seconds what used to take a human minutes to accomplish. This is Apple’s pitch distilled: the messy edges of your life, sanded down via Siri and brushed aluminum.

Generative AI is rapidly changing the way people work and live. Through language replication and the generation of written content, images and even music, gen AI is encroaching on domains previously considered ‘uniquely human.’ As the verbal and cognitive capabilities of machines evolve, an existential question has emerged: In gen AI’s shadow, what unique qualities will humans retain?  
More than 50 years ago, Stanley Kubrick’s groundbreaking film 2001: A Space Odyssey gave moviegoers and society at large one of the first glimpses into the future of AI. In the movie, a spacecraft’s onboard computer verbally interacts with its human crewmates, executes all technical aspects of the mission and even plays (and wins) a friendly game of chess with an astronaut. At one point in the story, the computer — HAL 9000 or simply “Hal” — is interviewed remotely by a news reporter back on Earth.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Moments later, when the interview shifts back to the crew, the reporter says he felt that Hal exhibited a sense of pride when he spoke about his own technical flawlessness. When the reporter asks if they think Hal is capable of experiencing emotions, the mission commander is doubtful.
“Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions… but as to whether or not he has real feelings is something that I don’t think anyone can truthfully answer.”
More than a half-century later, the ability to experience feelings and emotions are qualities that — at least, for now — remain uniquely human.
Interestingly, and contrary to Hal’s conversational abilities in a fictional setting, language was not something computers did particularly well. Today, however, gen AI has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks that include large language model (LLM)-driven language translation and sentiment analysis, and chatbots can now understand and respond to questions and commands. In a particularly noteworthy example, AI-enabled a computer to pass the Turing test while simultaneously convincing multiple human judges it was a person and not a machine.
Beyond the purview of technology
As gen AI continues automating human tasks without “feeling” any particular way about doing so, those of us among the living can take stock in our other unique qualities that are incapable of being mimicked by machines. Along with emotions, attributes that remain uniquely human include imagination-based creativity and original thinking, and complex problem solving that requires cognitive flexibility and intuition. It’s also important to note how morality and ethics — which are beyond the purview of a technology that lacks an experience of being a member of society — factor into human decision making.      
The five human senses, and the extensive input the brain processes in relation to them, represent another example of what can be deemed uniquely human. As sight, sound, smell, taste and touch intertwine with an infamously fallible memory to create an embodied experience in humans, it’s difficult to imagine technology replicating the uniquely human experience of this convergence of senses.advertisement
Delving deeper into the incomparable characteristics of the mind, the discovery of mirror neurons represents another human characteristic that technology has yet to reproduce. A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an individual executes a specific motor act or experiences an emotion and when they observe the same or similar act performed or emotion experienced by another individual. First observed in primates, actions driven by mirror neurons can be described in the most simplistic terms as “monkey see, monkey do.”  
According to research published by the National Institute of Health on mirror neurons, “from a functional viewpoint, action execution and observation are closely related processes, and… the ability to interpret the actions of others requires the involvement of our own motor system.” These mirror neurons enhance our experience of empathy, competition and teamwork, to name just a few examples. While an LLM might infer what we are feeling, they do not feel it themselves.
A shift in organizations’ mindset
In tandem with gen AI’s rising trajectory and the thought-provoking existential questions that come with it, humans are grappling with how to manage, control, and regulate AI technologies. Going forward, organizations will need to make choices when delegating tasks to gen AI technology.advertisement
According to research by McKinsey, business leaders need to take a broad view of gen AI’s capabilities and “deeply consider its implications for the organization.” The findings revealed that many global executives shared the following sentiment: “We were behind on automation and digitization, and we finally closed the gap. We don’t want to be left behind again, but we aren’t sure how to think about generative AI.”
Seeking to not repeat missed opportunities of the past, many organizations are approaching gen AI cautiously. Companies that leverage gen AI will need to establish well-defined workforce implementation and utilization strategies to ensure the responsible execution of their adoption roadmap. This will be increasingly critical as new regulations are created to ensure gen AI is used ethically, and standards are established to ensure data privacy and security. In short, organizations with a legitimate stake in gen AI will be held accountable for how they develop and deploy it.
Just because technology can do something…
Traditionally, technology has exerted a heavy hand on what we consider “work,” as 60% of the job titles held by those employed in 2018 did not even exist in 1940. As we look ahead to a world increasingly mediated by AI, it remains to be seen what new endeavors humans will undertake as AI remakes the 9-to-5 landscape. Going forward, governments, corporations and organizations of all types will need to make critical, conscious decisions about what will be outsourced to computers and what roles will remain in the human realm. During this process it’s important to consider this: Just because technology can do something doesn’t necessarily mean it should do it. 
When futurist Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick partnered in the 1960s to write a screenplay that placed AI at the center of its plot, could they have known how prescient their fiction would one day be?

Or candidates can go through the process independently to be added to a marketplace of engineers. The internal marketplace has a talent pool of vetted engineers—from India, Argentina, Brazil, and other countries far from American tech hubs—who Ansari describes as “untapped but exceptional.” This, he says, may help diversify who gets to work in top tech jobs. “We become the way into Silicon Valley,” Ansari says.Most PopularBusinessHere’s What Happens When You Give People Free MoneyBy Paresh DaveSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyCultureThe 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right NowBy Angela WatercutterMore than 100,000 people have gone through micro1’s screenings with hopes of being added to its marketplace of engineers, and the company lists a number of tech companies, including DoNotPay (whose CEO has also invested in micro1) among those who have used its system to screen or hire engineers from its marketplace. Ansari says companies are using micro1 to screen as many as 30,000 candidates a month.Asynchronous video interviews have become more common, with companies turning to prerecorded responses in automated systems to handle screening interviews. This task has become more onerous after a series of layoffs in the past two years have whittled down the number of positions available, and recruiters who post open roles on sites like LinkedIn can receive hundreds or thousands of applicants. And generative AI tools have made it easier for those seeking jobs to bulk apply, creating more applications for recruiters and hiring managers to review—some with little relevance to the role. But while AI is becoming more common on the hiring side, too, some recruiters are wary of the biases it may have, and have steered clear of employing the tools in their decisions.Of course there’s still bias with AI tools, Ansari says. “Of course there’s also bias with humans. The goal with the AI system is to make it much less biased than humans.” With AI, Ansari explains, the AI interviewer on micro1 won’t pass or fail a candidate; instead, it places them into categories like inexperienced, mid-level, and senior. Then, Ansari says, it’s on the hiring manager or recruiter to decide if the candidate is a good fit for the role. They can also listen to audio recordings of the responses rather than relying solely on the AI interviewer to interpret them.Zahira Jaser, an associate professor at the University of Sussex Business School, says a lot remains unknown about the impact of AI and asynchronous interviewing—including how the tech affects candidates. Recording oneself can be awkward, and there are no human cues to pick up on from an AI interviewer. After being told to act naturally and put their best foot forward in the already nerve-wracking process of human job interviews throughout their career, people may not know how to show their best self to a chatbot, particularly when they’re up against opaque, built-in biases of AI.“In the real world, humans are biased. But there are techniques we can use to overcome this human bias,” Jaser says. “In an algorithm-driven bias, this is likely to be very systematic.” For example, some AI hiring tools are trained on profiles of past successful employees, raising concerns that they will repeat past biased hiring practices.For now, these AI tools don’t have the final say in who gets hired. But they increasingly have sway over which applicants get face time with a real human, and that can have a massive impact on what the workforce looks like going forward.But if you ask Ansari, there is an alternative path for interviews in the future: He believes job seekers may also use AI-driven avatars to interview for jobs with AI interviewers, relegating the painful, tedious parts of initial job searchers to computers entirely. AI could make “really good matches” between job seekers and companies, Ansari says. “And then the company and the candidate can spend their actual time on a Zoom call or in-person interview.”WIRED has teamed up with Jobbio to create WIRED Hired, a dedicated career marketplace for WIRED readers.

And generative AI tools have made it easier for those seeking jobs to bulk apply, creating more applications for recruiters and hiring managers to review—some with little relevance to the role. But while AI is becoming more common on the hiring side, too, some recruiters are wary of the biases it may have, and have steered clear of employing the tools in their decisions.
Of course there’s still bias with AI tools, Ansari says. “Of course there’s also bias with humans. The goal with the AI system is to make it much less biased than humans.” With AI, Ansari explains, the AI interviewer on micro1 won’t pass or fail a candidate; instead, it places them into categories like inexperienced, mid-level, and senior. Then, Ansari says, it’s on the hiring manager or recruiter to decide if the candidate is a good fit for the role. They can also listen to audio recordings of the responses rather than relying solely on the AI interviewer to interpret them.
Zahira Jaser, an associate professor at the University of Sussex Business School, says a lot remains unknown about the impact of AI and asynchronous interviewing—including how the tech affects candidates. Recording oneself can be awkward, and there are no human cues to pick up on from an AI interviewer. After being told to act naturally and put their best foot forward in the already nerve-wracking process of human job interviews throughout their career, people may not know how to show their best self to a chatbot, particularly when they’re up against opaque, built-in biases of AI.
“In the real world, humans are biased. But there are techniques we can use to overcome this human bias,” Jaser says. “In an algorithm-driven bias, this is likely to be very systematic.” For example, some AI hiring tools are trained on profiles of past successful employees, raising concerns that they will repeat past biased hiring practices.
For now, these AI tools don’t have the final say in who gets hired. But they increasingly have sway over which applicants get face time with a real human, and that can have a massive impact on what the workforce looks like going forward.
But if you ask Ansari, there is an alternative path for interviews in the future: He believes job seekers may also use AI-driven avatars to interview for jobs with AI interviewers, relegating the painful, tedious parts of initial job searchers to computers entirely. AI could make “really good matches” between job seekers and companies, Ansari says. “And then the company and the candidate can spend their actual time on a Zoom call or in-person interview.”

Is Artificial Intelligence Going to Take Over Agriculture?

Artificial intelligence is everywhere these days. It is being used to create logos, write transcriptions of events and interviews,  and complete the homework assignments of students around the world. At first thought, it might not seem like artificial intelligence (AI, not to be confused with artificial insemination) has much of a place in agriculture. But there are many ways that AI is being used in ag, including in crop production, raising livestock, food production and processing, and more. The next question is, will AI take jobs away from those working in ag?
What is artificial intelligence, and how does it work?
Artificial intelligence algorithms are modeled after the human brain, meaning that they can “learn.” One goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic human cognitive activity. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
At its basis, AI is input provided to a processor, which produces an output. One example of machine learning would be providing an AI system with a photo of corn and telling it that the image is of corn. You can feed your system thousands of images of corn and tell it that the image is of corn. Eventually, the system will be able to tell you with certainty whether an image (different from the ones you have previously shown the AI) is of corn or not. This is an example of one of the uses of AI in agriculture. Some helpful AI tools in agriculture are apps, robots, and drones that can identify weeds. All you need to do is use the camera on your phone to see what type of weed or plant you are looking at. Some of these systems can also recommend how to control that weed and where to go for more information.
AI is also used to create autonomous robots that can drive through fields and identify and control weeds. These robots can also identify diseases and insects, take soil samples, and even spray or mechanically remove weeds that they identify. So far, these robots are still being researched, but they have the potential to replace some of the technology and labor currently used in agriculture. These types of multifunctional AI robots are still a long way out from being usable and affordable for the average farmer.
AI is also being used in livestock production. One example is using a camera on a drone that can be flown over a herd of cattle. AI systems can look at the footage captured by the drone and count and inventory the herd of cattle. This could save farmers time and labor, as they would no longer have to go out and physically count their cattle. AI is also being used to look at thermal images of cattle and recognize bovine respiratory disease at its early stages.
AI also has potential uses in food processing. Currently, work is being done on AI systems that can grade the quality of pork by looking at color and marbling (which is normally done by people). There is also the potential for better food tracking and management on the consumer side.
There’s also a lot of research being done about AI in agriculture. The USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is even funding AI research in many areas of agriculture. Some examples include using machine learning, remote sensing, satellite imagery, drones, and precision technologies for more informed farm production and management.
There is also research into autonomous robots that could perform labor-intensive jobs like pesticide application and harvesting. There are even nano-based sensing mechanisms and smart sensors being developed that could provide accurate, reliable, and cost-effective detection of pathogens, chemicals, and contaminants in foods, on farms and ranches, and in water and soil. AI also has the potential to help on the business and economics side of ag. Farm managers can use AI to help them make decisions, improve efficiency, and more. AI can also help us understand and develop international trade, ag resource use, consumer behavior, food safety, ag policy, technology development, and more.
Will AI take away jobs in ag?
New technological advances have historically automated and taken away jobs, especially factory positions. You might have heard about how AI has the potential to take over jobs, especially positions like writers, web developers, bookkeepers, judicial clerks, and similar positions. However, many businesses have a hard time finding qualified employees, so this could eliminate some employment pain points for the industry. As of 2022, 19% of American workers held positions in this category of jobs at high risk of being exposed to AI.
AI has the potential to take over jobs in ag, but many of these positions are a long way out from being overtaken by AI. It’s also hard to tell for sure what jobs and when will be taken over by AI. It will also take more new jobs to set up AI systems and complete more research into AI. It’s much more likely that instead of taking over jobs, AI will help agriculture as a whole.
The average age of farm producers has been rising, and in 2017, the average age of a farmer or rancher was 57.5 years old. New technology, including AI, can help aging producers and make their jobs easier. AI can also help ag by increasing efficiency and productivity, increasing sustainability, and helping producers make more informed decisions. AI has the potential to change agriculture, but the heart of ag will always be the people.

AI cons




AI pros








The rise of generative AI needs to be put into context, so I'm going to explain the pros and cons of using AI in art creation. But first, let's reflect… I was born in the 1980s and witnessed the transition from computers as a novelty, to them being in most homes. As a child, I loved to draw and paint. I loved to explore everything you could do with computers and creative work.As I grew up and started doing more serious digital artwork, I would often hear the “it's just pushing a button” comment when I people discussed digital art. I could easily brush that off and explain patiently, that a computer and Photoshop were like an advanced pencil. Just tools where I still did the creative work.Today, I can’t say the same with such high confidence. Today paintings, videos, 3D models and music can all be made with just that… “a push of a button”. So the discourse becomes how can AI and human creativity work?Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksOnline Shopping ToolsAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackOnline Shopping ToolsUndoit’s an insult to human creativity to think that all of our artistic sensibility could be channelled through a single text promptIt’s easy to come to the conclusion, then, that there’s no longer any need for artists, creatives and storytellers. But to me, it’s an insult to human creativity to think that all of our artistic sensibility could be channelled through a single text prompt. Art is intent, meaning, sensitivity and most importantly of all, it’s a reflection of the complexity of a human being. Being able to create a mostly random, beautiful image with the 'push of a button' doesn’t change that.LATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloqCreative BloqWe’re still nowhere near a point in time where generative AI based on text alone can offer the same sense of control of a traditional workflow. For some projects, that loss of control is not a problem, for others that fine-grained control over any aspect of the process, is what makes or breaks the work. As OLIVER's Rod Sobral argued in his piece on AI in branding, human creativity with AI can succeed, but AI alone fails.Outside of the debate about training data, which requires an article series of its own, what are the core pro’s and cons of generative AI? Let’s start with some cons and end on a more positive note with the pros.Generative AI: the cons01. Results can be frustratingOne of the main issues with generative AI systems today is that they’re great at making images that look good, but quite bad at making the image you had in mind.02. Subscriptions are expensiveA lot of AI services are good at some aspects of image or video generation, and not great at others. If you want a more full-fledged experience, subscription fees add up unless you have the technical courage to install local AI models.03. The training data is full of biasThere have been plenty of examples of how the bias is quite strong and most AI image generative systems. Several companies are trying to make more fair models, with varying success. In many ways it’s a reflection of the bias that already exists on the internet and in society in general.04. The results are inconsistentEverything constantly shifts around, and with most tools it’s impossible to do a “hold that thought” on elements that work, while continuing to iterate on other elements.Generative AI: the pros01. It’s great for brainstorming sessionsIt’s very easy to quickly generate content for moodboards and to brainstorm on ideas. If you supply the ai systems with just a little bit of content outside of a pure text prompt, you can get some truly surprising and inspiring results.02. There are a lot of tools and workflowsChances are there’s an AI tool that fits well for exactly what you’re making. Especially the open source community around Stable Diffusion based systems like Comfy-UI and AnimateDiff are increasing the amount of creative control we have over Gen AI, on a daily basis.03. Enables exploration of 'weird' ideasBy streamlining the art-pipeline in productions 'weirder' ideas can be explored, which would otherwise be too risky for budgetary reasons. AI tools could make productions less rigid. Need to change a main character's hair or relight a sequence? That would be very costly before, but maybe not as much tomorrow.04. AI can be used as an amplifierTools like Magnific AI (as I explain in my article 'Don't fear AI') can take a relatively detailed input and add a final layer of finish to it, effectively working as a sort of 'amplifier' of your artistic intent. This is where I think generative AI is most interesting; much more so than in workflows that revolve around text prompting alone.If you want to explore AI, read Martin's views on why generative AI is too generic as well as our look at Nvidia's approach to AI for video games.

Yet less than a third of companies that employ such workers have a formal AI strategy in place. And “dangerous divides” separate knowledge workers from the leaders to whom they ultimately report. The figures and the alert are from a survey conducted by the work management platform supplier Asana and the AI safety and research startup Anthropic. Researchers from the two received completed responses from around 5,000 knowledge workers in the U.S. and U.K. Noting that more than half of knowledge workers now use gen AI, the report authors observe that organizations move through five stages along the path to full AI integration—skepticism, activation, experimentation, scaling and maturity. Along the way, they suggest, AI-primed operations do well to take five questioning strides—all starting with a “C”—to successfully traverse the five stages. 1. AI Comprehension: How well do your employees understand how to use AI? To reach AI maturity, employee understanding of the technology is crucial, and it varies significantly across stages, the authors write. At stage 1, “AI skepticism,” only 2% are familiar with generative AI basics, 6% have a strong understanding of its capabilities for their work, and 20% use AI weekly at work. More: By stage 5, “AI maturity,” familiarity with generative AI surges to 35%, 53% have a strong grasp of its capabilities, and 93% engage with AI each week.2. AI Concerns: What issues are top-of-mind for employees regarding AI?As workers develop basic AI proficiency in stages 2 and 3—“AI activation” and “AI experimentation”—new fears emerge, Asana and Anthropic point out. Contributors become increasingly concerned about others’ perceptions of their new AI use, worrying that relying on AI might be seen as taking shortcuts or producing inauthentic work. More: Data shows 29% of workers worry about being perceived as lazy and 25% feel like frauds for relying on AI to complete tasks. 3. AI Collaboration: How do employees work together with AI? Workers who see AI as a teammate are 33% more likely to report productivity gains from using AI at work, compared to those who consider it a tool. The authors further note that, as workers use AI more frequently, they begin to recognize its potential for collaboration and its capacity to assume more complex roles within their workflows. More: Workers who interact with AI on a daily basis are significantly more likely to prefer AI to act like a teammate (22%) compared to those who use it monthly (16%).4. AI Context: What AI policies, guidelines and principles frame the organization’s outlook on AI? At stage 1 (AI skepticism), only 2% of employees report that their organizations have defined AI principles, compared to 34% at stage 5 (AI maturity). By stage 5, organizations not only recognize that well-defined AI policies and principles are crucial for regulatory compliance, but they also view them as strategic assets that can differentiate them in the market. These policies and principles provide a clear framework for employees to follow when using AI, ensuring ethical, consistent and responsible usage across the organization. 5. AI Calibration: How is AI effectiveness and value measured in your organization?To effectively calibrate AI, organizations must engage their workforce in the evaluation process, the authors state. At stage 1 (AI skepticism), only 17% of workers say their organizations actively collect employee feedback on AI tools, which may contribute to the modest productivity improvements observed at this stage.By contrast, at stage 5 (AI maturity), this practice becomes well-established, with 91% of workers reporting that their organizations actively incorporate employee feedback into the AI calibration process.Download the full report.  Related reading:So much healthcare data, so many missed opportunities 10 things you may have suspected about AI but didn’t know for sure till now Submitted for consideration by all healthcare AI stakeholders: 10 principles, 6 commitments, 1 direction Dave PearsonDave P. has worked in journalism, marketing and public relations for more than 30 years, frequently concentrating on hospitals, healthcare technology and Catholic communications.

Generative AI has the potential to transform every industry and line of business, revolutionizing sectors and enabling companies to unlock new opportunities. To ensure your organization maintains its competitive edge and keeps pace with innovation, mid-to-senior level leaders need to build the knowledge and skills to understand and maximize the full potential of generative AI.
The new learning program, Unlocking Generative AI Opportunities with AWS, is a six-week learning experience developed in collaboration with the Udemy Business Leadership Academy. It is uniquely designed to equip leaders across all industries with the generative AI knowledge and change management strategies they need to develop talent successfully and drive the digital transformation within their organizations.
Throughout the experience, leaders will build the following key skills:

Generative AI technology: Organizations need tech-savvy leaders proficient in generative AI tools. This program provides access to PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock playground, where participants engage in practical exercises in prompt engineering and capability exploration to help them learn how to reimagine businesses, boost productivity, redefine customer experiences, and create new business models.
Change management: Leaders use change management skills to foster innovation and create a thriving organizational climate. Participants learn innovation concepts, engage in an innovation tournament, and generate actionable proposals for efficiency and performance improvements through generative AI projects.
Communication and collaboration: Effective communication and collaboration are the keys to inspirational leadership, building trust and confidence while enhancing decision-making and driving innovation. The program guides leaders in developing communication strategies to articulate visions, provide clear directions, and foster open dialogues.


Collaborative learning with other leaders
The program connects leaders together to solve complex problems, generate and spread ideas, coach and learn from each other, and capture knowledge within the organization. Learners connect with their peers and certified expert moderators who answer questions, nudge people along, and facilitate the cohort learning experience. To help develop leadership teams at scale, this cohort program incorporates self-paced learning modules, microlearning, hands-on practice, and live, virtual events. Participants in the cohort will present and prioritize ideas, address AI misconceptions, design strategies, and learn skills to help inspire their teams with a forward-looking vision. Ultimately, progressing from a foundational understanding of generative AI to confident application, and enthusiasm for the possibilities that generative AI can help create for organizations of all sizes.
Hands-on with Amazon Bedrock and PartyRock
Early in the program, we’ll introduce foundation models, which are vast, complex networks trained on data. Amazon Bedrock is a catalyst for innovation with generative AI and is the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications using foundation models. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies: AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon. Through a single API, Amazon Bedrock grants access to a broad set of capabilities essential for building responsible generative AI applications with security, and privacy in mind. Throughout this cohort, learners explore how Amazon Bedrock and generative AI are driving business transformation, including process automation, enhanced customer experiences, and operational efficiency. Hands-on practice is integrated throughout the learning experience, enabling you to actively build and experiment with generative AI applications. You’ll engage with PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock Playground- an intuitive platform where you can create and experiment with generative AI applications in just a few clicks.
Real-world use cases
After learning about Amazon Bedrock, you’ll then hear stories of how real teams are using generative AI to work more effectively. These stories will exemplify generative AI’s influence beyond IT with specific use cases from marketing, customer service, sales, and operations teams. With any new technology and innovation, you must be aware of how to promote the safe and responsible development of AI as a force for good. You’ll hear from the experts and discuss how others have dealt with ethical concerns that will arise as businesses begin to use generative AI. With the core dimensions of responsible AI outlined (fairness, explainability, privacy and security, robustness, and governance), you’ll have a framework to follow as generative AI gets integrated across your business.
Prompt engineering
After learning generative AI and its real-world applications, it’s time to transition to some specific uses for the technology. You’ll learn how teams interface with generative AI services and how prompt engineering comes into play. Prompt engineering is a key skill to learn how to refine your prompts, helping you improve the quality and relevance of your outputs. Imagine the freedom and opportunity of effectively communicating with AI, where every instruction is met with precise and tailored results. That’s the basis of prompt engineering.

Introducing generative AI in your organization
As the cohort progresses, you’ll get concrete guidance on how to get started and accelerate your team and your organization’s use of generative AI. Change is hard and it takes a thoughtful approach to introduce, and get your employees comfortable, with this emerging technology. You’ll understand how generative AI must start at the team-level, helping to cement and drive adoption from all parts of your organization. The experts at AWS and Udemy will help you plan your first generative AI project and then outline a path to expand generative AI’s use.
Identifying opportunities for innovation
Next, you will embark on a journey to unlock the secrets of building an innovation pipeline. First, you will explore the interplay between quantity, quality, and variety of ideas, unveiling their roles in driving a thriving innovation ecosystem. Next, you will learn to cast a wide net, exploring all sources to uncover innovation opportunities. Additionally, you will acquire techniques to generate fresh ideas and maximize the power of others’ innovations. Finally, you will gain the skills to identify and submit innovation opportunities into a cohort-based innovation tournament, fostering collaboration and synergy among innovators.
Communicating to inspire change
Did you know that a staggering 70% of change initiatives within organizations fail (Source: the McKinsey Group)? We’ll dive into this aspect of your leadership and arm you with strategies to beat the odds. You’ll master the art of crafting a compelling vision for the future that resonates deeply with you and your workforce. Additionally, you’ll acquire the skills of trustworthy leadership communication, empowering you to motivate, inspire, and guide teams towards achieving breakthrough changes. By the end, you’ll have the knowledge and tools to navigate the ever-changing landscape of organizational transformation.
Putting it all together
You’ll conclude the cohort with a collaborative team event, working together with colleagues to learn how generative AI tools like PartyRock can help you think through problems, optimize processes, and be a catalyst for innovation across your business. Through all the exercises, you’ll build confidence to use generative AI to augment and enhance your work, and the work of your team, and ignite the generative AI-powered era within your organization.

How Generative AI is Changing the Game for Software Developers

For anyone involved in software development, the rise of generative AI tools raises an uncomfortable question: “Will robots take my job?” As AI changes the coding landscape, it’s inevitable that tech professionals will have to consider how they can evolve with it. 
These generative AI tools are becoming much better at everything from writing basic code snippets to identifying bugs. At first glance, that might seem like a career-ender for junior developers—but even the most coding-intensive job requires other skills, many of which aren’t replicable by a machine.
First, it’s important to note what AI does well in terms of coding:

Easing repetitive coding tasks by generating boilerplate code.
Reviewing code for obvious bugs.
Code optimization and efficiencies.

This is all front-line stuff; as any tech pro will tell you, generative AI can’t build an entire, complex app from scratch, or figure out how a project fits into a company’s overall portfolio. Developers and engineers who use generative AI to create code still need to tweak that output to fit their specific needs; AI also can’t catch every error and efficiency as well as a human who can see all a project’s particular needs and nuances. 
Adapting to the AI Revolution
For any developer or engineer who wants to further “future proof” themselves against AI, consider the following: 

Don’t run away from AI: For better or worse, these tools are here to stay, so you better learn how to leverage them. Take the time to explore AI-powered code completion. If you’re knowledgeable about how AI works, you may even attract attention from employers who want employees who’ve mastered AI code generation. 
Problem-solving is always key: AI excels at automating tasks, but it lacks the human ability to conceptualize and solve complex problems. Hone your analytical skills and become an expert in problem-solving, and you’ll continue to attract love from recruiters and hiring managers. 
Soft Skills never go out of style: Communication and teamwork are becoming even more critical as development teams become more distributed and leverage AI tools. Develop your ability to collaborate effectively, explain technical concepts clearly, and work seamlessly with designers, product managers, and other stakeholders—you’ll boost your career longevity in the process. 
Creativity! Use the time freed up by AI to focus on the big picture. Think strategically about new features, propose solutions to long-standing problems, and become a driving force for innovation within your team.

Remember, you ignore AI at your peril: PwC recently analyzed more than half a billion job ads from 15 countries to determine how AI is impacting the current global workforce, and found that those who choose to specialize in AI can enjoy wage premiums of up to 25 percent on average. “Today, there are seven times as many postings for specialist AI jobs as there were in 2012. In contrast, postings for all jobs have grown more slowly, doubling since 2012,” the report added. This is one genie that’s not going back in the bottle.

You’re putting yourself in front of people that you would really love to get a job with and hoping that they think you tick all of their boxes... without even knowing what those boxes are.Ultimately, though, the job interview is just as much about you finding out if the job and workplace is a good fit for you and that’s why, towards the end of the interview, you’re asked if you have any questions for the team.If that question often throws you or you don’t know what to ask, Christiano Winckler at Somebody Digital revealed his six best questions for that crucial final impression.These will ensure that you understand company culture, any potential progression and if it’s a good fit for you.The best questions to ask interviewers at a job interview“What can I expect during my first week?”While this may feel very presumptuous, it’s a great question to ask to understand just how organised a company is.Winckler said:  “If the employer hints that it’s unlikely that time will be given to make introductions, show you around, or take you through the workplace roster, it can leave a new team member feeling stranded.“It can also indicate that employees experience heavy workloads that don’t allow them to partake in additional tasks, or even that progression in the workplace is slim as employees don’t tend to pay attention to each other.”“What’s the best part of working here?”This is a great one to really get a feel for how the interviewer currently feels in their role as, outside of perks and progression opportunities, this question gets to the heart of the day-to-day in the job.Winckler said: “If the interviewer struggles to state a handful of perks, it’s likely to reveal how they really feel about their place of work. It may also indicate a negative working environment, where managers are reluctant to celebrate and reward hard work and success.”He added: “The best bit of a workplace is all relative as what is considered a perk to one person may be a norm to another.“When the interviewer reveals what they consider workplace plus, it gives you the opportunity to determine if for you, that it’s simply the norm.”“Do you socialise as a team?”According to Winckler, this question is a great way to get a feel for the culture.He said: ” The question gives the interviewer the opportunity to divulge if after work drinks are the norm, and if non-attendance is taboo.“For some, a social workplace is a must, however for others it can serve as a red flag and even a sign of a toxic environment.  ”“What could I do in the role to surpass your expectations?”Job ads could conceal the real crux of the position if the duties presented are vague.Questioning ways in which to surpass the organisation’s expectations works two-fold.It creates the opportunity to determine if what is required of the role is unrealistic, or something that you will not be able to fulfil.The answer may confirm that the role is what you are seeking and give you confidence that the workplace will enable you to progress in your career“How do you recognise success?”Winckler points out that recognising success is often synonymous with promotion and many employees resign if they feel that management doesn’t recognise their achievements.He said: “If the interviewer struggles with examples on how they have previously awarded a colleague’s achievements, then this may indicate that the chances of a promotion are slim.”“How do you ensure that remote workers feel part of a team?”Since the Covid-19 pandemic, many people now work from home full-time or hybrid between home and the office.Winckler said: “It is more important than ever for employees to feel a part of a team. If collaborating with colleagues is vital for you to succeed, it’s important that you establish if the workplace culture allows you to connect with your colleagues.”Related...People Are Sharing What It's Like To Job-Hunt Over 50 — And It's HarrowingPeople Revealed What Drove Them Out Of Their Toxic WorkplacesThis Is What It's Like To Be Autistic In The Workplace","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sarah-Louise Kelly', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}",2024-06-08T06:00:20.000Z,2024-06-08T06:00:20.000Z,Ask These 6 Unconventional Questions During A Job Interview To Really Learn About The Company,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1200, 'height': 600, 'url': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/huffpost_uk_744/1636b7fd5e94d2391760f6fc9822663b'}",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ask-6-unconventional-questions-during-060020374.html,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Yahoo News', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_news_en-US_h_p_news_2.png', 'width': 310, 'height': 50}, 'url': 'https://sg.news.yahoo.com/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://media.zenfs.com/en/huffpost_uk_744/1636b7fd5e94d2391760f6fc9822663b,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sarah-Louise Kelly', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'HuffPost UK', 'url': 'http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 396, 'height': 100, 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/709278b0-35a7-11eb-bbe0-e355079cf0b3'}}",

They told me that although being a professional artist had always been tough, lately things had gotten much worse.A few weeks ago, they were contacted by a client hoping to commission a drawing. The artist jumped at the opportunity and spent several weeks putting together samples. When they sent the samples to the client, the reply they got was both disappointing and disturbing. They were told the client had used the Dall-E AI program and were able to generate an image that worked perfectly for their purposes. The artist's services were no longer needed.That sort of email isn't something an artist could have expected a decade ago, but it's a story that's no longer rare. Increasingly, the creative work of artists is being replaced by AI. It's a concern for the future of art and for the future of artists, and I think we've finally reached a turning point.To paraphrase Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, computer engineers have been so preoccupied with whether they can create AI art, that they haven't stopped to ask whether they should. The cat is out of the bag now. AI art is all around us, and this trend will very likely continue. This makes it pressing to ask important ethical questions. Is AI art good for society? What will its effect be on artists? And how might we push back?One effect of AI art is clear. For the artist I met at the bus stop, it meant the loss of a commission. That sort of business loss, multiplied many times over and coupled with other new threats (such as the shift to payment via ""exposure""), has devastating effect. For many artists this movement will mean the loss of their ability to keep themselves afloat with their art. Many will increasingly have to rely on day jobs&mdash;with the hope that those jobs will afford them enough time to make art&mdash;while others will simply have to leave the profession.Consider New York-based company Monumental Labs, founded in 2022. Monumental Labs promises to create, utilizing AI, works of stone art in mere hours that previously would have taken months and to produce those works at 85 percent less than the ""normal"" cost&mdash;that is, 85 percent less than the cost to pay a human artist. On its website, Monumental Labs declares that it is unleashing a stone art ""renaissance.""Who will benefit from such a renaissance? Companies that rely on AI, if successful in their ventures, will effectively replace many human artists. A statue in a public square that could have been created by a human sculptor for a price that helps sustain their craft and support their family will now be made on the cheap and much faster by AI. This shift is a redistribution of not just artistic labor but also artistic wealth&mdash;from the hands and mouths of artists to the hands and mouths of tech CEOs. A modern-day version of John Henry vs. the machine.If we care about keeping human artists employed and producing great works of art, something must be done.One thing we might do is ban at least some AI art. This move will likely be resisted, however, especially by businesses hoping to profit from AI and by clients hoping to cut costs. It also seems like an option that will be difficult to enforce. But it still might be worth a shot.Another option is to support human artists through things like public grants, in effect subsidizing artists much like we already subsidize many businesses. Artist grants already exist and have good results, but they're rather difficult to obtain. We'd need to drastically increase their availability. Yet the instability of the political world suggests this option might not be so insulated from things like funding cuts or&mdash;perhaps more troubling&mdash;censorship. If conservatives take control of government again, it's conceivable they'd only approve grants for works in line with their values. That's a problem for maintaining the full range of artistic creativity and turns surviving as an artist into something that depends on one's politics.Another option is the free market. Television and streaming services are less influenced by government and depend primarily on advertising for their existence. And yet, many works on television and streaming services still face undue pressure from advertisers. It's also not hard to imagine a company like Netflix moving to produce AI-generated content if doing so would cut costs.The best tool we have left, it seems, is our ability to make individual choices. When a government or private client chooses to pay for a work of art created by a human being rather than by AI, they in effect choose to support real artists and not just leave them out to dry&mdash;they choose to help promote real artists and not a tech company that seems bent on replacing them. This is the old story of voting with your dollar. It's a move available to all of us and across a wide range of artistic media. We can choose to pay for a movie created by humans, or a movie created by AI; a song created by a human, or song created by AI. We can help keep human artists alive and creating their works for future generations while simultaneously choosing to withhold support from those who seek their replacement.Human-made art holds important values, and human artists are people like you and me&mdash;they deserve to eat and be able to pursue their passions. If we care about human artists, we need to accept that AI art is a real problem, and we need to make an effort to address it.Shawn Simpson is a Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.",,,,Artificial Intelligence Threatens Disaster for Artists,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'AI-Driven Deep Fakes Are Here To Stay', 'description': ""Instead of detecting what is fake, news organizations should focus on what's real, according to cybersecurity expert Louis Steinberg of CTM Insights."", 'thumbnailUrl': ['https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2362962/louis-steinberg-interview.png?w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;q=88&amp;f=aa05f00a64dc5f89cbb4a718f8349868'], 'uploadDate': '2024-03-15T14:04:56-04:00', 'duration': 'PT9M2S', 'contentUrl': 'https://video.newsweek.com/transcoder/480p/2918/louis-steinberg-interview-1710524105.m3u8'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While its voice capabilities are improving daily, OpenAI recently put its voice cloning on hold. Using just a 15-second clip of your voice, it can produce results that are indistinguishable from the real thing by analysis technology. While this opens up a world of opportunities, it is also extremely dangerous in a year where dozens of countries around the world will head to the polls for elections.It’s also worth noting that generative AI is still largely general-purpose in nature. It won’t be long, however, before more specialised tools become widely available; enhancing productivity levels and effectiveness across industries. In the customer experience (CX) space, for example, the coupling of generative AI with conversation process and orchestration tools is enabling the automation of high volumes of rule-bound sales, support and service conversations – all at the level of a human expert.Given these rapid advancements, it’s baffling how slow even major players in the contact centre space have been to incorporate generative AI tools. What makes this even more concerning is that contact centres are among the businesses that face the biggest threat of disruption from these technological advances.Virtual agentsGenerative AI, when blended into an intelligent automation ecosystem, allows human agents to have dramatically improved and more effective conversations. Agents can be guided through every conversation without having to know all the details or rules. Resulting actions, such as email scripts and call summaries, can also be done by AI. This reduces training and ramp-up times, improves first call resolution and allows agents to handle more calls without all the post-call work.More significantly, however, is the emergence of generative AI-powered virtual agents. These “conversation experts” can engage directly with customers via chat channels, email, web, app and phone. Unlike chatbots, they can have conversations that stick to compliance guardrails yet adapt dynamically to customer context and change in direction. As a result, they can now resolve huge volumes of customer queries without relying on a human in the loop.New opportunitiesWhile virtual agents are sure to take over the processing of most rule-bound engagements, there is still an important role for humans in the growing CX space. Since they are freed from largely transactional roles, human agents have more time to focus on the calls where empathy, humour and emotional intelligence are critical.From a customer perspective, having real time access to a service expert is highly appealing. Rather than waiting in a call queue, they can instantly be put through to a virtual agent. This can be very helpful when call volumes spike or no human agents are available.Imagine calling a hotel you have booked in a different time zone, without realising that it is 1am, to ask what time breakfast is. Based on your booking, a virtual AI agent can respond that your booking does not have breakfast attached. It would also notice you have a small child on your booking, but have not requested a cot. It could book that cot and your breakfast, without anyone in the hotel having to stay up to answer your call.For many organisations, the speed at which these technologies are evolving makes knowing where to start and how to make it work feel a little daunting. They may lack the capital or buy-in to hire the skills needed to fully embrace these new technologies. For these companies, partnering with a specialist that removes the learning curve and speeds up the time to impact is appealing. These “digital business process outsourcings” can effectively build and manage your virtual agent for you - ensuring your customers can immediately speak to a capable expert via the channel of their choice, at any time.A wait-and-see approach to generative AI and virtual agents may feel safer, but the speed at which things are moving could simply heighten the pain of the inevitable disruption.This technology is not going away. It is not a fad and its impact will be felt much quicker than many expect.• Falkenberg is co-CEO of CLEVVARelated Topics:job advicecareer advicemzansi jobsdream jobsmartsmart worksopportunitiesjob interviewjob alerttechnologyartificial intelligencechatgptYou may likeEssential tips to safeguard yourself from financial scamsBy Staff ReporterInitiative to provide multilingual books to ECD centres to tackle the literacy crisis in SABy Anita NkonkiGauteng health welcomes postponement of Cancer Alliance court caseBy Siyabonga SitholeRead nextJoburg GLU partners want the mayor outBy Sipho Jack","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Smart Works', 'url': 'https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/contact-centres-must-embrace-generative-ai-or-risk-being-left-behind-a7bbd9bc-50b2-48b4-b2fa-0d53ce3e0cdf'}",2024-06-06T10:42:57.000Z,2024-06-06T10:40:41.000Z,Contact centres must embrace generative AI or risk being left behind,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/4d3980f44e466e64a6fc5e4d3ec5765f8de47fab/2000', 'width': 2000, 'height': 1333}]","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/contact-centres-must-embrace-generative-ai-or-risk-being-left-behind-a7bbd9bc-50b2-48b4-b2fa-0d53ce3e0cdf'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'IOL | News that Connects South Africans', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.iol.co.za/logo.jpg', 'width': '60', 'height': '60'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Short




LLMs or large language models are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can understand and generate human language, based on probability.
LLMs are built on transformer-based neural networks and trained on a large corpus of textual data including books, articles, websites, and more.
The larger the LLM model, the more capabilities it exhibits. It can generate code, deduce patterns, and understand complex reasoning questions.
 



After OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, the world has witnessed new technological advancements, and it seems there is no end to this ever-expanding development. AI Chatbots have been released by Google, Microsoft, Meta, Anthropic, and a score of other companies. All of the chatbots are powered by LLMs (Large Language Models). But what exactly is a large language model and how does it work? To learn about LLMs, follow our explainer below.

A Basic Definition of LLM
An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is trained on a large dataset of texts. It’s designed to understand and generate human language based on principles of probability. It’s essentially a deep-learning algorithm. An LLM can generate essays, poems, articles, and letters; generate code; translate texts from one language to another, summarize texts, and more.

The larger the training dataset, the better the LLM’s natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Generally, AI researchers contend that LLMs with 2 billion or more parameters are “large” language models. If you are wondering what is a parameter, it’s the number of variables on which the model is trained. The larger the parameter size, the larger will be the model, and will have more capabilities.



To give you an example, when OpenAI released the GPT-2 LLM in 2019, it was trained on 1.5 billion parameters. Later in 2020, GPT-3 was released with 175 billion parameters, over 116x larger model. And the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model has 1.76 trillion parameters.



As you can see, over time, the parameter size is getting larger, bringing advanced and more complex capabilities to large language models.

How LLMs Work: The Training Process
In simple terms, LLMs learn to predict the next word in a sentence. This learning process is called pre-training where the model is trained on a large corpus of text including books, articles, news, extensive textual data from websites, Wikipedia, and more.



In this pre-training process, a model learns how a language works, its grammar, syntax, facts about the world, reasoning abilities, patterns, and more. Once the pre-training is done, a model goes through the fine-tuning process. As you can deduce, fine-tuning is done on specific datasets. 



For example, if you want the LLM to be good at coding, you fine-tune it on extensive coding datasets. Similarly, if you want the model to be good at creative writing, you train the LLM on a large corpus of literature material, poems, etc.

What is the Transformer Architecture for LLMs?
Almost all modern LLMs are built on the transformer architecture, but what is it exactly? Let’s briefly go through the history of LLMs. In the pre-transformer era, there were several neural network architectures like RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and more.



However, in 2017, researchers from the Google Brain team released a seminal paper called “Attention is All You Need” (Vaswani, et al). This paper introduced the Transformer architecture which has now become the foundation of all LLMs dealing with natural language processing tasks. The core idea of the transformer architecture is self-attention.

It can process all words in a sentence parallelly, understanding the context and relationship between words. It also leads to efficient training as it unlocks parallelism. After the paper was released, Google released the first transformer-based LLM called BERT in 2018. Later, OpenAI joined in and released its first GPT-1 model on the same architecture.

Applications of LLMs
We already know that LLMs now power AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and more. It can perform NLP tasks including text generation, translation, summarization, code generation, writing stories, poems, etc. LLMs are also being used for conversational assistants.




Recently, OpenAI demoed its GPT-4o model which is remarkable at engaging in conversations. Apart from that, LLMs are already being tested for creating AI agents that can perform tasks for you. Both OpenAI and Google are working to bring AI agents in the near future. 



Overall, LLMs are being widely deployed as customer chatbots and used for content generation as well. While large language models are on the rise, ML researchers believe that another breakthrough is required to achieve AGI — an AI system more intelligent than humans.



We have not seen such breakthrough developments in the Generative AI era yet, however, some researchers believe that training a much larger LLM could lead to some level of consciousness in AI models.

Apple’s AI features may run on these iPhonesAccording to a report by Bloomberg, users will need an iPhone 15 Pro or the upcoming iPhone 16 models, which are expected to arrive later this year, to access these AI features. This rumoured requirement might be due to the processing hardware necessary to support these AI features, especially for tasks that require on-device processing. As per the report, these tasks may require the A17 Pro chipset, which is only available in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, come equipped with the A16 Bionic chipset which are not suitable for these tasks.Untitled Carousel 110849833 110816773However, Mac and iPad users may not need the latest model to access the AI features. The report notes that an M1 chip is sufficient for these tasks. Currently, Apple offers iPads and Mac models that come powered by M4 and M3 chips, respectively. This suggests that users with slightly older devices may still have compatibility.Users who don't own the iPhone 15 Pro may still be able to experience some of iOS 18's AI features, especially for the ones that run on the cloud. However, for the full iOS 18 experience, users may want to need an upgrade. Why on-device processing is important for usersOn-device processing of AI tasks has two main advantages -- enhanced security for information and reduced latency. However, older iPhone models may lack the processing power needed to handle these tasks.

Apple had been among the tech giants most conspicuously absent from — or at least, low-key about — the generative AI craze, at least until today.
At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC 2024) in Cupertino, California, the company unveiled its biggest push into generative AI so far: a new service called Apple Intelligence, which will offer a variety of features across Apple devices including Mac computers, iPhones, and iPads.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



The service is not an app per se, rather, it is a set of features embedded within other popular apps, from web browser Safari (where you can summarize articles) to Mail (where it can rewrite and suggest grammar improvements) to Photos (auto generate photo albums on specific subjects and topics set to music based on a text prompt) to Messages (where it can create custom AI generated emoji and photos of your contacts, as well as event and group photos).
As with nearly all new Apple announcements of the company’s storied history, the Apple Intelligence announcement was watched by a large audience of tech workers and journalists, as well as creatives, and some notable entrepreneurs and executives from rival firms. 
It also inspired a wide range of responses, from some interpreting the announcement as underwhelming or undermining of Apple’s reputation as a company where minimalistic and clean designs are prioritized, while others viewed it as one of, if not the best examples of generative AI done right. Here are some of the most interesting reactions I saw:
High praise from former rivals
Steven Sinofsky, the former president of the Windows Division at Microsoft and current board partner at Andreessen Horowitz, called Apple Intelligence “really excellent work.”



He also said he thought the idea of weaving Apple Intelligence through its various Apple-branded apps was “exactly right and even more so when combined with privacy/on device.”



And, as if that wasn’t enough of a favorable review, Sinofsky also took the opportunity to ding Google and his own former employer Microsoft in comparison to Apple’s approach:

Similarly, Andrej Karpathy, an esteemed researcher who was previously director of artificial intelligence and Autopilot Vision at Tesla (where he competed with Apple’s abandoned self-driving car project) and a co-founder of OpenAI, said in a post on X that he found Apple Intelligence “super exciting.”



Double standard?
Bilawal Sidhu, host of the TED Talks AI Show and a former Google Maps AR/VR engineer, wrote a lengthy post on X comparing how Apple Intelligence leverages personal data on the device in which it operates, as well as virtual private clouds, to serve up AI responses — a tack that he saw as similar to Microsoft’s new Recall feature for Windows Copilot + PCs that faced intense backlash from some users and researchers for possible data security risks. Microsoft Recall was, as of last week, disabled by default and now must be turned on by the user during setup. advertisement



AI images and Genmoji: love/hate?
One of the most immediately obvious use cases for Apple Intelligence for regular users is in its ability to create custom imagery and emoji based on their text prompts within Messages and other apps. 
Open source software developer and AI influencer Simon Willison took to his blog to commend Apple’s approach toward AI image generation, writing:
“This feels like a clever way to address some of the ethical objections people have to this specific category of AI tool:

If you can’t create photorealistic images, you can’t generate deepfakes or offensive photos of people
By having obvious visual styles you ensure that AI generated images are instantly recognizable as such, without watermarks or similar
Avoiding the ability to clone specific artist’s styles further helps sidestep ethical issues about plagiarism and copyright infringement

The social implications of this are interesting too. Will people be more likely to share AI-generated images if there are no awkward questions or doubts about how they were created, and will that help it more become socially acceptable to use them?“
Others criticized the look and feel of the cartoonish AI generated images in Messages:

A third-party app killer
Various users pointed out that by integrating a number of AI features across its native apps, Apple was essentially killing third-party AI-powered apps and services that sought to offer similar functionality prior to the news today and the absence of Apple Intelligence.









Questions about training data
Other users on X, including some visual artists and tech workers opposed to the practices of generative AI model providers training without express consent on vast swaths of artwork and creative work posted to the web, questioned exactly how Apple had trained its underlying Apple Intelligence AI models — the company mentioned both language and diffusion models in its keynote announcement — and on what specific data.






One Apple executive present at WWDC told Axios’s Ina Fried that the models were trained on “data from the public web” combined with licensed, or paid, data.



AI is a feature not a product?
Apple’s choice to weave the Apple Intelligence service throughout its apps also had The Information founder and CEO Jessica Lessin musing that the approach was likely to be seen as influential.



Clearly, a wide range of reactions and they’re still rolling in. What do you think about Apple Intelligence so far?

IBM Study: Banking and Financial Markets CEOs are Betting on Generative AI to Stay Competitive, Yet Workforce and Culture Challenges Persist

By Technology For You -   June 7, 2024 






Share
FacebookLinkedinTwitterWhatsAppPinterestTelegram




Two-thirds (66%) of banking and financial markets CEOs surveyed said that the potential productivity gains from AI and automation are so great that they must accept the risks to stay competitive.
65% of financial institution leaders say that succeeding with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself and 60% recognize they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some might find comfortable.
Half (50%) of financial services CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI-related roles that did not exist last year and 53% indicate they are struggling to fill key technology positions.


New findings from the IBM Institute for Business Value revealed that banking and financial markets (BFM) CEOs are facing workforce and culture and challenges as they act quickly to implement and scale generative AI across their organizations.
The findings are part of an annual global cross-industry study that surveyed more than 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries, which included 297 BFM CEOs representing retail, corporate, commercial and investment banks and financial markets.
The survey found that generative AI is perceived as the key to unlocking competitiveness. 57% of BFM CEOs surveyed stated that gaining a competitive advantage in the sector will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.
The findings also revealed that CEOs are navigating complex issues around culture in the era of AI. 59% of surveyed BFM CEOs stated that cultural change within a business is more important than overcoming technical challenges when becoming a data-driven business, with 65% also believing success with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself.
Despite this, 60% of surveyed BFM CEOs say they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some employees might find comfortable. Yet 43% acknowledged that their employees do not fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.
Skills also proved to be an area of focus for the CEOs. While 60% of surveyed BFM CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles. In addition, 50% of these CEOs said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist this time last year due to generative AI, showing the rapid shift occurring in the workforce.
“Our research reflects the tremendous pressure CEOs are under to keep their competitive edge. Alongside profitability and productivity, getting the right skills remains a persistent challenge, with CEOs now hiring for roles that did not exist until recently,” said Shanker Ramamurthy, Global Managing Partner Banking & Financial Markets, IBM Consulting. “Workforce needs are shifting rapidly in the financial services sector and CEOs must ensure that upskilling programs are prioritized as an important element of any financial institution’s enterprise strategy for scaling generative AI.”
In addition, 66% of BFM CEOs surveyed stated that the potential productivity gains from automation are so great that they would accept significant risks to stay competitive, with 67% saying they would risk more than their competitor to maintain competitive edge.
However, BFM CEOs recognized that trust cannot be sacrificed for innovation. 64% of surveyed BFM CEOs agreed that maintaining customer trust will have a greater impact on success than any specific product or service, and 83% acknowledged that transparency around adopting new technologies was critical for fostering trust among customers and employees.
“CEOs in the banking and financial markets sector are keenly aware of the competitive benefits that generative AI will bring and are eager to move quickly,” said John Duigenan, Distinguished Engineer & General Manager, Global Financial Services Industry at IBM. “In their enthusiasm to embrace the benefits of this potent new technology, it’s critical that financial services leaders ensure their institutions are taking steps to engineer trustworthy AI designed to reduce risk and win the confidence of their customers, employees and regulators.”
Key Study Findings
BFM CEOs are hedging their bets on generative AI to stay competitive and are willing to take risks to achieve this.

57% of respondents believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.
Two-thirds (66%) of those surveyed agreed that the potential productivity gains from automation are so great that they would accept significant risks to stay competitive and 67% said they would take more risk than their competitors to maintain a competitive advantage.
However, customer trust was not a sacrifice CEOs are willing to make. 64% surveyed agreed that maintaining customer trust will have a greater impact on success than any specific product, and 83% acknowledged transparency in adopting new technologies is critical for fostering trust among customers and employees.

The workforce is shifting rapidly.

50% of CEOs surveyed said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist last year due to the rise of generative AI.
Yet, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles.
60% of respondents said their current team has the knowledge and skills to incorporate new technologies like AI.
Only 40% of respondents have assessed the potential impact of generative AI on their workforce.
Surveyed CEOs say 34% of their workforce will require retraining and reskilling over the next three years – up from just 7% in 2021.

Financial institution leaders recognize it takes a cultural shift to scale AI successfully but face collaboration and adoption challenges within their organizations.

64% of CEOs surveyed say their organization’s success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet half (50%) say competition among their C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration.
59% agree that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven business than overcoming technical challenges.
65% of BFM CEOs say that succeeding with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself.
At the same time, 43% acknowledge that their employees do not fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.
60% of surveyed CEOs say they push for AI adoption more quickly than some might find comfortable.
64% of surveyed BFM CEOs say to win the future, they must rewrite their organizational playbook.
72% plan to maintain or accelerate their organization’s pace of transformational change in
2024.

Productivity is a top priority but focusing on short-term targets may hinder long-term progress.

BFM CEOs ranked tech modernization as their highest priority for the next three years.
Productivity, profitability, and scalability were identified as the biggest challenges facing BFM CEOs over the next three years, with 46% agreeing that generative AI will be one of the most useful tools in helping them overcome these challenges.
However, BFM CEOs identified the focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation.

<p>Generative AI is a hotly debated topic these days. It involves computers that collect data from global sources to create text, movies, and images. The core of this discussion is comprised of numerous questions. Can production businesses use it as a means of making cost savings? Is the merchandise genuinely subpar? And, given the debate, why do CEOs appear so intent on using it? Producer Chris Miller recently answered the latter, which has been a major topic of controversy. In particular, he declared that ""Beyond the Spider-Verse"" will not use any generative AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This issue came into sharper focus after IndieWire reported on May 30 that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra informed investors of the studio's interest in producing films and television content more efficiently using AI. This statement naturally raised concerns, especially regarding movies like the third installment of the Spider-Verse series. These films are known for their stunning visuals, which are painstakingly crafted. The prospect of Sony using generative AI for the sake of efficiency worried many fans and industry professionals alike. In response to these concerns, Chris Miller made a clear stance on Twitter: ""There is no generative AI in Beyond the Spider-Verse and there never will be. One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.""</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's essential to recognize that while the Spider-Verse movies have utilized AI programs, they have not employed generative AI. Instead, they have integrated ethical and smart-use machine learning techniques to eliminate repetitive tasks and assist artists in adhering more accurately to 3D geometry. According to effects supervisor Pav Grochola, the team decided to use machine learning to enhance artists' productivity by providing an initial predicted result that would give them a reasonable first pass at creating ink lines on the characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This distinction between ethical machine learning and generative AI is crucial. Machine learning, when used responsibly, can significantly aid artists by speeding up mundane tasks, allowing them to focus more on the creative aspects of their work. In contrast, generative AI often raises ethical concerns because it can undermine the efforts of numerous real humans and relies on the work of others without proper attribution or compensation. This difference is not just technical but ethical, affecting how content is produced and valued in the creative industries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concerns surrounding generative AI are not unfounded. Many fear that its use in film and TV could lead to a decline in the quality of content, as the unique touch of human creativity might be lost. Additionally, there are valid worries about the potential for job losses among artists and creators whose work could be replaced by AI-generated content. Despite these issues, some industry leaders see generative AI as a tool for achieving greater efficiency and cost savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img src=""https://theubj.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-222.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-255364""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, as Chris Miller and others argue, the true value of films like those in the Spider-Verse series lies in their ability to push the boundaries of visual storytelling and create something genuinely new and original. By relying on generative AI, there is a risk of producing content that feels generic and uninspired, lacking the distinctiveness that human creativity brings. The debate over AI in the creative industries is far from over. Machine learning, when used appropriately, can be a powerful tool to help artists achieve their goals more quickly and efficiently. But generative AI, with its potential to devalue human effort and creativity, remains a contentious issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now, it seems that at least some creators, like those behind the Spider-Verse films, are committed to preserving the integrity and uniqueness of their work by steering clear of generative AI. This commitment is evident in the Spider-Verse team's approach to using technology. They leverage AI for repetitive tasks, not for creative ones. This approach helps maintain the human touch in their films, ensuring that each project retains its artistic integrity and originality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The broader industry is watching these developments closely. As AI technology continues to evolve, the line between helpful tools and unethical shortcuts will be scrutinized. The ongoing discussion about AI in film and TV will likely influence other creative sectors as well, from music and literature to graphic design and beyond. The core of the debate is not just about efficiency or cost but about the essence of creativity itself. How do we balance technological advancements with the irreplaceable value of human creativity?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Anderson, the Senior Editor for Nerdist, and host of the weekly pop culture deep-dive podcast Laser Focus, has weighed in on this debate. Through his reviews and commentary, he highlights the ongoing tension between the technological advancements that can aid production and the need to maintain the human element that makes creative works truly special. This discussion is likely to continue as the industry grapples with finding the right balance between innovation and preserving the artistry that defines great filmmaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the direction AI will take in the creative industries is unclear, the Spider-Verse film series' creators have set the standard. It's an appeal to respect human ingenuity and see technology as an aid rather than a substitute. The industry needs to tread carefully in these waters, making sure that even as we adopt new technologies, we don't lose sight of the fundamental elements that contribute to the human resonance of creative works. The future of all creative expression, including film and television, will be determined by this equilibrium.</p>
