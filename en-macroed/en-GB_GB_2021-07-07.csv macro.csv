Artificial intelligence has become one of the key themes in the oil & gas sector of late, with companies hiring for increasingly more roles, making more deals, registering more patents and mentioning it more often in company filings.
These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels.
According to GlobalData analysis, Saudi Arabian Oil Co is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the oil & gas industry, having advertised for 29 positions in artificial intelligence, made zero deals related to the field, filed 34 patents and mentioned artificial intelligence one times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021.

Our analysis classified one companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional four companies are classified as Market Leaders and zero are Average Players. 10 more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence.
For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the oil & gas sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 316 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021. The company reached peak hiring in January 2020, when it listed 63 new job ads related to artificial intelligence.
Total SE followed Royal Dutch Shell Plc as the second most proactive artificial intelligence employer, advertising for 101 new positions. Exxon Mobil Corp was third with 63 new job listings.
﻿
One of the most innovative oil & gas companies in recent months was Saudi Arabian Oil Co, having filed 34 patent applications related to artificial intelligence since the beginning of last year. It was followed by China Petroleum & Chemical Corp with one patent.
GlobalData collects patent filings from 100+ counties and jurisdictions. These patents are then tagged according to the themes they relate to, including artificial intelligence, based on specific keywords and expert input. The patents are also assigned to a company to identify the most innovative players in a particular field.
﻿
Finally, artificial intelligence was a commonly mentioned theme in oil & gas company filings. Royal Dutch Shell Plc mentioned artificial intelligence three times in its corporate reports between January 2020 and June 2021. Petroleo Brasileiro SA filings mentioned it three times.

These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels.
According to GlobalData analysis, Siemens AG is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the power industry, having advertised for 1,397 positions in artificial intelligence, made zero deals related to the field, filed 81 patents and mentioned artificial intelligence one times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021.
Our analysis classified two companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional seven companies are classified as Market Leaders and one are Average Players. 11 more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence.
For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the power sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers.

Siemens AG is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 1,397 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021. The company reached peak hiring in February 2021, when it listed 134 new job ads related to artificial intelligence.
E.ON SE followed Siemens AG as the second most proactive artificial intelligence employer, advertising for 446 new positions. Schneider Electric SE was third with 178 new job listings.

When it comes to deals, Chubu Electric Power Co Inc leads with one new artificial intelligence deal announced from January 2020 to June 2021.
GlobalData's Financial Deals Database covers hundreds of thousands of M&A contracts, private equity deals, venture finance deals, private placements, IPOs and partnerships, and it serves as an indicator of economic activity within a sector.

One of the most innovative power companies in recent months was Siemens AG, having filed 81 patent applications related to artificial intelligence since the beginning of last year. It was followed by Vestas Wind Systems AS with three patents and Electricite de France SA with one.
GlobalData collects patent filings from 100+ counties and jurisdictions. These patents are then tagged according to the themes they relate to, including artificial intelligence, based on specific keywords and expert input. The patents are also assigned to a company to identify the most innovative players in a particular field.

Finally, artificial intelligence was a commonly mentioned theme in power company filings. Schneider Electric SE mentioned artificial intelligence four times in its corporate reports between January 2020 and June 2021. Centrica Plc filings mentioned it two times and Southern Co mentioned it two times.

Deep learning and AI are drastically changing industries such as healthcare, financial services and retail. Many companies welcome these new technologies. However, Human Resources (HR) departments are having a harder time integrating intelligent systems into their workflows.
HR departments manage organizations' employees —hiring, firing, resolving disputes, payroll, benefits and more. Many of these tasks seem ripe for automation but handing over the reins to machine learning models poses interesting ethical challenges.
AI Uses in Human ResourcesHiring and OnboardingEmployee SchedulingWorkforce Analytics
 
Hiring and Onboarding
The hiring process is laborious and expensive. From reviewing resumes, to interviewing and training new employees, onboarding new employees can carry astronomical costs to organizations—not to mention the new employee’s salary and benefits package. Making the wrong decision can cost even more money if the employee is a poor performer or the new hire isn’t a good fit for the position—then the process starts all over again. Not only will the organization incur the new-hire onboarding costs a second time, but there are also the peripheral costs of lost productivity to consider.
As a result, many companies have looked towards deep learning to reduce the cost of recruiting and hiring employees while increasing the quality of new hires. As we might expect, these attempts haven’t always gone as planned.
From 2014 to 2018, a team at Amazon built systems to review applicants’ resumes in an effort to streamline the process of recruiting top talent. In order to train their algorithm, the team compiled a training data set using resumes submitted to the organization over the previous ten years.
Amazon hoped this system would drastically reduce the time it took to identify the most competitive applicants by automatically identifying the top x number of potential employees. However, these engineers discovered the system was favoring male over female applicants. This was because more male than female job seekers submitted resumes to Amazon, creating a biased, skewed data set.
Creating unbiased automated hiring systems can be a difficult task. Since most companies rarely have exact gender parity, the model will identify factors it thinks are most telling of a good hire but are actually illegal for hiring managers to consider. If you’ve hired more men than women in the past, your algorithm will think men are more qualified hires than women. It all comes down to the data you’re feeding your model.
In order to create accurate hiring decisions and candidate ranking systems, we must take care when assembling the data sets to eliminate unwanted bias. For example, you may want to consider hardcoding your model to disregard certain features such as name, gender and race.

Employee Scheduling
HR departments (or people teams as many companies are starting to call them) that manage hourly employees have a daunting task when creating schedules. When your employees are part- or full-time shift workers, scheduling conflicts will inevitably arise. Because of the unpredictable work schedule, a key function of HR managers (and often general managers) is managing time off and shift change requests.
If you ask any restaurant or retail store manager, scheduling and it’s related tasks often take up a large portion of their work day. However, deep learning systems are starting to take on this burden.
Automated systems can analyze employees’ requests and automatically approve or deny them based on predefined business rules. For example, many organizations that employ part-time shift workers do not allow their employees to work more than 40 hours in a given week. If a shift change request puts one employee above 40 hours for the week, the system would decline the request without any human intervention.
These systems become even more powerful when combined with predicted demand information. Accurately predicting when a particular shift requires additional employees and adjusting schedules or time-off requests accordingly can improve employee management efficiency. For instance, a restaurant’s automated staffing algorithm can learn about trends in diner traffic over time. The restaurant can then save on labor costs when demand is historically low and can also ensure adequate staffing when demand is high.

Do these technologies create a new age in productivity or simply remove the human from HR?

While these systems can drastically improve employee management and reduce the workload for managers, it could hurt employee morale. Often, time off and shift change requests can be personal in nature. If an automated system denies time off for an important event, the employee may grow resentful towards the organization and begin looking for work elsewhere. In today's tight labor market, that's a cost many employers shouldn't be willing to take.
For automated scheduling systems to work, it’s important to thoroughly define business rules and ensure there’s a way for employees to appeal the model’s decision through their manager.

Workforce Analytics
Analytics teams allow organizations to harness their data in ways never before imagined, giving companies the power to make more data-informed decisions than ever before.
When we think about business data, we often picture organizations collecting data on their customers to better serve them. However, many organizations are also collecting data on their employees.

Distilling an employee into a series of metrics can dehumanize the management process and make employees feel like nothing more than a number.

Analyzing key employee metrics allows HR departments to better understand their workforce. Tracking employees’ sentiment, productivity, connection to the organization and even diversity metrics can empower HR departments to better allocate resources and improve their workforce’s efficiency. In addition, predictive analytics models can help identify employees at risk of leaving the organization or likely to be promoted.
While workforce analytics may seem like an obvious choice for HR departments, employees may not have the same perspective. Distilling an employee into a series of metrics can dehumanize the management process and make employees feel like nothing more than a number.

The Future of People Management
Machine learning and AI have promising applications in human resources. However, switching from human to machine-driven people management can cause major issues for employee relations and worker morale within an organization. Do these technologies create a new age in productivity or simply remove the human from HR? Time will tell.

The world is now at a crucial point in technology evolution. The future depends on its deployment across all industries today, including in higher education.Artificial Intelligence-based technologies are thought to promote rather than hinder democratic values including freedom, equality, and transparency. AI-based technologies can become a tool to promote equity and personalized learning.For the past 20 years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made some advances in higher education, but not enough. Although the engagement of human teachers will be required for some more years, it is likely that in a distant future the role of human educators will suffer dramatic changes when AI-powered robots enter the classroom.Yet, today, the collaboration between human teachers and Artificial Intelligence is paramount to prepare the future generations for the AI-infused work environment that awaits them.Artificial Intelligence enhances higher education at all levels. One of the most relevant tasks of AI in education is to provide personalization at scale. However, resolving what is the best way to integrate human interaction and face-to-face learning with the promise of AI technologies remains a great challenge.As a consequence, there has been a significant sluggish adoption of AI in most of the colleges and universities at global scale. Sadly, this has positioned the education sector among the late adopters of AI.However, exciting news about the University of Buckingham in England, announcing the world’s first program degree incorporating Industry 4.0 technologies has given wings to Education 4.0.According to Stanford University’s One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, interactive machine tutors can now be matched to students for teaching science, math, language, and other disciplines. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and crowdsourcing have boosted online learning and enabled teachers in higher education to multiply the size of their classrooms while addressing individual students’ learning needs and styles.Over the next ten years, the use of AI and other technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Holograms, and Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) in the classroom as well as in the home is likely to expand significantly, provided they can be integrated with face-to-face learning.The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030 is a long-term investigation of the field of AI and its influences on people, their communities, and society. The study is periodically reviewed by experts in the field.AI in higher education and the three paradigms The development of computing and information processing techniques has brought Artificial Intelligence to a place where its many applications can be extensively applied in higher education. AI in education (AIEd) opens countless new opportunities, unmasks potentials, and challenges both educators and students in educational practices.A recent research paper by Fan Ouyang and Pengcheng Jiao from Zhejiang University entitled Artificial Intelligence in Education: The Three Paradigms, proposes that in the short history of AI in education, we can differentiate three paradigms for Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) as follows:Paradigm One: AI-directed - Learner-as-recipient AI is used to represent knowledge models and direct cognitive learning while learners are recipients of AI serviceParadigm Two: AI-supported - Learner-as-collaboratorAI is used to support learning while learners work as collaborators with AIParadigm Three: AI-empowered - learner-as-leader AI is used to empower learning while learners take agency to learnThe developing trend of AIEd has been focused toward empowering learning agency and personalization as well as enabling learners to reflect on learning and inform AI systems to adapt accordingly. The ultimate goal is toward a learner-centered, data-driven, and personalized learning experience.In preparation for more AIEd and Education 4.0, join Fierce Education and higher education executives for a ‘Business & Leadership: Summer Edition’ virtual event on July 14 to discuss immediate topics that need to be tackled this summer, and to learn what some university leaders are doing to alter their business models to excel in the Education 3.0 world, a stepping stone into the future of education.

Boiling is not just for heating up dinner. It’s also for cooling things down. Turning liquid into gas removes energy from hot surfaces, and keeps everything from nuclear power plants to powerful computer chips from overheating. But when surfaces grow too hot, they might experience what’s called a boiling crisis.
In a boiling crisis, bubbles form quickly, and before they detach from the heated surface, they cling together, establishing a vapor layer that insulates the surface from the cooling fluid above. Temperatures rise even faster and can cause catastrophe. Operators would like to predict such failures, and new research offers insight into the phenomenon using high-speed infrared cameras and machine learning.
Matteo Bucci, the Norman C. Rasmussen Assistant Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, led the new work, published June 23 in Applied Physics Letters. In previous research, his team spent almost five years developing a technique in which machine learning could streamline relevant image processing. In the experimental setup for both projects, a transparent heater 2 centimeters across sits below a bath of water. An infrared camera sits below the heater, pointed up and recording at 2,500 frames per second with a resolution of about 0.1 millimeter. Previously, people studying the videos would have to manually count the bubbles and measure their characteristics, but Bucci trained a neural network to do the chore, cutting a three-week process to about five seconds. “Then we said, ‘Let’s see if other than just processing the data we can actually learn something from an artificial intelligence,’” Bucci says.
The goal was to estimate how close the water was to a boiling crisis. The system looked at 17 factors provided by the image-processing AI: the “nucleation site density” (the number of sites per unit area where bubbles regularly grow on the heated surface), as well as, for each video frame, the mean infrared radiation at those sites and 15 other statistics about the distribution of radiation around those sites, including how they’re changing over time. Manually finding a formula that correctly weighs all those factors would present a daunting challenge. But “artificial intelligence is not limited by the speed or data-handling capacity of our brain,” Bucci says. Further, “machine learning is not biased” by our preconceived hypotheses about boiling.
To collect data, they boiled water on a surface of indium tin oxide, by itself or with one of three coatings: copper oxide nanoleaves, zinc oxide nanowires, or layers of silicon dioxide nanoparticles. They trained a neural network on 85 percent of the data from the first three surfaces, then tested it on 15 percent of the data of those conditions plus the data from the fourth surface, to see how well it could generalize to new conditions. According to one metric, it was 96 percent accurate, even though it hadn’t been trained on all the surfaces. “Our model was not just memorizing features,” Bucci says. “That’s a typical issue in machine learning. We’re capable of extrapolating predictions to a different surface.”
The team also found that all 17 factors contributed significantly to prediction accuracy (though some more than others). Further, instead of treating the model as a black box that used 17 factors in unknown ways, they identified three intermediate factors that explained the phenomenon: nucleation site density, bubble size (which was calculated from eight of the 17 factors), and the product of growth time and bubble departure frequency (which was calculated from 12 of the 17 factors). Bucci says models in the literature often use only one factor, but this work shows that we need to consider many, and their interactions. “This is a big deal.”
“This is great,” says Rishi Raj, an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology at Patna, who was not involved in the work. “Boiling has such complicated physics.” It involves at least two phases of matter, and many factors contributing to a chaotic system. “It’s been almost impossible, despite at least 50 years of extensive research on this topic, to develop a predictive model,” Raj says. “It makes a lot of sense to us the new tools of machine learning.”
Researchers have debated the mechanisms behind the boiling crisis. Does it result solely from phenomena at the heating surface, or also from distant fluid dynamics? This work suggests surface phenomena are enough to forecast the event.
Predicting proximity to the boiling crisis doesn’t only increase safety. It also improves efficiency. By monitoring conditions in real-time, a system could push chips or reactors to their limits without throttling them or building unnecessary cooling hardware. It’s like a Ferrari on a track, Bucci says: “You want to unleash the power of the engine.”
In the meantime, Bucci hopes to integrate his diagnostic system into a feedback loop that can control heat transfer, thus automating future experiments, allowing the system to test hypotheses and collect new data. “The idea is really to push the button and come back to the lab once the experiment is finished.” Is he worried about losing his job to a machine? “We’ll just spend more time thinking, not doing operations that can be automated,” he says. In any case: “It’s about raising the bar. It’s not about losing the job.”

In late June, the MIT Technology Review reported on the ways that some of the world’s largest job search sites—including LinkedIn, Monster, and ZipRecruiter—have attempted to eliminate bias in their artificial intelligence job-interview software. These remedies came after incidents in which A.I. video-interviewing software was found to discriminate against people with disabilities that affect facial expression and exhibit bias against candidates identified as women.
When artificial intelligence software produces differential and unequal results for marginalized groups along lines such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, Silicon Valley rushes to acknowledge the errors, apply technical fixes, and apologize for the differential outcomes. We saw this when Twitter apologized after its image-cropping algorithm was shown to automatically focus on white faces over Black ones and when TikTok expressed contrition for a technical glitch that suppressed the Black Lives Matter hashtag. They claim that these incidents are unintentional moments of unconscious bias or bad training data spilling over into an algorithm—that the bias is a bug, not a feature.

But the fact that these incidents continue to occur across products and companies suggests that discrimination against marginalized groups is actually central to the functioning of technology. It’s time that we see the development of discriminatory technological products as an intentional act done by the largely white, male executives of Silicon Valley to uphold the systems of racism, misogyny, ability, class and other axis of oppression that privilege their interests and create extraordinary profits for their companies. And though these technologies are made to appear benevolent and harmless, they are instead emblematic of what Ruha Benjamin, professor of African American Studies at Princeton University and the author of Race After Technology, terms “The New Jim Code“: new technologies that reproduce existing inequities while appearing more progressive than the discriminatory systems of a previous era.

Tech companies have financial and social incentives to create discriminatory products. Take, for example, Amazon Rekognition, a facial recognition created and sold by the e-commerce giant. Amazon very publicly enacted a moratorium on police use of facial recognition in June 2020 after protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. But prior to that, the company developed and sold this product despite mountains of evidence showing that the use of facial recognition by police departments amplifies harm toward Black people. Amazon did so to profit from a criminal justice system that disproportionately targets Black people for surveillance, arrest, and imprisonment and only stopped when protests against anti-Black racism brought attention to the company’s practices. Further, the development and sale of this technology helps to maintain an anti-Black social hierarchy that allows Jeff Bezos and the white men who occupy Amazon’s highest-paid positions to maintain their privilege in our society.

We should view algorithmic bias as a spillover effect from the culture of tech that has persistent racial and gender inequality in hiring and leadership and that has actively discouraged its employees from engaging in political discussions at work. Though the protests in 2020 prompted more explicit conversations about race and identity by tech companies, the culture of avoiding political discussions persists. This was evident when Basecamp CEO Jason Fried published a memo in April in which he banned employee discussions of social and political issues on company Basecamp accounts. In offering his reasoning, Fried wrote, “Today’s social and political waters are especially choppy” and that “you shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target.” The memo sparked online backlash and led to a cascade of employee resignations.

What Fried said has long been implicit within tech companies across the country: Discussions of “choppy” issues like racism, transphobia, misogynoir, and ableism are uncomfortable for those with privilege and that tech companies would prefer to avoid them. And though these companies have, in recent years, attempted to have more explicit discussions of race, gender, and bias within their workplaces, the belief that social issues like race are insignificant to technological development pervades within the corporate culture of Silicon Valley.
By normalizing the avoidance of explicitly talking about social and political issues, tech companies are maintaining a culture that privileges the perspective of people with dominant identities, from hiring to product development. And the truth is that social and political topics are always being discussed. It’s just that people with racial, gender, and other forms of power see their identities and perspectives as the default and therefore not a part of the social and political landscape.

This is particularly true for white people, a group whose racial identity has long been treated as invisible in the United States. In research I conducted last summer, I found that the statements released by tech companies amid the racial justice protests rarely mentioned whiteness or white people. The choice to exclude white people from these statements—while hyper-focusing on Black people and other people of color—normalizes the idea that white people are raceless, and it absolves white people from their role in maintaining the racial hierarchy. In doing this, white people get to maintain their power within tech companies and avoid the feelings of fear, discomfort, and anger that may accompany discussions of racial inequality—a phenomenon sometimes known as white fragility.

It’s time for us to reject the narrative that Big Tech sells—that incidents of algorithmic bias are a result of using unintentionally biased training data or unconscious bias. Instead, we should view these companies in the same way that we view education and the criminal justice system: as institutions that uphold and reinforce structural inequities regardless of good intentions or behaviors of the individuals within those organizations. Moving away from viewing algorithmic bias as accidental allows us to implicate the coders, the engineers, the executives, and CEOs in producing technological systems that are less likely to refer Black patients for care, that may cause disproportionate harm to disabled people, and discriminate against women in the workforce. When we see algorithmic bias as a part of a larger structure, we get to imagine new solutions to the harms caused by algorithms created by tech companies, apply social pressure to force the individuals within these institutions to behave differently, and create a new future in which technology isn’t inevitable, but is instead equitable and responsive to our social realities.

Disclosure: Microsoft and Dell are clients of the author. 
Windows 11 is in early preview right now, and it is far from feature complete; this phase of the deployment is typically focused on assuring hardware and application compatibility. Most of my newest desktop machines won’t yet run Windows 11 because they weren’t configured with their 2.0 Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) turned on (an easy fix) or with Secure Boot enabled (a much more complicated fix).
I was, however, able to load the Windows 11 preview onto my Dell OptiPlex 7070 Ultra modular desktop successfully and without issues. If you decide to try out Windows 11, I suggest you load it overnight, as the upgrade takes several hours.

User interface
Windows 11’s taskbar looks like an updated blend of the Windows 10 taskbar and the macOS dock without the animations. It moves the icons to the center of the taskbar rather than the left, justifying them.
 Rob Enderle/IDG

The new Start menu is centered and shows apps in a grid rather than a list. (Click image to enlarge it.)


Opening up the index of applications is similar in practice, but the result is very different and much closer to what you would see on a smartphone: the apps you most use are presented in an alphabetized grid and not a list as in earlier versions of Windows. This change made it far faster for me to find specific applications than had been the case earlier.











 
 
 
Switching to the complete app list is quick and easy, but it is an extra step from the default app list we had before. As with the default app list, the overall effect is closer to what we are used to on a smartphone. Once you get used to this new layout, it does feel more efficient.
Settings do not immediately pop up when you hit the Windows icon, which is still on the left but now centered with the other app icons in the taskbar. The icons on my home screen and my background were unchanged. Once you open Settings, however, the layout is significantly different, and it may initially take you a while to find where the setting you want has moved.
 Rob Enderle/IDG

The Settings app’s layout is significantly different in Windows 11. (Click image to enlarge it.)


That said, the settings I look to most often, like software updates, were in view and not buried under a submenu, reducing my time to access them. As with the app lists, once you get used to the new Settings layout, you’re likely to find it more efficient to use.











 
 
 
Smartphone integration
Microsoft’s smartphone integration app, Your Phone, is working on this initial build, and it does a decent job of providing an onscreen view of some of your phone’s core features like texts and phone calls. It appears that it has a music feature as well, but currently that appears to be disabled. I did appreciate that you could drag a photo from the visible representation of your phone and into email from your PC desktop interface. The app is both easier to use and more useful than the last time I used it.
Performance
During this phase of the rollout, the platform typically isn’t optimized yet for performance. Still, I didn’t notice any individual wait states or performance degradation on the Dell PC. This lack of noticeable performance penalty suggests there may be a slight performance boost when we get closer to the product’s official release.
Wrapping up: Meh…
While there were minor improvements, there was nothing about Windows 11 that knocked my socks off at this time. But that is expected at this early phase, which is primarily focused on hardware/software compatibility and is not yet feature complete. This phase of the testing isn’t supposed to be exciting; it’s just supposed to work, and Windows 11 did work with minimal disruption or retraining.











 
 
 
The updated OS went in clean with no errors, my core apps all worked fine, and the Your Phone app showed a usability improvement, even though at least one of the newer features didn’t appear to be active yet. I’ll provide updates as the product becomes more feature complete, but, for now, I don’t see any significant problems beyond the known need for a current TPM and Secure Boot.
 Rob Enderle/IDG

Your Phone provides a handy way to see your phone’s notifications, messages, calls, and photos. (Click image to enlarge it.)


Anyone using a business PC, laptop, or desktop that’s within three years old, configured with TPM 2.0, and with Secure Boot enabled should have a similar Windows 11 experience to mine. Windows 11 may not install on many consumer or education-focused PCs if they don’t at least have a current TPM.
The TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements for Windows 11 should result in far more PCs that are secure, as many PCs support those technologies but don’t have them turned on. Other systems will need to be replaced, although not necessarily right away: Windows 10 support will continue until at least 2025.











 
 
 
With the significant increase in ransomware attacks, putting off anything that increases the security of PCs comes with inherent risk, and it may be wiser to go early rather than late on this latest Windows version. Best practice, however, is to wait at least two months after general release before deploying to make sure new problems are identified and corrected before your installation. Often a good time for an update like this is during the holiday break, where any problems will have a minimal impact on productivity.
One last note: When I checked the security features after the Windows 11 installation, they were turned off, and I had to turn them on manually. Do check these features if you load the current build of Windows 11; the irony of installing a more secure version of Windows 11 only to find security turned off is painful at best.

In India, technological progress, is the main driver of growth of GDP per capita, allowing output to increase faster than labor and capital. Technology increases productivity by decreasing the number of labor hours needed to create a unit of output. An increment in labor productivity generally translates into increases in average wages, allowing workers to cut back on work hours and to afford more goods and services. AI should be welcomed for its potential economic benefits. Those economic benefits, however, will not necessarily be evenly distributed across society..At present, it may be challenging to predict exactly which jobs will be most immediately affected by AI-driven automation. Because AI is not a single technology, but rather a collection of technologies that are applied to specific tasks, the effects of AI will be felt unevenly throughout the economy. Some tasks will be more easily automated than others, and some jobs will be affected more than others—both negatively and positively. Some jobs may be automated away, while for others, AI-driven automation will make many workers more productive and increase demand for certain skills. Finally, new jobs are likely to be directly created in areas such as the development.and supervision of AI as well as indirectly created in a range of areas throughout the economy as higher incomes lead to expanded demand..Recent research suggests that the effects of AI on the labor market in the near term will continue the trend that computerization and communication innovations have driven in recent decades. Researchers' estimates on the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 percent. For context, every 3 months about 6 percent of jobs in the economy are destroyed by shrinking or closing businesses, while a slightly larger percentage of jobs are added resulting in rising employment and a roughly constant unemployment rate. The economy has.repeatedly proven itself capable of handling this scale of change, although it would depend on how rapidly the changes happen and how concentrated the losses are in specific occupations that are hard to shift from..Effect of AI Automation in Macroeconomy.Productivity.Technology increases productivity by decreasing the number of labor hours needed to create a unit of output. Labor productivity increases generally translate into increases in average wages, allowing workers to cut back on work hours and to afford more goods and services. Living standards and leisure hours could both increase, although.to the degree that inequality increases—as it has in recent decades—it offsets some of those gains..Labor Market.Recent research suggests that the effects of AI on the labor market in the decade ahead will continue the trend toward skill-biased change that computerization and communication innovations have driven in recent decades. Researchers differ on the possible magnitude of this effect. Experts declare that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI technologies and computerization in this period..The Jobs Created by AI.Four categories of jobs are likely to rise during AI-driven growth in the future. Employment in areas where humans engage with existing AI technologies, develop new AI technologies, supervise AI technologies in practice, and facilitate societal shifts that accompany new AI technologies will likely grow..Technological advancement is generated and adopted into the economy as the product of choices of entrepreneurs, workers, and firms looking to better serve a market or streamline a production process, in the context created by public investments in basic and applied research, infrastructure, and other public goods. In a process of directed technical change, incentives draw investment towards more potentially profitable innovations and so the types of technological change that are likely to occur..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
