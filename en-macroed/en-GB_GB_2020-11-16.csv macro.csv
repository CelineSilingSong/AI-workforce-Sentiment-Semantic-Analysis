			Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Jobs		

Posted on November 19, 2020Updated June 13, 2024 By Manjeet Rege, PhD, and Dan Yarmoluk '17 MS in Data Science 



Everywhere you turn today is some unbelievable technological advancement on a variety of fronts. In our everyday lives, we hear or experience things about autonomous vehicles, warehouse robots, chatbots, Alexa, Siri, Uber, automated email responses, robotic surgeries, Netflix recommendation systems, smart factories, smart buildings and search retargeting. Technology giants are becoming the most valuable companies on the planet, and we see our lives shifting from what we thought was kids and their smartphone addictions and gaming to encroaching on our daily lives across the board. They are typically revolving around a variety of enabling technology layers, namely, cloud computing, computational systems, networks and sensors, robotics, material sciences, digital manufacturing and artificial intelligence. However, at the center of it, is AI that permeates many of the other advances in some shape or form in creating intelligent systems on top of advances in core products or technologies.
“Computers, intelligent machines and robots seem like the workforce of the future. And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government,” predicts Elon Musk, the cofounder and CEO of Tesla. This is a scary proposition in some sense, in that what will we do if all the work is done by AI or robots? Isn’t life tough enough? Don’t we have enough economic disparity and can barely make ends meet today? To add insult to injury, many of the analyses seem to center on displacing the low wage workers. As if they didn’t have enough disadvantages already, their entire economic class will be wiped out is the feeling we get from the news cycle. This is evidenced by robotic warehouses and chatbots or automated customer service and we can really feel the changes all around us.
Innovation and technology are certainly changing; skills and jobs as we know them today will need to change. Our frame of reference is being disrupted like never before, the guideposts and rules are changing, and this causes discomfort, uncertainty and worry. How can we chart the course if we are uncertain that the traditional methods (hard work, educational degrees, etc.) do not necessarily guarantee a certain quality of life? News flash, it is changing rapidly and therefore uncertain. We need to all become comfortable with being uncomfortable, with adapting to change, continuing education and reskilling.  Some reports predict that millennials will change their jobs 17 times, but that might be a low number when you really factor in the gig economy.
According to various reports, the warnings suggest that AI could lead to the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It begs the question, when or what is the time horizon of the adoption of AI and the job loss a reality? Many reports suggest of job displacement or the very nature of jobs shifting. Automation and technology have shifted work in pursuit of lowering costs, increasing efficiency and production. The automobile “displaced” work that was done via horse and buggy, electricity or fluorescent lighting displaced gas lamps and gas replaced coal in many instances. Jobs have been displaced in the past, but in today’s case the rate at which these exponential technologies are growing is moving faster than the rate of human adaptation. That speed at which we are experiencing technological and societal change is only the beginning as many futurists, such as Peter Diamandis, prophesize.
Bloomberg reports that “more than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” That report and interpretations of it seem to suggest that adoption of AI may result in massive job losses and requires massive retraining. This paints a doomsday scenario, creates uncertainty and worry. The interpretation is AI equals job loss; we would argue that the interpretation should be interpreted as AI and technology advancements will require job retraining and job reskilling. The reports also seem to suggest that our educational system is preparing for jobs of today, when we see that the jobs of the future will be quite different, with different resources and tools at our disposal. This further creates panic in that we see nothing but chaos and the inability to control our destiny for ourselves and our children.
The report was MIT-IBM Watson Lab research that shed light on the reorganization of tasks within occupations by analyzing 170 million online job postings in the U.S. between 2010-17. There is no question that AI and related technologies will affect all jobs; what the report did shed light on was the fact how the nature of work is changing, how tasks are changing and tried to link the implications for employment and wages. There were some key findings in the report, that tasks are shifting between people and machines (or AI), but the change has been small (Figure 1).

Automation or AI is disappearing from job requirements, shifting in the way work gets done; as technology reduces the cost of some tasks, the value of remaining tasks increases, particularly soft skills such as creativity, common sense, judgment and communication skills.

This type of analysis is what experts refer to as the “future of work” and how the work is shifting, job requirements are changing, and automation and AI are displacing certain sectors of the labor market. It also informs policymakers of where to focus attention and resources in order to best prepare for the future. Many of the takeaways and political talk seem to focus on “the vulnerable will be the most vulnerable” as a key takeaway, and that better-educated workers will fare out alright as AI/automation spreads. As a McKinsey report forecasted 800 million global workers could be replaced by robots by 2030, they further stated that blue-collar jobs, such as machine operating, warehouse workers and fast food are particularly susceptible to disruption.
But a new study published by the Brookings institution states that might not be the case. The report looked at thousands of AI patents and job descriptions and that educated, well-paid workers may be affected even more by the spread of AI. Most consider robotics and software as impacting the physical and routine work of traditionally blue-collar jobs. The report goes on to state that workers with a bachelor’s degree, for example, would be exposed to AI over five times more than those with only a high school degree. That is due to the fact AI is very strong at completing tasks that require planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving and predicting – most of which are skills we think of as white-collar jobs.

This analysis of patent data and tasks and exposure to risk on a sampling of various occupations in Table 2.

AI’s impact on the workplace, the future of work, sectors of the economy and global domination are hard to assess. Most forecasts are rooted in well-established, well-understood technologies such as robotics and extrapolated across of a range of tasks, functions and jobs. The nature of AI being new and poorly understood, nonetheless unsuccessfully implemented across all industries, makes it even more difficult to understand. There is no shared agreement on the tasks, nor the expected impacts on the workforce or economy. The best scholars concede to the limitations of their economic or forecasts for the future. What we do know is that the nature of work will change, as it has through the centuries with innovation. We do know that disruption will occur in sectors of the economy, and we should brace for that change and try to harness that change for good. Perhaps AI can see patterns in deadly diseases, fight climate change and explore the universe. We should be as excited as nervous about change, and try to the best of our abilities to shape our society for that coming change.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Job Trends Important to Watch in 2021

The use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning (ML), technologies that help people and organizations handle customer personalization and communication, data analytics and processing, and a host of other applications continues to grow.   
An IDC report found three-quarters of commercial enterprise applications could lean on A.I. by next year alone, while an Analytics Insight report projects more than 20 million available jobs in artificial intelligence by 2023.   
Due to A.I. and ML's transformational reach, specialists with the right skills could find themselves with job opportunities across a wide range of industries. A global skills gap in the technologies means qualified applicants can expect good salaries and a strong bargaining position.  
Gus Walker, director of product at Veritone, an A.I. tech company based in Costa Mesa, California, told Dice that, in 2021, there will be growing opportunities for A.I. and ML specialists in public safety, banking and fintech, and healthcare.  
“These three industries have the money to invest in A.I. and ML right now and have the greatest opportunity to see the investment pay off, fast,” he said. “That being said, the pandemic has caused industries hit the hardest to take a step back and look at how they can leverage AI and ML to rebuild or adjust in the new normal.”  
Data collection and preparation, as well as data analytics expertise, could end up the most in-demand skills when hiring for artificial intelligence. “Organizations need to hire individuals who can identify the correct training data and annotate the data accurately,” Walker added. “They need talent that can maintain growing training sets and analyze the data to create targeted datasets for customized model generation.”  
This means companies will require professionals familiar with algorithm tuning and training; prime candidates will also have experience in A.I. operationalization and DevOps, in order to successfully set up datasets and continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines so that algorithms stay up-to-date.  
“Digitalization will make even more structured and unstructured data available to be leveraged, which will increase the need for more A.I. professionals,” Walker pointed out. “Businesses need someone who can maintain production deployments throughout.”   
Here’s a breakdown from Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, of how many technology jobs request machine learning skills. Although the current numbers are relatively small (at least when it comes to job postings), Burning Glass predicts significant growth over the next decade:   
  
Extreme Skills  
For Terry Simpson, technical evangelist at Nintex, a process management and workflow automation company based in Bellevue, WA, the skill sets around artificial intelligence and machine learning vary between extremes.  
“On one side, you have the technical developer who can take a desired outcome and build an algorithm or series of steps to execute a task in a repeatable format,” he said. “On the other extreme, you have the business analyst who needs to identify and understand what the business is needing and see the vision of how to automate it.”  
Between these two extremes, Simpson explained, you will find a small group of individuals who have the right balance between developer knowledge and business analyst knowledge.  
“These are skillsets that are in demand,” he said, pointing out most organizations are just starting to understand how A.I. and ML can have a positive strategic impact.  
“Someone who has high technical capabilities but lacks an understanding of the business won’t be successful,” Simpson noted. “On the flip side, someone who understands the business side, but is not technical enough to understand A.I. and ML, won’t be successful either. Finding the balance between the two is the sweet spot for a great candidate in the A.I. and ML space.”  
Simpson added that, as companies mature, they quickly find that they need full-time employees who have a good understanding of A.I. and ML tools in the marketplace: “Not only do they need professionals, they really need a group of them that have diverse skills in this area in order to stay up to date on the different offerings, and have the ability to implement.”  
Process mining is an area that businesses plan on investing more in, as it involves utilizing A.I. and ML to find processes inside the network that have a pattern. Once discovered, specialists can streamline and automate these patterns; in many cases, a business analyst or individual would never have been able to identify the pattern without an A.I. tool.   
As Walker noted, call center tools may see an increase in A.I. and ML usage to help match customers to the resources they need; retail experts may lean more on artificial intelligence apps to improve recommendation engines and “bespoke” personalized service.  
“Companies need someone who is familiar with A.I. and can look at the current problems and identify where A.I. can be applied,” he said. “Next, they need professionals who can develop and deploy the A.I. solution whether it be pre-built or a point solution.”  
Lastly, Walker explained, businesses should have someone with data analytics experience to ensure that products and services are actually improving as a result of A.I. and ML. Throughout 2021, we’ll likely see more A.I. usage by small businesses and educational institutions: “Now that the election is over and a vaccine is on the horizon, shifts to A.I. in all industries will be accelerated.”

A fascinating slice of electro-acoustic music history has just come out on the Carrier label. This 1984 concert performance of Rainbow Family by George Lewis — composer, master jazz trombonist, Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians member, computer music explorer — takes us back to an early stage of artificial intelligence (AI) when desktop computers (then known as microcomputers) were starting to interact with live musicians.
After two years of research and experimentation at IRCAM — Pierre Boulez’s new music laboratory underneath the Pompidou Centre in Paris — Lewis put together what he believes was IRCAM’s first commission for microcomputers and musicians improvising together. In his long booklet note, Lewis writes that he did all of the computer programming and “hardware hacking” himself, using the computer language Forth that he learned from his mentor, composer/record producer David Behrman.
The first popular digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7, had just been introduced the year before — and there are three of them here, driven by three Apple II computers via the newly established MIDI standard for connections. These computers and synthesizers — once considered state-of-the-art keys to music’s future, yet not fated to be a part of it for long — face off with four players, including a major jazz figure, soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy, plus Derek Bailey on electric guitar, Joëlle Leandre on acoustic bass, and Douglas Ewart on bass clarinet and flutes. 





After Lewis gives a spoken introduction in French and we hear the clicking of the keys of the computers, the hour-long piece starts with a digital rainbow of spangled, chromium-plated timbres typical of the DX7 that engage in a tumbling dialogue with Leandre — a promising start with a humorous ending. For me, this first section is the most interesting of a series of four fragmented, always atonal episodes for each instrument and another with Ewart and Bailey, an abstract amalgam of electronic music with the timbres and improvisatory streams-of-consciousness of free jazz. AACM meets the European avant-garde, in short.




The last movement is the longest, taking up about a third of the piece, with all four human musicians now involved. The textures are usually thicker, the direction meanders, and the music sometimes starts to sound a bit like Boulez’s later scores, though with much more active electronic participation (no wonder, since the music was conceived and performed in a time and place where the Boulez presence must have been overwhelming).
Ultimately, let me be rash enough to declare the computers and synthesizers the winners in this AI encounter — which is either a tribute to Lewis’s programming skills or simply that I respond more to the colors that the electronics produce than most of the salvos by the live musicians.
Experiments like this would be developed further by Lewis in the following decades. As recently as at the 2017 Ojai Festival, you could hear Lewis interacting on trombone and laptop with fellow AACM veterans — saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell and pianist Muhal Richard Abrams (who passed away four months later) — in an out-on-the-edge group improvisation not dissimilar to this one at IRCAM 33 years before. Devotees of the jazz and electronic avant garde then and now will be transfixed by this dive into the digital era’s Bronze Age.

New York City wants to restrict artificial intelligence in hiring

Businesses turning to AI for job interviews
06:07

New York City is trying to rein in the use of algorithms used to screen job applicants. It's one of the first cities in the U.S. to try to regulate what is an increasingly common — and opaque — hiring practice. The city council is considering a bill that would require potential employers to notify job candidates about the use of these tools, referred to as ""automated decision systems."" Companies would also have to complete an annual audit to make sure the technology doesn't result in bias.The move comes as the use of artificial intelligence in hiring skyrockets, increasingly replacing human screeners. Fortune 500 companies including Delta, Dunkin, Ikea and Unilever have turned to AI for help assessing job applicants. These tools run the gamut from a simple text reader that screens applications for particular words and phrases, to a system that evaluates videos of potential applicants to judge their suitability for the job. 






""We have all the reasons to believe that every major company uses some algorithmic hiring,"" Julia Stoyanovich, a founding director of the Center for Responsible AI at New York University, said in a recent webinar. Machine biasAt a time when New Yorkers are suffering double-digit unemployment, legislators are concerned about the brave new world of digital hiring. Research has shown that AI systems can introduce more problems than they solve. Facial-recognition tools that use AI have demonstrated trouble in identifying faces of Black people, determining people's sex and wrongly matching members of Congress to a mugshot database. 


In perhaps the most notorious example of AI bias, a hiring tool developed internally at Amazon had to be scrapped because it discriminated against women. The tool was developed using a 10-year history of resumes submitted to the company, whose workforce skews male. As a result, the software effectively ""taught"" itself that male candidates were preferable and demoted applications that included the word ""women,"" or the names of two all-women's colleges. While the tool was never used, it demonstrates the potential pitfalls of substituting machine intelligence for human judgment. ""As legislators in a city home to some of the world's largest corporations, we must intervene and prevent unjust hiring,"" city council member Laurie Cumbo, the bill's sponsor, said at a hearing for the legislation last week. Not tough enoughSeveral civil rights groups say New York's proposed bill doesn't go far enough. A dozen groups including  the AI Now Institute, New York Civil Liberties Union and New York  Communities for Change issued a letter  last week pushing for the law to cover more types of automated tools and  more steps in the hiring process. They want the measure to include heavier  penalties, enabling people to sue if they've been passed  over for a job because of biased algorithms. This would be in line with existing employment law, which allows applicants to sue for  discrimination because of race or sex.""If we pass [the bill] as  it is worded today, it will be a rubber stamp for some of the worst  forms of algorithmic discrimination,"" Albert Fox Cahn, executive  director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told the city  council.

""We need much stronger penalties,"" he said. ""Just as we do with every other form of  employment discrimination, we need that private-sector enforcement.""


Alicia Mercedes, a spokesperson for Cumbo, the bill's sponsor, said the bill is still in its early stages and is likely to change in response to feedback. ""We're committed to seeing this legislation come out as something that can be effective, so we will of course take any input that we can get from those who are working on these issues every day,"" Mercedes said.Less time, better results?For hiring professionals, the main appeal of AI is its capacity to save time. But technologists have also touted the potential for automated programs, if used correctly, to eliminate human biases, such as the well-documented tendency for hiring managers to overlook African-American applicants or look favorably on candidates who physically resemble the hiring manager.

""When only a human reviews a resume, unfortunately, humans can't un-see the things that cause unconscious biases — if someone went to the same alma mater or grew up in same community,"" said Athena Karp, CEO of HiredScore, an AI hiring platform. Karp said she supports the New York bill. ""If technologies are used in hiring, the makers of technology, and candidates, can and should know how they're being used,"" she said at the hearing.  In the U.S., the only place where this is currently the case is in Illinois, whose Biometric Privacy Act requires employers to tell candidates if AI is being used to evaluate them and allows the candidates to opt out. On the federal level, a bill to study bias in algorithms has been introduced in Congress. In New York, most job candidates have no clue they're being screened by software — even those who are computer scientists themselves. ""I've received my fair share of job and internship rejections in my graduate and undergraduate careers,"" said Lauren D'Arinzo, a master's degree candidate in data science and AI at New York University. ""It is unsettling to me that a future employer might disregard my application based on the output of an algorithm.""


She added, ""What worries me most is, had I not been recruited into a project explicitly doing research in this space, I would likely not have even known that these types of tools are regularly used by Fortune 500 companies.""

Nov 20, 2020 | LIFE | By Joshua Kalenga | Illustration by Patil Khakhamian
At first thought, the concept of a “racist” algorithm might seem absurd. After all, one may ask, how can we assign any ethical value to what is just a set of calculations?
In a world where artificial intelligence is being used for everything from job hiring to policing, however, questions about how fairly these algorithms deal with different individuals and groups are surely warranted.
“Coded Bias,” a 2020 documentary by Shalini Kantayya, argues that some of the artificial intelligence in use today is biased against women and minorities and is in urgent need of government regulation.  
The documentary follows the journey of MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini. Her discovery that most facial-recognition software does not accurately identify the faces of women and darker-skinned people inspires her to investigate widespread bias in algorithms.  
In one particularly memorable scene, Buolamwini — who is a woman of color — explains to Congress that she had to wear a white mask for Amazon’s facial recognition software to ‘recognize’ her.
In response, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asks Buolamwini, “So, we have a technology that was created and designed by one demographic that is only mostly effective on that one demographic and they’re trying to sell it and impose it on the entirety of the country?” 
A 2019 study by The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of almost 200 facial recognition algorithms found that “for one-to-one matching, [there were] higher rates of false positives for Asian and African American faces relative to images of Caucasians. The differentials often ranged from a factor of 10 to 100 times, depending on the individual algorithm.”  
Since facial recognition software is already being employed in crucial facets of everyday life such as policing, the implications of misidentification are non-trivial. The New York Times reported in June 2020 that Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, a Black man, was arrested in Michigan after being wrongly identified by a faulty facial recognition program.
“Coded Bias” also cites an experimental Amazon program developed in 2014 to screen job applications for technology roles as an example of algorithmic bias. The program automatically disregarded résumés that mentioned women’s colleges or groups, likely reflecting the prevailing gender imbalance in the demographics of the company. 
A lack of adequate representation in the underlying data used to build some artificial intelligence systems is a recurring theme in the documentary.
“When you think of A.I., it’s forward-looking,” Buolamwini says in the film. “But A.I. is based on data, and data is a reflection of our history.”    
There are other concerning examples of bias in artificial intelligence that are not explicitly discussed in the “Coded Bias” documentary. An algorithm widely used in U.S. hospitals, according to a study published in Science, was less likely to refer Black people that were equally sick as White people to programs that provided personalized care.
In spite of the biases in some applications, artificial intelligence remains one of the most sophisticated developments of computer science. From natural language processing to cancer diagnosis, artificial intelligence applications can be both deeply fascinating (at least to a tech nerd like myself) and incredibly useful.
While “Coded Bias” certainly doesn’t romanticize the power of artificial intelligence, it doesn’t suggest that the concept is inherently flawed either. Instead, the film seems to simply argue for more racial and gender diversity in the technology industry, as well as more government regulation of widely used algorithms — especially those that have been proven to contain systematic bias.  
Following “The Great Hack” and “The Social Dilemma,” Kantayya’s “Coded Bias” is the latest documentary to address the dangers of Big Tech. Perhaps, at best, the directors and casts of these documentaries hope they are inspiring a global consciousness in us, the viewers. After all, it is our data that runs the algorithms.

Let’s take my dog, Buster. When Buster was a pup I wanted to teach him to roll over, but I had two main problems. The first is that Buster doesn't know English. The second is that he doesn't exactly know what it means to roll over. So not only can I not communicate with him in the same way I could communicate with a kid but I can’t even describe the action to him.But I have two keys ways to teach buster to roll over.

There is a buzz in the tech industry around AI and its developments. The internet has expectedly played a vital role in the development of AI-enabled services. Although artificial intelligence is frequently thrown around, not everybody understands what it is and what AI is capable of..If you have ever talked with Siri, precisely searched for a film or show on Netflix, or asked Siri the temperature, you have interacted with AI. Initially coined by John McCarthy in 1955, artificial intelligence is a machine that can solve problems that humans perform using natural intelligence. AI is used to build agents or robots that can replicate human behaviour and decide on humans' behalf..Insightful Facts about AI.1. AI Pets Exist.Although real pets are lovable, as per pet-bot developers, they have a few setbacks. Real pets need to be taken care of, such as feeding and cleaning them up. AI pets will be robots that look, feel, and act like a real animal but eliminate such issues faced by owners. It is expected that AI-driven pets will be widely available in the market by 2025..2. Most AI Bots are Female.Studies show that most of the population prefer the sound of a female voice over a male voice. It is because if you ask voice assistants like Alexa, Siri a question, you will be answered by a pleasant and polite woman's voice..3. AI Recognises Emotions.A robot built in the late 1990s called Kismet can recognise emotions through human body language and voice tone..4. AI can Repair Itself.A robot that rebuilt itself after noticing its performance had dropped after losing two of its six legs. The robot did not know what the problem was but fixed it by trial and error..5. AI can Replace Human Workforce.Around 1,160,000 people are out of work in Canada alone. Although AI helps reduce business costs, it's set to create some significant problems. As per The Guardian, customer service jobs (85%) will face the highest AI threat by 2021..6. AI will Become Smarter than Humans.AI can learn anything quickly, meaning its intelligence is increasing. In 2013, AI had the same intelligence as a 4 year old. By 2029, AI will have the same intelligence level as adult humans..7. Humans can Develop Romantic Relationship with AI.David Levy, a student in this field, believes that marriage between humans and robots will be made legal by 2050. At the moment robots are not so advanced enough for this..8. AI has Nationalities and Passports.Sophia, a lifelike humanoid, has obtained guaranteed citizenship in Saudi Arabia. It has brought controversy as people wonder and question whether or not robots should have rights..9. AI can Write.A robot wrote an article on an earthquake in California on the Los Angeles Times website, gathering data from a seismograph..10. AI will Recognise people by Voice.As early as by the end of 2018, it was expected that robotic assistants would be able to carry out voice recognition..The primary purpose of artificial intelligence is for humans or businesses to have a machine that thinks faster and more efficiently. But the question becomes, in this process, will advancements in technology take over the world? Will it help humankind reach the highest potential or destroy it in the process?.Well, in January 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that artificial intelligence would be more transformative to humanity than electricity. Mckinsey report reveals that global demand for data scientists will exceed supply by more than 50% in 2018. On the other hand, PWC predicted that the global GDP could rise by 14% as a result of AI-powered activities by 2030, which is equal to US$15.7 trillion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

We hope to address the pain of both consumers and tradesmen whilst saving the environment, creating new jobs in the economy by making the industry more reliable using technology and behavioural data”


— Anuj Gupta, Founder GreenVan

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM , November 16, 2020 /EINPresswire.com/ — GreenVan(GV) a home services company provides Movers, Plumbers, Electricians. GV is a branded service (like Uber) and not a marketplace ensuring quality of service delivered by its tradesmen. After a successful market launch GV now hopes to consolidate a fragmented market and become an affordable and accessible company for the 27 M households across the UK. Consumers today have the option to either use a large player by paying high prices or rely on small and unreliable independent tradesmen who make up to 94% of the market.
The pain is clear for consumers who spend hours in finding experienced, reliable and affordable tradesmen. They witness huge price variation, poor track record visibility of the tradesmen , last minute cancellations, disputes, loss of deposit, delays etc. Tradesmen on the other hand suffer from low income, poor family time ,subservience and an unorganised work life..
Gv hopes to make a huge shift in that by offering Customers instant, smooth and 24/7 access along with low prices , On-time promise, Insurance, Free changes & cancellation, time & day preference.
For the Tradesmen to work 250 days Vs 300 days and thereby create more family time for them and make them focus only on what they do best. The tradesmen would double their disposable income, retain their freedom and safety of increased work flow without any domination from a corporation. The income would directly come to their bank account making them more bankable, says Anuj Gupta the founder of GreenVan, who won the award for the best consumer technology  platform in the world by Microsoft in the business he had founded earlier.


Given the strong value proposition for the customers, GV hopes to expand the market as it would more viable for customers to to use GV than to do the job on their own (a shift from the DIY to GV) and that should result in a need for more tradesmen thereby creating large amounts employment for the economy.
Using the latest technology (Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms and process automation) results in better van capacity utilisation, optimal route planning, better vendor time utilisation and less fuel consumption along with a new business model and Green assets, GV hopes to organise the home services industry and even with capturing a small market share GV hopes to get to unicorn valuations as the market opportunity is enormous.
GV has launched moving services in the first phase and has already successfully moved a few thousand customers who seem delighted with the service as many have given a 10 on 10 rating and is now waiting for the current pandemic restrictions to get relaxed to operate at full scale as customers are vary of letting tradesmen into their homes.
GV is a carbon neutral business and has a huge thrust on climate protection and therefore the name GreenVan as the vans used by its tradesmen are electric in nature.  GV's network of the electric vans would also be used to advertise other conscious and ethical brands across the UK.


In recognition of the potential of the business. GV has received expectational levels of credits from Amazon for the use of their AWS technology infrastructure.
GV has entered into agreement with one of the largest outdoor media companies to use thousands of their billboards across the UK with a 50% co-investment from them for the advertising – GreenVan London Billboard – https://www.greenvan.eu/london-billboard
GV has many areas of Impact and caters to the UN sustainable development goals like 5-9-11-12-17 as it creates more social capital for both customers and tradesmen, decarbonising cities, a low-no emission green fleet, ethical partnerships, green media etc. GreenVan is very light in its processes right from the top of the funnel till the job day.
