Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Although banking and financial services tend to be slower to adopt new technologies, a PricewaterhouseCooper study confirms the majority of financial services decision-makers are investing in artificial intelligence (AI)—52 percent of executives confirmed they are making “substantial” investments in AI while 72 percent believe it will be a business advantage. One thing that will likely make the rest believe in artificial intelligence’s potential for the industry are the cost savings that are expected to be $447 billion by 2023.

So, how do financial institutions use artificial intelligence? The most visible way the banking industry uses artificial intelligence (AI) is for customer service from chatbots and robots. Many of the largest financial institutions, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, use AI to streamline customer service. Another customer-facing way AI is deployed is to facilitate mobile banking that allows 24/7 access for consumers to conduct banking operations. AI is also instrumental in the way financial institutions enhance security and prevent and detect fraud. The technology helps financial institutions with risk management and lending decisions and is foundational in making other technology such as big data analytics, robotic process automation, and voice interfaces work.

PROMOTED
Blockchain
Blockchain technology, first used in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is a distributed database that can keep track of transactions in a verifiable and permanent way. The Harvard Business Review predicts that blockchain will disrupt banks the way the internet disrupted media. Blockchains are transparent, highly secure, and are relatively cheap to operate. As more financial institutions realize how blockchain can improve security, save money, and improve customer satisfaction, more will adopt the technology.

Blockchain can support banking in several ways. Bitcoin showed how it can be used for payments, but it can also be transformative in the way our capital markets work by tokenizing traditional bonds, stocks, and other assets and putting them on public blockchains. Blockchains would remove the gatekeepers and third parties in the loans and credit system while also making it more secure to borrow money and lowering interest rates. Blockchain could also eliminate manual data reconciliation for bank ledgers. The way information and money are exchanged today will be altered by smart contracts that operate from blockchain technology.

Big Data
One of the ways to determine a technology’s influence on an industry is to look at how an industry is investing in it. The banking sector is currently one of the top investors by industry in big data and business analytics solutions according to the IDC Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Spending Guide. The amount of data generated by the financial industry—credit card transactions, ATM withdrawals, credit scores—is mind-boggling. And being able to put that data to use to make business decisions and process it effectively to glean actionable insights will be critical to staying competitive in the future.

Financial institutions can use big data to learn more about customers and be able to make business decisions in real-time including learning about a customer's spending habits, sales management such as segmenting customers to optimize marketing as well as product cross-selling, fraud management, risk assessment, and reporting, and customer feedback analysis. Not only does big data analysis help identify market trends, but it also helps financial institutions streamline internal processes and reduce risk.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Since robotic process automation can save labor, operational costs, and minimize errors, many financial institutions are starting to leverage this technology to create the best possible user experience for customers and to remain competitive. In RPA, software is programmed to enable robots and virtual assistants to complete repetitive and labor-intensive tasks correctly and quickly without human intervention.
RPA, through customer service chatbots helps banks deal with the low-priority queries from customers such as account and payment questions to free up human customer agents to deal with the high-priority concerns. In insurance companies, RPA is used to automate parts of the claims-handling processes. Another way RPA influences financial institutions is to help ensure compliance in the highly regulated industry. Today, thanks to RPA, customers can get a decision on their credit card application within a few hours but sometimes almost immediately after they submit the information. It’s also optimizing mortgage processing.
Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is technology for storing data and delivering computing services, including servers, databases, networking, software, analytics and more over the internet. When an individual or a business wants to use the cloud, they will pay a cloud provider based on usage with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Cloud computing makes 24/7 customer service from anywhere possible. In addition, cloud computing enhances the agility of financial institutions and makes scaling up services easier and quicker. Since they only pay for services they use, cloud computing can help financial institutions control costs. Cloud computing also enables secure online payments, digital wallets, and online transfers.
Voice Interfaces
Chatbot solutions, enabled by sophisticated artificial intelligence, are being deployed by financial institutions to reduce costs and meet customers' expectations regarding quick response and effective issue resolution. Traditional forms of two-way communication such as email, phone, and text can be replaced with a chatbot. By 2020, chatbots are expected to handle no less than 85 percent of customer service interactions, according to Gartner.
Chatbots offer a nearly instant conversational experience that that can be personalized, so customers get premium service expeditiously. Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo have used chatbots for years for simple account queries, but today’s advanced chatbots could even offer financial advice. Bots are also able to provide centralized financial management over the multiple channels that customers interact with their financial institution, correcting what had in the past felt disjointed. This technology continues to improve and will empower customers to connect with their bank on their terms.
Cyber Security and Resilience
In an industry dealing with sensitive personal and financial information, and that's an attractive target of cybercriminals, security is paramount for financial institutions. It would be a good idea for financial institutions to assume there will be a security breach and plan for how to minimize the damage, because preventing all cyberattacks is nearly impossible due to the diverse ways consumers interact with their money and the numerous vulnerabilities that exist regardless of how much time and energy is put forth to prevent cyberattacks. From mobile apps and web portals to third-party networks and even susceptibilities introduced by employees and customers themselves, safety is never ensured even if you can thwart an attack periodically.
Financial institutions must do more than invest in technical measures to protect against cyberattacks. They must share knowledge and best practices with each other, work with governments to ensure cybersecurity is prioritized, be proactive about educating employees regarding their cybersecurity responsibilities and the importance of following protocols, and reaching out to the public to help them understand the situation and their role in keeping their personal data safe.

What happens when technology advancements threaten to automate people’s jobs?That question is on the minds of many as research and development in artificial intelligence and machine learning rapidly advances.A new project led by Siddharth Srivastava, an assistant professor in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University, aims to help alleviate this concern.Srivastava and his multidisciplinary team are creating autonomous systems that are not only more adaptable and efficient in manufacturing environments, but also have built-in intelligent tutoring systems that will cooperate with factory workers and retrain them to use AI technology so they are not displaced from their jobs.Funded by a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation as one of its Convergence Accelerator awards, the project is highly focused on using AI to augment the workplace rather than replace workers.“Suppose you have this new robot, it’s very efficient, but you need to hire five computer science graduates to operate and maintain it instead of five current factory workers,” Srivastava said. “That’s not feasible, first of all because we don’t have that many computer science graduates in society. Our idea is that instead of getting people to enroll in a new college program again, what we can do instead is design our AI systems, our robots, in a way that will help people to come on board.”Srivastava is collaborating with ASU faculty members in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society to bring the project to life.“We have 10 team members, including experts in robot control, tutoring systems and human systems engineering — a field that involves thinking about how the robot and the human would interact and how you would build a situation where the human trusts the robot,” Srivastava said. “We also have experts in law to help solve the sociotechnical aspects of the problem.”How artificial intelligence can preserve jobsTraditionally, AI has mostly been developed with a mind to automate human-performed tasks — that is, to perform tasks in place of a human. For example, machines play chess better than humans do and are also faster at distinguishing patterns and performing calculations. One example of AI working to augment human-performed tasks rather than replace them can be found in intelligent tutoring systems.The ASU team is focusing on this interaction, particularly in implementing the intelligent training systems for factory workers. This eliminates the concern about driving up the demand for highly educated workers to unsustainable levels and also empowers human workers to incorporate AI into their work.According to Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor of computer science, this education-based relationship is the key to successful collaboration between AI and humans. In particular, the AI systems need to learn to model the mental states of the humans they collaborate with, and use those models to guide their interactions with the humans.“We are now considering scenarios in which the AI system teaches humans on the job,” Kambhampati said. “If you are using one machine, and there is a big technological advancement, then the question is what is the best way to get people to come up to speed in using these new machines?”This retraining process is essential to helping factory workers in the evolving manufacturing industry keep their jobs. It’s a necessary transition into a future when machines can augment human activities without replacing the people who have traditionally performed them.In that scenario, workers would be able to assign robots a wider variety of tasks while the robots teach workers how to use the robots and why robots are making the decisions they do.“(Robots) are more adaptable in that their behavior adapts to the changes in their environment, they adapt to the tasks that you give them and at the same time they can answer your questions,” Srivastava said. “A worker who doesn’t know the internals of the robot can ask it, ‘Why did you go along this path when I think you should have just gone straight?’ And the robot can answer, ‘If I go this way then my hand might collide with that table.’ So, in that process, the worker learns about the robot’s constraints and how to operate it.”Moving toward a more robotic futureCould machines ever replace humans? Is it cheaper to have an all-robotic workforce?The answer is complicated, said Katina Michael, a professor jointly appointed in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering, one of the six Fulton Schools.“At face value, initially it seems that robots would do better than the operational expenditure of the human labor force,” she said, “but when you look at this quite clinically, you’re almost shifting costs from the human labor force to the robotic labor force. It’s quite debatable as to whether costs will be reduced.”While robots can operate 24/7, people need breaks, time off, insurance coverage and compensation. However, robots must be updated and maintained, and they also need power to operate — human workers are still extremely necessary in the workplace.Although the research project is focused on AI development, it is ultimately centered around training human workers and ensuring job security. The team wants to enhance communication between both humans and robots to obtain the best of both worlds in the manufacturing industry.“Sadly, training diminishes with the increased cost of the capital investment,” Michael said. “Many corporations are trying to save money somewhere, but training is where we need to invest more money in order to have a successful integration of workers and autonomous systems so we can minimize safety risks. If we don’t have adequate training, we don’t have adequate responses to reducing the incidence of on-the-job disasters.”An interdisciplinary interactionIn highly multidisciplinary projects involving diverse skill sets and expertise in multiple areas, there are many factors to consider when humans team up with robots.“We’re interested primarily in how humans and robots work together,” Michael said. “With the humans doing their bit and the robots doing their bit, we want to see if there is any incongruousness or congruousness that can be observed. I’m also looking not only at the economic impact but also the societal impact, seeing if the workers who are interacting with these robots are receiving adequate training.”Erin Chiou, an assistant professor of human systems engineering at The Polytechnic School, one of the six Fulton Schools, is studying the interactions of humans and machines for data to guide the design of systems that prioritize the collaboration of humans and robots.“Ultimately, it’s getting that multidisciplinary conversation going between people who actually build the machines and people who think very critically about job design and human workers,” Chiou said. “It is relatively easy to optimize technology when you aren't thinking too deeply about how to involve people, because once you involve people, you introduce variation into the system. This makes the problem much more difficult. At the same time, this variation — or the ability for a system to adapt to different situations — is crucial for technology acceptance and for overall system performance.”The ASU team also has experts looking at the legal, social and economic implications of implementing such technology in the workplace, all of which will be considered when designing the new systems.“It’s not about changing the hardware, it’s about how to change the software,” Srivastava said. “We’re thinking about how it should act and what it should do. We are rethinking how a robot’s ‘mind’ should work in order to make it more amenable to providing on-the-job training and collaborating with humans.”

It should prevent discrimination, respect privacy and only operate in accordance with their intended purpose.The guidelines also recommend human oversight of AI always be enabled and there should be timely processes to allow people to challenge the use or output of information.""People do think of the Terminator when they think about artificial intelligence and robotics and those sorts of things,"" Ms Andrews said.""But that's not what we should be doing with artificial intelligence. It [AI] is positive, it will help people in their daily lives.""Ms Andrews conceded that while AI would change jobs, she was adamant people shouldn't fear it putting them out of work.She argued greater adoption of technology would give people opportunities to develop skills to better suit a future economy. Karen Andrews says an ethics framework could encourage businesses to make decisions in people's best interests.(ABC News: Matt Roberts)""It's important that we get the framework right for this because artificial intelligence can be quite scary to a lot of people,"" Ms Andrews said.""They seem to think it's robots taking over the world, robots taking their job, that machines are going to be making the decision for them.""The guidelines also urge companies to ensure people know when they are engaging with and being ""significantly impacted by an AI system"". The list of principles comes after Ms Andrews released an AI discussion paper in April.That paper was developed in conjunction with the CSIRO and designed to create an environment that would allow Australians to have greater trust in how AI was designed, developed and used by businesses and governments.You decide: Driverless carsDriverless cars could make our roads safer and reduce congestion. But the algorithms driving them will also have to make life-or-death decisions.Read moreThe Government received 130 submissions to the discussion paper and then brought together academics and the business community to develop the ethics guidelines.Telstra, Microsoft, NAB, Commonwealth Bank and Flamingo AI have agreed to test the eight points to see if they can be implemented in the real world.Ms Andrews said she hoped companies that were already using AI would review the guidelines and assess if they needed to make changes.""We want to make sure that we're setting it up for the future,"" Ms Andrews said.""There might well be many companies that have relied on principles that have been developed elsewhere around the world. What we wanted to do as a Government was look at what we could develop that was really targeted [and] focused on Australian needs."" The Government has released an artificial intelligence ethics framework it wants businesses to follow.(Reuters: Denis Balibouse)Given the guidelines are voluntary, there are no consequences for businesses that fail to develop ethical AI.""At this point, I'm not looking at bringing out the big stick that obviously sits there as a possibility but that would be a long way off before we got to that point,"" Ms Andrews said.""I think there is a strong willingness at the early stages of artificial intelligence for businesses wanting to get it right so this should prove the framework that they need.""Posted 6 Nov 20196 Nov 2019Wed 6 Nov 2019 at 12:31pm, updated 6 Nov 20196 Nov 2019Wed 6 Nov 2019 at 3:38pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesYou're approaching an intersection.

While India has a low 27 per cent women participation in workforce, it has a higher-than-average share of women with artificial intelligence skill sets.  Heidrick and Struggles, a global provider of executive search, leadership assessment and development, found that India has an inconsistent history of women&rsquo;s advancement, shaped by cultural norms that strongly favour males from birth. The country&rsquo;s gender inequality is difficult to tackle, as women in India have a low 27 per cent rate of workforce participation. The report finds that the low participation rate is attributed to various cultural factors, as well as challenges faced by women in the workplace, such as healthcare access, gender bias, and lack of flexible working opportunities.  But there have been some positive trends as well. Indian has higher-than-average share of women with artificial intelligence skill sets (22 per cent) compared to other countries.  &ldquo;Thanks to the growing involvement of leaders committed to creating a more inclusive work environment, we are seeing a growing trend of more women becoming equipped with the latest technology skill sets. This indicates an increasing number of women in India are entering a space which was commonly seen as a male-dominated domain,&rdquo; Gauri Padmanabhan, Partner, Heidrick & Struggles said.  The study found that the government has taken a number of initiatives such as furthering girls&rsquo; education, improved healthcare, and maternity benefits, which tackle some of the basic challenges faced by women in the workplace. The Sebi has formulated guidelines for the inclusion of women on the boards of listed companies by early 2020 and companies are also implementing their own programmes. Many IT companies are computer programming boot camp specifically for women developers who have left the field but are interested in reskilling and rejoining the technical workforce.  &ldquo;Most academic excellence entrance examinations have been showcasing the growing dominance of women amongst rank holders and across all streams including science and engineering hence the findings are not surprising as well as equally welcoming. However the question that arise in my mind is how many of these women actually find their way into the active formal workforce as well as stay there,&rsquo; said Rituparna Chakraborty,  co-founder and executive vice president of TeamLease Services.     Though Diversity and Inclusion programmes in Asia are focusing on women in leadership, race and ethnicity and sexual orientation, in India the programmes are dominated by women-focused initiatives. Programmes focused on race and ethnicity and LGBTQ engagement are still at a nascent stage in the country.  &ldquo;Going forward, Indian businesses need to widen the scope of D&I with the objective of including the LGBTQ community and differently-abled people. Tackling gender disparity in India is currently the foremost concern, given our cultural norms. But as women break barriers and step forward in every area, we will gradually be able to create pathways for inclusion of other communities and this will indeed be welcome progress,&rdquo; said Padmanabhan.",[],"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.asianage.com/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'asian - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.asianage.com/images/logo.png'}"
