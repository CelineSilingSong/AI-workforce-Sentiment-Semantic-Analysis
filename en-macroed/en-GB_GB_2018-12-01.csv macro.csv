5 Important Artificial Intelligence Predictions (For 2019) Everyone Should Read

This is because expectations of the changes to business and society which AI promises (or in some cases threatens) to bring about go beyond anything dreamed up during previous technological revolutions.
PROMOTED
AI points towards a future where machines not only do all of the physical work, as they have done since the industrial revolution but also the “thinking” work – planning, strategizing and making decisions.

The jury’s still out on whether this will lead to a glorious utopia, with humans free to spend their lives following more meaningful pursuits, rather than on those which economic necessity dictates they dedicate their time, or to widespread unemployment and social unrest.
We probably won’t arrive at either of those outcomes in 2019, but it’s a topic which will continue to be hotly debated. In the meantime, here are five things that we can expect to happen:

 AI increasingly becomes a matter of international politics

2018 has seen major world powers increasingly putting up fences to protect their national interests when it comes to trade and defense. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the relationship between the world's two AI superpowers, the US and China.
In the face of tariffs and export restrictions on goods and services used to create AI imposed by the US Government, China has stepped up its efforts to become self-reliant when it comes to research and development.
Chinese tech manufacturer Huawei announced plans to develop its own AI processing chips, reducing the need for the country’s booming AI industry to rely on US manufacturers like Intel and Nvidia.
At the same time, Google has faced public criticism for its apparent willingness to do business with Chinese tech companies (many with links to the Chinese government) while withdrawing (after pressure from its employees) from arrangements to work with US government agencies due to concerns its tech may be militarised.
With nationalist politics enjoying a resurgence, there are two apparent dangers here.
Firstly, that artificial intelligence technology could be increasingly adopted by authoritarian regimes to restrict freedoms, such as the rights to privacy or free speech.
Secondly, that these tensions could compromise the spirit of cooperation between academic and industrial organizations across the world. This framework of open collaboration has been instrumental to the rapid development and deployment of AI technology we see taking place today and putting up borders around a nation’s AI development is likely to slow that progress. In particular, it is expected to slow the development of common standards around AI and data, which could greatly increase the usefulness of AI.

 A Move Towards “Transparent AI”

The adoption of AI across wider society – particularly when it involves dealing with human data – is hindered by the ""black box problem."" Mostly, its workings seem arcane and unfathomable without a thorough understanding of what it's actually doing.
To achieve its full potential AI needs to be trusted – we need to know what it is doing with our data, why, and how it makes its decisions when it comes to issues that affect our lives. This is often difficult to convey – particularly as what makes AI particularly useful is its ability to draw connections and make inferences which may not be obvious or may even seem counter-intuitive to us.
But building trust in AI systems isn’t just about reassuring the public. Research and business will also benefit from openness which exposes bias in data or algorithms. Reports have even found that companies are sometimes holding back from deploying AI due to fears they may face liabilities in the future if current technology is later judged to be unfair or unethical.
In 2019 we're likely to see an increased emphasis on measures designed to increase the transparency of AI. This year IBM unveiled technology developed to improve the traceability of decisions into its AI OpenScale technology. This concept gives real-time insights into not only what decisions are being made, but how they are being made, drawing connections between data that is used, decision weighting and potential for bias in information.
The General Data Protection Regulation, put into action across Europe this year, gives citizens some protection against decisions which have “legal or other significant” impact on their lives made solely by machines. While it isn’t yet a blisteringly hot political potato, its prominence in public discourse is likely to grow during 2019, further encouraging businesses to work towards transparency.

 AI and automation drilling deeper into every business 

In 2018, companies began to get a firmer grip on the realities of what AI can and can’t do. After spending the previous few years getting their data in order and identifying areas where AI could bring quick rewards, or fail fast, big business is as a whole ready to move ahead with proven initiatives, moving from piloting and soft-launching to global deployment.
In financial services, vast real-time logs of thousands of transactions per second are routinely parsed by machine learning algorithms. Retailers are proficient at grabbing data through till receipts and loyalty programmes and feeding it into AI engines to work out how to get better at selling us things. Manufacturers use predictive technology to know precisely what stresses machinery can be put under and when it is likely to break down or fail.
In 2019 we’ll see growing confidence that this smart, predictive technology, bolstered by learnings it has picked up in its initial deployments, can be rolled out wholesale across all of a business’s operations.
AI will branch out into support functions such as HR or optimizing supply chains, where decisions around logistics, as well as hiring and firing, will become increasingly informed by automation. AI solutions for managing compliance and legal issues are also likely to be increasingly adopted. As these tools will often be fit-for-purpose across a number of organizations, they will increasingly be offered as-a-service, offering smaller businesses a bite of the AI cherry, too.
We’re also likely to see an increase in businesses using their data to generate new revenue streams. Building up big databases of transactions and customer activity within its industry essentially lets any sufficiently data-savvy business begin to “Googlify” itself. Becoming a source of data-as-a-service has been transformational for businesses such as John Deere, which offers analytics based on agricultural data to help farmers grow crops more efficiently. In 2019 more companies will adopt this strategy as they come to understand the value of the information they own.

 More jobs will be created by AI than will be lost to it. 

As I mentioned in my introduction to this post, in the long-term its uncertain if the rise of the machines will lead to human unemployment and social strife, a utopian workless future, or (probably more realistically) something in between.
For the next year, at least, though, it seems it isn’t going to be immediately problematic in this regard. Gartner predicts that by the end of 2019, AI will be creating more jobs than it is taking.
While 1.8 million jobs will be lost to automation – with manufacturing in particular singled out as likely to take a hit – 2.3 million will be created. In particular, Gartner's report finds, these could be focused on education, healthcare, and the public sector.
A likely driver for this disparity is the emphasis placed on rolling out AI in an ""augmenting"" capacity when it comes to deploying it in non-manual jobs. Warehouse workers and retail cashiers have often been replaced wholesale by automated technology. But when it comes to doctors and lawyers, AI service providers have made concerted effort to present their technology as something which can work alongside human professionals, assisting them with repetitive tasks while leaving the ""final say"" to them.
This means those industries benefit from the growth in human jobs on the technical side – those needed to deploy the technology and train the workforce on using it – while retaining the professionals who carry out the actual work.
For the financial services, the outlook is perhaps slightly grimmer. Some estimates, such as those made by former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit in 2017, predict that the sector's human workforce could be 30% smaller within five years. With back-office functions increasingly being managed by machines, we could be well on our way to seeing that come true by the end of next year.

 AI assistants will become truly useful 

AI is genuinely interwoven into our lives now, to the point that most people don't give a second thought to the fact that when they search Google, shop at Amazon or watch Netflix, highly precise, AI-driven predictions are at work to make the experience flow.
A slightly more apparent sense of engagement with robotic intelligence comes about when we interact with AI assistants – Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, for example – to help us make sense of the myriad of data sources available to us in the modern world.
In 2019, more of us than ever will use an AI assistant to arrange our calendars, plan our journeys and order a pizza. These services will become increasingly useful as they learn to anticipate our behaviors better and understand our habits.
Data gathered from users allows application designers to understand exactly which features are providing value, and which are underused, perhaps consuming valuable resources (through bandwidth or reporting) which could be better used elsewhere.
As a result, functions which we do want to use AI for – such as ordering taxis and food deliveries, and choosing restaurants to visit – are becoming increasingly streamlined and accessible.
On top of this, AI assistants are designed to become increasingly efficient at understanding their human users, as the natural language algorithms used to encode speech into computer-readable data, and vice versa is exposed to more and more information about how we communicate.
It's evident that conversations between  Alexa or Google Assistant and us can seem very stilted today. However, the rapid acceleration of understanding in this field means that, by the end of 2019, we will be getting used to far more natural and flowing discourse with the machines we share our lives with.

A version of this article appeared in the Spring 2019 issue of strategy+business.
This interview is part of the Inside the Mind of the CEO series, which explores a wide range of critical decisions faced by chief executives around the world.

In 2008, Daniel Hulme started Satalia, a company that uses data science, machine learning, and optimization (making the best use of resources) to build customized platforms that solve tough logistics problems involving products, services, and people. Lately, Hulme has spent a good portion of his time explaining the ins and outs of artificial intelligence to other CEOs. He sees a big information gap at the top of most companies — yet this is where technology investment decisions are made. Misunderstanding AI, Hulme believes, can lead people to both overestimate its value and underestimate its impact.
Satalia’s work is a leading example of what AI is currently good at. Not coincidentally, it is also the commercialization of Hulme’s research at University College London (UCL), where he is the director of the business analytics master’s degree program. Satalia’s clients are household names in the U.K.; they include Tesco, DFS, and the British Broadcasting Corporation. (Disclosure: PwC, which publishes strategy+business, uses Satalia’s technology and is working with the company to develop an offering to take to mutual clients.)

Quiz: Are you an AI optimist?




The increasingly competitive market for AI expertise is both a blessing and a curse for Satalia. The company, with a staff of 30 that is expected to grow quickly in 2019, can’t attract talent through salaries alone, so it also relies on an innovative management concept. This organizational structure reflects what Hulme believes will become the prevailing model of successful corporations in the future. Satalia, a loose-knit operational hub, based in a trendy North London shared workspace, taps into a “gig economy”–style global talent network and offers flexibility and fun, with few if any layers of management.
The setting is a long way from Morecambe, a sleepy coastal resort town on the chilly northwestern coast of the United Kingdom, where Hulme, 38, grew up. Morecambe is famous not for computer science but for potted shrimp, a late British comedian (Eric Morecambe, who took the town’s name as his own), and a very British playwright, Alan Bennett. A girl Hulme met at age 16 came from London, and inspired him to move 250 miles south after finishing secondary school. There, he entered UCL and the world of artificial intelligence. In September 2018, Hulme sat down with strategy+business in the cafeteria of Satalia’s shared offices to explain the artificial intelligence revolution and why there are no truly intelligent machines — yet.
S+B: What drew you to artificial intelligence?
HULME: I’ve always been interested in what it means to be human, and in the nature of the universe. I did my undergraduate [degree] in AI and my master’s in AI, and my Ph.D. in AI, so I guess I’ve been doing 19 years’ worth of activity in AI.
S+B: What is your definition of AI?
HULME: There are two definitions of AI, and the more popular one is the weakest. This first definition [concerns] machines that can do tasks that were traditionally in the realm of human beings. Over the past decade, due to advances in technologies like deep learning, we have started to build machines that can do things like recognize objects in images, and understand and respond to natural language. Humans are the most intelligent things we know in the universe, so when we start to see machines do tasks once constrained to the human domain, then we assume that is intelligence.

But I would argue that humans are not that intelligent. Humans are good at finding patterns in, at most, four dimensions, and we’re terrible at solving problems that involve more than seven things. Machines can find patterns in thousands of dimensions and can solve problems that involve millions of things. Even these technologies aren’t AI — they’re just algorithms. They do the same thing over and over again. In fact, my definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result.
S+B: And the second definition of AI?
HULME: The best definition of intelligence — artificial or human — that I’ve found is goal-directed adaptive behavior. I use goal-directed in the sense of trying to achieve an objective, which in business might be to roster your staff more effectively, or to allocate marketing spend to sell as [much] ice cream as possible. It might be whatever goal you’re seeking.
Behavior is how quickly or frictionlessly I can move resources to achieve the objective. For example, if my goal is to sell lots of ice cream, how can I allocate my resources to make sure that I’m achieving the objective?

But the key word for me in the definition of goal-directed adaptive behavior is adaptive. If your computer system is not making a decision and then learning whether that decision was good or bad and adapting its own internal model of the world, I would argue that it’s not true AI. And it’s OK for companies at the moment to be calling machine learning AI. So for me, the true [definition of] AI [involves] systems that can learn and adapt themselves without the aid of a human. Adaptability is synonymous with intelligence.
In fact, most companies don’t have machine learning problems — they have optimization problems. Optimization is the process of allocating resources to achieve an objective, subject to some constraints. Optimization problems are exceptionally hard to solve. For example, how should I route my vehicles to minimize travel time, or how do I allocate staff to maximize utilization, or how do I spend marketing money to maximize impact, or how do I allocate sales staff to opportunities to maximize yield? There are only a handful of people across the world who are good at solving problems like this with AI.
S+B: How do you think CEOs see AI today?
HULME: Many CEOs feel they need to bring AI into their organization. There’s this fear factor that if you’re not on the AI bandwagon, then you’re going to lose out to competitors that are going to be eating your market, because they’re using technologies to make decisions faster and better than you.
They may ask the chief information officer, “What are we doing in AI?” And the CIO will then hire or try to hire data scientists, whose work represents a kind of proxy for AI. But data scientists only have a certain type of skill. They understand how to use statistics and machine learning to find patterns in data. They’re not necessarily good at building production-grade systems that can make decisions or that can adapt themselves.
S+B: So you don’t believe that machine learning, in itself, can evolve into the kinds of adaptive systems that companies need.
HULME: A lot of people are saying, “Well, [with] these deep learning models, these data scientists will solve all our problems,” and actually, they won’t. As I said, machine learning, data science, and statistics are great at finding patterns in data. But the most important thing is making decisions that leverage the patterns found in data. This requires a completely different set of skills: discrete mathematics, operations research, and optimization. These skills are massively underrepresented in industry.
S+B: What kinds of questions, then, should CEOs be asking about AI?
HULME: One is, what technologies and solutions should they be bringing into their organization to remove the biggest frictions? So first they need to identify the big frictions that are aligned to their core competencies and assess what technologies they need to innovate the core competencies. The biggest frictions might come from having lots of costs associated with employing people. Or the company might have frictions associated with customer experience. Or, if I have a lot of analysts reading lots of reports and then trying to synthesize those reports into information, we can get machine learning to do that better.

CEOs also need to have a very clear understanding about the competitive landscape. Most companies don’t just have direct competition; they also have indirect competition from the Googles and the Facebooks and the Alibabas. Lots of those big companies can enter almost any market and shake it up. So companies need to be looking tangentially at indirect competitors and assessing what these competitors could do, given all the data that they’re currently sitting on — because once they figure out how to mobilize that data, they can cannibalize those markets.
And then the third question CEOs should ask is how do they bring the right talent capability into their organization to help execute a strategy to remain competitive? It’s hard for most companies to do this, so you have to learn to work with startups and third-party vendors to deliver innovations and help you quickly adapt to a changing world.
S+B: On the question of talent and skills: You say data science is only part of it. What other categories should companies be looking at?
HULME: There are four categories of AI skills. The first category is the data. Companies should ask: Are we getting our data into the shape where people can consume it? There are lots of companies out there that are throwing money at building data lakes — that’s all the raw data that a company holds from code generation to sales information — because they think at some point in the future data lakes will be useful. That’s not a bad investment, but I would also suggest that you need to be building applications straight away on top of that data lake that drive value into your business. Companies…should be thinking about building digital twins of their organizations, i.e., a perfect digital representation of their physical assets, like their infrastructure and employees.
S+B: What’s the second AI category?
HULME: Next is recruiting data scientists who have the machine learning and statistics skills to find insights from the data. Then, the third is [finding] what I call the decision scientists: people who can understand how to make decisions or solve optimization problems that leverage those insights.
And fourth, crucially, for true AI, you need to have an AI architect who understands how to glue these three components together: the data, the machine learning, and the optimization to build adaptive systems. And at the moment, it’s the CIO who is trying to step into that role of overseeing this. But I don’t know of many companies out there that have true AI architects. For now, companies are managing maybe part of this, but not all four categories.
S+B: Can you say more about the digital twin concept? What can digital twins be used for?
HULME: Digital twins are the next evolution of digital transformation. To be able to adapt more quickly to a changing world, companies need to create a digital replica of all of their physical assets, their infrastructure and people. Once you have a twin, you can start to run experiments and simulate scenarios to operate your business more effectively. Further down the line we may even have AI setting those experiments, and running experiments without the aid of the human. The role of the strategist and of leadership is to develop a strong vision and purpose, i.e., [determining] what key objective the organization needs to aspire to. I hope that organizations will realize that this objective needs to be much more sophisticated than a financial return to be able to attract, empower, and motivate talent. Exceptional talent wants to align with a strong purpose and inspirational leaders.

S+B: Are we going to have a wave of wasted AI spending?
HULME: There is a bit of a bubble in AI. I don’t think that it’s going to go to waste. I think that all this investment will be additive, but there’s an over-expectation of what machine learning can bring right now, because of a lack of appreciation of the fact that machine learning is only part of the journey. And the next part of the journey for most big companies is optimization and decision making.
S+B: You’re saying that AI is simultaneously overhyped and underexploited.
HULME: As [futurist] Roy Amara noted, the impact of technology tends to be overestimated in the short run and underestimated in the long run. For now, you can probably ignore the idea of having adaptive systems in your business. That will come later. In the short run, you can use AI to remove the friction of mundane and repetitive tasks across the organization. If used correctly, this can absolutely change your business. But there’s a lot of hype out there, and a lot of people investing in these technologies don’t know what they’re doing.
S+B: How well equipped is AI to help business leaders forecast the future?
HULME: The world is changing so quickly, it’s very difficult to actually have all the necessary data points to be able to help you forecast accurately. At the moment, that’s still in the realm of human beings.

“If used correctly, AI can absolutely change your business. But there’s a lot of hype out there, and a lot of people investing in these technologies don’t know what they’re doing.”

I’ll give you an example. Someone I know who worked at a loan company told me this story. They were trying to predict who might default on their loans, and they decided to collect social data from LinkedIn and Facebook to see whether they could find indicators there. Actually, all that data was useless. But there are two really good predictors of defaulters: One is the Internet caches [browsing histories] that contain websites with a particular font that is often found on gambling sites. The other is the number of mistakes people make when they are filling out the loan application, which [can be] an indication of whether they are intoxicated.
So you don’t need all the data in the world. You just need the right data, and the right amount of data. It all stems from: What is the problem we’re trying to solve, and how are we solving that problem at the moment? What data are people consuming, and what algorithms are they using? Because it’s most likely that data will solve the problem. We just need to start by replicating what’s in experts’ heads.
S+B: As the CEO of an AI company, what do you think are the greatest threats your company faces?
HULME: I used to think that technology was a threat, in the sense that my competitors had access to advanced technologies and data. But now I think [the worry] is not getting the talent to use that technology. How do you attract and retain that talent? And that comes back to culture and purpose.
One of the things I’m worried about is my team going to work for other companies that can pay twice as much. Bigger companies now have access to very cheap capital, and they understand how to get users, even by losing money. They know that users are going to be valuable in the future. They know how to attract the right talent; they can pay high salaries; they know how to keep them happy by giving them beanbags and free food and all of this kind of stuff. And it’s going to be very, very difficult, I think, for traditional startups to compete with those organizations without them being hoovered up very quickly. Even in academia now we’re seeing the really good professors just being hoovered up by these large organizations. So the biggest threat for me is large companies that have access to infinite amounts of cheap capital that will be able to out-innovate me because of their access to [people].
S+B: Do you expect AI experts to be in high demand in general?
HULME: I do. Lots of companies will be telling their investors, “OK, we need to get money to build our own AI teams or data science teams.” And in reality, it’s going to be very difficult for most companies out there to attract and retain that talent. In some respects, that’s a problem we are trying to solve at Satalia. We try to help companies understand what kind of people they need and be honest with themselves.
S+B: Which countries do you think will move fastest with the next stages of AI?
HULME: It comes back to the ethical questions around GDPR [the European Union’s recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation] and building “explainable algorithms.” So if you’re building algorithms now that are making decisions in people’s lives, in Europe you need to be able to explain how those algorithms are making those decisions.

Unfortunately, countries that don’t have constraints — maybe the Chinas and Russias of this world —may be able to out-innovate countries that do have those restrictions, because it’s very, very, very hard to build explainable algorithms. And if there is no legislation for this, you may find unscrupulous organizations trying out systems that could have horrible outcomes, but there will be unclear jurisdictional repercussions. In a hospital, for example, is it you or the algorithm that just made the mistake? That’s why it’s important to understand and to explain how a computer is making its decisions. And we are not there yet.
S+B: Overall, what effect do you think AI will have on jobs? Will it create more?
HULME: In the short term, over the coming decade, I believe that AI will create jobs. In the long term, it will remove more jobs than it creates. I spend a lot of time thinking about the concept of economic singularity. This is the point at which AI will free people from their jobs and those people won’t be able to retrain fast enough to get another job, because AI will have taken it, too. Some experts believe that this could happen in the next 10 to 20 years, and that governments and our economy aren’t prepared for it. Satalia’s purpose is to try to address these future problems. We need to somehow create a global infrastructure that supports those people who are going to be out of work.
There’s another concept called the technological singularity, in which we build AI smarter than us in every possible way. It will be the last invention humanity needs to create, because it will be able to think infinitely faster and better than humans. Many scholars predict we will birth a superintelligence around the middle of our century. It will either be the most glorious thing to happen to humanity or perhaps our biggest existential threat. My concern is that if we are not cooperating as a global species by the time we create it, then it will see us as a threat and remove us from the equation. My purpose is to steer the world toward cooperation, and that means reinventing our political and economic models, and agreeing on a new objective function for humanity. The impulse for countries to increase GDP and companies to make profits means that more and more investment will be made to drive efficiencies and profits, which is leading us to a global economic and environmental crisis. We need a sustainable objective function, and we need to get everyone on the planet contributing to it; otherwise, we may destroy ourselves. I don’t believe that governments are prepared or can act quickly enough, so I hope the change will come from business leaders who have a huge influence and responsibility to steer us toward a positive future.
S+B: This implies that we need to put in safeguards now to ensure the ethical development of AI.
HULME: For millennia, philosophers have been debating how society should be structured and what it means to live a “good life.” As our environments start to intelligently interact with us, we’re giving them the power to create and destroy. We have to embed ethical behaviors into these system, which makes it an extremely exciting time for humanity, because we now have to agree on what those ethical behaviors should be.
S+B: Are there other technologies — perhaps blockchain — that will deliver this AI-enhanced world?
HULME: Blockchain technology is giving the world a trusted data platform, and AI is providing the means to collaborate and connect without friction. Over the coming decade we might see the emergence of a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization]  that will allow for truly decentralized and distributed decisions and actions. I can imagine a world in which anyone could boot up a project by launching a DAO that enables contributions from anywhere in the world. The DAO is similar to the open source movement, but in this new paradigm, anyone  —  software engineers, designers, marketers, accountants, and even strategists  —  will be able to rally around an idea and contribute to its development. Work won’t be provided for free or for kudos, as in the open source model. Instead, fiscal remuneration will be determined by the quantity and quality of the contribution. This means that anyone will be able to contribute to a project, even for just a few hours, and they will be rewarded fairly for their work. As people work on these open projects, the DAO captures their contribution on a public blockchain. These contributions accumulate to form a reputation that determines the rate of remuneration on future projects. People develop different rates for different skills, and the rate evolves dynamically over time. You would be paid a different rate for marketing work than for software development, depending on your relative skill in each.
S+B: This upends the financing models we have today, similar to the ICOs (initial coin offerings) that have been developed out of bitcoin. Will this continue, and what is your vision of this autonomous world?
HULME: Many of these open projects will use digital tokens as their economic model. A Cambrian explosion [a rapid diversification among animals found in the fossil record] of funding models will appear, such as ICOs and other types of token sales. Selling tokens will give DAO projects the capital to get started. By reducing the waste and friction, we may reach a point at which new innovations help ensure that everyone’s basic needs are met. Giving everyone seamless access to healthcare, nutrition, and education will mean that people have the freedom to create and contribute to DAO projects without the need for initial funding. Since digital tokens have no jurisdiction, contributors from anywhere in the world can be remunerated with the same currency. Someone in Europe who contributed the same value to a DAO project as someone in India would receive the same remuneration. And because everyone has a fair opportunity to contribute to DAO projects, there may be a rapid redistribution of wealth.

One of the founding principles of the DAO is that all products are open source. The creation of a completely frictionless free market, where the cheapest and best-placed people could contribute, means that toxic companies are starved of labor and customers. Efficient markets coupled with conscientious consumption could spawn tens of thousands of new organizations whose products and services are developed to meet real needs and provide real benefits.
People will be able to work anywhere they want, which could cause mass migration. Digital nomads could force governments to reassess and innovate their policies to attract and retain corporations and talent by reducing taxes and slackening employment laws. The freedom to work anywhere will cause substantial population shifts and reenergized communities, with people growing their own food, harnessing natural energy sources, and turning away from mass-produced or packaged solutions. This reemergence of community after years of isolated self-interest could have a huge impact on the happiness levels of all age groups.
S+B: Back to the here and now. How far away are we from solving technology problems so that being a small company today in this world of AI won’t be a disadvantage?
HULME: The tools themselves are not too far away. One of Satalia’s aspirations is to build a platform that allows somebody to boot up a company or an organization, and then attract people from anywhere in the world to contribute to a particular product or service. I have a personal mission to try to get the world cooperating as a global community because I don’t believe that our current economic and political systems are sustainable for the planet.
In some respects, the biggest threat to a company like Satalia is the limitation of its own internal structure. In the future, the success of Satalia will be to remove the concept of a centralized organization, and that means completely decentralizing Satalia itself. That’s OK. And that’s why I’m trying to operate Satalia as a self-organizing company. I want to build a platform to create a decentralized world and be an exemplar for what amazing innovations you can build if you harness and empower amazing talent. In a decentralized world, people could learn to cooperate and contribute more positively to society, and potentially help address some of the threats I’ve mentioned above. If I could create a world where anybody could boot up an idea and get people to surround it and drive it forward, then that’s a world that I want to live in.

The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) of the Council of Europe adopted in December 2018 the first European text setting out ethical principles relating to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in judicial systems.
The Charter provides a framework of principles that can guide policy makers, legislators and justice professionals when they grapple with the rapid development of AI in national judicial processes.
The CEPEJ’s view as set out in the Charter is that the application of AI in the field of justice can contribute to improve the efficiency and quality and must be implemented in a responsible manner which complies with the fundamental rights guaranteed in particular in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Personal Data. For the CEPEJ, it is essential to ensure that AI remains a tool in the service of the general interest and that its use respects individual rights.
The CEPEJ has identified the following core principles to be respected in the field of AI and justice:
 Principle of respect of fundamental rights: ensuring that the design and implementation of artificial intelligence tools and services are compatible with fundamental rights;
 Principle of non-discrimination: specifically preventing the development or intensification of any discrimination between individuals or groups of individuals;
 Principle of quality and security: with regard to the processing of judicial decisions and data, using certified sources and intangible data with models conceived in a multi-disciplinary manner, in a secure technological environment;
 Principle of transparency, impartiality and fairness: making data processing methods accessible and understandable, authorising external audits;
 Principle “under user control”: precluding a prescriptive approach and ensuring that users are informed actors and in control of their choices.
For the CEPEJ, compliance with these principles must be ensured in the processing of judicial decisions and data by algorithms and in the use made of them.
The CEPEJ Charter is accompanied by an in-depth study on the use of AI in judicial systems, notably AI applications processing judicial decisions and data.

Its negative impact under capitalism, and its revolutionary potential under socialism
Robin Clapp, Socialist Party national committee




 In Marxist terms, the fight for our future is not dystopia or utopia, but one of capitalism or socialism, photo www.vpnsrus.com   (Click to enlarge: opens in new window)



In a warning laced with ironies, former warmongering US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger – who presided over many of the atrocities of the Vietnam war in the 1960s and 1970s – warned in an article in Russia Today in July that: “We are in the midst of a sweeping technical revolution whose consequences we have failed to fully reckon and whose culmination may be a world relying on machines powered by data and algorithms and ungoverned by ethical or philosophical norms”.
The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machines that do not just carry out pre-programmed instructions but learn more new programmes and instruction by experience and by new situations, does pose fundamental questions for capitalists and the workers’ movement, with some AI advocates arguing that algorithms will soon surpass the intelligence of humans. They call this the ‘singularity’ moment.
Yet for socialists, there is nothing intrinsically revolutionary about these new technologies while they remain restrained by the capitalist mode of production that needs human labour power to generate profit. 
Indeed, in every previous historical epoch there have been new technologies, but their ownership has lain just as firmly in the economic grip of the ruling class of the day.
Robots and more highly developed forms of AI do not change the exploitation of humans by other humans and cannot solve the fundamental contradictions of capitalism.
The productive forces long ago burst asunder the boundaries of the nation state, but this process cannot be completed by capitalism.
Many AIs exist principally as digital entities, but in other applications the intelligence is embodied in a robot that augments human work.
In manufacturing, robots are evolving from potentially dangerous and ‘dumb’ industrial machines into context-aware ‘cobots’.
The technology is already used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites.
Calculating and predicting more quickly and accurately than has ever been possible what the likelihood is of a particular outcome, is the fundamental advance which AI brings.
In the future, it is claimed that AI could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids.
Yet in austerity-ridden capitalist society, even the filling of potholes is a task beyond this system.
Jobs risk
As long as capitalism is in the driving seat, a planned and coordinated rolling out of AI is impossible in a manner that creates well-paid jobs and new opportunities for workers displaced by machines.
The economist Robert Gordon predicts 47% of jobs in the US, most of them semi-skilled, will disappear in the next few years, while an in-depth study by Citi and Oxford University predicts that 77% of all jobs in China are at risk of automation and 57% of all jobs across the OECD (a grouping of advanced capitalist countries).
The responsibility for combatting this dystopian view of the future lies with the workers’ organisations and left parties.
But the leaderships have not put forward clear ideas for the organised working class to see its role in changing society.
Instead of simply bowing to the ‘inevitable’, the trade unions must formulate a programme for jobs that includes the demand for an immediate struggle for a shorter working week without loss of pay, sharing out the work without loss of pay and a real living minimum wage. 
These demands must be linked to public ownership of major industries under workers’ control and management, in order to facilitate democratic socialist planning.
The capitalists themselves at their annual hideaways in Davos, Switzerland, have begun to ponder this question of how to deal with displaced workers and the social risks that will be triggered by large-scale surges in unemployment.
Traditional ‘middle class’ jobs will be threatened too and as Karl Marx warned 170 years ago, the continuation of capitalism leads inevitably to the growing pauperisation of the mass of the population.
Therefore it is incumbent on socialists not to settle for the idea of a ‘universal basic income’ as advanced by many on the utopian liberal left, but instead to fight for the full socialist transformation of society, which alone can take full advantage of the dazzling potential latent in AI.
On the basis of a socialist revolution and common ownership, the distribution of the output produced by the robots can be controlled and distributed to each, according to their needs.
If society operates through maintaining the private ownership of the robots, then the class struggle for the control of the surplus must continue.
The use of robots has grown exponentially since the 1950s. An industrial robot costs about £4 an hour to operate, compared to average total EU labour costs of about £40 an hour or £9 an hour in China.
Pepper Robots which engage in basic interactions and monitoring with elderly people are used in thousands of care homes in Japan.
They communicate through speech and with gestures, moving independently and picking up signs that someone is unwell.
With 25% of Japan’s population now aged 65 or over, on present trends, there will be a shortfall of 380,000 care workers by 2025.
The UK will need up to 700,000 more care-working roles by 2030. Pepper robots are being trialled here too and recently one performed before a parliamentary select committee. What impact will this have on the quality of social care?
Robotics
China is now the world’s biggest operator of industrial robots, according to the International Federation of Robotics.
One company, which exports 1,500 kitchen sinks a day, has spent over $3 million on nine robots that do jobs formerly done by 140 workers.
The boss comments: “These machines are cheaper, more precise and more reliable than people. I’ve never had a whole batch ruined by robots. I look forward to replacing more humans in future.”
Robots are employed in abattoirs and butchery and can cut fat off meat much more efficiently than humans, because of the use of cheaper and more responsive sensors. 
Another boss boasts: “It’s becoming economically feasible to use machines to do this because you save another 3 or 4% of the meat – and that’s worth a lot on a production line, where you can move quickly.”
The payback period for a welding robot in the Chinese automotive industry dropped from 5.3 years to 1.3 years between 2010 and 2017, according to analysts at Citi.
China’s rising labour costs may be an indirect silver lining because they are driving technological advancement, but simultaneously, immense social problems are being stored up, where massive and constant displacements of workers is leading to a rash of bitter industrial strikes, a questioning of the regime and tomorrow, even revolutionary movements.
Technology is never a neutral factor in production in a class society. The internet is a valuable means of communication for the workers’ movement, but can also be used to undermine democratic debate and spread misinformation. In extremis, right-wing governments have shut it down!
Prior to the financial crash of 2007 which triggered the ‘great recession’, the gurus of high finance boasted that their wizardry with algorithms had assured them there was almost no risk to the ‘skyscraper on chicken’s legs’ that was the volatile, speculative and largely fictitious derivatives market.
They were soon to learn that financial algorithms are not infallible. Others continue to be hypnotised by the get-rich-quick crypto-currency market, powered by algorithms and destined once again to end in tears for the parasitic ‘coupon clippers’ (wealthy holders of interest-bearing bonds).
At best the applications of AI can be rolled out only unevenly by the private sector. Historically the much-derided state has taken the risk in advancing science and AI, with the algorithm that led to Google’s success coming from a grant from the US National Science Foundation.
The iPhone would not exist if not for previously developed public technologies – the internet, GPS, lithium-ion batteries, microprocessors, multi-touch screen, SIRI, click-wheel, liquid crystal display, and so on.
Planning
A major technological innovation is unfolding around nanotechnology – the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular and supra-molecular scale. 
This requires cooperation and coordination among a variety of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering and computer simulation. So far, it has been governments that have been primarily financing this research.
Today has parallels with the 1930s rather than with the post-war boom years, meaning AI is curtailed by capitalism, just as new technologies were stymied in the inter-war years.
The capitalist economist JM Keynes argued that the application of these technologies in the 1930s could even then reduce the working week to 19 hours. Yet investment and production seized up as economic depression spread like virus.
Marx and Engels explained through the law of historical materialism that the motor force of progress is the development of the means of production – industry, science, technology and technique.
The development of the productive forces is a process of humankind’s mastery over nature, of harnessing the forces bequeathed to us by our surroundings.
Those forms of AI that are presently conceived as most important include transformative developments like gene-sequencing technology, broad reach forms like the internet, economically lucrative breakthroughs like advanced robotics and potential game-changers such as energy storage technologies. 3D computers, once just a Star Trek fantasy, have opened up limitless possibilities.
In healthcare, AI can multi-scan cancer patients, allowing for adaptive radiotherapy where scanning, image mark-up and beam planning are done before every treatment session.
That way, the radiotherapy beams are sculpted to the tumour’s size and shape on the day, not when it was first imaged.
AI enthusiasts dream that the economic impact of these technologies – from falls in price and diffusion and improved efficiency, could be between $14 and $33 trillion a year in 2025.
AI technologies cannot, however, be harmoniously rolled out, due to the contradictions of capitalism. Capitalism can never give finished expression to the economic trends within it.
In Marxist terms, the fight for our future is not dystopia or utopia, but one of capitalism or socialism.
The real ‘third revolution’ will be the socialist one which, linked to the internet of things can connect everything with everyone in an integrated planned global network.
People, machines, natural resources, production lines, logistic networks, consumption habits, recycling flows, and virtually every other aspect of economic and social life will be linked via sensors and software.
Realm of freedom
This is the outline for a socialist world, in which humankind will be transformed. Engels once said “the invading revolution” is before us.
All capitalist institutions proceed from the belief that the capitalist system is permanent, yet the epidemic of chaos and crisis that is their system, creates social explosions out of which we can build the forces to change society completely.
The very future of the planet, from the struggle to eradicate disease and poverty to the protection of Earth from the horrors of climate change is a question that will be settled by the living struggle between class forces.
In the memorable words of revolutionary socialist Leon Trotsky: “For the first time mankind will regard itself as raw material, or at best as a physical and psychic semi-finished product.
“Socialism will mean a leap from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom in this sense also, that the human of today, with all their contradictions and lack of harmony, will open the road for a new and happier race” (In Defence of the October Revolution, 1932).

 RIT assistant professor and alumnus Rui Li joined the world’s best artificial intelligence experts to present a new machine learning algorithm at NeurIPS 2018, the largest AI conference, Dec. 5 in Montreal.   





Researchers at Rochester Institute of Technology are sharing their work amongst the world’s top artificial intelligence experts this week at NeurIPS 2018, the premier AI conference. The RIT team designed and implemented an algorithm that allows AI to analyze high-dimensional data sets more efficiently.
A paper on the RIT work, called “Sparse Covariance Modeling in High Dimensions with Gaussian Processes,” was accepted for the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), where academics and industry share work that pushes the boundaries of what is possible in AI. Rui Li, an assistant professor of computing and information sciences at RIT, was invited to give a spotlight presentation at the conference Dec. 5 in Montreal.
NeurIPS is the longest-running and largest artificial intelligence gathering for scientists and industry, with nearly 9,000 attendees this year. In fact, the first batch of 2,000 tickets for the conference sold out in less than 12 minutes.
The RIT research, led by Li, seeks to maintain a balance between speed and accuracy when a computer is working to analyze high-dimensional data sets. The new algorithm essentially helps to condense the number of dimensions while keeping the information statistically accurate.
For artificial intelligence to work, a computer must quickly analyze data with thousands of variables. This is what allows AI to find statistical relationships in data that a human never could. However, even for high-powered computers, these immense calculations can be time and energy consuming.
“This research is motivated by the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data sets and the computational capacity to analyze and model their volatility and co-volatility varying over some covariates,” said Li, who is also a 2013 graduate of RIT’s Ph.D. program in computing and information sciences. “The study proposed a methodology to scale to high dimensional observations by reducing the dimensions while preserving the latent information; it allows sharing information in the latent basis across covariates.”
For the study, the team designed and implemented an efficient inference algorithm for tractable computation.
“I model the observation elements’ changing covariances as sparse multivariate stochastic processes,” Li said. “To characterize the changing correlations, we jointly model the latent factors and the factor loadings as collections of basis functions that vary with the covariates as Gaussian processes.”
The work has applications in computational biology, where it can help find statistical relationships in thousands of genes over different experimental conditions. Another example of its use is crime occurrence correlations between spatially disjoint regions that evolve over time.
“By capturing the spatio-temporal variations, we can provide key information to predict crime occurrence over time and among regions,” said Li.
Li presented the work along with other top AI researchers in academia and industry. The conference also includes talks and demonstrations from tech giants, including Amazon, Apple and Google.
“NeurIPS is the top-tier venue in AI and machine learning,” Li said. “All the important major players from academia and industry leaders are getting together to present their cutting-edge research. I’m looking forward to meeting some legendary heroes in the fields.”
Other members of the RIT research team include Kishan KC, a computing and information sciences Ph.D. student; Feng Cui, graduate director of RIT’s bioinformatics program and an associate professor; and Anne Haake, dean of RIT’s Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. The work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).

FAIR turns five: What we’ve accomplished and where we’re headed 


 


				By Yann LeCun, Jerome Pesenti, Mike Schroepfer 



















Five years ago, we created the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) group to advance the state of the art of AI through open research for the benefit of all — it’s an effort to understand the nature of intelligence so that we might create intelligent machines. Since then, FAIR has learned a lot and grown into an international research organization with labs in Menlo Park, New York, Paris, Montreal, Tel Aviv, Seattle, Pittsburgh, and London. AI has become so central to Facebook that FAIR is now part of a larger Facebook AI organization that works on all aspects of AI R&D, from fundamental research to applied research and technology development.
FAIR has applied an open model to all aspects of our work, collaborating broadly with the community. Our teams publish cutting-edge research early and often, and open-source our research code, data sets, and tools like PyTorch, fastText, FAISS, and Detectron where possible. The approach has been successful for advancing the state of AI research. This year, FAIR’s researchers have won recognition, including Best Paper awards, at ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, and ECCV, and Test of Time awards at ECCV, ICML, and NeurIPS. We know working in the open allows everyone to make faster progress on AI.
Making machines truly intelligent is a scientific challenge as well as a technological and product engineering challenge. A significant part of FAIR’s research focuses on fundamental questions about the keys to reasoning, prediction, planning, and unsupervised learning. And in turn, these areas of investigation require better theoretical understanding in fields such as generative models, causality, high-dimensional stochastic optimization, and game theory. These long-term research explorations are required to unlock the full future potential of artificial intelligence. Of all the projects we’ve tackled over the past five years, we’ve picked a handful that show how FAIR has approached its mission, contributed to our field, and made an impact on the world.

This timeline highlights many of FAIR’s projects over the past five years.

Memory networks
In 2014, researchers at FAIR identified an intrinsic limitation in neural networks — long-term memory. Though neural nets could learn during the process of training on data sets, once these systems were in operation they were typically unable to store new information to help solve a particular task later on. So we developed a new class of learning-model-enabled machines that remembered enough of their interactions to answer general knowledge questions and refer to previous statements in a conversation. In our initial 2014 paper on this approach, we tested this by having a memory-enabled network answer questions about the plot of the Lord of the Rings series, based on a short summary provided to it. The system was able to learn simple linguistic patterns and generalize the meanings of unknown words, correctly answering, for example, that at the end of the story Frodo was in the shire and the ring was in Mount Doom.

FAIR continued to develop this approach over the next two years, extending the research and exploring related areas. With StackRNN, the team augmented an RNN with push-pop stacks that could be trained from sequences in an unsupervised manner. With bAbl, the team built data sets of question-answering tasks to help benchmark performance in text understanding. bAbI is now part of the open source project ParlAI that includes thousands of dialogue examples, ranging from responses to restaurant-reservation requests to answers about movie casts. We also iterated on memory network architectures, making them increasingly useful for real-world applications. These updates included end-to-end memory networks, which allowed them to work with less supervision, and then key-value memory networks, which could be trained by generalizing from completely unsupervised sources, such as Wikipedia entries.
Self-supervised learning and generative models
It has long been one of FAIR’s priorities to scale up AI by exploiting large amounts of unlabeled data through self-supervised learning (SSL). With SSL, a machine can learn abstract representations of the world by being fed unlabeled images, video, or audio. An example of SSL is showing video clips to a machine and training it to predict future frames. By learning to predict, the machine captures knowledge about how the world works and learns good abstract representations of it. Using SSL, machines learn by observation, a bit like human and animal babies do, and accumulate large quantities of background knowledge about the world. The hope is that a form of common sense could emerge. Acquiring predictive world models is also key to building AI systems that can reason, predict the consequences of their actions, and act in the real world.
In 2014, our friends from MILA at Université de Montréal proposed a new unsupervised learning method called generative adversarial networks (GANs). We were immediately fascinated by the potential applications of self-supervised learning. But as promising as GANs looked, they had been demonstrated only on “toy” problems. Starting in 2015, we published a series of papers that were instrumental in convincing the research community that GANs really worked. GANs are used to train machines to make predictions under uncertainty by pitting two neural networks against each other. In a typical GAN architecture, the generator network produces data — such as an image or a video frame — from a bunch of random numbers (and perhaps past video frames). Meanwhile, the discriminator network has to differentiate between real data — real images and video frames — and the generator’s “false” outputs. This ongoing contest optimizes both networks and leads to increasingly better predictions.
Each of our papers focused on different variants of GANs, including image generation in Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and Laplacian Adversarial Networks (LAPGANs), and video prediction in Adversarial Gradient Difference Loss Predictors (AGDLs). But our collective contribution was to show that GANs could “invent” realistic-looking images of, for example, nonexistent bedrooms, faces, or dogs.

This example shows a series of fashion designs created by generative networks.

Other researchers have since picked up on our work in GANs, using them to produce stunning high-resolution images. But GANs are notorious for being very difficult to tune and for often failing to converge. So FAIR has explored ways to make GANs more reliable by focusing on understanding adversarial training at the theoretical level. In 2017, we introduced the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) method, which proposed a way to make the discriminator “smooth” and more efficient, in order to tell the generator how to improve its predictions. The WGAN was essentially the first GAN whose convergence was robust on a wide range of applications. This avoided the need to balance the output of discriminators and generators as the system is optimized, which results in significantly more learning stability, particularly for high-resolution image generation tasks.
Since then, FAIR researchers and Facebook engineers have used adversarial training methods for a range of applications, including long-term video prediction and the creation of fashion pieces. But the really interesting part of GANs is what they mean for the future. As a brand-new technique that wasn’t available to us even a few years ago, it opens up new opportunities to generate data in areas where we have little data. It will likely be a key tool on our quest to build machines that can learn on their own.
Text classification that scales
Text understanding isn’t a single task but a sprawling matrix of subtasks that organize words, phrases, and entire data sets of language into a format that machines can process. But before much of that work can take place, the text itself has to be classified. Years ago, NLP models such as word2vec classified text through extensive, word-based training, with the model assigning a distinct vector to each word in its training data set. For Facebook, the status quo was simply too slow and too dependent on fully supervised data. We needed text classification that could eventually work with hundreds or even thousands of languages, many of which don’t lend themselves to extensive data sets. And the system needed to scale across the entire range of text-based features and services, as well as our NLP research.
So in 2016 FAIR built fastText, a framework for rapid text classification and learning word representations that takes into account the larger morphology of the words it classifies. In a paper published in 2017, FAIR proposed a model that assigns vectors to “subword units” (e.g., sequences of 3 or 4 characters) rather than to whole words, allowing the system to create representations for words that didn’t appear in training data. The end result was a model whose classifications can scale to billions of words, learning from novel, untrained words while also training significantly faster than typical deep learning classifiers. In some cases, training that had taken several days with previous models was finished in a few seconds with fastText.
FastText has proved to be a vital contribution to the study and application of AI-based language understanding, and it’s now available in 157 languages. The original paper has been cited more than a thousand times in other publications, and fastText remains one of the most commonly used baselines for word embedding systems. Outside of Facebook, fastText has been used for a diverse array of applications, ranging from the familiar, such as suggesting message replies, to the exotic — an “algorithmic theater” production called The Great Outdoors, which used fastText to help select and order public internet comments that would become the script for each performance. The framework is deployed at Facebook to classify text across 19 languages, and it’s used in tandem with DeepText for translation and natural language understanding.
Cutting-edge translation research
Fast, accurate, and flexible translation is a key component of helping people around the world to communicate. So, in the early days of FAIR, we set out to find a new approach that would outperform statistical machine translation, which was then the state-of-the-art method. It took three years of work to build a CNN-based neural machine translation (NMT) architecture with the right combination of speed, accuracy, and learning. (FAIR published a paper in 2017 detailing its work.) In our experiments, this approach resulted in a 9x increase in speed over RNNs while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy rates.

Not only are our multi-hop CNNs easier to train on more limited data sets, but they’re also better able to understand misspelled or abbreviated words, such translating “tmrw” as “mañana.” Overall, the NMT transition has improved accuracy by an average of 11 percent and sped delivery of translations by 2.5x. And in addition to improving our own systems, we open-sourced the code and models for fairseq, the sequence-to-sequence modeling toolkit that we used for our CNN-based system.
To sidestep the need for vast training data sets for translations (often called corpora), we’re also pursuing other methods, such as multilingual embeddings, which can enable training across multiple languages. Last year, we released MUSE, an open source Python library that provides two different methods for learning multilingual embeddings: a supervised approach, using the 110 bilingual dictionaries included in the release, and a newer, unsupervised method that allows new bilingual dictionaries to be built between two languages without parallel corpora. We followed this with an EMNLP award-winning paper demonstrating a dramatic improvement in unsupervised training for translation of full sentences.

Two-dimensional word embeddings in two languages (left) can be aligned via a simple rotation (right). After the rotation, word translation is performed via nearest neighbor search.
By sharing research and resources like fairseq and MUSE, we’re encouraging others to take advantage of faster, more accurate, and more versatile translation techniques, whether for research purposes or production applications.
AI tools that level everybody up
Progress in AI depends not only on breakthrough ideas but also on having powerful platforms and tools for testing and then implementing them. FAIR has prioritized building these systems and sharing them with the world. In 2015, we open-sourced the Torch deep learning modules created by FAIR to speed up training of larger neural nets. We released Torchnet in 2016 to make it easier for the community to rapidly build effective and reusable learning systems. Soon after, we introduced Caffe2, our modular deep learning framework for mobile computing that is now running neural nets on more than 1 billion phones around the world. And then we collaborated with Microsoft and Amazon to release ONNX, a common representation for neural networks that makes it simple to move between frameworks as needed.
In particular, our work on PyTorch demonstrates FAIR’s commitment to rapid iteration, meaningful impact, open systems, and collaboration with the AI community. PyTorch began as a small effort with just a handful of FAIR researchers. Rather than build a completely new deep learning framework, we chose to build on top of the Torch open source library, and we integrated with acceleration libraries from Intel and NVIDIA to maximize speed. We announced PyTorch at the beginning of 2017 — less than two years ago! It’s now the second-fastest-growing open source project on GitHub and the framework of choice for AI developers around the globe. In October, hundreds of members of the AI community attended the first PyTorch Developers Conference to hear presentations from Caltech, FAIR, fast.ai, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Tesla, and many others. And now the release of PyTorch 1.0 integrates the modular, production-oriented capabilities of Caffe2 and ONNX to provide a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment, with deep integration with cloud services and technology providers.

PyTorch is integrated in Facebook products that are used by billions of people, as well as in FAIR research projects such as fairseq(-py), which accelerates translations by 80 percent over the previous version. PyTorch is also used by ELF OpenGo, our reinforcement learning bot; our EmbodiedQA work; and our successful effort to train image recognition networks on billions of public images with hashtags. And beyond Facebook, PyTorch powers projects from AllenNLP to NYU professor Dr. Narges Razavian’s work to use AI to improve early detection of disease. And now Udacity and fast.ai are helping even more people get going with PyTorch.
Whereas PyTorch made it faster and easier to take models from research to production, our work on Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) has accelerated large-scale search. FAISS began as an internal research project to better utilize GPUs for identifying similarities related to user preferences, and it is now the fastest available library of its kind and able to leverage billion-scale data sets. FAISS has already opened up possibilities for recommendation engines and AI-based assistant systems. We released it as an open source library last year, and FAISS has been widely adopted by the developer community, with more than 5,000 GitHub stars and integration into NVIDIA’s GPU-accelerated scikit-learn library, cuML.
A new benchmark for computer vision
Seeking to understand the nature of intelligence is a study in multisensory modalities, but the story of FAIR’s past five years is really bookended by advancements in computer vision. Before FAIR was born, there was a small team of AI specialists at Facebook seeking to better understand how pixels represent people in images, so that the right photos might be surfaced for people at the right times. Fast-forward to 2017, and FAIR researchers had won the International Conference on Computer Vision Best Paper for Mask R-CNN, combining the best of computer vision worlds: object detection with semantic segmentation.

As the paper stated, “Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.” The work rapidly became the basis for computer vision research in the broader AI community. The technology was then integrated into our open source Detectron system, bringing the meta algorithm’s intuitive ease of use, speed, and accuracy to researchers everywhere.
This foundational work now underpins a myriad of Facebook’s current systems, such as automatic alt text to help the visually impaired and tools that detect objectionable content. It’s also groundwork for future applications: AR features across our platforms and Smart Camera in Portal have roots in this work. This research continues, with the focus moving to video, where our DensePose project will help our systems understand video content as well as they understand photos.

Image understanding: Faster training and bigger data sets
Computer vision isn’t the only area where FAIR has looked to address scale challenges. FAIR partnered with Facebook’s Applied Machine Learning (AML) team to tackle the limitations of training speed and training set sizes, as well as the lack of supervised data sets. In a paper published earlier this year, the team at AML discussed how they trained image recognition networks on large sets of public images with hashtags, the biggest of which included 3.5 billion images and 17,000 hashtags. It was an order of magnitude more than any previous published work and the results were the best published results for the industry to-date: 85.4% accuracy.
This breakthrough was made possible by FAIR’s research on training speed — FAIR was able to train ImageNet an order of a magnitude faster that previous state of the art. They got the training time down to under one hour, showing how to perform SGD training with minibatch sizes an order of magnitude larger than were previously considered practical. In their words: “To achieve this result, we adopt a linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training.”
With this improvement in training speed, we were able to perform directed research on weakly supervised learning on bigger data sets than was previously possible. Both results show the clear value of a partnership between FAIR and AML. When the science of solving AI is buttressed by practical research and application in production, we see rapid, state-of-the-art results.
The future of FAIR
When we created FAIR, our ultimate goal was to understand intelligence, to discover its fundamental principles, and to make machines significantly more intelligent. Our goal has not changed. We’re continuing to expand our research efforts into areas such as developing machines able to acquire models of the world through self-supervised learning, training machines to reason, and training them to plan and conceive complex sequences of actions. That is one reason we are working on robotics, visual reasoning, and dialogue systems. We’ve described some of the more concrete projects that show how far we’ve come, but we still have far to go in scientific and technological advances to make machines sufficiently intelligent to help people in their daily lives.

Here are three reasons why we should welcome the march of the robots.,https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,"A 2017 New Yorker cover by R Kikuo Johnson painted a dystopian scene. Robots pace and trundle past a homeless human kneeling at their feet, while one deigns to lower its gaze to flip a few coins in his cup. The image expressed perfectly the pervading, and misplaced, pessimism around the impacts of automation not just among East Coast sophisticates, but across the U.S. and the developed world. In fact, it is a view that has even infiltrated one of the last pockets of optimism about the future: the wide-eyed utopianism of Silicon Valley.Tech Support by R. Kikuo Johnson. [Image: R. Kikuo Johnson (illustration)/The New Yorker]When even the technorati are starting to agonize over the future of artificial intelligence and the perils of automation, you have to wonder. Elon Musk–often a champion of the human ability to improve its condition through material progress–is becomingfearmonger-in-chief of the artificial intelligence apocalypse: “There certainly will be job disruption. Because what’s going to happen is robots will be able to do everything better than us . . . I mean all of us.”The most widely held fear, and one that taps into our earliest fears about industrialization, is of mass unemployment as robots take most of the jobs. Other critiques of the proliferation of artificial intelligence and increased automation are more nuanced. Some say that it will drive even greater inequality between the “cognitive elite” and the deskilled masses. The Guardian reflected a widespread concern over the potential concentration of power by the robot-owning corporations: “If you think inequality is a problem now, imagine a world where the rich can get richer all by themselves.”These concerns lie behind growing calls for Universal Basic Income, robot taxes, and the break-up of Big Tech giants like Google and Amazon. But the situation isn’t as grim as we might think. Automation need not be stirred into a doom-laden soup along with Trump and climate change. In fact, if we step back from the narrow focus on technology and take a wider historical, economic, and humanist view, the picture is far from bleak. Counterintuitive as it may seem, automation can play a key role in creating more and better jobs, and rising prosperity. There are broadly three reasons to be cheerful about the march of the robots.[Image: Hulton Archive/Getty Images]Automation drives growthSince the Industrial Revolution, the automation of human labor has run hand-in-hand with productivity gains, economic growth, and an increase in the number of jobs and prosperity. It is productivity growth that largely accounts for why most of us are six times better off than our great-grandparents. As Paul Krugman put it, in economics, “Productivity isn’t everything–but in the long run, it’s almost everything.” How can automating work create more jobs?A classic example of how this process can work is that, during the Industrial Revolution, 98% of the manual labor involved in weaving cloth was mechanized. But, despite the concerns of the Luddites, the number of textile workers in the U.K. exploded. As costs plummeted, demand grew, and so did the size of the industry–and therefore job numbers. The cake got bigger. The jobs also changed from hand weaving to operating the weaving machines. A more recent example is the impact of Electronic Discovery Software (EDS) on junior lawyers and paralegals, who traditionally spent the bulk of their time sifting through piles of documents. EDS was first applied in the 1990s, and did the job more quickly and more accurately than humans. Yet paralegal and junior lawyer jobs have grown quicker than the rest of the workforce since 2000.How so? As searching became cheaper and quicker, law firms searched more documents, and judges allowed more expansive discovery requests. Economists have a name for the intuitive, but mistaken, idea that there is a certain amount of work to do in an economy, and if productivity increases there will be fewer jobs to go around–the Lump of labor fallacy. There are, of course, occupations that fared less well in the face of technology, such as typesetters, once graphic designers adopted desktop-publishing software in the 1990s. But the general pattern is that machines take over mundane tasks, and humans move on to do more sophisticated–and often meaningful–work that machines can’t do yet.And the net effect in a buoyant economy is job growth. A long view reveals that each round of automation brings similar fears–when the first printed books with illustrations began to appear in the 1470s, wood engravers in the German city of Augsburg protested and stopped the presses. In fact, their skills turned out to be in higher demand than before, as more books needed illustrating.Automation makes work more rewardingThe general assumption is that if the robot doesn’t replace you, it will deskill you. Yet a study by the Boston University School of Law into the impact of automation on 270 occupations in the U.S. since 1950 found that only one was eliminated: lift operators.The other jobs were partially automated and in many cases, this automation led to more jobs, often more skilled positions. The impact of ATMs on bank clerks is a case in point. The number of branch employees has grown since cash machines were first installed: ATMs allowed banks to operate branches at lower cost, enabling them to open many more. At the same time, banks morphed into financial-service providers, giving clerks more opportunity for upward job mobility. Machines generally take on the simple tasks, as humans move to more complex–and often more meaningful–work.[Photo: Franck V./Unsplash]Overestimation of machines, underrating humansIn 1979, Fiat ran a television ad in the U.K. for the Strada with the tagline, “Handbuilt by robots.” In the 1980s, the march of the robots was seen as inevitable and, as with the assembly line, car production would lead the way. Forty years later, Toyota, the guru of manufacturing innovation, has robots doing less than 8% of the work on the factory floor–a ratio that hasn’t changed in 15 years. When asked why, the president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, replied that “machines are good for repetitive things, but they can’t improve their own efficiency or the quality of their work. Only people can.”Even in manufacturing, automation isn’t as easy as many assume. Pessimists tend to overestimate the extent to which humans can be replaced and how fast it will happen. They share a faulty assumption with artificial-intelligence optimists, who look forward to “singularity,” when computer intelligence will supposedly surpass our own. They see impressive breakthroughs in narrow and bounded machine-learning problems, like beating humans at board games, and extrapolate that this singularity is inevitable and around the corner.advertisementThis assumption runs far ahead of current knowledge. Neuroscientists are only scratching the surface of understanding how our brains perceive, learn, and understand, while human consciousness is still a highly contested topic in both philosophy and psychology. We’re a long way from understanding human intelligence, never mind surpassing it. Gloom merchants tend to imbue technology with superpowers while running down human ingenuity. Surely our perception, curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, judgment, and adaptability will drive the world forward–aided by more automation.We shape technology and, of course, it shapes us, but it does not define our future. Social and political forces are pivotal. The fatalism around robot-driven inequality suffers from peering at the future through technology blinkers. If robots drive inequality, how is it that Sweden has three times as many robots as the U.K. as a proportion of manufacturing workers–and much lower levels of inequality? Many other factors feed into the U.K.’s relatively high levels of inequality, such as low investment in education and in research and development, an overreliance on cheap labor, and an erosion of union power.It is no coincidence that inequality in the U.K. soared between 1979 and 1990, during Margaret Thatcher’s assault on the unions. Fretting about robot-induced impoverishment tomorrow obscures the real policy-related causes of wage suppression today. With living standards stagnating across the developed world, boosting productivity growth should be a pressing priority. Far from running scared of it, we should be ramping up our investment in automation.Of course, the road to semi-automated economic renewal will not be pain-free–many jobs will be lost in parts of the economy, while others will be created elsewhere.But even more will be lost if the economy continues to ossify. This is where the state has a key role to play in devising and implementing an industrial renaissance strategy to navigate the disruption caused by the next wave of automation. This should include investing in R&D in job-creating sectors such as autonomous transportation, virtual and augmented reality, and data security, as well as introducing automation to the backward construction industry as part of a desperately needed expansion in housebuilding. There is, after all, no shortage of problems to solve and work to be done, including in human-intensive sectors that desperately need revitalization, such as healthcare and infrastructure.An ambitious program to support and retrain workers for the parts of the economy that will grow as a result of automation is also needed. In short, timidity, not technology, is the problem. We have nothing to fear, but the fear of robots itself.Kevin McCullagh is founder of the London-based consultancy Plan. Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

Evolving trends in the workforce are encouraging companies to reexamine their legacy ecosystems, and many are discovering that they lack the capacity most businesses today require to manage the modernization and digitalization of their workforce. As a result, these organizations require ongoing disruptive and expensive fixes in an attempt to bridge the gaps left behind from these outdated systems.Related: 10 Key Pitfalls To Avoid During the Digital Transformation ProcessBusinesses are also slowly realizing that, in order to manage today's modern workforce, they must use a system of record for time. Between companies' legacy technology, resulting disparate data, and inflexible and unintuitive interfaces, the picture is clear -- time management needs to enter the 21st century. The best time management processes collect the most data while asking the least amount of supervisors and employees, and many organizations are finding that artificial intelligence provides the tools to get there. With features like facial recognition, AI-powered chatbots and intelligent business process management, modern time management solutions can be frictionless, automated and unobtrusive. Artificial intelligence has found a home in today's diverse, mobile and modern business needs -- and leveraging it, organizations can support their workforce modernization and standardization initiatives.



AI can be applied to do the heavy lifting in the process of gathering time data, adding context and connecting it to metrics, which directly results in a more streamlined, centralized system altogether.New tools of the tradeAdvanced intelligent tech allows for automated data harvesting and seamless integration with an existing business structure. Mobile and non-intrusive data capture minimize the need for manual time inputs from employees, and instead automatically harvest time data from a business's ecosystem to tie back to specific deliverables and metrics. With facial identification, employees simply walk up to their time clock and automatically log in through facial recognition. This is fast, simple, and provides the benefits of biometrics without the additional hardware costs. If employees prefer a conversation, they can strike up a dialogue with a chatbot about their time, increasing adoption and accurate data collection.

Many managers today sift through the drudgery of time sheets, scouring for exceptions, errors and inconsistencies. Aside from adding administrative overhead, the real danger is in the error and delays that inevitably result from this never-ending manual process. Intelligent workflows simplify business processes by validating data in real-time with built-in exceptions, so supervisors of any department can get visibility where and when it counts. Whether it's approvals, payroll or compliance, companies can increase collaboration and reduce errors dramatically.Managing in the nowWith a wealth of real-time data now readily accessible, businesses are empowered to make important decisions almost instantly. Managers, supervisors and leaders can receive advance alerts and notifications that enable them to make proactive informed decisions with accurate data. With up-to-the-minute information on hours worked, compliance, exceptions and resource availability, errors and wasted time are all but eliminated.Related: 3 Forward-Looking Mindsets Entrepreneurs Need to Have About AITo prepare for the next wave of workforce modernization, businesses should be honing in on productivity. To start, measuring it accurately -- and in order to do that, businesses must account for 100 percent of resource time, and tie it back to all outcomes. With the digitization and modernization of time management, businesses are using these AI technologies to empower their employees to directly affect the outcomes. This promotes a system of record for time and work, enabled by artificial intelligence. By leveraging advanced technologies like AI and machine learning into the fundamental time tracking framework, and staying ahead of the curve on cutting-edge tech, businesses can achieve real profitability.

Call it the automation paradox: The infusion of AI, robotics and big data into the workplace is elevating the demand for people’s ingenuity, to reinvent a process or rapidly solve problems in an emergency.

It’s hiring day at Rolls Royce’s jet-engine plant near Petersburg, Virginia. Twelve candidates are divided into three teams and given the task of assembling a box. Twelve Rolls Royce employees stand around them, one assigned to each candidate, taking notes. 
The box is a prop, and the test has nothing to do with programming or repairing the robots that make engine parts here. It’s about collaborative problem solving.
“We are looking at what they say, we are looking at what they do, we are looking at the body language of how they are interacting,” says Lorin Sodell, the plant manager.

For all the technical marvels inside this fully automated, 8-year-old facility, Sodell talks a lot about soft skills such as trouble shooting and intuition.

“There are virtually no manual operations here anymore,” he says. People “aren’t as tied to the equipment as they were in the past, and they are really freed up to work on more higher-order activities.”
Call it the automation paradox: The infusion of artificial intelligence, robotics and big data into the workplace is elevating the demand for people’s ingenuity, to reinvent a process or rapidly solve problems in an emergency.
The new blue-collar labor force will need four “distinctively more human” core competencies for advanced production: complex reasoning, social and emotional intelligence, creativity and certain forms of sensory perception, according to Jim Wilson, a managing director at Accenture Plc.
“Work in a certain sense, and globally in manufacturing, is becoming more human and less robotic,” says Wilson, who helped lead an Accenture study on emerging technologies and employment needs covering 14,000 companies in 14 large, industrialized nations.
Few narratives in economics and social policy are as alarmist as the penetration of automation and artificial intelligence into the workplace, especially in manufacturing.
Economists talk about the hollowing-out of middle-income employment. American political discourse is full of nostalgia for high-paying blue-collar jobs. The Trump Administration is imposing tariffs and rewriting trade agreements to entice companies to keep plants in the U.S. or even bring them back.
The stark reality is that automation will continue to erode away repetitive work no matter where people do it. But there is also a myth in this narrative that suggests America has permanently lost its edge. The vacant mills in the southeast and Midwest, and the struggling cities around them, are evidence of how technology and low-cost labor can rapidly kill off less-agile industries. This isn’t necessarily a prologue to what’s next, however.
Cutting-edge manufacturing not only involves the extreme precision of a Rolls Royce turbo-fan disc. It’s also moving toward mass customization and what Erica Fuchs calls “parts consolidation” — making more-complex blocks of components so a car, for example, has far fewer parts. This new frontier often involves experimentation, with engineers learning through frequent contact with production staff, requiring workers to make new kinds of contributions.
“This is a chance for the U.S. to lead. We have the knowledge and skills,” says Fuchs, an engineering and public-policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “When you move manufacturing overseas, it can become unprofitable to produce with the most advanced technologies.”
The new alliance between labor and smart machines is apparent on Rolls Royce’s shop floor. The 33 machinists aren’t repeating one single operation but are responsible for the flow of fan-disc and turbine-blade production. They are in charge of their day, monitoring operations, consulting with engineers and maintaining equipment.

This demonstrates what automation really does: It changes the way people use their time. A visit to the plant also reveals why factory workers in automated operations need more than some knowledge of machine-tool maintenance and programming: They are part of a process run by a team.
Sodell opens what looks like a giant suitcase. Inside is a titanium disc about the size of a truck tire. Unfinished, it costs $35,000, and it’s worth more than twice that much once it’s machined as closely as possible to the engineers’ perfect mathematical description of the part. The end product is so finely cut and grooved it resembles a piece of industrial jewelry.

“I am not at all bothered by the fact that there isn’t a person here looking after this,” he says, standing next to a cutting station about half the size of a subway car. Inside, a robot arm is measuring by itself, picking out its own tools and recording data along the way.
Variations in the material, temperatures and vibration can cause the robot to deviate from the engineers’ model. So human instinct and know-how are required to devise new techniques that reduce the variance. Just by looking at the way titanium is flecking off a disc in the cutting cell, for example, a machinist can tell something is off, Sodell says. With expensive raw materials, such technical acumen is crucial.
It’s also important because current artificial-intelligence systems don’t have full comprehension of non-standard events, the way a GPS in a car can’t comprehend a sudden detour. And they don’t always have the ability to come up with innovations that improve the process.
Sodell says workers are constantly looking for ways to refine automation and tells the story of a new hire who figured out a way to get one of the machines to clean itself. He developed a tool and wrote a program that is now part of the production system.

Technicians start off making $48,000 a year and can earn as much as $70,000, depending on achievement and skill level. Most need at least two years of experience or precision-machining certification from a community college. Rolls Royce is collaborating with these schools and relying on instructors like Tim Robertson, among the first 50 people it hired in Virginia. He now teaches advanced manufacturing at Danville Community College and says it’s hard to explain what work is like at an automated facility. Jobs require a lot more mental engagement, he explains, because machinists are looking at data as much as materials and equipment.
The Danville program includes a class on talking through conflict, along with live production where students are required to meet a schedule for different components in a simulated plant. The group stops twice a day and discusses how to optimize work flow.

“You can ship a machine tool to any country in the world,” Robertson says. “But the key is going to be the high-level technician that can interact with the data at high-level activity and be flexible.”

But curiously, the résumé featured the term “data science” nowhere.Instead, the résumé belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold’s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.The idea is not to focus on job titles, but “what skills they have,” Mr. Garg said. “You’re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market — not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers — even for hard-to-fill roles — whom they might not otherwise have come across.And while that could also help some candidates, there’s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.“You get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,” Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer “doesn’t seem to have to compete for them as much.”For years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on résumés, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their résumés with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don’t explicitly appear on a candidate’s résumé.To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn’t list the skill on a résumé.By performing a similar exercise across an entire résumé, the company’s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEightfold can then use this data to better predict performance — say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional résumés.Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.“The tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,” Ms. Villanueva said. “We keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.”ImageAshutosh Garg, left, is a co-founder and chief executive of the hiring service Eightfold.ai, which has applied artificial intelligence to job recruitment. Kamal Ahluwalia, center, is president, and Varun Kacholia, another co-founder, is chief technical officer.Credit...Anastasiia Sapon for The New York TimesIn the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold’s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master’s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,” Mr. Garg said. “You can predict what they’re likely to do next very easily.” He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.“We surface people we think would be good draft picks,” rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. “This person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.In a technical field like software engineering, for example, a dropout from a no-name university could end up making a very comfortable living after becoming known to employers. But established coders are sufficiently in demand that wages are likely to remain high even as it becomes easier to find alternatives.In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master’s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.“You can think of cases in the product market where people thought they needed something special and you really didn’t — the commodity, low-cost person took over,” said John Horton, a labor economist at N.Y.U. Think of hand-held video cameras after the proliferation of smartphones.“That could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don’t need anything special here,” Mr. Horton said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAll of this presumes, however, that deep-learning technology is viable for use in recruiting and human resources and could eventually become commonplace. Surveys suggest that only a small minority of companies have adopted these tools, and that even fewer feel prepared to exploit them.A recent paper summarizing the findings of a conference at the University of Pennsylvania, involving roughly 20 employers, cited a variety of problems. Among them were the difficulty of measuring employees’ performance and the sense of unfairness that workers might feel if a computer were to make hiring, firing and promotion decisions.Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point — call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren’t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players — the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs — not the general population.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.Google says it uses machines to take a second look at résumés in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can’t claim. “We now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,” he said.Cade Metz contributed reporting.

“We’re moving closer to “Productivity 3.0,” where the product becomes the expert, so you don’t have to be.”
This fascinating Interview with Mitch Grasso, CEO and Founder, Beautiful.ai, focuses on how anyone, no matter how design-challenged, can now make beautiful presentations, with the help of AI-powered solutions like Beautiful.ai. 
1. Despite all the advancements in interactive technology and media, PowerPoint presentations have stood the test of time. What does that say about PPTs or about the professionals who use them?
I don’t think this says something about PPT. It says something about the value of presentations in general, as a way to communicate well. Clearly, using a visual medium to back up verbal communications is a better method to engage and motivate, as opposed to words on a page or a person simply speaking to a room full of people. Professionals that regularly use the presentation format have experienced the obvious value they offer. We see a huge opportunity with adopting this format as a way to “present” your work every day – not just for a formal presentation. 
2. What is the value proposition of Beautiful.ai? How is it different from say a Prezi or similar?
While presentations are ubiquitous, they still aren’t easy to create. We think people should be able to focus on their content and story, not worry about the details of design. The reality is most people aren’t designers, and most presentation tools offer this completely blank canvas. Just organizing and presenting ideas is difficult enough for most people, but when you add the challenge of having to visualize these concepts using an authoring tool like PPT or Prezi – it becomes a nightmare effort. We have built-in design “best practices” that let people communicate their intent without the distractions of bad design. 
3. Collaborative work places, remote work forces, mobile work – these are the new realities. It’s led to the rise of products like Slack and its ilk. How does your vision build on/support these new workplace realities? 
To me, collaboration has become table stakes – it’s “Productivity 2.0.” We’re moving closer to “Productivity 3.0,” where the product becomes the expert, so you don’t have to be. Our tool is smarter, intuitive and supportive, so we are excited about collaboration in the cloud, mainly because it allows for an improvement in product intelligence. 
4. What is the model of Beautiful.AI? What is your vision of how it can transform work?
At Beautiful, our mission is to make your work life simpler, more effective and more inspiring for everyone. We believe in “making work beautiful,” which is a tall mountain to climb but one we’re passionate about summiting. Imagine a future where visualizing everyday ideas at work is done with a few clicks of a button, so teams and clients are educated and motivated faster and more effectively. We’re excited about that future.
5. Who in the organization should be making a decision on investing in a product like yours for the organization (once you start pricing)? 
We have a “bottom up” approach to engaging with the enterprise. Right now, we’re focused on making individuals within organizations happy. We’re already appealing to anyone who wants to elevate how they communicate with colleagues and clients, which is entry-level employees all the way to the C-Suite. We’re less worried about marketing to specific hierarchies right now, and more focused on solving the problems of presentation design. Once we perfect the “presentation experience” for individuals, we will work on adopting the product for the enterprise.
6. What integrations are you planning in the near term? 
Currently, we’re allocating our internal resources for additional product functionalities that relate to presentation design. Our primary goal is to solve the problems with presentations first and we want to make that experience as close to perfect as possible — through automation, intelligence and good design. But we’ll definitely integrate with document management tools, workflow and cloud storage like Google Drive and Dropbox in the near future. 
7. What are your users telling you? What are the challenges with getting management buy-in to investing in productivity tools that feel, perform and look better?
First of all, our users are telling us that they love that we’re solving all the problems of past presentation tools. We get love letters all the time, and really appreciate hearing their feedback. The obvious, inherent challenges with enterprise are three-fold: supporting their existing brand standards (design), addressing specific feature requests (customer service) and onboarding new products (integration). In the meantime, we are getting a ton of inbound interest from corporations on how they can roll this out to their teams – they react very positively to the restraints of the tool, and the fact that it can maintain their design standards for them.
8. The data visualization space is becoming increasingly important for companies inundated with data, dashboards, reports and analytics. What trends are you excited about in this space as we head into 2020 and beyond?
In terms of trends, we are really passionate about the idea of telling a story by visualizing data. And that’s what we’re doing already: building tools that help you tease out that story and give it life through design and animation, instead of just showing boring tables and graphs.

Without them, the 10-year old insurance aggregator would have needed three to five times more people to do tasks such as selling motor or health insurance. About half the motor covers are sold by bots, a number Gupta expects will increase to 75% in the next couple of years.Thousands of bots will work alongside humans to book appointments with doctors, schedule meetings, deliver customer support, help access records, assist in work and so on. EY predicts a five-fold increase in their numbers at the workplace in the next year.You Might Also Like:View: How India's services sector is a perfect springboard for automationThe largest temp staffing company in India, TeamLease Services, has calculated that 0.1% of industrial jobs have been lost to robots, while 37% of the jobs that currently exist will change in some way. That change is coming about faster now, driven by bots or software applications that perform automated tasks such as searching online, paying bills, answering queries, fixing an appointment with a doctor or a plumber, helping in research, driving marketing campaigns, filing tax returns or checking for errors in documents without human intervention.Bots and robots both do the same thing. But bots are software and robots are mechanical. Yet both excel at repetitive tasks – ones we call the daily grind, or tedious chores.Robots have mechanised manufacturing somewhat in the last few years but in their new avatar, bots are altering services companies. A car manufacturer such as Ford could be using robots on the factory floors to make cars just like they do at their Gujarat export plant, but in the corporate offices, bots can be devising multi-platform campaigns to sell those sedans or SUVs.The scope is wider. That is why L&T is using them for payable and contract management; Airtel for billing and customer services; TataSky for finance and supply chain functions. Bajaj Electricals has Paddy taking employee complaints and booking technician visits and EY has deployed 1,500 bots for clients across functions — finance, HR, IT or any activity that has a set procedure (rule-based processing). At HDFC Bank, job applications from humans are screened by bots and the first videoconferenced interview is also with one.You Might Also Like:The factor that will be key to getting a job in the age of robotsWherever there is a highly templatised, predictable, non-cognitive assignment, bots are taking over. At the same time, they are constantly upgrading. Like HDFC Bank’s Eva is helping users decide between recurring or fixed deposits. In some financial services firms, bots are advisors, cherry-picking bespoke investment and savings products for clients after mapping their age, risk profile, time horizon and several other parameters.Depending on the complexity, a single bot can cost from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore to develop.“Earlier there were no alternatives but to throw bodies at mundane jobs. Now, bots are taking over while humans move to better quality, higherthinking jobs,” says Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, TeamLease.Bengaluru-based tech services provider Mindtree has gone a step further to make it official. It reported the addition of 426 bots to its workforce as of June 30 and 484 in its second quarter results.

The second generation, in use at present, can handle multiple tasks such as employee self-service, IT help desk or customer queries. The third gen will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and use self-learning to improve their own knowledge to help human users.Similarly, activity bots that Mindtree has built can decide who the best person (human) is to do a job. As machines do more tasks, humans can perhaps utilise free time to upskill themselves, argues Ravanan. “Bots will save human workers four hours in an eight-hour shift.

But while each bot is as good as, or better, than 2.5 human workers, it needs at least 5-7 people to develop, deploy and maintain it. Ergo, at least coders can rest easy.But in a billion-plus country where only 10-12% of the 480 million workers are in the organised sector, intelligent automation — though inevitable — is bound to face backlash. In election season, farm distress and youth unemployment is already political ammunition.Yogendra Yadav, national president, Swaraj India, feels it’s a “fundamental error in believing there’s something called advanced technology.” The US and Europe have deficient labour and excess capital, he argues, making bots relevant there. “In India, the situation is the opposite.

I can empathise with people’s fears,” says Ravanan. However, “getting humans and intelligent bots to collaborate and feed off each other’s insights will be key to evolution,” feels Gomatam.As per EY estimates, 40% of any job component is digital and increasing. “If the economy doesn’t grow, even bots will be unemployed. If the economy expands, as is expected, there will be jobs for both humans and bots,” argues Sheth. Of the 15 names mentioned in this story, three are of bots.

Canny algorithms invade our space with targeted messaging. In today’s Orwellian world, everything — from personal photographs to financial records — are vulnerable to the prying eyes of bots.   Facing unprecedented global backlash, Facebook and Twitter have purged millions of bots who have been spamming humans while promoting hate, misogyny, terror, sexual abuse and pornography or just plain falsehoods.“We now stop more than one million accounts per day at the time of upload,” points out Monika Bickert, vice-president, product policy and counter-terrorism, Facebook. About 1.3 billion fake accounts have been brought down in May-October.Of course, it is unlikely that the need for humans —to write a story, run factories or companies and work at the bank — will disappear. Still, dystopian though it may seem, the post of a bot manager who has been trained by bot teachers and hired by bots may be a coveted job sooner than you think.You Might Also Like:To hire US graduates, Indian IT firms go straight to source    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeHorror Stories Of Entitled PeopleA family of 5 gets on my flight.

And after all that, they take time out to share the workload of senior colleagues.Superhuman, you would say. We wholeheartedly agree. For Myra and Gia are not flesh and blood white-collar executives. They are bots.       66930787 66930388 66933549 66926731   It’s the Year of the Bots. They are efficient, can handle scale, accuracy and, most importantly, work tirelessly without a lunch break.Inspired by SoftBank-backed Ping An Good Doctor of China, insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar.com started a healthcare venture, docprime.com, with an investment of around $50 million in April. It would help users book doctor and lab appointments. Chief executive Ashish Gupta says it couldn’t have started without bots!At Ping An Good Doctor, bots enable 700,000 consultancies, with 1,000 bots working alongside human agents. “Such scale is possible only with bots.” adds Gupta, who is also the chief technology officer of PolicyBazaar. Without them, the 10-year old insurance aggregator would have needed three to five times more people to do tasks such as selling motor or health insurance. About half the motor covers are sold by bots, a number Gupta expects will increase to 75% in the next couple of years.Thousands of bots will work alongside humans to book appointments with doctors, schedule meetings, deliver customer support, help access records, assist in work and so on. EY predicts a five-fold increase in their numbers at the workplace in the next year.The largest temp staffing company in India, TeamLease Services, has calculated that 0.1% of industrial jobs have been lost to robots, while 37% of the jobs that currently exist will change in some way. That change is coming about faster now, driven by bots or software applications that perform automated tasks such as searching online, paying bills, answering queries, fixing an appointment with a doctor or a plumber, helping in research, driving marketing campaigns, filing tax returns or checking for errors in documents without human intervention.Bots and robots both do the same thing. But bots are software and robots are mechanical. Yet both excel at repetitive tasks – ones we call the daily grind, or tedious chores.Robots have mechanised manufacturing somewhat in the last few years but in their new avatar, bots are altering services companies. A car manufacturer such as Ford could be using robots on the factory floors to make cars just like they do at their Gujarat export plant, but in the corporate offices, bots can be devising multi-platform campaigns to sell those sedans or SUVs.The scope is wider. That is why L&T is using them for payable and contract management; Airtel for billing and customer services; TataSky for finance and supply chain functions. Bajaj Electricals has Paddy taking employee complaints and booking technician visits and EY has deployed 1,500 bots for clients across functions — finance, HR, IT or any activity that has a set procedure (rule-based processing). At HDFC Bank, job applications from humans are screened by bots and the first videoconferenced interview is also with one.Wherever there is a highly templatised, predictable, non-cognitive assignment, bots are taking over. At the same time, they are constantly upgrading. Like HDFC Bank’s Eva is helping users decide between recurring or fixed deposits.

China leads the world in hiring AI talents

        China and the US are leading the way in AI employment globally, with China topping the list with just over 12,000 job listings.    


        By: HRM Asia Newsroom | December 6, 2018
            

Topics: Asia-Pacific | China | Europe | News | Recruitment | US   


 
 
China has topped the list of 15 industry-leading countries with the most artificial intelligence (AI) job offerings, according to software company UiPath.
China has over 12,000 job listings covering roles including software engineer, intelligence researcher, sales engineer and product engineer. This is followed by the United States at 7,000. Other leading countries include Japan, the United Kingdom, India, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, and Poland.
The company looked at AI job offerings worldwide, scanning through 30,000 job listings from 15 countries.
UiPath reported that China’s Suzhou and Shanghai are the top two cities in the number of AI jobs, with 3,300 and 1,600 jobs respectively.
According to PwC, AI could add up to US$15.7 trillion (SGD$21 trillion) to the global economy by 2030.

And no one is safe. Artificial Intelligence will very soon capture the role of many white-collar jobs too, just like machines have taken away many blue-collar jobs and the tractors reduced many farming jobs..We have made a list of jobs which may soon be replaced by Artificial Intelligence. These jobs have a standard sequence of recurring activities or they are cheaper when computerized than carried out by a human. Such estimated patterns are easy to reproduce through highly developed machine learning algorithms..Call Center Customer Care.Why: At most of the call centers, humans are employed to answer and counter the customer queries. But, in the Google I/O 2018 event, Google displayed a demo version of Google Duplex. It was so wonderful that you wouldn't think it's a demo version. The assistant making calls and interacting with a real person at the other end of the line is not only amazing but also well, job taking. Google Duplex is so good and its completed version can easily replace the human workers at the call center..Tele-Marketers.Why: Today, chances are high you've received one of those robocalls from telecom companies and different service providers. In Uganda, most people remember these robo-calls at the time of the presidential elections when a robocall in President Museveni's voice called a number of people showing gratitude to them for voting..Many people hate this type of promotion and its return on investment is little. Therefore, businesses aim to mechanize it with cheaper and mostly more competent AI..Clerks.Why: Most bookkeeping is replaced by automated programs like QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Microsoft Office. These are more inexpensive than hiring people. One program is enough to perform all the company's book-keeping..Couriers.Why: The job of delivery guys have been reducing in some developed countries. They are getting replaced by drones and robots. As a result, this area may soon get dominated by automation and AI drones..In many parts of Africa, there are no delivery drones. In the technology world, what occurs in Rome does not end there. Soon AI will make its way to these markets too and the delivery boy will have some unemployment to deal with..Retail shopkeepers.Why: Currently, people are getting more dependent on online platforms than the physical store. Companies are trying to make the shopping experience as tremendous with features like self-checkout. Buyers are getting more tech-savvy and companies may take the help of AI to fix this. Physical shopkeepers are probably to be replaced by Artificial Intelligence and other technologies.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
