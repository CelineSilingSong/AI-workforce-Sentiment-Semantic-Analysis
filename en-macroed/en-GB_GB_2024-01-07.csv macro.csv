There is a direct correlation between using artificial intelligence and concerns about job security. The more workers leverage generative AI in their jobs, the more likely they fear that automation may replace them. According to a December CNBC SurveyMonkey Workforce survey, 60% of employees who use AI regularly reported they worry about its impact on their jobs. Seventy-two percent of respondents who use the technology recognize that automation significantly increases productivity.


Last year, Goldman Sachs published a report that estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology. The investment bank predicts that the growth in AI will mirror the trajectory of past computer and tech products. Just as the world went from giant mainframe computers to modern-day technology, there will be a similar fast-paced growth of AI reshaping the world.

Automation In Today’s Workforce
Automation is already being deployed heavily in the workforce. Seventy-eight percent of C-suite leaders have reported that their company actively uses generative AI today, according to a survey by UKG, a human resources and workforce technology company.

PROMOTED
Seven out of 10 C-suite executives say enhancing their use of AI is a central priority for their business, with 49% revealing that their organizations have benefited the most—with increased financial returns—from AI integrations.

The Benefits Of AI
AI can streamline workflows, increase efficiency and optimize resources, leading to cost savings and improved quality of work. By offloading mundane and repetitive tasks to AI systems, workers can shift their attention to higher-value activities, resulting in higher employee effectiveness and a more engaging and diverse workplace culture.

AI tools can help with decision-making in the workplace by analyzing vast amounts of data, recognizing patterns and recommending optimal solutions.
With that said, technology lacks human wisdom and discernment, so some level of personal human involvement will always be needed. The purpose of AI in decision-making is not complete automation. Instead, the goal is to help humans make quicker and better decisions through streamlined processes and improved accuracy.

“People jump to ‘all or nothing,’” said Hugo Sarrazin, chief product and technology officer at UKG, “The reality is that it’s going to automate tasks, not automate a full job in most cases.”

Some corporate software spies on workers to see whether they ever write the word “union” in their emails.As technologies grow ever more sophisticated in monitoring, surveilling and speeding up workers, many workplace experts say US businesses, labor unions and government are not doing nearly enough to protect workers from tech’s downsides.“Workers are being constantly monitored, and AI-based monitoring tools can make mistakes that can translate into unfair pay cuts or firings,” said Virginia Doellgast, a professor of employment relations at Cornell. “Workers often don’t know what monitoring tools are being used, what data the tools are collecting or how that data is used to evaluate their performance.”In Europe, unlike in the US and Canada, many unions have been pushing for years for protections against some of the more intrusive ways that AI tools track and manage workers. “This issue has yet to be put at the center of the radar for unions in North America,” said Valerio De Stefano, a labor law professor at York University in Toronto, who has written extensively on AI’s use in the workplace. “Unions in Europe are more aware of the uses of technologies from the surveillance standpoint. This is not something that unions in North America have focused on.”At some German companies, labor experts say, workers have won protections that could become models for US and Canadian workers. At Deutsche Telekom, Germany’s largest telecommunications company, workers have won a prohibition against algorithms firing workers without any human involvement as well as a ban on using data collected by digital monitoring to discipline or dismiss individual workers.“In Europe, workers have stronger rights to obtain information and participate in decision-making,” Doellgast said. “In the US, where there is a union present, workers have some information rights about AI and hopefully a voice in how it’s used. Where unions aren’t present, workers have no information rights, and all they see is the effects of the technologies on them.”Mindful of the downsides of AI and algorithmic management, US labor unions are starting to push harder for protections. For instance, at some call centers, the Communications Workers of America union has won not only requirements that managers notify workers whenever recording their calls, but also guarantees that management will only record calls for training purposes to help improve employee performance – and not for evaluating or disciplining workers.Dan Reynolds, the Communications Workers’ assistant research director, said the union has long been concerned about how new technologies affect jobs. “AI is a new technology often used to speed up the work, deskill the work, make workplaces more stressful and make jobs more demanding,” he said. “Our concern about AI isn’t just its effect on the number of jobs, but how it will affect the quality of jobs.”“Our goal is not to stop new technologies,” Reynolds continued, “but to make sure the gains of these new technologies are broadly and equitably shared.”Germany has laws requiring companies to notify their works councils about AI and other new technologies that they’re planning to adopt. Most German companies have work councils, which are worker-management committees that discuss everything from vacation schedules to the pace of work and the effects of AI.To prevent AI-based performance data from being used against individual workers, the work councils at Deutsche Telekom got the company to agree that performance data can be gathered only for groups of at least five employees. The company has also agreed not to use AI to gather certain personal information about employees, such as their political opinions or sexual orientations.Doellgast and De Stefano – who edited a recent academic journal about AI and work – say worker input about new technologies often reduces their invasiveness and other downsides for workers, while making the introduction of technologies smoother and more productive. Moreover, when workers have some say about new technologies, that often reduces employee resistance to those technologies.De Stefano pointed to some problems with using AI to hire and discipline workers. “These machines are, in many cases, unreliable,” he said. “They have certain discriminatory output, especially in hiring. These machines are basically benchmarked around a standard worker – normally white, prime-age, male workers. Anyone who doesn’t correspond to that benchmark risks being misjudged by these algorithms.”The AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation, has created a technology institute to develop expertise and policies on AI and other technologies. That institute is planning training sessions to educate union leaders and strategists about new technologies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s [scientific management] on steroids.”Ballantyne said the communications workers union, the hotel workers union, Sag-Aftra and the Writers Guild have helped lead the way on new technologies. After their recent 148-day strike, the Writers Guild won protections that require studios to disclose whether any material given to writers was developed with the help of AI.The US Chamber of Commerce says AI and analytics can have substantial benefits for workers and productivity, providing insights into worker performance and allowing for targeted coaching and training to improve performance.AI surveillance, the chamber says, can also help prevent workplace violence by, for instance, monitoring abnormal behavior in the workplace. While many workers criticize the use of “wearable” monitors, the chamber says “smart sensors and wearable devices can help” protect them, by detecting potential accidents, ergonomic risks, toxic chemicals and imminent heat stress.“While there are clear benefits” to AI, said Michael Richards, policy director of the chamber’s technology engagement center, “we understand there are legitimate concerns surrounding the use of the technology.”Employers “recognize that engaging in an inclusive dialogue about using new technologies is critical to fostering a culture of trust with employees”, he added.Annette Bernhardt, director of the technology and work program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, pointed to the home-care sector as an example where new technologies make workers’ lives more stressful. Many home-care aides must meticulously follow instructions that apps send them, while reporting back each and every task they complete.“We need strong labor standards around the use of these technologies,” Bernhardt said. “We need to support unions as they bargain around these technologies. Most important, we need to assure that workers have a seat at the table on these technologies from the outset, not just when they’re being implemented.”Bernhardt added: “When workers are at the table, it means better technology adoption for them and better results for employers.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Workers' rightsUS unionsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma AydemirSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggests‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read our privacy policyThe jobs safest and most at risk from Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been revealed, as experts predict AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs in the coming years. A study from investment bank Goldman Sachs found AI could take over a quarter of work tasks in the USA and Europe. As with all technological advances, AI will change the way we work, making some jobs redundant but creating others too.Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is “a major advancement”, the report said.Early last year, telecoms giant BT announced it will cut 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade, including replacing around 10,000 workers with artificial intelligence (AI), in a bid to cut costs. One of the UK’s largest trade unions, Prospect, found that workers overwhelmingly believe government should set rules around the use of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) to protect jobs, with 58% of workers supporting regulation.The UK government is also keen to promote AI investment in the UK, with Prime minister Rishi Sunak claiming AI could be the best thing that ever happened to the human race at the Bletchley Park AI summit in November last year. At the same summit, Elon Musk, Owner of X and Tesla, told the Prime Minister AI would be “the most disruptive force in the industry for jobs”, claiming that “there will come a point where no job is needed. What jobs are safest from AI?The table below shows the jobs that are safest from AI and automation, ranked by salary, according to analysts at job search engine Adzuna. They found that skilled manual jobs, such as mechanics, plumbers and carpenters have little exposure to AI, with medical professionals ranked among the highest-paid and best insulated careers. The average advertised salary for an oncologist in December was £201,243 - the highest on the list - while roles such as influencer, therapist and judge also ranked as safe from the advent of AI. There are also completely new jobs emerging since the AI boom, including machine manager, AI trainer and prompt engineer. What jobs are most at risk from AI? The Goldman Sachs report notes AI's impact will vary across different sectors - 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction 4% in maintenance. The job most at risk of being replaced by AI is data entry assistant, with an average salary £42,764, according to Adzuna. Careers in the media industry, including advertising specialists, journalists and writers also ranked highly on the list, as generative AI becomes increasingly more sosphisticated in producing long-form written content. Prior to his AI summit, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak attempted to ease people’s fears about Artificial Intelligence, saying: “It’s important to recognise that AI doesn’t just automate and take people’s jobs.“A better way to think about it is as a co-pilot.“As with all technologies, they change our labour market, I think over time of course they make our economy more prosperous, more productive.“They create more growth overall but it does mean that there are changes in the labour market.”More aboutAIartificial intelligencejobsJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies9Comments1/1Revealed: Top 20 jobs safest from AI takeover - is your job at risk?Revealed: Top 20 jobs safest from AI takeover - is your job at risk?The logo of the ChatGPT application developed by US artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI on a smartphone screen on 23 November, 2023, in Frankfurt, GermanyGetty Images

Since the arrival of Chat­G­PT, there has been con­cern that we are going to be replaced by robots. Gen­er­a­tive arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence, capa­ble of assim­i­lat­ing and cre­at­ing writ­ten, visu­al, or audio con­tent, is often described as a threat to jobs. With each new major tech­no­log­i­cal advance comes its share of debate and appre­hen­sion about impacts on the work­force. Dur­ing the indus­tri­al rev­o­lu­tion, man­u­al work­ers were at the fore­front of these major changes. Con­verse­ly, AI is now more rel­e­vant to man­agers and pro­fes­sion­als. But what will be the real impact of this technology?
Togeth­er with Pawel Gmyrek and David Bescond, Inter­na­tion­al Labour Organ­i­sa­tion econ­o­mist Janine Berg analysed the 436 occu­pa­tions list­ed in the ILO’s Inter­na­tion­al Clas­si­fi­ca­tion of Occu­pa­tions. The aim was to under­stand which types of jobs would be most affect­ed by AI on a glob­al scale. The authors used Chat­G­PT to analyse the tasks asso­ci­at­ed with the occu­pa­tions and assigned them scores cor­re­spond­ing to their poten­tial expo­sure. Some tasks are high­ly exposed to tech­nol­o­gy, oth­ers less so. The high­er the expo­sure poten­tial of an activ­i­ty, the more like­ly it is to be automated.
For econ­o­mists, the pri­ma­ry impact of arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence will not real­ly be the mas­sive destruc­tion of jobs, but rather the pro­found trans­for­ma­tion of work. For most pro­fes­sions, cer­tain tasks will indeed be car­ried out by bots, but this will leave time for oth­er, more com­plex activ­i­ties. On aver­age, 10–13% of jobs world­wide could be “aug­ment­ed” or trans­formed. The first jobs to use this tech­nol­o­gy will poten­tial­ly be ware­house­men, deliv­ery dri­vers, man­agers in the dis­tri­b­u­tion sec­tor, machine oper­a­tors and assem­blers, ser­vice and sales work­ers, dri­ving instruc­tors, dri­vers, wait­ers, archi­tects, teach­ers, musi­cians, etc. In all, 427 mil­lion jobs, or 13% of jobs world­wide, could change because of arti­fi­cial intelligence.
75 million jobs could be automated
Although the poten­tial for change is much greater than automa­tion, the risk remains very real, with 2.3% of jobs world­wide affect­ed. Admin­is­tra­tive jobs would be heav­i­ly impact­ed by automa­tion. “Call cen­tre employ­ees, sec­re­taries, data entry oper­a­tors – sim­ple, lin­ear activ­i­ties with lit­tle vari­a­tion in tasks and lit­tle inter­ac­tion with oth­ers – could be replaced by bots,” explains Janine Berg. In recent years, office work­ers have already seen their day-to-day work evolve. Accord­ing to the experts, 24% of their tasks are high­ly exposed to AI, and 58% are mod­er­ate­ly exposed. This is by far the occu­pa­tion most at risk. This means that 2.3% of jobs world­wide, or 75 mil­lion, could end up being automated.

Our study should not be read as a reas­sur­ing voice, but rather as a call to devel­op mea­sures to deal with the immi­nent tech­no­log­i­cal changes

Arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence will clear­ly not affect all pro­fes­sions in the same way. The tech­nol­o­gy is also like­ly to have dif­fer­ent con­se­quences for men and women. Women will be 2.5 times more affect­ed by automa­tion than men, not least because there are more women in low-skilled admin­is­tra­tive posi­tions. Con­verse­ly, male-dom­i­nat­ed pro­fes­sions such as secu­ri­ty, trans­port and con­struc­tion are unlike­ly to be affect­ed. As a result, 3.7% of wom­en’s jobs world­wide are at risk of being auto­mat­ed, com­pared with 1.4% of men’s jobs. This dif­fer­ence is even greater in rich coun­tries, with 7.8% of jobs held by women like­ly to be replaced by bots, com­pared with 2.9% of jobs held by men. In low-income coun­tries, few­er women are in the labour mar­ket, and low-skilled admin­is­tra­tive pro­fes­sions are pre­dom­i­nant­ly held by men.
Towards a productivity divide between countries?
The oth­er major dif­fer­ence point­ed out by the ILO econ­o­mists depends on the wealth of the coun­tries con­cerned. “In low-income coun­tries, arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence is unlike­ly to be deployed. The tech­nol­o­gy is expen­sive, and there is a lack of infra­struc­ture, with a poor elec­tric­i­ty sup­ply and poor inter­net con­nec­tion”, explains Janine Berg. In fact, by 2022, a third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion will not have access to the inter­net. What’s more, the struc­ture of the labour mar­ket in low-income coun­tries makes them less sus­cep­ti­ble to automa­tion. In these coun­tries, 0.4% of jobs could be replaced by bots, com­pared with 5.5% in high-income coun­tries. In terms of pos­si­ble changes to jobs, 10.4% of occu­pa­tions are affect­ed in low-income coun­tries, com­pared with 13.4% in rich coun­tries. In short, poten­tial automa­tion main­ly con­cerns rich coun­tries. They will be more dis­rupt­ed by AI, but they will also be able to take advan­tage of it. “This sit­u­a­tion could cre­ate a pro­duc­tiv­i­ty divide between rich and poor coun­tries”, says the economist.

While there are nuances depend­ing on the region of the world, the study broad­ly envis­ages the inte­gra­tion of AI into every­day life. Replac­ing humans with bots is not on the cards for the time being. “This approach could have been expect­ed to gen­er­ate an alarm­ing num­ber of job loss­es, but is not the case. Our over­all esti­mate points more towards a future where work is in fact trans­formed, but still present”, the econ­o­mists sum­marise. How­ev­er, this evo­lu­tion of work must take cer­tain issues into account to avoid a neg­a­tive impact. “Our study should not be read as a reas­sur­ing voice, but rather as a call to devel­op mea­sures to deal with the immi­nent tech­no­log­i­cal changes”, explain the authors.
Thinking through and organising the deployment of AI 
Janine Berg believes that gen­er­a­tive AI is fun­da­men­tal­ly nei­ther pos­i­tive nor neg­a­tive. It all depends on how the tech­nol­o­gy is deployed. The econ­o­mist details a num­ber of actions that gov­ern­ments need to take: “reflect­ing on the ques­tion of the bal­ance of pow­er, the voice of work­ers affect­ed by labour mar­ket adjust­ments, respect for exist­ing stan­dards and rights, and the appro­pri­ate use of nation­al social pro­tec­tions, as well as train­ing sys­tems will be cru­cial ele­ments in steer­ing the deploy­ment of AI in the world of work.”
It is not just a ques­tion of observ­ing how this new tech­nol­o­gy is applied, but of sup­port­ing it with reflec­tion and mea­sures. The aim is to ensure social dia­logue, rede­ploy­ment or train­ing for employ­ees affect­ed by automa­tion, and employ­ee par­tic­i­pa­tion in the intro­duc­tion of AI for those whose tasks will be trans­formed. “If we don’t put mea­sures in place, and these sys­tems arrive, more jobs than nec­es­sary will be lost. Work­ing con­di­tions will dete­ri­o­rate. There may be short-term gains for some com­pa­nies, but there will be social con­se­quences,” warns Janine Berg.

Generative artificial intelligence, capable of assimilating and creating written, visual, or audio content, is often described as a threat to jobs. With each new major technological advance comes its share of debate and apprehension about impacts on the workforce. During the industrial revolution, manual workers were at the forefront of these major changes. Conversely, AI is now more relevant to managers and professionals. But what will be the real impact of this technology?



Together with Pawel Gmyrek and David Bescond, International Labour Organisation economist Janine Berg analysed the 436 occupations listed in the ILO’s International Classification of Occupations. The aim was to understand which types of jobs would be most affected by AI on a global scale. The authors used ChatGPT to analyse the tasks associated with the occupations and assigned them scores corresponding to their potential exposure. Some tasks are highly exposed to technology, others less so. The higher the exposure potential of an activity, the more likely it is to be automated.



For economists, the primary impact of artificial intelligence will not really be the massive destruction of jobs, but rather the profound transformation of work. For most professions, certain tasks will indeed be carried out by bots, but this will leave time for other, more complex activities. On average, 10-13% of jobs worldwide could be “augmented” or transformed. The first jobs to use this technology will potentially be warehousemen, delivery drivers, managers in the distribution sector, machine operators and assemblers, service and sales workers, driving instructors, drivers, waiters, architects, teachers, musicians, etc. In all, 427 million jobs, or 13% of jobs worldwide, could change because of artificial intelligence.



75 million jobs could be automated



Although the potential for change is much greater than automation, the risk remains very real, with 2.3% of jobs worldwide affected. Administrative jobs would be heavily impacted by automation. “Call centre employees, secretaries, data entry operators – simple, linear activities with little variation in tasks and little interaction with others – could be replaced by bots,” explains Janine Berg. In recent years, office workers have already seen their day-to-day work evolve. According to the experts, 24% of their tasks are highly exposed to AI, and 58% are moderately exposed. This is by far the occupation most at risk. This means that 2.3% of jobs worldwide, or 75 million, could end up being automated.




Our study should not be read as a reassuring voice, but rather as a call to develop measures to deal with the imminent technological changes




Artificial intelligence will clearly not affect all professions in the same way. The technology is also likely to have different consequences for men and women. Women will be 2.5 times more affected by automation than men, not least because there are more women in low-skilled administrative positions. Conversely, male-dominated professions such as security, transport and construction are unlikely to be affected. As a result, 3.7% of women's jobs worldwide are at risk of being automated, compared with 1.4% of men's jobs. This difference is even greater in rich countries, with 7.8% of jobs held by women likely to be replaced by bots, compared with 2.9% of jobs held by men. In low-income countries, fewer women are in the labour market, and low-skilled administrative professions are predominantly held by men.



Towards a productivity divide between countries?



The other major difference pointed out by the ILO economists depends on the wealth of the countries concerned. “In low-income countries, artificial intelligence is unlikely to be deployed. The technology is expensive, and there is a lack of infrastructure, with a poor electricity supply and poor internet connection”, explains Janine Berg. In fact, by 2022, a third of the world's population will not have access to the internet. What’s more, the structure of the labour market in low-income countries makes them less susceptible to automation. In these countries, 0.4% of jobs could be replaced by bots, compared with 5.5% in high-income countries. In terms of possible changes to jobs, 10.4% of occupations are affected in low-income countries, compared with 13.4% in rich countries. In short, potential automation mainly concerns rich countries. They will be more disrupted by AI, but they will also be able to take advantage of it. “This situation could create a productivity divide between rich and poor countries”, says the economist.







While there are nuances depending on the region of the world, the study broadly envisages the integration of AI into everyday life. Replacing humans with bots is not on the cards for the time being. “This approach could have been expected to generate an alarming number of job losses, but is not the case. Our overall estimate points more towards a future where work is in fact transformed, but still present”, the economists summarise. However, this evolution of work must take certain issues into account to avoid a negative impact. “Our study should not be read as a reassuring voice, but rather as a call to develop measures to deal with the imminent technological changes”, explain the authors.



Thinking through and organising the deployment of AI&nbsp;



Janine Berg believes that generative AI is fundamentally neither positive nor negative. It all depends on how the technology is deployed. The economist details a number of actions that governments need to take: “reflecting on the question of the balance of power, the voice of workers affected by labour market adjustments, respect for existing standards and rights, and the appropriate use of national social protections, as well as training systems will be crucial elements in steering the deployment of AI in the world of work.”



It is not just a question of observing how this new technology is applied, but of supporting it with reflection and measures. The aim is to ensure social dialogue, redeployment or training for employees affected by automation, and employee participation in the introduction of AI for those whose tasks will be transformed. “If we don't put measures in place, and these systems arrive, more jobs than necessary will be lost. Working conditions will deteriorate. There may be short-term gains for some companies, but there will be social consequences,” warns Janine Berg.

What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is an emerging form of artificial intelligence that generates content. Popular examples of generative AI software include ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway. These programs are now used by millions of users to create text, images, video, music, and software code.
Indeed, generative AI functionality is all about creating content. It combines algorithms, deep learning, and neural network techniques to generate content that is based on the patterns it observes in other content. It analyzes vast amounts of patterns in datasets to mimic style or structure to replicate a wide array of contemporary or historical content.
For example, the image below was created using a text-to-image generative AI model. The prompt I fed the system: “a captivating portrait of a mysterious woman in a moonlit forest using a realistic style similar to Vermeer, with soft, golden lighting and a close-up framing.”

For many more examples of how generative AI serves users, see our guide: Generative AI Examples
How Do Generative AI Models Work?
Generative AI models perform several levels beyond traditional machine learning. By utilizing multiple forms of machine learning systems, models, algorithms, and neural networks, generative AI offers a tech-based foray into the world of creativity.
These models are typically trained on large datasets containing a wide range of information, such as text, images, and audio. By analyzing patterns and relationships within the data, the models can understand the underlying structure and generate new content similar in style and context.
Although the output of generative AI is classified as original material, in reality, it uses machine learning and other AI techniques based on the earlier creativity of others – this is a significant criticism of generative AI. This emerging AI technology taps into massive repositories of content and uses that information to mimic human creativity, which raises a question that is now being debated: Is generative AI a copyright violation?
One common type of generative AI model is the generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN framework consists of two main components:

Generator: The generator is responsible for generating new outputs.
Discriminator: The discriminator acts as a critic to evaluate the generated outputs for authenticity.

The generator and the discriminator are trained simultaneously to improve the generator’s ability to fool the discriminator. To train the GAN, the generator first creates random noise as input and attempts to generate outputs that resemble the data it was trained on. The discriminator then receives real and generated outputs and aims to classify them correctly as real or fake.
The feedback from the discriminator is used to update the generator, encouraging it to improve its outputs and generate content that is increasingly difficult for the discriminator to distinguish from real data.
Benefits of Generative AI
Generative AI offers numerous benefits for those who seek to create content, and its creative potential is seemingly vast.

Creative writing and art: Generative AI can do things like analyze the entire works of Dickens or Rollins or Hemingway and produce an original novel that seeks to simulate their style and writing patterns. It can produce this same mimicry in images and music. Generative AI excels at creating coherent text and images, aiding in writing, translation, and artistic endeavors.
Data enhancement: It contributes to data augmentation, personalization, and accessibility, making generative AI a versatile tool for various industries, including healthcare and finance.

Limitations of Generative AI
For all of its benefits, the limitations of generative are quite challenging – including historical biases in supposedly neutral system outputs.

Vulnerability to adversarial attacks: Generative models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where input data is carefully crafted to mislead the model into producing incorrect or unintended outputs.
Contextual ambiguity: Generative AI models may struggle with understanding and maintaining context over long passages. They can be sensitive to slight changes in input phrasing and might produce inconsistent or contextually inappropriate responses.
Potential biases: Generative AI models are trained on large datasets, and if these datasets contain biases or prejudices, the AI system may unintentionally replicate them in the generated content.

Generative AI Use Cases
By producing fresh content, generative AI is used to augment but not replace the work of writers, graphic designers, artists, and musicians. It is particularly useful in the business realm in areas like product descriptions, variations to existing designs, or helping commercial artists explore different concepts. Among its most common use cases, generative AI can:

Text: Generate credible text on various topics. It can compose business letters, provide rough drafts of articles, and compose annual reports.
Images: Output realistic images from text prompts, create new scenes, and simulate a new painting.
Video: Compile video content from text automatically and put together short videos using existing images.
Music: Compile new musical content by analyzing a music catalog and rendering a new composition.
Product design: Can be fed inputs from previous versions of a product and produce several possible changes that can be considered in a new version.
Personalization: Personalize experiences for users such as product recommendations, tailored experiences, and new material that closely matches their preferences.

What is Predictive AI?
Predictive AI uses statistical algorithms to analyze data and make predictions about future events. It is sometimes also called predictive analytics and may sometimes be loosely termed as machine learning.
Predictive AI studies historical data, identifies patterns, and makes predictions about the future that can better inform business decisions. Predictive AI’s value is shown in the ways it can detect data flow anomalies and extrapolate how they will play out in the future in terms of results or behavior. When used properly, it enhances business decisions by identifying a customer’s purchasing propensity as well as upsell potential and can offer enormous competitive advantages.

​​How Do Predictive AI Models Work?
Predictive AI models leverage historical data, patterns, and trends to make informed predictions about future events or outcomes. These models analyze past data, identifying patterns or relationships within that data, and then use this information to generate predictions about future outcomes.
Building a predictive AI model requires a business to collect and preprocess the data. This involves gathering relevant data from various sources and cleaning it by handling missing values, outliers, or irrelevant variables. The data is then split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model and the testing set used to evaluate its performance.
Once the data is ready, the predictive AI model can be trained. Various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, can be used. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the type of prediction being made.
During training, the model learns the relationships and patterns in the data by adjusting its internal parameters. It tries to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the actual values in the training set. This process is often iterative, where the model repeatedly adjusts its parameters based on the error it observes until it reaches an optimal state.
The accuracy and performance of predictive AI models largely depend on the quality and quantity of the training data. Models trained on more diverse and representative data tend to perform better in making predictions. Additionally, the choice of algorithm and the parameters set during training can impact the model’s accuracy.
Benefits of Predictive AI
For businesses that are experts at using predictive AI, the benefits range from understanding future trends to getting more value from each data repository they have.
Future trends: Predictive AI can enlighten management on future trends, opportunities, and threats. It can be used to recommend products, upsell, improve customer service, and fine-tune inventory levels.
Better accuracy: Predictive AI adds a deeper dimension and greater accuracy to management processes. When used optimally, it increases the chance of success and positive business outcomes, particularly in the area of forward-looking inventory management.
More value from data: Through accurate predictions and improved decision-making, predictive AI can help organizations glean far more value from the data by providing more information about each sector of that data.
Limitations of Predictive AI
Despite its benefits, predictive AI can’t yet predict the future with 100% accuracy, and some businesses have been frustrated by this challenge.

Data quality and availability: Predictive AI heavily relies on data availability and quality. If the data used for training the AI system is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased, it can lead to flawed predictions.
Ethical concerns: Using predictive AI raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, bias, and discrimination. Does a given company have the right to glimpse future trends about certain consumers?
Interpretability: Many predictive models, especially complex ones like deep neural networks, lack interpretability. It may be challenging to understand how the AI arrives at its predictions or to identify any underlying biases in its decision-making process.
Resource Intensive: Training and deploying sophisticated predictive models can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive, limiting their practicality in certain environments.

Predictive AI Use Cases
Predictive AI is finding innumerable use cases across a wide range of industries. If managers knew the future, they would always take appropriate steps to capitalize on how things were going to turn out. Anything that improves the likelihood of knowing the future has high value in business. Predictive AI use cases include financial forecasting, fraud detection, healthcare, and marketing. Predictive AI can:
Financial services: Enhances financial forecasts. By pulling data from a wider data set and correlating financial information with other forward-looking business data, forecasting accuracy can be greatly improved.
Fraud detection: Spot potential fraud by sensing anomalous behavior. In banking and e-commerce, there might be an unusual device, location, or request that doesn’t fit with the normal behavior of a specific user. A login from a suspicious IP address, for example, is an obvious red flag.
Healthcare: Find use cases such as predicting disease outbreaks, identifying higher-risk patients, and spotting the most successful treatments.
Marketing: More closely define the most appropriate channels and messages to use in marketing. It can provide marketing strategists with the data they need to write impactful campaigns and thereby bring about greater success.
Bottom Line: Generative AI vs. Predictive AI
As AI evolves, the distinction between generative AI and predictive AI is likely to fade. AI systems that seamlessly merge generative AI and predictive AI are emerging. Instead of using one set of algorithms to predict and another to create, advanced AI systems combine both and can deliver both types of results.
By combining the algorithms that identify trends and forward-looking correlations with those that recombine those patterns into new creations, the value of AI will be improved even further.
While there are certainly differences between generative AI and predictive AI, these distinctions are far from rigid. Each contains similar elements to the other. It is how they are put to use that brings about the different outcomes. As AI evolves, both generative AI and predictive AI will play a role in reshaping the future.

(Sanish Mondkar CEO of Legion at Workday Rising)

The stakes for enterprise AI in 2024 are already high. The shakeout at OpenAI and the EU AI Act have added new levels of complexity, raising questions about whether open source AI is viable - and how companies will approach AI amidst new IP lawsuits.
Not to mention concerning stories about unethical training data,  who owns the model's content IP, and model drift.
Will enterprises pull back on their AI pursuits? I don't believe so - but this type of volatility will compel customers to seek out AI solutions from trusted software vendors, who can assume a major chunk of the liability risk - and source different Large Language Models (LLMs) as needed.
A parallel line of thinking is that these developments point to big tech in firm control of our AI futures. To some extent, this is true. As long as we are reliant on LLMs with voracious needs for training data, organizations will find it difficult to train their own models from scratch - it's too resource/cost intensive.
Whether that will remain an impediment remains to be seen - but for now, there are other ways to move ahead. I've already documented use cases where the vendor doesn't need to build their own LLMs to provide gen AI results for customers. In such cases, customer-specific data is infused into the architecture via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) or other scenarios.
Gen AI startups with domain experts - a force for enterprise change in 2023?
This opens up the intriguing possibility that smaller startups of domain experts can build AI into their solutions - and provide impact that is much closer to ""out of the box"" than training your own LLM, and without the risk mitigation issues that do-AI-yourself currently raises.
With that in mind, I have a couple of standout examples I picked up on my travels, starting with Legion, an HR solution focused on the problem of the deskless/hourly worker. This is actually a difficult workforce to manage - and the solutions to do so must encompass the complexity of on-the-fly workforce scheduling.
No surprise then, that Legion has been knee deep in applying AI to labor challenges for years now. But when I met Sanish Mondkar, CEO and founder of Legion at Workday Rising, Legion had just announced their Copilot Generative AI Assistant. It was not a coincidence to find the Legion team at Workday Rising. Legion is a part of the Workday Ventures program.
Some vendors seem to mistakenly assume that the scale of big AI requires them to develop all their customers' AI solutions internally. But the savvier vendors will find ways of opening their platform to their partners' AI applications. That's why I thought Workday's announcement of their AI marketplace (and certification program) was one of the underrated AI announcements of the fall.
Legion: we need better workforce management in labor-intensive industries
During our sit down, I asked Mondkar how this all started:
Legion is workforce management, largely catered towards labor-intensive industries. So retail, hospitality and so forth. Our customers in those industries, we help them manage their labor force, from the perspective of scheduling them to work - and then capturing time and creating the timesheets. So payroll can be efficiently generated, and also increasingly, enabling employees to have more flexibility and ownership over their schedules - and work at different locations of the customer.

Mondkar says this kind of a workforce management can empower employees who typically don't feel very empowered:
This gives them more options to earn more wages, and also provides a lot of self-service tools for them if they want to manage this - if they're running late to a shift, like how to communicate to the manager or swap their shifts, or if they want to get paid instantly after the shift is over. So these are all the capabilities that add a lot of value to these labor intensive industries, because labor is a challenge for them.

I spent many years writing blog posts at a local brewery. I saw firsthand the complexity and urgency of shift-swapping and schedule management. Handling this manually means contacting every other worker every time a shift opens up - and individual workers may not even have all the contact numbers. Frantic Facebook Messenger threads aren't the way forward. As Mondkar explains, providing user-friendly apps for this purpose is crucial in today's tight labor market:
The turnover is very high; anything they can do to increase efficiency, but also simultaneously engage and improve the employee experience is a highly-valuable thing. So that's where Legion comes into the picture.

But many companies already rely on an HR system of record/cloud platform like Workday. So how does Legion fit in?
We integrate with Workday. We basically integrate Workday employee record into Legion, and then from Legion, we've downloaded the Legion app to managers in these locations. They use Legion to generate the schedule, and all that good stuff. So that's the fundamental value proposition.

Investing in workforce management - intelligent automation is a must
Given the popsicle headaches of hourly worker scheduling, it's no surprise that Legion invested in AI early. Mondkar says it comes down to their founding question: ""How are we going to improve workforce management?""
We saw two ways to do that. One is to make it more employee-centric as we talked about - so, make workforce management actually about the workforce. And the second was automation. If you look at any labor-intensive job like restaurants or retail, the managers, they are not managers of that store because they like sitting in front of software and creating schedules. That's not why they are there. They like to be in front of customers, and like to run it as a business.
No one will argue against automation, but they just want to make sure it's done right, because a lot of important decisions happen on a daily basis: how much labor needs to be allocated, where should it be allocated? How many people should work, who should work at what time? How to deal with timesheets?

That took Legion's team into an ""intelligent automation"" journey. But in practice, what does ""intelligent automation"" really mean? The response:
Intelligent Automation means the right decisions are made not just for the sake of automation. The model we built when Legion was founded was machine-learning-based demand forecasting... Legion went very deep with AI and machine learning from day one - and that's very important. We built AI-based demand forecasting for automated scheduling. We do things like when managers edit the schedule, we learn from those edits and we correlate that with employee behavior, employee preferences and things like me automatically.

For the last five years, Legion's AI-based scheduling automation has integrated a range of third party data, from weather forecasts to religious holidays. Long before generative AI, Legion's team was working with predictive algorithms, optimization through expert systems, and AI learning through neural nets.  So when generative AI heated up, Legion was on the case with their new Copilot. Mondkar says gen AI is a very good fit with the needs of hourly workers, who need a fast/intuitive conversational interface on-the-go:
The thing we find so fascinating about generative AI is for workforce management, 99% of our workers are deskless workers... We think and generative AI provides this natural language interface for this workforce. Plus, they do not have time to get trained on software. The turnover is so high. When a new manager shows up, you're training how to be productive as soon as possible.

As Legion puts it:
Regardless of their location or task, managers and employees can now engage with Legion Copilot to gain insights into labor regulations, internal company policies, and even bespoke training content.

Legion's Copilot roadmap includes:

Knowledge-Based Self-Service
Labor and Hour Compliance Q&A
WFM Conversational Interface - with ability to pull up and manage schedule, with user-permissioned actions like adding shifts and changing shift assignments (natural language queries like ""what should I know about the schedule?"" brings up the relevant info - full details on Legion's blog)

My take - enterprise AI is about domain expertise in 2023
As the new year kicked off, I asked the Legion team for an update, before they head off to the NRF Retail ""Big Show"" in New York City (you can book an NRF meeting via their web site). Legion hit several key milestones including gross revenue retention (GRR) of 97%+ and 55% growth in revenue, and 88% weekly active users on the platform. Legion this growth to ""an increasing need for AI-native solutions for workforce management.""
Via email, I asked Mondkar about the potential for smaller vendors to play a key role in enterprise AI adoption. Can customers move ahead despite the various roadblocks with consumer LLMs I noted in the intro? Mondkar's response emphasized the importance of customer data - and the collaboration that entails.

It is true that the ownership of data is a crucial factor in training LLMs. This may imply that larger players who has access to bigger datasets have an advantage. However, the world for enterprise software vendors is more complex. SaaS vendors do not automatically have rights to customer data, even if it is stored in their databases. Instead, SaaS vendors must collaborate with their customers to establish guidelines and obtain permission to use the data effectively. This collaborative approach ensures that customer privacy and data security are safeguarded.

In the generative AI debate I took part in on CRM Konvos this week, I cautioned about the copyright and IP problems the large LLMs are facing, but I also encouraged enterprises not to sit on the sidelines. This is a good time for customers to look to industry-specialized vendors to help them move forward with focused AI projects, with focused data - and minimize LLM risk, while addressing something that moves the business forward.
On the customer use case side, I'd like to talk further with a Legion customer once the gen AI use cases mature. For Mondkar, the ability to serve these customers has been propelled by their time with Workday Ventures.
There were a lot of synergies. We already had common customers. They liked what they got from us. They liked what they got from Workday. They said, 'You guys should be working more closely together.'

I talked about domain expertise being crucial to the next phase in enterprise AI. But maybe I should have also said a strong organizational purpose - one that elevates human work even while it augments and automates. That certainly seems to be what's driving Legion. As Mondkar told me:
Our founding thesis for Legion is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs. That's our mission.

The pandemic put pressure on that mission, as hourly labor reached a breaking point, and that pressure hasn't really let up.
The reason why it was building up was that there wasn't much innovation, or even frankly, desire to improve the experiences and uplift these jobs, fundamentally, from the perspective of experience. So I feel pretty strongly about that.

If you can build a business on that, I'll be rooting for you.

Nothing demonstrates the technology’s impact on our public consciousness better than leading dictionary Collins naming “AI” as their word of the year. The need to regulate AI was hotly debated, along with its benefits and impact on the economy and jobs.The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023 found that nearly three-quarters of companies surveyed plan to adopt AI, with 50% expecting it to lead to job growth. In the book Bridgital Nation, our Chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, predicts that AI could add 30 million jobs by 2025 and provide a major impetus to economic growth.Unsurprisingly, the impact of AI on the economy will be a major topic at the forthcoming Annual Meeting of the Forum in Davos, Switzerland. And it is easy to see why; some projections suggest the addition of an economic boom equivalent to India and China’s output combined by 2030. We’re at the start of a transformative decade in which generative AI is already reshaping work, life and business. In addition to its business impact, it will unlock benefits in healthcare, education and climate change. Yet, despite the intense focus on AI, we are missing something fundamental. Public attention has largely been on increasing productivity with accelerating outputs. But the real potential lies in the decision-making processes that precede that. Here, AI can augment what humans are capable of – taking them from average to great, making novices as proficient as experts – rather than rendering them obsolete. AI’s evolutionBefore looking into this, let’s define what AI means. Its evolution has been rapid and can be delineated by its expanding capabilities. Initially, AI focused on recognition tasks, like identifying objects in images. Its next iteration involved reasoning, analyzing what was happening, why it was happening, the likely outcomes, what we should do about it, and decision-making based on that understanding.The most transformative shift happened with the advent of generative or operative capabilities, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, LaMBDA and LLaMA. These models leverage predictions made during the reasoning stage and can make decisions and propose actions. LLMs go beyond the information fed to them and extrapolate, resulting in non-deterministic responses to the same input. They have the power to extract insights from unstructured content and when combined with enterprise-specific models, they can create a knowledge superstructure, enhancing decision speed, effectiveness and customer experiences. Augmenting, not replacing humans It’s clear that the most effective use of generative AI will be in augmenting human creativity, rather than in replacing humans. AI won’t replace jobs, but make people better at them, in part by the democratization of knowledge. This will allow for jobs to be elevated by AI, levelling existing knowledge gaps and increasing global access to information. Indeed, the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will be a net job creator between now and 2027. While there is an onus on businesses to support their staff in re- and upskilling in line with these developments, the benefits are clear for all to see; increased efficiency and, thus, often higher output are welcome side effects. The need to reskill people must be our first priority towards realizing this opportunity. At TCS, we have trained over 100,000 people on generative AI in the past year, and I am heartened to see similar efforts across the industry, which are essential in building up an AI-ready workforce. Have you read?How to harness the power of generative AI for better jobs? Experts share their viewsAutomation or augmentation? This is how AI will be integrated into the jobs of tomorrowDavos 2024: Who's coming and what to expectA new AI-first business architecture In today's knowledge economy, enterprises generate value through knowledge work, which involves decisions and actions taken by individuals or groups. Traditional techniques like machine learning and data analysis have been used to extract information from structured data. But then there is an organization's tacit knowledge: the unstructured content and data – often acquired by experience, observation, imitation and practice – that cannot be easily codified.This reliance on tacit knowledge makes decisions challenging to explain and causes variability in decision outputs, outcomes and customer experiences. GenAI or large language models can potentially extract insights from such unstructured content. Foundational models, such as GPT, LLaMA and open-source alternatives, are “world-wise” and can integrate common knowledge that may exist offline, such as in books or paintings.Combining such models with enterprise-wise ones and traditional AI/ML techniques, a knowledge superstructure can be created within an enterprise, increasing the speed and effectiveness of decisions and actions. This can improve customer experiences, productivity and talent utilization. The greater benefit of these technologies is in digitizing an enterprise's knowledge and reducing reliance on tacit knowledge in decisions and actions.The four-tier AI architecture for business Image: TCSThis requires creating large numbers of enterprise-fine-tuned purposive models or agents for each activity, which will be further augmented by these knowledge superstructures. AI should be viewed as a business redefinition exercise involving various parts of the business, such as legal, security, data, compliance and tech teams, to identify the highest value activities that can be transformed through a knowledge superstructure. Enterprises will need to invest in a four-tier architecture powered by hundreds or thousands of purpose-built models optimized for cost, quality, security and privacy. This complex undertaking offers significant opportunities to reduce reliance on tacit knowledge, deliver elite quality value, and reduce variance in output quality. A sophisticated and well thought-out strategy is required to drive this transformation within an enterprise.Taking decision-making from average to greatUltimately, generative AI offers an enterprise-wide opportunity to improve decision-making processes and overall efficiency. This integration digitizes enterprise knowledge, reducing reliance on tacit knowledge and boosting productivity and talent utilization. And it’s here where the current focus of public debate is misplaced, focusing almost exclusively on “action”, rather than on the potential to digitize an enterprise's knowledge and reduce reliance on tacit knowledge in decisions and actions. Simply put, the real value of AI and machine learning lies in the step before output, in improving decision-making. Why? Because it can help us overcome the gap between average and great outputs and unlock higher-quality outputs more consistently. It allows us to democratize knowledge. This could help improve outcomes in many areas – think of enabling doctors to diagnose and treat patients more consistently despite differences in experience and time constraints. If we harness generative AI correctly and focus on how it can augment our decision-making and creativity, we can unlock a powerful knowledge superstructure, enhance decision speed and effectiveness, and supercharge customer experiences.Turning average or even good work into great.

<p>Mentions of artificial intelligence (AI) in corporate strategy meetings will, at some point, end with discussions on the impact of the technology on staff.

<p>A <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/new-salesforce-research-links-lower-stress-levels-and-business-automation/""><strong>2021 Salesforce automation survey</strong></a> in the US reported that among 773 automation users, 89% are more satisfied with their job and 84% are more satisfied with their company as a result of using automation in the workplace. Additionally, 74% say using automation tools helps them get their work done faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The operative word here is that automation is a tool that supports or augments the way of usual work. Can the same be said of artificial intelligence? What can business, operational and IT leaders learn from the automation experience to help ‘sell’ the AI value proposition to the workforce?</p>

<p>Speaking on the topic, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew1248/""><strong>Matt Lyteson</strong></a>, CIO of Technology Platforms Transformation at IBM says every area of an IT department should be looking at AI – both traditional AI as well as generative AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He believes this helps accelerate the automation and intelligent operations of an IT department and achieves a broader scale than we’ve traditionally seen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“Companies should focus on areas that will yield the greatest return with the smallest amount of effort, for example, IT modernisation and IT support, and refer to industry use cases, which are already yielding results for many organisations,” he continued.</p>

<p>“There’s also been work around infrastructure resource and capacity management tailored to specific business application workloads. With generative AI, IT departments can develop intelligent automation capabilities more quickly for managing network and infrastructure,” he added.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, the maturing of automation of backend IT operations, including hardware, software and network, has also meant the introduction of AI technologies and practices to support &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/modernising-process-automation-for-growth/"">AI for IT operations</a></strong> simply means applying AI and machine learning to improve IT operations management. The rationale is that automation of routine IT tasks and processes will mean IT can focus on activities that drive IT innovation – as an example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyteson adds that where AI can take IT departments to the next level – particularly generative AI – is by enabling them to develop automation much more rapidly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It creates a repeated cycle where it’s easier to develop the automation, that took hours and weeks, within minutes. This accelerates IT modernisation overall opening the door for reinvestment,” he posited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in decision-making</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The biggest opportunity is IT operational data and the application of AI,” opined Lyteson when asked about the opportunities for using AI in data analysis and decision-making within the IT department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He posited that even if there is centralised logging and an observability toolset across the IT estate, parts of the operational environment are likely not included.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He suggested that starting with the data lake and <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/optimising-digital-platforms-for-ai-and-da-delivery-and-consumption/"">data fabric</a></strong>, IT departments can derive intelligence through a combination of traditional AI and generative AI. For example, when is the best time to make a change to the network? This simple request typically takes many hours of brain power to determine the best window and risk for the change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“AI can look at the risk of change based on various factors: the reputation of the team performing the change; the state of the network; any overlapping changes already scheduled; and other corporate events that are on the calendar. AI can help make recommendations like this, aiding in decision-making,” he elaborated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in predictive maintenance</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic has forced organisations to question the extent to which they can extract value from current capital investments. This extends throughout the lifecycle of all equipment used by the business, including maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyteson says hardware, predictive maintenance, and software systems have used traditional AI for several years. “IT departments should consider if traditional AI is delivering the results needed or if there is an opportunity with generative AI to take it to the next level,” he continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in service and support</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asked what the potential uses of AI in customer support and service desk operations within the IT department are, Lyteson pointed out that customer support and IT support via service desk are two fantastic use cases for generative AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He noted that with customer support, there are interactions with the consumer that go a few steps beyond <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/software-engineering-trends-to-stay-ahead-of-the-curve-from-2024-2026/"">self-service</a></strong>. “We can easily provide end users access to guidance to resolve issues on their own before contacting a service desk,” he explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He suggested that with the service desk, support agents have access to generative AI to answer questions on how to resolve issues. “This has the potential to drastically reduce the amount of time to resolve issues as well as improve the productivity of support agents. There is also the opportunity to translate speech or chat and interpret it in real-time to quickly identify solutions to recurring issues,” he outlined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Improving IT service management</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long before AI became a fashionable term to use, chatbots were in place to augment contact centre agents in the provision of helpdesk services. Today, AI-powered solutions can be integrated into the helpdesk practice to improve the resolution – at the very least, AI-assisted helpdesk can prevent IT support personnel fatigue.</p>

<p>“Change risk analysis with AI, incident similarity matching, and incident summarisation are areas where <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/rewriting-the-rules-of-it-service-management/"">IT service management</a></strong> and incident response are evolving with the advent of generative AI.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Matt Lyteson</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He added that this will be even more impactful as organisations stitch together heterogeneous data that makeup IT estates in real time to detect things before they become issues. “There are additional cases where solutions for repeated incidents are more attainable with generative AI compared to legacy knowledge-based search tools. Overall, this improves efficiency and efficacy of IT service management,” he concluded.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in <a href=""https://futurecio.tech/digitalocean-app-platform-to-simplify-appdev-in-the-cloud/"">AppDev</a> and testing</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whoever said software development is easy must have been drinking from the low-code/no-code water cooler. While writing code can become mundane quickly, debugging and testing applications opens a can of worms, ranging from poor code quality to complex dependencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyteson says before generative AI came to the forefront, there was already auto-test generation, application analysis for modernisation and even rudimentary development of language translation. New generative AI approaches can take it to the next level, offering code assistance for application developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This accelerates time-to-delivery and increases consistency and security if managed properly. With application development of legacy-to-modern language translation – for example, COBOL to Java – it produces real results,” he concluded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gartner coined the term <strong><a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/aiops-artificial-intelligence-operations"">artificial intelligence for IT Operations</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_for_IT_Operations"">AIOps</a></strong>) in 2016 referring to it as the combination of big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection and causality determination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As AI continues to mature, no doubt new use cases around its use to support all aspects of IT will reveal itself.</p>

Generative AI is transforming how we work. McKinsey found that 40% of companies increasing their investment in AI are doing so because of the advancements made in generative AI. Plus, 22% of employees say they’re already using gen AI tools in their work.In the contact center industry, companies are developing a variety of AI-enabled solutions to enhance the customer experience. In fact, 80% of employers believe generative AI will help them increase revenue and profits by enhancing relationships with customers and boosting customer satisfaction scores.However, the potential application of generative AI reaches far beyond just the customer experience. It can also be a valuable tool for supporting, engaging, and empowering agents within contact centers.Since improving the contact center agent experience has a direct impact not just on CX scores, but business profitability and growth, it’s worth examining the various ways generative AI tools can enhance agent workflows.Here are 10 ways generative AI will change agent experiences in contact centers.1. Eliminating Repetitive TasksFor years, AI and automation have proven to be valuable tools for minimizing the mundane and repetitive tasks that consume employees’ time. Generative AI has the potential to handle even more tasks on behalf of omnichannel contact center agents, from summarizing calls, to transcribing and translating conversations.With fewer repetitive tasks to focus on throughout their workday, agents have more time to handle complex inquiries, and ensure they are delivering a personalized experience.2. Enhancing Data AnalysisGenerative AI tools excel at data analysis, using pre-built algorithms to sort through and understand data. The right tools can sort through huge volumes of data, surfacing valuable insights into customer journeys, purchasing decisions and even ways to improve employee performance.Intelligent AI tools can even be used to automate the process of collecting data. For example, AI chatbots can ask customers questions and extract contextual insights before transferring a conversation to an agent. They can automatically send surveys to customers via voice, IM, and email too. This allows companies to keep their finger on the pulse of CSAT (customer satisfaction) scores, and customer sentiment.3. Transforming Customer RoutingConnecting customers to the right agent quickly isn’t just important for improving customer experiences. It’s also essential to ensure agents don’t have to waste time navigating calls and transferring them to the right agent.Generative AI solutions built into an IVR system can collect valuable customer information and use that data to assign calls to agents based on skill sets, availability, and customer preferences. Some AI solutions can even address customer issues immediately, reducing call queues.4. Reducing Contact VolumesAround 90% of global customers expect companies to have self-service options in place so they don’t always have to wait for a live agent. Generative AI tools allow companies to build intelligent bots that are equipped to address a range of customer needs.Not only does this mean that customers can receive answers to their queries faster, but it also reduces the number of customers agents need to assist. This reduces the strain on your workforce and allows agents to spend more time delivering personalized assistance to customers.5. Improving Hiring and OnboardingRapid turnover is all too common in the contact center space. To ensure agents remain productive, companies need an effective way to quickly recruit new employees. Generative AI can help with this in a number of ways, such as helping to create job descriptions for new hires.AI can also assist in improving the onboarding journey for new hires.AI bots can deliver valuable onboarding information and training to new team members, reducing the strain on supervisors. With step-by-step guidance, and the ability to answer questions in real time, the AI bots have the potential to rapidly accelerate new hire training and onboarding.



6. Supporting Agents During CallsEven after the onboarding experience, generative AI bots can provide valuable support to agents throughout their workday. These bots can be equipped with knowledge from your business database and CRM, allowing them to present relevant articles and guidance to agents when they need it most.Generative AI bots can offer step-by-step coaching to employees, responding to changes in customer sentiment or intent. They can also handle things like instantly collecting and transcribing calls, so agents can focus exclusively on the customer conversation.7. Enhancing Employee TrainingEmployee training and development has always been important in the success of a contact center. Regularly supporting your workforce with the right education helps to keep them engaged and ensures they can cultivate the skills they need to thrive. Generative AI can once again help in this area.Generative AI can help supervisors determine where employees need extra help handling and managing calls and create training resources to ensure agents have the expertise to address a customer’s problem. Plus, they can auto-score agents as part of the agent performance management strategies, offering insights to supervisors on where agents may need more training and support.8. Streamlining the Search for InformationTracking down information in real time is often essential to contact center employees, whether they’re dealing with administrative tasks or connecting with a customer. Unfortunately, workers spend around 3 hours a day (on average) simply searching for the right information.Generative AI tools can make it easier for team members to find the information they need. All they need to do is enter a simple prompt into a chatbot and the system will do the rest, such as surfacing FAQs, reports, documents, and articles. They can even help agents personalize experiences with behind-the-scenes insights into customer purchase histories and preferences.9. Simplifying Content CreationGenerative AI models like ChatGPT have already proven their ability to quickly generate content in a natural human language at scale. In the contact center, a generative AI chatbot can be used to suggest rapid responses to messages across different channels like social media, email, and SMS.The same solution can analyze previous interactions with customers and suggest follow-up messages to improve customer relationships. With access to business information and CRM data, these tools can personalize content to suit your audience, and even adapt to your brand’s tone of voice.10. Transforming Productivity and EfficiencyPerhaps the biggest impact Generative AI will have on agents in the contact center involves enhancing their productivity and efficiency levels. AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, reduce call queues, and simplify processes like analyzing data or transcribing calls.They can also transform workflows in other ways. Generative AI tools can offer supervisors suggestions on how to schedule teams and make the most of their internal resources. They can instantly pull action items from conversations and meetings, helping teams to get more done in a shorter amount of time. They can even assist organizations in designing workflows that empower their teams.The Power of Generative AI for Contact CentersGenerative AI is becoming one of the most powerful tools for the contact center. It not only improves customer experience, but also has the ability to enhance agent experiences. Companies can use these tools to automate repetitive tasks, empower agents with the right training, and even simplify content creation.Bernie Lee, VP of Product Engineering at ComputerTalk, adds:“With agent assist, contact insights and other capabilities enabled by generative AI, ComputerTalk is committed to delivering AI features that help boost agent performance and equip managers with actionable analytics.”Learn more about ComputerTalk’s AI-enabled ice Contact Center platform.

Maybe it’s time to consider delegating basic tasks to the much-talked about and ever-expanding technology powered by artificial intelligence. For those living under a rock, artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability to use machine learning and specific inputs to perform human-like tasks. Here are some everyday examples of how Creators are using machine learning to make their job easier:
Creator Morgan Shaw of Gold Shaw Farm is among many Creators using AI tools to streamline creative ... [+] workflow.Morgan Shaw

1. Repurposing VideoCreator Devin Lytle puts AI to work cutting down her longer form library content.Paola Trusendi
Seasoned Creators have built a back catalog of video content which provides untapped opportunity to exploit their archives through syndication and licensing. Rather than front the cost of an editor or give up revenue share to a third-party partner, some Creators like Mai Pham (3.27 million Subscribers on YouTube) and Devin Lytle (186,000 Subscribers on YouTube) are testing platforms like Opus and Munch AI. Lytle uses Munch AI to automate the cutdown of longer form YouTube videos to repurpose as short form TikToks. “It gets me about 75% of the way there. The tool will slice the long video for me and put together the most interesting parts,” says Lytle who is best known for Buzzfeed’s LadyLike and now also works behind-the-scenes as a creative producer and director. “I just go in and tweak what Munch edits to make it my own.” More traditional editing tools like Premier Pro have released AI features including Adobe
ADBE
-1.2% Sensei to streamline workflow in the video post-production process.

2. Dubbing
YouTube Creators have always been able to reach a global audience. However, it’s previously been too time consuming and expensive to dub videos in local languages which was a big missed opportunity for Creators to customize their content based on who they know is watching. AI tools like DeepTune and Vidby help solve that issue. Vidby charges a subscription fee based on the number of hours of video and level of features. One premium feature called “voice cloning” delivers a sound-alike voice of the Creator mimicking their original tone. In his weekly Night Light newsletter, Night Media CEO and founder Reed Duchscher who reps Jimmy Donaldson (aka Mr. Beast) says “[from] what I’ve heard so far, until AI can actually recognize emotion better and dub in a decent way, I think that multi-language is going to take a backseat for the majority if not 99% of creators.” Like most AI tools, the machine learning is constantly expanding knowledge base and releasing better quality results over time.

3. Music
Music plays an important part of any new video – but it’s often expensive and impossible to access well-known music for commercial use on social media. Third-party audio libraries like Epidemic Sound, JinglePunks and Audio Network helped solve this hurdle for Creators but now it may get even easier to discover the perfect sound for your creative vision. YouTuber Robbi Jan who has almost 600,000 Subscribers on the platform has been testing the waters with YouTube’s Dream Track for Shorts feature. Announced last November, Dream Track allows YouTubers to source music using text prompts. The program includes music from top recording artists like Charlie Puth and T-Pain. YouTube has made it clear this is an early test but the potential is promising for Creators on the platform.

Editing photos and creating original graphics has never been easier with machine learning interpreting a Creator's text prompts with tools like Canva’s Magic Design and Beautiful.ai. Creators use Magic
MAGIC
-5.3% Design to create Instagram Story templates to promote their new video content. Up-and-coming Creators also turn to Beautiful.ai and Canva to design electronic press kits (EPKs) to promote themselves to brands and partners. Creator Morgan Gold of Gold Shaw Farm (over 850,000 Subscribers on YouTube) has gotten creative using D-iD to animate static stock imagery to appear as if they’re talking. While Mai Pham and her creative director Kayli Sandoval has utilized Adobe Photoshop’s Generative Fill to edit photos by filling in empty space with a cohesive look and feel.

5. Product Placement
One of the most intriguing new AI offerings for Creators offers a fresh source of revenue. This technology enables the insertion of branded products into a video after a final cut has been delivered. Enhanced in-scene advertising company Rembrand is working with top talent like Lauren Riihimaki (aka LaurDIY), Miki Rai, and Lavendaire. “Virtual product placement is a new revenue opportunity that is still in its very early stage,” says Brittany Maxwell, a talent manager at industry leader Select Management Group. “We’re excited to see how AI evolves to create efficiencies and provide new revenue streams for our Creators.

This is not a conclusive list. Just examples of how Creators are actually using AI to date. Some Creators and their teams admit they haven’t figured out how best to use the new technology. This is likely the year Creators will double down on putting artificial intelligence to work in supporting and growing their existing business. There’s an AI-powered tool for just about everything at this point including contractable.ai for legal templates and even Bena.Social for your very own virtual agent to negotiate brand endorsements on your behalf. Lest we forget, the onslaught of AI-generated virtual Creators like Kuki who’s worked with H&M and the original Creator bot Lil Miquela who has partnered with PacSun, Calvin Klein and more.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Towards the end of 2023, for example, global searches for “Is my job safe?” doubled.Recent World Economic Forum research found that LLMs will impact job tasks rather than jobs as a whole, and could augment many roles, offering the potential for job growth. Even so, over 40% of working hours could ultimately be transformed – so businesses will need to move quickly to navigate these changes in the way that is best for both their organizations and their employees.Here are three areas leaders need to consider as they do so, outlined in Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs – A Business Toolkit, a white paper written by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with Accenture.A business strategy matrix for effectively leading the workforce transition through the large-scale deployment of LLMs. Image: Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs – A Business Toolkit1. Job change and job displacement riskJob tasks with the highest potential for automation by LLMs are those that use language in a routine and repetitive manner – and roles emphasizing these types of tasks could see a decline. At the same time, LLMs could augment many jobs, assisting with those that rely on abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.Organizations should respond by supporting workers through any disruption, the report says. Using predictive analytics to forecast the jobs most likely to be affected by LLMs will empower employees with the knowledge to make better decisions as they look to reskill or move to a new role. This will increase trust and wellbeing, as well as performance and business accountability.Alongside, creating an internal job marketplace that helps employees understand available opportunities and transition into new roles will provide workers with growth opportunities and firms with a tool to address talent shortages.All of this should be underpinned by a culture that values and rewards flexibility in job roles. Encouraging employees to embrace diverse work experiences and develop skills useful across different roles will increase workforce agility – and could reduce anxiety around job displacement.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology? Show moreThe Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2023 report outlined the technologies poised to positively impact society in the next few years, from health technology to AI to sustainable computing. The World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is driving responsible technology governance, enabling industry transformation, addressing planetary health, and promoting equity and inclusion.Learn more about our impact: Digital inclusion: Our EDISON Alliance is mobilizing leaders from across sectors to accelerate digital inclusion, having positively impacted the lives of 454 million people through the activation of 250 initiatives across 90 countries.AI in developing economies: Our Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Rwanda is promoting the adoption of new technologies in the country, enabling over 4,000 daily health consultations using AI.Innovative healthcare: Our Medicine from the Sky initiative is using drones to deliver medicine to remote areas in India, completing over 950 successful drone flights.AI for agriculture: We are working with the Government of India to scale up agricultural technology in the country, helping more than 7,000 farmers monitor the health of their crops and soil using AI.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesWant to know more about our centre’s impact or get involved?

The Forum report highlights that emerging data shows LLMs in fact have potential to improve job quality by making room for more creativity, problem solving and independent decision-making.Ensuring this happens will rely on organizations including workers in the governance of LLMs, involving diverse teams in their development, and promoting awareness around the benefits of new tools.For example, LLMs have the greatest impact when developed and used by teams with a diverse mix of skills and perspectives, helping to reduce bias and implement required operational changes – 92% of companies that scale AI effectively use cross-platform, multidisciplinary teams.Transparent and inclusive governance is also key to effective deployments and building trust. This can be achieved through the creation of frameworks that explain how LLM design and use should be guided by participative decisions, employee feedback and ongoing assessment and refinement.3. Skilling and learningBusiness leaders estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted in the next five years, according to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023. As such, training will need to focus on the skills predicted to grow the most – including analytical skills, creative thinking, technology literacy and lifelong learning.Businesses can address this by increasing LLM fluency among their workforces with courses that explain the technology’s opportunities and limitations. This will help employees understand how their jobs will evolve, how they can use AI, and its benefits to the organization.Work-based learning opportunities, such as apprenticeships and temporary assignments, are an effective way of keeping employees’ skills current and creating a culture of lifelong learning, the report says.Alongside these literacy and skilling programmes, which will help build confidence in LLMs and encourage their use, businesses should develop a skills-first approach to upskilling and hiring. This involves ensuring a person has the right competencies – rather than the right degree or previous job title – for a particular role. And it can have a big impact – some studies have shown that companies hiring based on skills are 36% less likely to face talent and skills shortages.The potential of LLMs in the workplace is huge, and considerations such as those outlined in the Forum’s toolkit will help guide business leaders to take advantage of the technology in a way that benefits the organization, employees and society.Have you read?Artificial intelligence will transform decision-making.

Source: Getty.January 11, 2024ShareSave Subscribe to Listen00:0012:30Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.Earlier this week, the Telegraph reported a curious admission from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. In a filing submitted to the U.K. Parliament, the company said that “leading AI models” could not exist without unfettered access to copyrighted books and articles, confirming that the generative-AI industry, worth tens of billions of dollars, depends on creative work owned by other people.We already know, for example, that pirated-book libraries have been used to train the generative-AI products of companies such as Meta and Bloomberg. But AI companies have long claimed that generative AI “reads” or “learns from” these books and articles, as a human would, rather than copying them. Therefore, this approach supposedly constitutes “fair use,” with no compensation owed to authors or publishers. Since courts have not ruled on this question, the tech industry has made a colossal gamble developing products in this way. And the odds may be turning against them.Read: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and techTwo lawsuits, filed by the Universal Music Group and The New York Times in October and December, respectively, make use of the fact that large language models—the technology underpinning ChatGPT and other generative-AI tools—can “memorize” some portion of their training text and reproduce it verbatim when prompted in specific ways, emitting long sections of copyrighted texts. This damages the fair-use argument.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story. Start your subscription.Uncompromising quality. Enduring impact.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Toronto-based artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical startup BenchSci has reduced its headcount as the startup looks to adapt to the impact of generative AI in the field of drug discovery.
BenchSci announced the layoffs in a LinkedIn post on Monday, but did not disclose how many staff were let go as part of these layoffs, nor did it share what percentage of the company’s total workforce these layoffs represent. 

“We believe that generative AI will continue to reshape preclinical [R&D] and have a substantial positive impact on our customers.”

A BenchSci spokesperson has since confirmed to BetaKit that the startup laid off 70 team members, marking a 17 percent reduction in headcount.
In its LinkedIn post, BenchSci cited several reasons behind its workforce reduction, including “shifts in the economic environment, operational efficiencies, and adaptation to technological advancements,” specifically citing generative AI.
“We believe that generative AI will continue to reshape preclinical [research and development] and have a substantial positive impact on our customers,” BenchSci said in its LinkedIn post. “As we look towards our future, these changes will allow us to further our investment in generative AI and work toward making drug discovery more efficient and help bring new medicine to patients faster.”

“As we continue our work to revolutionize preclinical drug discovery, this decision stems from shifts in our longer-term strategic direction and what we know will have the greatest impact on our customers—which includes furthering our investment in generative AI,” BenchSci co-founder and CEO Liran Belenzon said in a statement sent to BetaKit. “Parting ways with team members is extremely difficult, and we are committed to supporting them through this transition.”
The layoffs come roughly six months after BenchSci closed $95 million in Series D funding to expand its AI-powered drug-discovery platform. Using text and image-based machine learning models, BenchSci claims its software allows scientists to accelerate the pace and increase the success of research during the preclinical drug-development process.
BenchSci is not the only Canadian AI and biomedical startup to have reduced its headcount in recent months. In late November, Vancouver-based AbCellera laid off 63 employees, or 10 percent of its workforce. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the layoffs would help it “focus its efforts toward the clinical development of new antibody medicines for patients.”
At the time of BenchSci’s Series D fundraise, Belenzon told BetaKit that in the 15 months between its $63-million Series C financing round and its Series D round, the startup had tripled its revenue and doubled its team size from 200 to 400.
UPDATE (01/08/2024): This story was updated with commentary from BenchSci’s CEO, as well as information regarding how many team members were let go.

Viral Lists Reveal Artists Whose Work May Have Trained an A.I. Art Generator
Thousands of painters, cartoonists, sculptors and other creatives are featured in the documents, which reinvigorated debates around copyright infringement and consent

                Lists are circulating online that contain the names of artists whose work was allegedly used to train an A.I. image generation tool without their permission.

Artists are accusing the developers of an artificial intelligence art generator of ripping off their work after a list containing the names of thousands of creatives recently began circulating online.
They claim the list confirms what they had long suspected: that Midjourney—the company behind a popular text-to-image generative A.I. technology—used their artwork without their permission to train its art generator.
Powered By                         10 Sec      The Great Diving Beetle Is an Impressive Underwater Hunter         NextStay5    


The list in question contains the names of 4,700 individuals. The artist Jon Lam shared it online in late December, but it was initially included in a court exhibit in November as part of a lawsuit against Midjourney and several other generative A.I. companies.
A larger spreadsheet titled “Midjourney Style List” is also circulating online. The spreadsheet reportedly contains the names of some 16,000 “proposed additions.” (Though its owners have made it inaccessible, a version of the sheet still exists on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.)
David Holz, Midjourney’s founder, purportedly shared the list on Discord in 2022, reports NBC News’ Angela Yang. 
The lists feature painters, cartoonists, filmmakers, animators, sculptors and many other types of creatives, both living and dead. They include famous figures such as Tim Burton, Pablo Picasso, Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney and Banksy.
Many lesser-known artists also made it onto the lists, including a 6-year-old, reports ARTnews’ Karen K. Ho.
Together, the lists have reinvigorated the debate around whether A.I. should be allowed to imitate the work of real-life artists—and, perhaps more importantly, make money off those imitations. Legal and ethical questions about copyright infringement and consent continue to swirl, with artists calling for greater regulation of A.I. art generators and related technologies. Some creatives are asking lawmakers—and the courts—to help settle the issue.
Tools like Midjourney use machine learning models to study vast amounts of data, including online images of artwork and stills from movies and video games. Then, when a user inputs a prompt, like “Paint the Faroe Islands in the style of Vincent van Gogh,” the A.I. uses its training to produce an image that matches the request. Artists argue that the A.I. platforms are spitting out replicas of their existing work—much of which is copyrighted—rather than using it as inspiration to create something new.
In a 2022 interview with Forbes’ Rob Salkowitz, Holz acknowledged that the company did not seek consent from living artists to use their work while training Midjourney’s generative A.I. technology. The company also did not get permission to use copyrighted work, he told the publication.
“There’s no way to find a picture on the internet and then automatically trace it to an owner and then have any way of doing anything to authenticate it,” Holz said.
When asked if artists could opt out of having their work included in the training data, Holz responded that the company was “looking at that.”
Some artists are taking matters into their own hands. For example, researchers at the University of Chicago have created programs that make images difficult for A.I. tools to scrape.
In the meantime, as the legal landscape evolves, “documents like the ‘Midjourney Style List’ [can help] shed light on the actual processes of converting copyrighted artwork into A.I. reference material,” writes the Art Newspaper’s Theo Belci.

A.I. ‘Completes’ Keith Haring’s Intentionally Unfinished Painting
Critics say the image is disrespectful of the original work, which the artist made as a commentary on the AIDS epidemic

The year before he died of AIDS-related complications, the artist Keith Haring created a unique work known only as Unfinished Painting (1989). In its upper-left quadrant, black and white lines form stylized patterns on a purple background. Streaks of purple paint trickle down onto the otherwise empty lower-left quadrant; the right half of the canvas is also blank. Haring intentionally left the work unfinished as a commentary on the AIDS crisis.
Now, a newly “completed” version of the work—made with the help of artificial intelligence—is generating controversy: A social media user employed an A.I. image generator to expand Haring’s designs across the blank sections of the canvas, ultimately posting the altered image on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“The story behind this painting is so sad!” writes the user, who goes by Donnel. “Now using A.I. we can complete what he couldn’t finish!” 
The image was met with intense backlash.
“It’s very disrespectful to not only anyone who was around during the AIDS epidemic, but particularly those who died from it or who lost friends and loved ones during it,” Tina Tallon, a researcher of A.I. and the arts at the University of Florida, tells NBC News’ Kalhan Rosenblatt.
Born in 1958, Haring rose to fame through the graffiti art he drew inside the New York subways. In the early ’80s, “Haring produced hundreds of these public drawings in rapid rhythmic lines, sometimes creating as many as 40 ‘subway drawings’ in one day,” according to the Keith Haring Foundation. “This seamless flow of images became familiar to New York commuters.” He began exhibiting his art in cities around the world.
While Haring is perhaps best known for his colorful, playful designs, he also used his art to help raise awareness of the AIDS crisis. In 1988, he was diagnosed with the disease, which he died from in 1990, when he was 31.
“I find the ‘completed’ version of the artwork to be abhorrent,” artist Brooke Peachley, whose post honoring Haring’s work prompted Donnel’s, tells Hyperallergic’s Elaine Velie and Rhea Nayyar, using a pseudonym for her last name. “Not only does ‘completing’ the painting completely negate it of its original meaning, but spits on the tens of thousands of queer individuals who lost their lives to the AIDS epidemic in the ’80s and ’90s.”
She adds: “To do so using generative A.I., a computer program that cannot feel the weight of what it is doing nor create with any sort of human intention, only adds to the disrespect.”

What’s more, the A.I.-generated image doesn’t appear to be faithful to Haring’s style, which often included images of human figures. These kinds of figures are visible in Haring’s original piece, but the image generator wasn’t able to replicate them.
“The once deeply intentional curves and shapes eerily lose their form as the program moves farther and farther away from the original source,” Peachley tells Hyperallergic.
Ever since A.I. image generators became publicly available, their role in the art world has been a matter of debate. Many artists worry that these models are trained on copyrighted works by living artists—who didn’t consent for their art to be used in this manner. Just last month, a list of thousands of artists allegedly used to train Midjourney started circulating, intensifying concerns about how A.I. art interacts with copyright law.
“Right now, we don’t really have structures or frameworks for engaging with A.I.,” Tallon tells NBC News. “Or engaging with generative AI in a way that I think fully respects artists and the agency of artists and their agency over their own creative work, whether living or dead.”

Image: WacomPopular drawing tablet manufacturer Wacom is the latest target being slammed by the digital art community after appearing to use AI-generated images in ads. Over the weekend, creatives across X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok noticed that Wacom was promoting its Intuos pen tablet with a dragon illustration that showed telltale marks of AI-generated images — such as questionable scale designs and fur blending unnaturally into other sections of the image.Wacom deleted the images without explanation, fueling speculation that an industry-standard brand for artists was using tools widely criticized for replacing them. And it wasn’t the only AI controversy this weekend. Wizards of the Coast (WotC), the publisher behind Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, also issued an apology on Sunday for using an ad with AI-generated elements. The controversies have escalated mistrust around an already complicated question: how can creatives, and the companies that work with them, navigate a flood of images that are easy to create and hard to conclusively detect?Many artists have already rallied against companies using generative AI. They fear it could impact job security across a wide range of creative professions like graphic design, illustration, animation, and voice acting. But there’s a particular sense of betrayal around brands like Wacom, whose main audience is artists. The company has long been considered the industry standard supplier for drawing tablets, thanks to the success of products like its professional Cintiq lineup. At the same time, it’s facing more competition than ever from rival brands like XPPen and Xencelabs.Wacom initially didn’t respond to artists’ complaint. Several days later, and after this article was published, the company issued a contrite statement saying that the images in question had been purchased from a third-party vendor and had evaded being flagged by the online AI detection tools it used for vetting.“We want to assure you that using Al generated images in these assets was not our intent,” Wacom wrote. The company said it is now unsure whether AI was used in their creation. “For this reason, we immediately discontinued their use.”WotC’s issues are more straightforward — but in some ways, they point to a tougher problem. The company announced in August that it would prohibit AI-generated imagery in its products after confirming AI was used to create some artwork for the Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants D&D sourcebook. In December, WotC also refuted claims that AI-generated imagery was included in the upcoming 2024 Players Handbook for D&D.Despite this, the company shared a new marketing campaign for its Magic: The Gathering card game on January 4th that was quickly scrutinized for containing strangely deformed elements commonly associated with AI-generated imagery. The company initially denied AI was involved, insisting that the image was made by a human artist, only to back down three days later and acknowledge that it did in fact contain AI-generated components. In an apology that followed, WotC implied the issue was tied to the increasing prevalence of generative AI integrations within widely used creative software like Adobe Photoshop’s generative fill feature.“We can’t promise to be perfect in such a fast-evolving space, especially with generative AI becoming standard in tools such as Photoshop,” said WotC in its online statement. “But our aim is to always come down on the side of human made art and artists.”WotC says it’s examining how it’ll work with vendors to better detect unauthorized AI usage within any marketing materials they submit — but that’s easier said than done these days. There are currently no truly reliable means to check if a given image was generated using AI. AI detectors are notoriously unreliable and regularly flag false positives, and other methods like the Content Credentials metadata backed by Adobe can only provide information for images created using specific software or platforms.Even defining AI-generated content is getting harder. Tools like Firefly, the AI model integrated into Photoshop and Illustrator, allow users to make prompt-driven alterations on individual layers. Some creative professionals argue these are simply tools that artists can benefit from, but others believe any generative AI features are exploitive because they’re often trained on masses of content collected without creators’ knowledge or consent. Adobe has assured users that Firefly-powered AI tools are only trained on content that Adobe owns, but that doesn’t mean they’re passing everyone’s ethical sniff test.The situation has left bystanders visually checking projects for telltale signs of inhuman origin and organizations trusting artists to not lie about how their content was made. Neither option is exactly infallible.That uncertainty has driven a wedge of paranoia and anxiety throughout the online creative community as artists desperately attempt to avoid contributing to — or being exploited by — the growing AI infestation. The rapid deployment of generative AI technology has made it incredibly difficult to avoid. The inability to trust artists or brands to disclose how their content is produced has also sparked AI “witch hunts” led by creatives. The goal is to hold companies accountable for using the technology instead of paying designers, but in some cases, accusations are entirely speculative and actually harm human artists.Even when companies insist that AI hasn’t been involved, creatives are understandably skeptical. A poster for Marvel’s Loki TV series on Disney Plus was also criticized last year after some creatives claimed it contained AI-generated stock assets from Shutterstock. Following its own investigation, Shutterstock said that the stock image was human-made, and that a “software tool” had instead been used to create the “subtle creative imperfections most often associated with AI generated art.” Shutterstock declined, however, to share what the software tool in question was.The headache of trying to avoid generative AI entirely — including by unknowingly promoting it or having online portfolios scraped to train it — has proved too much for some creatives. Artists have credited it as a reason for leaving the industry or contemplating abandoning their studies. At least one art competition, the annual Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO) cover contest, was shut down entirely after last year’s winner admitted under duress to using banned AI tools.But even creatives who don’t expect to stop generative AI’s development want something more substantive from companies than “trust me bro,” especially when those companies rely on their patronage. Artists value honesty and accountability over stonewalling and evasiveness about whether AI tools are being used.Wacom and WotC eventually provided similar responses to their respective situations: that the offending images had come from a third-party vendor, that the companies were unaware that AI had been used to make them, and that they promised to do better in the future. That hasn’t reassured some artists, however, who questioned how apparent hallucinations within the images had gone undetected, and why these creative companies weren’t hiring artists directly.Both cases suggest that anti-AI pressure campaigns will remain an ongoing force in the creative world. Generative AI might not be going anywhere — but for many companies, using it has turned into a PR nightmare.Update January 9th, 5:11PM ET: Added Wacom’s response to accusations that it used AI generated images.Comments72 Comments / 72 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung’s new folds, flips, and Apple clones | The Vergecast

(PATH) Stock9 Comments21 LikesBert Hochfeld22.45K FollowersFollowSummaryUiPath is the leading vendor, by far, in the Robotic Process Automation space.Last quarter's results were exceptionally strong and seemingly marked a breakout in terms of net new ARR.The space itself is bucking macro headwinds and is enjoying strong adoption, with 3rd party analysts forecasting a CAGR for the next several years in the mid-high 30% range.Process automation coupled with generative AI simply works much better in terms of deploying solutions than Generative AI on its own.The company's competitive position is perhaps as dominant as any other vendor in any other space within the IT market.    Shutthiphong ChandaengWhat do bots say about Path’s consistent growth? As many have observed, the last two years in the market have been a period in which stocks fell consistently for months, and then rose quite sharply, albeit not in a straight line. Depending on what ETF a reader might look at, the change over 2 years has been small, with the QQQ and the IGV ETFs up about 10% due to the weighting of the magnificent seven, while the Wisdom Tree Cloud ETF (WCLD) is still down more than 30% from its level at the start of 2022. The SPDR ETF is almost exactly unchanged over the same span. There are plenty of bold individuals who make guesses as to what is next-in politics, style and of course the market. Sometimes the guesses are right; often time’s forecasts go seriously awry. This is not an article trying to call the market for 2024. It is an article updating my last article regarding UiPath that was published on SA in April 2023. The shares have risen more than 35% since then, quite a bit more than the market as a while, mainly in the wake of what might be considered to have been a break-out quarter. That said, like the shares of many other high growth IT, the shares remain almost 40% below their levels of 2 years ago. Have Path shares run too fast and too far? The temptation is there to believe that thesis. Many observers have written much about the extraordinary rally of the last two months. I have no specific idea if the rally continues or consolidates. For the most part, the rally was based on waning inflation and lower interest rates. Currently there is a debate between those who believe that there will be 6 rate cuts, i.e. rates going from about 5% to 3.5% this year, and those who think the terminal rate will be 4.25%. In turn that evolution will be primarily decided on how the overall economy grows and how employment metrics progress. I don’t have that kind of crystal ball; for the record my favorite economist, Ian Shepherdson, who runs Pantheon Macroeconomics, is forecasting a greater than anticipated rise in unemployment and consequently more rather than fewer rate cuts. His track record on such calls, while not perfect, is better than that of most other economists. Just based on the velocity of the rally in last weeks of 2023, I would guess PATH shares, along with most else high-growth IT, will consolidate for a time until there is some additional validation of the soft landing thesis or more likely the thesis of Mr. Shepherdson. I don’t really expect some short-term out-performance from high growth IT shares, and that includes UiPath (NYSE:PATH) shares. Some technical analysis suggest there will be a short term sell-off in the shares of the magnificent 7: if that happens, PATH shares will go along. As it happens, some of the consolidation that I have expected has finally arrived with the New Year. Path shares have fallen by 11.5% in just the last 3 trading sessions, and have perhaps provided investors with a better opportunity to enter a position. But I am certainly not trying to forecast any macro headlines which will have a significant impact on the share price of PATH over the next few weeks. But this is an article about the operational performance and the valuation of PATH over the next 12 months. This is not a trading call, or an attempt to forecast how markets, and UiPath shares might trade in the next couple of weeks. If you want that, consult your local necromancer. Part of the valuation of UiPath shares will be determined by how the market plays out in 2024 and exactly how the market for high growth IT shares will evolve as the year progresses. It would be naïve to imagine that Path shares can achieve significant appreciation without at least a benign market environment for high growth IT shares. That said, UI Path will chart its own course with regards to its growth which I expect to exceed current consensus forecasts for reasons outlined in this article. Just as last quarter was a breakout period for PATH, I expect that many of the positive trends seen then to reprised in the quarter next to be reported (est. reporting date will be 3/15/24). But the question really is can Path continue to achieve accelerating revenue growth and maintain strong improvements in profitability even if the economy starts to decelerate. This article explores that in depth with a conclusion that the likelihood is that growth expectations will increase throughout the year. Based on that expectation, this is article reaffirming my prior purchase recommendation for Path shares at this time and at this price. Last quarter, Path’s revenue growth and the year on year growth of the ARR balance reached 24%. Net new ARR grew by 15% sequentially. The company’s free cash flow margin was about 13%. The company increased its expected year end ARR noticeably, and also increased its forecast for non-GAAP operating income. That said, the 1st Call consensus for 2024 revenue growth is below 20%, implying a growth slowdown from the levels expected for this current quarter. The company’s backlog (RPO balance) grew nearly 30% which self-evidently is a contradictory indicator with regards to Path’s actual growth momentum. In some ways, the most encouraging part of Path’s performance was the sequential growth in ARR additions. It is, to be sure, a second order number, but I often look at it as an indication of the changes in health in terms of go-to-market efficiency. When asked about Q4 guidance which calls for revenue growth of 24%, the CFO indicated explicitly that the forecast was based on putting adequate prudence and macro-economic concerns into the projection. The company’s forecast also was said to reflect macro headwinds at the lower end of the company’s market; the company’s go to market focus remains on acquiring larger customers with a higher propensity to grow. This focus was partly responsible for a constant currency, dollar based net expansion rate of 123% in the quarter.    Ashim Gupta Yes, I would just say, Mark, we're really pleased with our performance and the team's execution. We are focused on closing out a good year-end here. And the teams are really focused on that. And we look at our fourth quarter guidance just putting the right prudence and the right macroeconomic variability included in our guidance, and we'll update as we get closer to next year.  In this very uncertain environment, the company has taken an appropriately conservative path with regards to guidance; if the macro environment improves for enterprise IT spend as the most recent surveys have been suggesting, then current guidance and expectations are likely to see noticeable upward revisions. Some analysts on SA who have downgraded their rating of the shares have done so without considering the messaging here, which is not to be too literal in using the guided numbers as the most likely forecast. Just for the record, the company is now forecasting Q4 revenues of $383 million; that compares to a prior revenue forecast of $380 million. Ending ARR is now forecast to be $1.455 billion; the prior forecast for ending ARR was $1.435 billion. For a company like this, ARR and ARR growth are the most important metrics to consider in evaluating sales growth. The company increased its forecast for Q4 non-GAAP operating income to $78 million; the prior forecast for that metric had been $63 million. Recently, 3rd party surveys for IT spending growth have begun to tick upwards. While surveys aren’t always accurate, there seems to be a theme that last year’s anemic revenue growth for the space represented an aberration in IT spending growth. I am inclined to agree with that theme. The most recent surveys also point to a growth acceleration in the process automation space specifically, the space in which PATH enjoys a market leading position. When it comes to Path, in particular, it has been able to develop products that users view as an important component of an AI strategy. I will discuss the product strategy in greater detail below, but the concept that automation using bots + AI are better together seems to be resonating with large enterprises. Why PATH’s growth is showing signs of acceleration UiPath is the leading company in what is called the Robotic Process Automation space. This technology makes it easy for developers to build, deploy and manage software robots (most usually abbreviated as bots). The bots can be taught to emulate human actions such as understanding what is on a screen, completing the right keystrokes and perform a wide range of defined actions-basically repetitive tasks, and to do so far faster and more accurately than the comparable human actions can achieve. I have linked to a white paper by PATH’s marketing function that does a deeper dive into what RPA is all about. It is hardly any secret that users want to invest, and invest heavily in generative AI solutions. That investment will be a rising tide for many boats-and so far as it goes, many investors. But perhaps, not all boats. Initially, when the AI craze struck market participants with full force last spring, one issue that arose for PATH-or at least PATH shares, was whether the deployment of generative AI would mean less need for the process automation bots that are the heart of what this company sells. The underpinning of that thesis is linked here Despite the provocative headline, in the context of PATH’s operating performance, the thesis couldn’t be more wrong. In point of fact, AI works better with process automation bots. Indeed, that is why I wrote my last article on PATH shares last spring. A few months ago, PATH introduced a new sales tool, NorthStar, which has apparently has had a significant impact on the company’s sales efficiency. I am not going to try to provide a deep dive into NorthStar; it provides PATH sales people with a road-map to present to users showing them ROI for various steps on their automation journey. The use of NorthStar is an iterative process and is having a more substantial impact on driving the increase in ARR than might be appreciated. In addition, the company’s relatively new partnerships with SAP (SAP) and with Deloitte are starting to produce some significant transactions.    Daniel Dines Well, I think that direction in the market that we are seeing right now, around autonomous agents prove a bit -- our approach that always said that AI plus automation is the thing that drives the biggest outcomes for our customers. Actually, this is what we are seeing a lot of our customers after the initial, a little bit of a pause around how AI is going to help me with my automation, they realize that they need powerful automation platform in order to harvest the power of AI. And going forward on a longer term basis with UiPath are in one of the best positions to build the next generation foundational models that understand processes, tasks, screens and documents, the type of multimodal that is built in, in order to drive automation. So it's -- to me, it's clear that the world is going into that direction. And again, we are really in a very good position to take advantage of it.  (For those unfamiliar with the term, and that most surely includes this writer until I looked it up, an autonomous agent is a system situated within and part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time in pursuit of its own objectives. According to the link above, the deployment of autonomous agents is supposed to be the next AI wave after Chat GPT. There is some uneasiness about this trend, which I confess I share, but which is not a factor in evaluating PATH shares-the only subject at hand). I think the above quote from the founder/co-CEO is really the heart of what is happening. Generative AI + automation simply produces an overall better results for users, and PATH’s selling motion NorthStar is proving that effectively to users. It is one of the key reasons why sales growth as measured by net new ARR is showing strong gains and I anticipate that this is a long lived trend that will provide allow percentage revenue growth to continue to accelerate. Another issue that in the past had been called out as inhibiting sales growth has been the lengthy deployment time for the average bot. While it is only supposed to take a few weeks to create an intelligent bot, getting a bot deployed across a business vertical takes 6-12 months, of course an unacceptable period. The issue has been creating a reasonable knowledge base that allows a specific new chatbot to achieve satisfactory performance. The company recently launched a product called UiPath AutoPilot: essentially all generative AI products simply must have “pilot” of some version of pilot in their names. In any event this pilot, which is in beta, is apparently already seeing some definitive and positive results in terms of shortening the deployment cycle for bots. Already in production and in use at some PATH clients is something called Document Understanding and Communication Mining models as explained here by the co-CEO.    Daniel Dines This is always one of our major product focus on how can we shorten the adoption curve for our customers. And we are already seeing with our autopilot family that is in private preview some really good results with the initial set of few hundreds of customers that are testing the product. So, yes, I would say that this is going to be a significant driver for adoption. And both for advanced developers, where they will get to really increase the productivity to also citizen developers that will get started faster. And also, I would like to mention that training our specialized Document Understanding and Communication Mining models using Gen AI, it has already proven this is actually in production already. And it's been proven to accelerate the deployment quite a bit.  Overall, I believe that the reasons UiPath achieved what might be described as a break-through growth quarter when it last reported are fairly straightforward. Users are getting better results in terms of their automation journeys by using bots and generative AI as part of a unified strategy. PATH solutions are designed to help developers build next generation models that understand processes, tasks, screens and documents as part of an enterprise AI strategy. The company has an effective sales tool called NorthStar that is helping its sales people document a road map and expected ROI. And it is developing tools to speed up the deployment of intelligent bots. I don’t want to suggest that I have some particular crystal ball when it comes to handicapping the company’s growth both for the company soon to be reported and for its 2024 forecast. But I think from a qualitative point of view, what was reported was a break-out quarter whose foundation is based on multiple pillars that should support growth significantly above the current 1st Call consensus revenue growth forecast of less than 20% for this year. UiPath Competition UiPath is the leader in the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) space. 3rd party analysts suggest that RPA has one of the higher CAGRs of any IT space. The study linked here suggests that the market in 2022 had a value of about $4 billion and will have a CAGR of nearly 37% over the next 10 years. That gets the market to a value of $82 billion. I am not sure how realistic a 37% CAGR projection might be. That said, the study is just 90 days old at this point. Like most of these kinds of studies, the devil is in both the details, but particularly in the definitions. In this report, much of the growth being forecast is coming from those autonomous agents about which I commented earlier in this article. Autonomous agents are part of the process of implementing generative AI solutions, so perhaps there is a foundation for the high growth forecast. UiPath, as can be seen in this most recent study by Gartner, dwarfs its competitors with a market share of around 36%. According to Gartner: UiPath is a dominant player owing to its strong performance, global brand recognition, a customer and partner ecosystem of more than 2.5 million members, and its market-influencing narrative about AI-powered automation. The Gartner study contained commentary from Wayne Butterfield, who is the Global Lead for Augmented Intelligence at ISG. Even though this sounds like a commercial, it really isn’t. It is obviously far more authoritative than anything else I am likely to find. Many prominent RPA practitioners and thought leaders will agree with this sentiment. That includes Wayne Butterfield, Global Lead for Augmented Intelligence at ISG, who exclusively shares his perspectives on the market share research below. An Analyst’s Perspective Butterfield believes the suite of complementary capabilities that UiPath couples with its “solid” RPA product drives the vendor’s market leadership. These capabilities widen the scope for automation, “ensuring the ceiling that many end clients hit with RPA alone lifted further,” he suggests. To achieve this, UiPath delved deep into adjacent fields, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Process Mining, opening up many new opportunities for customers. Alongside this, the provider has more than 5,000 partners and resellers globally. Underlining the significance of this ecosystem, Butterfield says: They have a much broader reach than the other RPA vendors, getting into clients that others may have struggled with. Finally, Butterfield notes that UiPath has become the analysts’ preferred RPA provider for the past three or four years. That timespan corresponds with how long the provider has led the RPA space, in terms of market share, as per the Gartner report. I really don’t see that I can add much to what has been said here. RPA is growing rapidly, because it is really part of a holistic AI solution. I think it is the growth in bots that are described as autonomous agents that is leading to this very strong forecast. The analysis linked below contrasts the functionality of Path with the #2 competitor, Automation Anywhere This is how that product is said to compare to UiPath’s RPA suite. Reviewers rated RPA Suite higher than Automation Success Platform in the following categories  Better at service and support Easier to integrate and deploy Better evaluation and contracting  Based on what I have read, PATH is more likely than not to continue to enjoy market dominance for the foreseeable future, and dominating this market should be a lucrative position. Gaining market share as has been the case for UiPath for some time now ought to set the company for years of growth greater than 30% suggesting a continued path to higher percentage growth that is clearly not what the consensus is currently reflecting. The UiPath Business model UiPath’s business model has seen significant improvement over the past several quarters. This is a function of better expense management, some improvement in non-GAAP gross margins, and of course leverage at scale. Last quarter non-GAAP gross margins rose slightly to 87% of revenues compared to 86% in the preceding year. They also rose by 100 bps sequentially. The company has a rather substantial set of new products that are moving into GA; this might produce a minor headwind on short term gross margins. The non-GAAP sales and marketing expense ratio last quarter was 47% compared to 47% in the year earlier quarter. Sequentially, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense rose by 19%. To an extent, this kind of increase was a catchup from the prior quarter during which non-GAAP sales and marketing expense actually declined year on year, an unsustainable cadence. Of more significance was a reclassification of expenses between general and administrative and sales and marketing which is expected to reverse in this current quarter. Over the first 9 months of this current fiscal year, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense fell to 45% of revenue down from 53% of revenues in the comparable year-ago period. Basically, sales and marketing expense declined year on year through the first 6 months of the year and then rose as indicated, partially a function of reclassifying some expense, but also accelerated sales hiring. The company, I believe, is going to attempt to achieve 30%+ revenue growth next year in a difficult software sales environment. To achieve such a goal, the company will need adequate sales capacity in-place and reasonably trained at the start of the fiscal year. The research and development spend ratio was a comparatively modest 16% of revenue last quarter, essentially unchanged from the year earlier period. Non-GAAP research and development spend was essentially flat sequentially while sequential revenues rose by 13.5%. The Non-GAAP general and administrative expense ratio, as mentioned, was severely depressed last quarter due to the classification of some expenses into the sales and marketing category. Reported non-GAAP general and administrative expense was down almost 15% year on year and was 10% of revenues compared to 16% of revenues in the year earlier period. It would be difficult to imagine running a company of this scale on a general and administrative expense ratio of 10% over the long term. Over the first 9 months of the year, reported general and administrative expense was also down by about 16% and it was down by 3% sequentially. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses for the 3rd quarter were 74% of revenue compared to 79.5% of revenue in the prior year. This put non-GAAP operating margins at 13% of revenue compared to 7% in the year earlier period. The company is forecasting that its non-GAAP operating margin will reach 20% of revenue in this current quarter. On the surface, that looks ambitious as it implies a decline in non-GAAP operating expense in the quarter. Presumably most of that will come out of the still very elevated non-GAAP sales and marketing expense ratio. The company has seen some significant seasonality in the past with a quarterly operating margin which was actually 22% in the year earlier period. For the full year, the company CFO has forecast non-GAAP operating margins will be 13.7% compared to 6.1% in the year earlier time frame. The latest published 1st call consensus essentially calls for non-GAAP margins to fall noticeably in FY ‘25; I would suggest that is fairly unlikely. The company is quite focused on spending discipline, and it has achieved spending discipline and the results of the last year are indicative of that discipline. My guess is that the company will wind up continuing to grow non-GAAP operating margins for the year, and that current valuation metrics do not reflect a more likely margin improvement. Of course, the combination of reasonable spending discipline and resurging growth make it much easier for the company to achieve a path to stronger margins-no pun intended. The company continued to generate cash; through 9 months its free cashflow margin was 17%; in the year earlier period the company burned cash. Unlike most other enterprise software companies, the growth in the deferred revenue balance was relatively strong last quarter. The company does use stock based compensation, and stock based compensation expense was 28% of revenues last quarter, down from 36% of revenues in the year earlier period. Stock based comp. actually fell 6% sequentially. I look at actual dilution to factor in the real expense of stock based comp. Outstanding shares rose 3% year on year. I have forecast that 12 month forward outstanding shares will be 588 million, up 3.5% from the outstanding shares in the period most recently reported. Wrapping Up: The case to buy UiPath shares UiPath shares have seen a considerable run in the wake of a particularly strong quarterly earnings report that was well above prior forecasts. Guidance also was increased, although apparently not enough for some observers. The most impressive metric for me was that of the net new ARR metric which rose more than 15% sequentially. Based on the comments by the CFO as well as indications of stronger IT spend growth, I expect that the company is quite likely to exceed its Q4 revenue growth guidance. Overall, the shares are up by more than 50% since their late October, 2023 lows, but down about 11% since their highs at the end of last year. The shares after doubling over the last 12 months, are still down over 40% over the last two years. UiPath remains the leader in robotic process automation, and RPA growth has been accelerating as part of the overall enthusiasm for all things based on generative AI solutions. Generative AI + RPA demonstrably work better together, and some of the generative AI components that UiPath is deploying allow its solutions to be deployed more rapidly, typically a bottleneck for developers. Just how fast can the RPA space grow? The 3rd party analysis linked in this article show a multi-year CAGR for the space in the mid 30% range. And 3rd party analysis also linked in the report show a highly favorable evaluation of the company’s competitive position suggesting further market share gains from an already market leading position. I haven’t chosen to go all-in when forecasting a CAGR for this company-my valuation model is based on growth in the mid-20% range. My projection is that the EV/S for PATH is just greater than 7X and I have also projected a 4 quarter forward free cash flow margin of 17%. Despite the huge run the shares have had-on a relative basis, the shares are still valued below average for the mid-20% growth cohort, an indication of the strength of most high growth IT shares at the end of 2023.  I have commented that the kind of spike that high growth IT enjoyed the last two months of the year is extraordinary. While I believe that the current valuations are not excessive given greater growth, stronger profitability and a trend toward lower interest rates, as well as the base from which the spike started, I doubt that the kind of cadence seen in the last two months of 2023 can continue. And that applies to the short term outlook for PATH shares as well. I think it would be more than a bit surprising if the shares showed significant relative strength until they next report earnings which is likely not to be until mid-March. That said, I think the opportunity for the company and the shares over the next 12 months remains considerable, despite the recent rerating. I think the potential for positive alpha remains significant.This article was written byBert Hochfeld22.45K FollowersFollowBert Hochfeld graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania and received an MBA from Harvard.

Sign in A lot has been said about what Generative AI tools can and cannot do. The bottom line: these tools will have a pivotal role and businesses stand to gain from implementing them. In the interim period, where do leaders stand on this emerging, transformative technology? What are the opportunities and risks? More importantly, what is the roadmap that businesses should follow?To better understand how business and technology leaders are thinking about Generative AI, in March 2023 KPMG surveyed 300 global executives and senior managers at companies of various sizes across industries. (A follow-up survey was conducted in June and highlighted notable differences where relevant.) There is a clear takeaway — making the most of Generative AI will require a delicate balance between speed, thoughtful planning and risk mitigation. The report, based on a survey of global business and technology executives and insights from KPMG advisers in artificial intelligence, technology enablement, strategy and risk management, explores the emerging trends, challenges and patterns of thinking on this transformative technology.expandUnderstand the impact from Generative AIBusiness leaders do understand how transformative Generative AI can be. It is rated as the top emerging technology and all surveyed expect their organizations to be impacted very highly in the next 12 to 18 months.What sets Generative AI apart is its ability to augment human cognition and reasoning directly, creating customer-facing and operational applications. This technology has the potential to revolutionize every task and function, from content creation and user engagement to software development and data analysis. Companies across sectors continue to explore novel use cases.""It's important for business leaders to focus on the future of work and the workforce in their organization,"" according to Todd Lohr, KPMG U.S. Technology Consulting Leader and Partner in Chicago. ""Unlike most technology that has improved or automated tasks and workflows, AI augments human knowledge, it requires a different lens to approach.""Prepare the workforce to adapt and thrive While executives expect Generative AI to have a significant impact on how employees work, they mostly see it as an additional tool for workers to use rather than a job replacement. 73 percent of the executives say they expect Generative AI to increase productivity. At the same time, they also understand the risk of certain roles being automated, especially those in administrative, customer service and creative functions. Even then, human expertise and insight will be crucial for unlocking value and fact checking Generative AI. Therefore, reskilling and training will be key.Develop an AI governance program While the potential benefits of Generative AI are immense, there are also several hurdles along the way. These challenges include security, reliability and having the ability to quantify the value gained.The consequences of failing to address these risks can be catastrophic for organizations. Without proper guardrails like engaging an AI governance program, billions of dollars may be wasted on incorrect tools, unhelpful applications, or use cases that fail. Companies risk alienating customers, damaging their brand reputation and creating legal complications by violating global regulations.Interestingly, business leaders are adapting quickly to addressing risks associated with Generative AI. Their confidence in mitigating risk rose from 30 percent in March 2023 to 77 percent in June 2023. Furthermore, in March, only 3 percent of respondents reported that they had mature responsible AI governance in place. By June, 46 percent said they had implemented it.Ensuring responsible, ethical use of AI systems is something that KPMG believes in. Our Trusted AI statement outlines our strategic approach and framework to designing, building, deploying and using AI systems in a responsible and ethical manner.Follow the roadmap for success with Generative AI From this point, organizations need a roadmap to make the most of this new technology. Here are some ways to get started.Develop a strong foundation: Establish a designated leader for cross-enterprise coordination to champion adoption of the technology and ensure responsible use of Generative AI throughout the organization. Develop clear governance structures, promote accountability and address risks associated with financial, reputational and ethical aspects.Empower talent and elevate Generative AI literacy: Focus on upskilling employees, communicating job shifts and new processes and positioning Generative AI as a tool to augment human capabilities. Ensure continued education, training and a positive culture of responsible adoption across the organization.Have a transformational vision of the future: What is your end goal with Generative AI adoption? The answer should guide everything else you do, from making business moves and acquiring essential skills to purchasing technology and developing new business models. Encourage experimentation and adoption of Generative AI across the workforce.Generative AI makes the future for organizations promising, transformative and challenging all at the same time. The key to success will be in following a roadmap that guides designing, building and deploying ethical Generative AI programs that best serve organizational needs.To learn more, download Generative AI: From buzz to business value.

Some students—like those studying in the University of South Florida’s Muma College of Business Center for Marketing and Sales Innovation Customer Experience and Behavioral AI Lab—are already being exposed to how artificial intelligence can help them in the workforce. The lab uses various technologies to measure brain waves, eye movements and otherwise understand how humans respond to a variety of stimuli. Students then get opportunities to apply these insights across settings, sometimes in partnership with commercial businesses or government agencies.
“Students are learning and applying state-of-the-art skills and participating in research,” says Rob Hammond, center director, “that will make them more employable at graduation.” 
But even beyond such specialized training, nearly three in four students say their institutions should be preparing them for AI in the workplace, at least somewhat. So finds a new flash survey of 1,250 students across 49 four- and two-year colleges from Inside Higher Ed and College Pulse’s Student Voice series.

Here are the survey’s main takeaways.
AI is impacting what students plan to study, especially newer students. 
Asked how much the rise of artificial intelligence has influenced what they’re studying or plan to study in college, 14 percent of students over all say it’s influenced them a lot. An additional 34 percent say it’s influenced them somewhat. 
By year, the Class of 2024 is least influenced in this way, with just 35 percent of students saying AI has affected what they’re studying or plan to study, either a lot or somewhat. The Classes of 2025 and 2026 are incrementally more influenced, while the majority of the Class of 2027 (64 percent) says AI has at least somewhat impacted their academic plans. This difference may make sense in light of the buzz around generative AI within the last year. Two- and four-year college students in the survey report being equally influenced by AI in this area. 











But student major, gender and financial aid status all appear to factor in. By field, just 7 percent of arts and humanities students say AI has influenced what they plan to study, compared to 15 percent of natural sciences students, 17 percent of social sciences students and 22 percent of students identifying as having interdisciplinary majors. By gender, 20 percent of male students say AI has significantly impacted their academic plans, versus 10 percent of women and 4 percent of nonbinary students (there are insufficient responses to show for certain other demographics). And by financial aid status, 60 percent of students with no financial aid say AI is influencing their study plans, either a lot or somewhat, compared to 45 percent of students receiving financial aid. 
Another key difference: 52 percent of continuing-generation students say AI is influencing what they plan to study, either a lot or somewhat, compared to 41 percent of first-generation students. 












AI is impacting students’ career plans. 
Similar to how students say AI is impacting their academic plans, 11 percent of students over all say that the rise of AI has significantly influenced their career plans. An additional 31 percent say it’s influenced their career plans somewhat. 
By year, the Class of 2027 appears most impacted, with 61 percent saying the rise of AI has affected their career plans, either a lot or somewhat (just 31 percent of the Class of 2024 say this, as do 41 percent of the Class of 2025 and 51 percent of the Class of 2026). 
Gender appears to matter, as well, with 52 percent of men in the study saying AI is impacting their career plans, versus 35 percent of women and 35 percent of nonbinary students. 
Yet again, there’s no significant difference between four-year and two-year students’ responses, while relatively more students without financial aid (51 percent) than with (41 percent) say they’re influenced by AI in this respect, either a lot or somewhat. Relatively more continuing-generation students (46 percent) than first-generation students (34 percent) also say AI is at least somewhat impacting their career plans. 

Most students say their institutions should be readying them for AI in the workplace. 
Nearly three in four students say that their colleges or universities should be preparing them for AI in the workplace, either a lot (27 percent) or somewhat (45 percent). Newer students are again more likely than soon-to-graduate students to expect AI preparation, with 81 percent of the Class of 2027 saying their institutions should be preparing them at least somewhat. Yet even 66 percent of the Class of 2024 say this. By major, students in the arts and humanities are a bit less likely to say so (66 percent) than students in the social sciences (78 percent). In the natural sciences, the share is 70 percent, and among interdisciplinary majors, it’s 71 percent. 
By gender, 77 percent of men say their institutions should be readying them for AI and work at least somewhat, as do 69 percent of both women and nonbinary respondents. 
Some 76 percent of continuing-generation students expect their institutions to ready them for AI and work at least somewhat, compared to 66 percent of first-gen peers. 

Students are seeking both ethical and practical AI training. 
As for just how institutions should be preparing them for AI and work, the No. 1 priority, to students, is being taught the ethics of using AI, with nearly three in four students choosing this. The No. 2 choice (62 percent) from a list of five options is prioritizing teaching core skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. This is presumably to build skills that make students’ would-be jobs more resistant to AI. A close third choice is teaching the ins and outs of using AI, meaning students are also eager for practical training (60 percent). 
Just 28 percent of students say their institutions should prepare them for AI and work by encouraging career paths that are less likely to be impacted by AI. These results are relatively consistent across student subgroups and institution types, including gender, major and first- or continuing-generation status. 

M’hammed Abdous, assistant vice president for teaching and learning with technology and associate director of the Center for Faculty Development at Old Dominion University in Virginia, says the responses are “a strong indication of the transformative potential that AI is registering with students.” Respondents over all seem “rightly aware of how AI is reshaping the job market in so many different areas.” Abdous cites reports suggesting that up to 40 percent of current jobs are potentially replaceable by AI, adding that even jobs that won’t be displaced will still be subject to change due generative AI’s power to reshape work. 
At the same time, “AI will also stimulate demand for new skills that require human ingenuity, creativity, empathy and ethics—things that AI cannot do,” he adds. Regarding the related Student Voice findings on what training students want, Abdous says that students are again “right on target.” 
Abdous suggests colleges and universities consider doing the following: 
Conduct a thorough analysis of current curriculum and degree offerings to ensure their continued relevancy. Identify careers that are and will be disrupted by AI and update the relevant curricula accordingly. Include AI in every program to guarantee that students are exposed. Offer multidisciplinary programs that address different aspects of AI, including in computer science, data science, ethics and English. Build lifelong learning pathways for students to continue building their knowledge after graduation. 
Suzanne Helbig, associate vice provost of the Division of Career Pathways at the University of California, Irvine, says that institutions can adopt “intentional practices to cultivate a continuous-learning mindset and critical thinking skills that will future-proof their students.” This means providing more ways for students to connect what they’re learning in the classroom to the world of work and equipping faculty and staff members to help students “identify and articulate their transferable skills for future roles.” 
Institutions should harness workforce data and industry connections to inform curriculum and program development, she adds, plus “resource and elevate campus career services to address the top reason students seek higher education: to advance their careers. The proliferation of AI and its effects on the future of work makes career services an even greater institutional imperative.”

The sweeping proposal that US Citizenship and Immigration Services released last fall was crafted with the intent of modernizing the specialty occupation visa heavily used by the tech industry and offering new flexibility to workers. But if the final version of the rule tracks the proposal, new eligibility criteria and definitions will actually make it harder to hire the talent needed for roles in emerging tech fields like AI, according to many of the over 1,300 public comments submitted on the proposal.Among the most notable proposed changes, the regulations would overhaul the annual H-1B lottery system, which USCIS uses to select petitions to process because demand far exceeds the supply of 85,000 visas each fiscal year. The agency has proposed basing lottery selection on individual workers, rather than the current practice of selecting based on employer submissions—which allows for multiple registrations to be filed on behalf of the same worker. Businesses say that shift, proposed to weed out companies gaming the lottery, would level the playing field for securing the visas. At the same time, the proposed rule would modify the definition of what qualifies as a “specialty occupation,” adding the requirement of a direct relationship between a degree held by a potential H-1B employee and the position the employer aims to fill. A role also wouldn’t qualify as a specialty occupation under the proposal if it requires only a general degree such as engineering without further specialization.That added restriction would stymie hiring in interdisciplinary fields like AI or business intelligence and adopt an approach already rejected in court rulings, pro-immigration groups including the American Immigration Lawyers Association said in comments on the proposed rule.The reality is employers are seeking to build teams of workers with a range of knowledge and backgrounds, said Divyansh Kaushik, associate director for emerging technologies and national security at the Federation of American Scientists.“USCIS is essentially going against what the market considers best practice,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Law. “It appears the language is trying to solve government’s needs, not the user’s needs.”The requirements of most technology jobs can change significantly after a person moves from higher education into the workforce, said Jennifer Young, CEO of the Technology Councils of North America. “It’s not really keeping up with the times,” she said of the proposal. “Flexibility is required because these jobs are changing so rapidly.”Targeted in AI OrderThe proposed H-1B changes were released the same month that President Joe Biden issued an executive order that made adding foreign talent with essential expertise a central piece of his administration’s policy vision on artificial intelligence.The order directed the State and Homeland Security departments to consider policies that would lower visa barriers for researchers and students working in AI or other critical new fields. The order specifically targeted J-1 research scholar visas; F-1 visas for students in science, technology, engineering, and math fields; and H-1B visas for regulatory changes. While industry advocates welcomed the immigration provisions of the executive order, they said it also underlined the need for Congress to make streamlined access to visas and to increase the numbers of visas available for foreign talent.The H-1B program in particular is the main pathway for employers to bring in international workers with at least a bachelor’s degree in fields like technology and engineering, but the 85,000 visas issued annually don’t even come close to what employers are seeking. Entries for the annual H-1B lottery have skyrocketed since the government adopted an online registration system, surpassing 750,000 registrations for this fiscal year alone.Those numbers reflect growing demand for the visas. But USCIS also says they demonstrate attempts by at least some users to cheat the system by submitting multiple entries on behalf of the same worker to increase the odds of selection. Those particular concerns drove much of the draft regulations even as the agency sought to lower barriers for other program users. USCIS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the feedback. Unnecessary HurdlesTightening specialty occupation standards by requiring a degree be “directly related” to a position adds unnecessary hurdles for employers and contravenes the Biden executive order, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said in public commentson the rule.A Silicon Valley lawmaker, Lofgren has been one of the biggest advocates in Congress for updating the employment-based immigration system. USCIS said in its proposal that the suggested new regulatory language would codify existing practices and shouldn’t be read as requiring a singular field of study. For example, a degree in electrical engineering or electronics engineering may qualify for an electrical engineer position, the agency said. The draft regulations don’t mention artificial intelligence directly. For any job to qualify as a specialty occupation, the proposal states that “a position may allow a range of degrees or apply multiple bodies of highly specialized knowledge, provided that each of those qualifying degree fields or each body of highly specialized knowledge is directly related to the position. That fails to account for the way industry hires talent with a range of scholarly specialties in developing fields, Lofgren wrote. “Across industries, employers have trended towards hiring teams with degrees and skills that complement each other from across various academic backgrounds. This is true for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) workforce, as well,” she wrote. “As AI makes its way into various industries not historically associated with the use of AI, such as agriculture and healthcare, employers will need to hire professionals with knowledge specific to the industry itself, not just those who will have the academic background traditionally associated with AI fields.”The new eligibility standards would increase scrutiny of H-1B petitions and thus denials, and would “open the door to even narrower interpretations of H1B eligibility under future administrations,” Scott Corley, executive director of the Compete America Coalition, wrote in the organization’s comments. The coalition is made up of employers that advocate for reform of the high-skilled immigration system.Although the draft was a thoughtful update to H-1B regulations overall, the proposed definition of specialty occupation “really does risk putting the wheel in the ditch,” said Bo Cooper, a partner at Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy LLP.The proposal would put agency officials’ focus on broad labels of positions and degrees when adjudicating petitions, he said in an interview with Bloomberg Law. That change would potentially lead to petition denials for workers who are actually qualified under the statute, he said.“The basic equation should be is there a connection between the course of study and the job duties required for the position,” Cooper said. “If you focus too much on labels, then that doesn’t align with the realities of university-level education. Normally, emerging fields come first and then degrees to support those specialties follow.” Continue Reading To contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Kreighbaum in Washington at akreighbaum@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Laura D.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Pittsburgh-based Duolingo has laid off some of its contractor workforce, in part because of artificial intelligence. The East Liberty-based company said it has ""off-boarded"" 10 percent of its contractor workforce. In some cases, the contractor work was concluded, Duolingo said, adding that in other cases the work is being aided by A.I. ""There is some merit to the idea that AI is contributing to the reduction of our contract workforce, but it would be an oversimplification to say this is the sole reason,"" Sam Dalsimer, Duolingo's global head of communications, said on Monday to our news partner at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""We use AI for a variety of different functions and tasks.""Duolingo produces courses in 40 different languages and said artificial intelligence is generating some narratives and translations. Over the summer, Duolingo was recognized as one of Time's 100 most influential companies across the globe for 2023. Time highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence as a reason for making the top 100.

With 2022 headlined by quiet quitting and the great resignation, in 2023 artificial intelligence was decidedly in, while corporate jargon was out.With lingering exhaustion from the pandemic years leaving many reconsidering the nature of work itself, last year was tough for workers, according to the University of Sydney business school’s Associate Professor Anya Johnson.How workplaces changed in 2023: Wellness, hybrid work and artificial intelligence.  Credit: Marija Ercegovac“There’s been a desire to not snap back to what was happening in 2019 but to re-craft what and how work will happen moving forward,” says Johnson, who researches workplace performance and wellbeing.Here are five ways that workplaces changed in 2023.Artificial IntelligenceFuelled by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, artificial intelligence entered the mainstream last year. By January, it had become the fastest growing consumer technology, with more than 100 million users.Fears that jobs would be rendered obsolete followed but Dr Sandra Peter, director of Sydney Executive Plus at the University of Sydney, believes proficiency with AI will become a normal part of job descriptions – like having basic computer skills.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 0:00Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -0:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Jobseekers are already using AI to optimise cover letters and CVs, create headshots and generate questions to prepare for interviews, Peter says.AdvertisementAs jobs become automated, soft skills – those that can’t be offered by a computer – could become increasingly valuable.Related ArticleOpinionWork therapyI can’t find a job. Have I been replaced by AI?Jonathan RivettCareers contributor“For anybody who wants to develop their career in an AI future, focus on the basic soft skills of problem-solving, creativity and inclusion,” says Cayla Dengate, news editor at LinkedIn Australia.Some concerns about the dangers of AI in the workplace remain in 2024.“Artificial intelligence automates away a lot of the easy parts and that has the potential to make our jobs more intense and more demanding ... there have always been unethical uses of technology.” Peter says. She says education and policy are vital to curb irresponsible uses of AI.Hybrid workAre we nearing the end of the work from home era? While COVID fast-tracked flexible working models, in 2023 many organisations began ushering employees back to the office.In a KPMG survey of more than 1300 chief executives released in October, most predicted a complete eradication of working from home over the next three years.Younger workers, who require more support than previous generations after COVID, benefit from a return to the office.Credit: Peter RaeStill, many employers are grappling with keeping employees happy.“We’re seeing a divide between managers and staff in terms of how much time they want to be spending in the office versus working from home,” says Dengate.Editor's pickGot a Minute?My boss asked for honest feedback, then froze me out of the team“An idea that’s gaining momentum is that a workplace is not somewhere to sit down and quietly do your work. Going into work is about connecting with your colleagues and having a bonding experience, more so than just working.”Younger workers, who require more support than previous generations after COVID, also benefit from a return to the office.“That generation really do need mentors, they need to be getting feedback and to feel that others in the workplace value them and that they have the opportunity to learn,” says Johnson.The fall of corporate jargon“Circling back”, “taking things offline”, “sorry if that was unclear” – corporate jargon has been slowly falling out of favour for the past few years – and younger generations are leading the charge.A global report from LinkedIn from June found that “60 per cent of Gen Z and 65 per cent of Millennials want to reduce or eliminate the use of workplace jargon”, while a quick scroll on TikTok reveals many young office workers mocking the veiled language.  “Sometimes corporate buzzwords can help a team feel like they’re all speaking the same language,” says Dengate. “But the flip side is that it can isolate people who aren’t in on the lingo.“Remote workers are more likely to dislike corporate buzzwords because it makes them feel left out. They don’t know what the latest acronym is, and it stands in the way of understanding.”WellbeingFrom managers supporting staff through a divorce to lunchtime meditation, the personal and professional have become increasingly intertwined. Worker wellbeing is a growing concern for organisations with increases in psychosocial risk claims and work absences due to stress and exhaustion.The pandemic was a trigger for many workers. “People did some soul-searching and asked themselves, do I care about where I work? Is this feeding my soul?” says Dengate.In response, she says organisations took a “stronger stance on social issues, such as the environment, to create a workplace where people’s personal mission is aligned with their workplace”.While breath work and nutrition seminars are positive steps, wellbeing solutions in the workplace should go beyond the individual to be meaningful. “We need to be looking more closely at what people are doing at work and whether it’s good for them,” says Johnson. “How is the work you’re doing designed? What extent are you receiving feedback? Do people just have too much to do in the time that they have available?”Paid job interviewsRecognition is growing for just how much work goes into looking for a job. From multiple rounds of interviews to business proposals, the application process can be incredibly time and labour-intensive – and some are calling for applicants to be compensated for their time.The idea is gaining traction abroad. Canadian food justice organisation FoodShare offers prospective candidates $75CAD per interview ($83), while Zero Waste Club in the UK compensates workers with $275 for attending a two to three hour workshop. It’s a concept Dengate believes will catch on in Australia in 2024.Editor's pickWorkplace cultureWhy offering senior jobs part-time is a ‘no-brainer’“Part of the reason why is to level the playing field. It’s not one person asking to impress the other. It’s an acknowledgement that this person is important, and their time is valuable.”Dengate says compensating workers for work during the interview process can also be beneficial for organisations.“Paying somebody to attend a job interview forces companies to be more direct about who they want and why, without wasting time on additional job interviews and additional applicants,” she says.Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our Live Well newsletter.
