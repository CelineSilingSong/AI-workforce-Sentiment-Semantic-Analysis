Too many technologist, in every generation of technology, state that management need to think more like programmers. That’s not the case. Rather, the technology professionals need to learn to speak to management. “The Business Case for AI,” by Kavita Ganesan, PhD, is a good overview for managers wishing to understand and control the complexities of implementing artificial intelligence (AI) systems in businesses.


I’m always skeptical of self-published books. Usually that means the books just aren’t that good. However, sometimes, especially in non-fiction, it means that publishers are clueless about the subject and hesitant to work with people who aren’t “names.” This book is an example of the second option, and it will give management an introduction to the concepts surrounding AI and how to address implementation in a way that will increase the odds of success for AI initiatives.

The indication that the author mostly lives in the real world comes quickly. The first chapter is a good, introduction to what matters for business about AI. Forget the technical focus, it’s about solving problems in an efficient and cost-effective way.

PROMOTED
Chapter 2, “What is AI?” isn’t bad either, though I disagree with the idea that machine learning (ML) is part of AI. Business Intelligence (BI) has advanced, along with computing performance, that standard analytics provide insight that can be termed ML, so ML and AI overlap. That, however, is a religious argument and what Ganeson has to say about AI is at a good level for management understanding.

The weakest chapter in the introduction is the fourth, where the science fiction addict in me had to sigh at “Movies such as ‘I Robot’”. Ummm, check your library.
That chapter’s list of myths is also a bit problematic. The first, about job loss, is the one area where it shows the part of the real world in which the author exists isn’t one most people are in. The AI revolution is very different than the industrial revolution and earlier technology revolutions. She talks about artificial general intelligence (AGI) and says that since it’s still far away that means a lot of jobs won’t be lost. We don’t need AGI to replace jobs.

The next couple of chapters are good for setting up examples of business processes that could be impacted by AI. I do have an issue with which companies she decides to name and which remain anonymous, as that seems to imply protecting customers. The best part was a good discussion of IT & manufacturing operations, but that could have been improved by discussing infrastructure operations such as pipelines and the electrical grid.

Part 3 (chapters 7-9) is very good but, again, has a few things to keep in mind. On page 117, six phases of the development lifecycle are defined. I agree with them, but want to point out that data acquisition and model development, phases 2 & 3, can be done somewhat in parallel. The things you learn from each can impact the other. The other nit is that the author seems to use warehouse improperly. Data warehouses have a specific, more narrow purpose. When she uses the term, think data lake. The importance of logging, transactions and more, is often ignored, and the end of this section of the book has a good explanation of its importance.

The fourth part of the book is a set of chapters that drills down into the “finding AI projects” portion of the analysis process, and is well laid out.
The final section has two chapters. The first is about “build v buy.” It is no surprise that a consultant leans towards build, that’s her livelihood. What managers need to understand is that businesses aren’t as unique as they wish to think. There are unique things, but the vast majority of business is like other businesses. AI is a new technology and there aren’t enough easy to use tools for a buy decision in many areas, but that will change over time. Managers need have a flexible understanding of the equation and balance that in the real-world.
The final chapter is, as expected, a good summation and a return to focusing on business results. It continues the author’s use of good, simple, graphics to show the points of her arguments. Regardless of the issues I’ve mentioned above, the book does a great job of laying out the challenges of artificial intelligence from a business perspective. The book doesn’t delve deeply into algorithms or other details that don’t matter to management, while it does provide a framework to look at AI projects through a business lens that integrates the technology into organizations in a way that doesn’t leave everything to technologist. “The Business Case for AI” is a good introduction for IT and line managers to think about how to integrate artificial intelligence into their organizations.

Global survey shows researchers in increasing numbers are looking to AI to support and speed up their work

COVID-19 changed the way we all work, live and socialise – with technology and communication tools more important than ever. The world of scientific research was no exception, with the use of technology and specifically artificial intelligence (AI) increasing. AI is now increasingly relied upon to speed up research and generate new insights across all of science. 
The positive endorsement of AI was noted in the second iteration of Elsevier’s global research project – Research Futures – which aims to gather the views and opinions of researchers across the world to help us as science publishers better understand the challenges and opportunities they face.
Forty seven percent of researchers believe that a long-lasting impact of the pandemic will be a greater dependency on technology and AI in their work, underlining the importance of AI for the future of research.
The study shows the number of researchers using AI “extensively” has increased from 12% in 2020 to 16% in 2021.

Daikin latest to adopt AI service tool
29th April 2022






USA: Daikin Comfort Technologies North America is the latest air conditioning manufacturer to adopt the cloud-based mobile communications tool developed by US company XOi Technologies. 

The technology has also been adopted by Carrier for both its Carrier and Bryant service technicians in the USA and by the UK subsidiary of Aermec, the Italian chiller and fan coli manufacturer.
Using the technology with the Daikin, Goodman and Amana air conditioning brands will enable contractors to automate the entire workflow, boosting quality repairs and replacements. It seamlessly connects field service techs, home offices and their customers, while enabling on-the-job photo and video documentation, real-time remote video support and training, plus access to a vast knowledge base of product documentation and training content.
This is accomplished through a cloud-based app that’s customisable for specific dealer needs. For their customers, it allows the repair process to be immediately shareable, transparent and validating.

According to XOi Technologies, contractors using this service solution found they could grow revenues by up to 18%, cut callbacks by up to 40% and reduce re-servicing by up to 80%.
“XOi simplifies technicians’ work while validating consistent quality and, ultimately, transforming the customer experience,” said Stuart Werner, Daikin’s vice president – technical services.
“With XOi’s software solution, HVAC technicians can better document, communicate and verify the services they provide. It equips field professionals with capabilities to perform full-service diagnostics at any job site by applying data science across live video, workflow automation and artificial intelligence.”
At its core, XOi software standardises workflows and documents job sites by collecting, indexing and analysing data to improve both current and future service calls. But, Werner says, it also allows Daikin technicians to build a deep and easily accessible institutional knowledge base that supports real-time decision-making and data-based continuity.
“What elevates XOi’s technology from the rest of the field service management sector,” explains Werner, “is its historical job data functionality that seamlessly ties together customers, contractors, distributor and OEMS, laying the foundation for future value. If we can reduce the challenges HVAC techs face – documenting the entire process for both customers and our industry’s knowledge base – we can tackle one of HVAC’s biggest challenges head on.”

XOi’s cloud-based suite uses augmented reality and artificial intelligence to apply, aggregate and analyse critical job data from the moment a field tech steps onto a job site. The entire workflow is streamlined and automated, with a simple capture and share function that allows photo/video documentation, while pinpointing manuals, parts and training specific to the equipment. The workflow is readily shareable to the home office, distributors and OEMs. Customers can also get a record of service call highlights, making it easier to understand repair or replacement costs.
With XOi’s coaching screen, field techs and others can collaborate with live, interactive video that’s recorded and indexed, a feature built to help less experienced technicians or those facing repair challenges. Technicians can access more than 120,000 pieces of content – a centralised training repository with easy access to historical job content.
“Most field service management software solutions are effective for high-level operations, but we designed XOi to fully capture the granular detail that is crucial not only for real-time decisions but for long-term accuracy and efficiency,” said XOi founder and CEO Aaron Salow.

Despite continued increases in R&D spending, the five-year average number of new medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sits stubbornly at around 50 drugs per year1. As the cost of bringing a new drug to market increases, with estimates suggesting it has nearly doubled in the past decade2, it has become vital to improve R&D productivity to ensure the future viability of the pharmaceutical industry and advances in healthcare.Many drug candidates fail before they enter clinical trials. Preclinical studies are designed to identify and validate a lead candidate. It is at this crucial stage of the process that 50% of spending is wasted, amounting to $28.2 billion in the United States alone each year3.There are three main reasons for this:• Redundancy. Scientists often have no or poor visibility of experiments other scientists have performed in the past, even within their own organizations.• Experimental failure. Many experiments fail to produce usable data because of faulty reagents and protocols.• Irreproducibility. Even when an experiment seemingly succeeds, it often cannot be reproduced, perhaps because of problems with reagents, documentation and data gathering.As a PhD researcher, Tom Leung, BenchSci’s CSO experienced first-hand the waste of resources in preclinical studies. When working as a cancer researcher, he lost rare patient samples because of an inappropriate antibody. Problems with antibody selectivity and specificity are widely acknowledged as one of the main causes of incorrect, inconsistent and irreproducible results in life sciences.Keen to tackle the problem, Leung teamed up with David Q. Chen, Elvis Wianda and Liran Belenzon at the University of Toronto, Canada, to apply AI to antibody selection. In 2015, they founded BenchSci and started building AI-powered applications that analyse the full text of scholarly articles to extract relevant information for choosing the most suitable reagent for a particular experiment.In 2017, BenchSci launched its first application: AI-Assisted Antibody Selection. “Scientists used to have to spend hours or even days reviewing publications to find the antibody that would be most likely to work in their experiments. With BenchSci they can get antibody validation information within minutes,” said Leung.Since then, BenchSci’s platform has expanded to encompass more types of reagents as well as model systems, including recombinant proteins, RNAi, cell lines, CRISPR, animal models and PCR. Today, more than 49,000 scientists in 16 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies and 4,500 academic institutions use BenchSci’s AI-Assisted Antibody Selection or Reagent Selection applications to plan more successful experiments, with proven savings of millions of dollars per year.




How the BenchSci system works. Accelerating R&D, the system above enables faster reagent selection, more reproducible experiments and increased research capacity.


Running fewer but better experimentsBy helping researchers select the most-appropriate reagents in seconds, BenchSci aims to halve the time it takes for new drugs to reach the market by 2025.“Roughly 80% of experiments in the preclinical phase of the drug development process are unnecessary to progress a novel medicine to clinical trials,” said Leung “Performing only the 20% that are necessary would mean carrying out an average of 1,400 versus 7,000 experiments—so new drugs would get to patients much faster and be much cheaper.”BenchSci’s approach involves:• The collection of terabytes of data from sources including scientific publications, reagent catalogs, and customer databases. These include closed-access publications, thanks to partnerships with publishers.• The use of more than 100 proprietary machine-learning models that decode millions of unstructured scientific documents and extract insights from images, as well as text.• A user-friendly interface that organizes the resulting information using a proprietary ontology. This allows researchers to understand the biomedical significance of the extracted data and establish relationships between biological entities. Users can easily search by target and reagent- or model system-type to obtain experiment-specific reagents and compare their specifications in minutes.Meeting customer needsBuilding on the success of current applications, BenchSci is evolving its technology to provide even more comprehensive solutions to help leading pharmaceutical companies solve their biggest R&D challenges.

As stated in our ""Thought Leadership"" document
published in 2021, AI-created works of art and the notion of
ownership and enforcement within copyright law are controversial
issues worldwide.
Although there has been no new court decision or legislative
regulation that could answer these questions in our country or
around the world during the past year, the decision of The Review
Board of the United States Copyright Office (""Board"")
dated February 14, 20221, which includes evaluations on
whether artificial intelligence can be the owner of the work,
contains substantial determinations in this regard.
In the related dispute, Stephen Thaler, who works in artificial
intelligence technologies, has applied for the copyright
registration for the work named ""a recent entrance to
paradise"", whose image is presented below and created by the
algorithm called ""creativity machine"".

In his application, Stephen Thaler stated that the related work
was created autonomously by the ""creativity machine""
algorithm, and it is a work created by the ""work made for
hire"" doctrine, and that he filed the application by being the
proprietor of the machine following the assignment declaration he
submitted. However, in its initial examination, the United States
Copyright Office (""Office"") rejected the application,
stating that the relevant application did not meet the ""human
authorship"" requirement sought for a copyright claim. On the
other hand, Thaler requested reconsideration of this decision
stating that it is unconstitutional to require a ""human
authorship"" requirement for registration and that such a
requirement is neither included in the law nor the case law.
In the subsequent examination, the Office again rejected these
requests, reiterating its initial assessments and stating that
Thaler did not provide evidence to prove that human-provided
sufficient creative contribution to the relevant work or that the
human intervention had taken place. Thus, the Office has also made
it clear that it will not abandon its long-standing interpretation
as ""a work will only meet the legal and formal requirements to
benefit from copyright protection when it is created by a
human."" which has been adopted based on the US Copyright Law,
Supreme Court and other court decisions.
Thaler filed a second request for the reconsideration, stating
that the regulations regarding copyright already allowed
non-natural persons to own works within the scope of the ""work
made for hire"" doctrine and that there is also no obstacle to
the application of the works created by computers. Therefore, he
argued that the Office's refusal grounds were based on old
views that did not address current needs.
Evaluating this second request for reconsideration, the Board
stated that the law protects the fruits of intellectual labour. The
Board did not find these reconsideration requests acceptable,
stating that the works created only by a machine or a mechanical
process without a human author's creative input or intervention
cannot benefit from protection. Referring to the previous
decisions, the Board underlined that no protection had been
provided before for works created by non-humans such as animals or
spiritual beings. Moreover, the Board stated that the ""work
made for hire"" doctrine is not relevant to this file and that
creating the work by a human is a must for this doctrine.
As a result, the relevant decision of the Board set out that, in
accordance with the current regulations and case law in the USA,
the nexus between the human mind and creative expression is seen as
the most fundamental element for copyright, and it is not possible
for works created without human creative contribution and
intervention to benefit from copyright protection under the current
legislation.
Although we see that the requirement for the owner of the work
to be a natural person continues to be sought within the scope of
the current regulations, the necessity of protecting the works
created using artificial intelligence systems and the issue of what
kind of protection this will be, continue to be discussed around
the world.
As a matter of fact, the UK Intellectual Property Office has
published a consultation and requested the opinion of the public
until the date of January 07 2022, on the issues of copyright
protection and authorship on the products created as a result of
the technological developments in terms of the relationship between
artificial intelligence and copyright law. Besides other questions,
participants were asked whether the current regulation, which
grants copyright ownership to the natural person who makes the
necessary arrangements during the creation of the relevant work,
responds to developments in artificial intelligence and carries a
sufficient incentive mechanism.
Although the results of this consultation and regulations to
come into force regarding this issue have not been shared with the
public yet, even the fact that such consultation is being conducted
indicates that the authorities are paying more attention to this
issue and actions are being taken slowly to meet the
ever-increasing need for regulation in this area.
In addition, the European Union Intellectual Property Office,
which examines the usage areas and effects of artificial
intelligence technology more closely in terms of rights arising
from copyright, and evaluates the situation with 20 different
scenarios, published the Study on the Impact of Artificial
Intelligence on the Infringement and Enforcement of Copyright and
Designs report2 in March 2022. In summary, the
report stated that artificial intelligence could be used
effectively during the exercise of these rights and to detect
violations; however, this technology has technical limitations in
itself, and even there is an increasing trend in terms of their use
in acts constituting infringement, it brings concerns in terms of
ethics, privacy and fundamental rights.
We will continue to follow the developments in this field, which
no doubt will keep being on the agenda in the following years.

Normally, epigraphers – scholars who study ancient texts written on durable materials such as stone, metal, or pottery – use their knowledge of repositories of information and digital databases to perform &quot;string matching&quot; searches to find textual and contextual parallels. However, differences in the digital-search query that can exclude or conceal relevant results and that the texts often are discovered not in their original context can complicate the work. Starting from Adam and Eve to the Greek gods there is so much to discover and researchers are using advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to get more accurate results. Most scientific research to date has focused on whether Adam and Eve could have passed on genetic material to everyone living; however, this doesn't seem to be the type of ancestry the Bible is concerned with. While all genetic ancestors are genealogical ancestors, the inverse is not necessarily true..So, what does this mean for Adam and Eve? Well, in 2004, a computer simulation of life on Earth was created to test and see when the most recent common ancestor for all humans was. The researchers put higher barriers than historically existed to stack the odds against there being a common ancestor in the recent past. Despite this, the results, published in Nature, found common ancestors only two or three thousand years ago. Apart from Adam and Eve, the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is speeding up such research and drawing attention to overlooked information. But this approach, known as &quot;digital humanities&quot;, is in a battle for funding against more future-focused applications of AI..Restoring or recreating archaeological artifacts is a complicated problem for computer vision models. Previous work — algorithms learning to reassemble photos or documents, for example — has not accounted for the degradation of fragments, unclear images, or imprecise piece-fitting..Researchers use AI to restore ancient Greek texts.Ancient texts written on stone tablets, such as those found in Greece, provide invaluable insight into the history of past civilizations. However, being as much as 2,600 years old, these priceless inscriptions haven't been immune to the ravages of time. They're often damaged and littered with chips and cracks, sometimes even missing entire fragments of text. To fill these gaps and reconstruct the missing sections, historians typically rely on a discipline called epigraphy, which uses &quot;grammatical and linguistic considerations, layout and shape, textual parallels, and historical context&quot; to estimate what the text originally contained. As this is a very complex and time-consuming process, the team behind Google's DeepMind AI joined forces with the University of Oxford to develop Pythia, the first ancient text restoration model that uses deep neural networks to recover missing characters from damaged text..How AI is helping us bring history back to life.Artificial intelligence technology has had a profound impact on a wide variety of industries in recent years, transforming almost every aspect of our lives in the process. While most of the talk surrounding AI has focused on how it will affect the human workforce, it can't be denied that it's found some very promising applications in certain areas. One of these areas is archaeology, where AI's ability to analyze large amounts of data in a short amount of time and uncover hidden patterns is very useful. Whether it's used to restore ancient Greek texts, translate long-lost languages, reassemble damaged archaeological artifacts, or uncover hidden designs in the Nazca Lines, AI is becoming an increasingly important tool in archaeologists' arsenal, helping them bring history back to life..In conclusion, looking at the continued developments there is no lie that in no time artificial intelligence will be able to tell how Adam and Eve used to live in the past.

AI is turning out to be one of the trendiest topics in the business and digital world. Top leading tech companies and industries show interest in AI app development Canada. The speed with which the craze and development of artificial intelligence are rising is admirable as AI is everywhere nowadays. But how does AI help in mobile app development Toronto?
Beginning from the live chat box to prediction analytics, AI approaches state-of-the-art ideas to provide better client services and re-evaluate business procedures with current modern technology. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the new-age technologies that cause unexpected changes in the manner a business works.
The thought of AI portrays that a computer will carry out a task that generally needs a human to finish. Amazingly, AI is about speech recognition as well as interpretation, portraying that a program could work as a human in activities and thoughts. The implementation of artificial intelligence in mobile app development Toronto can be classified into weak and strong levels.
Though AI accounts for fewer errors in the complete procedure, carries out deadly tasks easily, and distinguishes real-time location smoothly; AI decreases the amount of creativity and innovative ideas of a process, that a human could think of. So, AI has its advantages and disadvantage. But we cannot deny the fact that it is the future of mobile app development Canada and the tech industry.
Types of AI
AI is a very provocative topic, on which we have seen a lot of intense discussions. But generally speaking, Artificial intelligence can be categorized into 4 types. They are –
1. Reactive machines:
This is the first type of AI that reacts to the present scenario by analysing all the feasible moves and then selects the finest one. A well-known sample of a reactive machine is the IBM chess program, Deep Blue which defeated chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This program analyses its own as well as opponent moves and selects the most tactical one. But, it can’t store previous experiences. One more example of such reactive AI is Google’s AlphaGO.
2. Theory of mind
In this type of AI, psychology term is considered that means understanding others’ desires, beliefs, and intentions that influence one’s decision. An example of this kind of AI doesn’t present as of yet. Such kind of artificial intelligence would understand you and afterwards make a decision.
3. Limited memory 
These systems of artificial intelligence do all the discussed things that reactive machine performs, but it additionally stores memory. Such Ai’s are utilized in self-driving cars which utilize past observation to form a prediction such as changing car lanes etc. But the memories are not permanently stored. They are stored for a limited time.
4. Self-awareness 
This is the kind of artificial intelligence which you perceive in movies which have self-awareness, self-consciousness, have a sensitive feeling toward others. Right now, we are very far from making such kind of AI.
Importance of Artificial Intelligence in Real Life
Artificial intelligence plays a very significant role in mankind. It is the expertise that can bring more output in less input. Primarily, AI will carry out tedious tasks, but it will also improve efficiency. Farmers can utilize robots to plant as well as cultivate seeds and afterwards use drones to look after their field. It will exponentially raise the output. In the same way, advancements are also in development in other fields like healthcare and education. But it will moreover create so many high-skilled jobs and get things much more inexpensive for the people.
Artificial intelligence will affect and transform every industry on Earth, such as manufacturing, health care, agriculture, and many more.
What are the examples of AI?
Machine learning
In this technology, machines act with no need for programming. They perform by the study of earlier experiences and then forecasting moves.
A realistic example of this kind of AI can be a robot which analyses the stock market by looking at earlier recorded trades and afterwards forecast new ones that get success in the upcoming days.
Automation
Mobile Application development is a lengthy process; programmers have to employ hundreds of hours coding a similar thing. Artificial intelligence will ease this burden by creating infrastructure for programmers to work on. A company launched the latest AI test bot which will test different mobile applications. In simple terms, it will assist developers to test smartphone applications more efficiently and make the most of quality assurance by doing less.
Machine vision
Artificial intelligence is utilized to provide a machine with the competence to capture as well as analyse visual information. Thus, an AI can witness and listen to things simply like a human. Afterwards, analyse and react as per the information. The humanoid Sophia is powered by artificial intelligence that can see as well as listen to things and facial recognition feature is included with the machine vision to better recognize the world.
Voice recognition
At present, we have a lot of mobile applications that use artificial intelligence to understand your voice. You can also unlock or give commands through this feature. Apple has become the pioneer in this field because it has combined Siri with Apple mobile gadgets for a long time. She can identify your voice and customize the phone for the best user experience.
Chatbots
Chatbots are AI-powered robots that can have an interaction with users just like humans. They learn through previous practices. The basic thought behind this product is that if individuals don’t desire to interact with somebody other than humans, they can employ these chatbots. Several popular AI-powered chatbots are Bold360 and LivePerson.
These were only a few popular applications of artificial intelligence that are being utilized in the present market.
How Can You Improve User Experience and Mobile application Development? 
AI assist to make a better decision
Artificial intelligence can analyse large bits of data which humans cannot. Imagine there is a big sum of data on the response of consumers to the application. You can create a program to get all those responses and feedback. But artificial intelligence can change the game by reading them in a humane way & grant developers a superior-conclusion. Later, this can be utilized to make an up-to-date decision.
User engagement
Most smartphone applications fail because of their lack of user engagement. Artificial intelligence is presently being utilized to analyse user behaviour to grant insight into the consumer. AI can tell smartphone applications what users are in search of and how they are utilizing their applications. Professional developers can employ this information to do changes for improved user engagement.
Personalization with artificial intelligence 
The smartphone is already marketized as custom-made for every user. But most applications are just the same for everybody. There is not much customization on an individual level. Recently, Flutter mobile applications have improved user experience with their personalized apps as per the user. AI primarily records user behaviour and afterwards changes their application or suggests changes as per the user practice for a better experience.
The smartphone can better connect with users 
As artificial intelligence can analyse large amounts of data, smartphone applications can connect to consumers on a deeper level. Apps can store the behaviour of users and give them more control over themselves. Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri are good examples that are doing the same. 
Context-driven UX
A smartphone can find your location; however, it doesn’t affect the user experience to a big level. But artificial intelligence-based algorithms can employ the user location along with various crucial aspects and then turn up user-centric recommendations and messages. For instance, in case you are on a road trip, your smartphone AI can suggest applications that can be beneficial to you or give a notification informing you that there is not any fuel station 100 odd km ahead.
Conclusion:
So, by now, you must be aware of how amazingly AI affect the user experience and mobile app development Canada. You also got a bit of knowledge about how it works on mobile applications. However, the incorporation of artificial intelligence with mobile applications is yet in the early stage. In future, you can witness a lot of transformation that can happen here. Your complete user experience can be improved through AI and then utilized in various mobile applications. We all need to see where artificial intelligence can take user experience and mobile app development.
