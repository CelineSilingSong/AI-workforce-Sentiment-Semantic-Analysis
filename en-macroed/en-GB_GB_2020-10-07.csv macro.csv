By and large, manufacturing jobs as we know them are not going to return. Instead, they are set to be replaced by automation and machine learning.This is not a uniquely American problem. Global population forecasts say we will reach almost 8.5 billion by 2030. Add the exponential speed at which areas such as AI, computational processing power and robotics are developing, and it is safe to predict that our global workforce and the demands we put on it will change markedly in the near future.Job functions will change rapidly to mirror the pace of technology, so creating a workforce that is educated and ready to adjust to changing demands must be among our priorities.The form future jobs will take is likely to be shaped by how man and machine end up working together. It remains unclear to what extent the analytical power of machines will replace that of humans. Will the human presence in some job functions become entirely obsolete? Such questions could be better framed. Image: World Economic ForumThere’s good news for those in creative roles: so far, machines cannot really replicate the imagination. The bad news is for those who have routine, non-creative jobs, as these are indeed being eaten up by automation.Man can meet machine in two waysThere are two opposing approaches to how we can help the workforce keep up with technological development. One is to boost employees’ analytical skills to compete directly with the machines, the other is to strive to complement machines and artificial intelligence with synthetic skills. But it is not about polar extremes, nor is it a question of picking one or the other; it is about finding that sweet-spot of how machines and humans work best together. This will not come about by designing the fastest central processing unit (CPU) nor the strongest robot. Instead it will be the fruit of designing the best teams, best processes, and best user experiences. We should not be sizing up the potential of humans nor machines in isolation, but taking both combined. Designers must look into solutions whereby humans and machines complement each other, maximizing the potential of both.Why computational power should not be reserved for only the specialistsGarry Kasparov, a Russian chess-master who still holds the record for consecutive professional tournament victories said, “A weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a very powerful machine alone, but more remarkably, is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process.” In the 1990s, Kasparov represented humans versus machines in a historic chess game against IBM’s Deep Blue computer. He went on to observe and participate in various chess contests where teams of man and machines competed against each other. His conclusion? It is not the team with the most computational power or the highest-ranking grand masters that will win, but the team with the best interplay – the best teamwork. In 2000, grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik defeated Garry Kasparov and became the Classical World Chess Champion. After retirement, he sought to rekindle human virtuosity in chess. Paradoxically he did so with the help of DeepMind – the makers of the best chess computer so far, AlphaZero, a far more advanced chess computer than Deep Blue. It is self-taught, and since AlphaZero can teach itself to play, it is also able to learn how to play any game by new rules. It can explore new variants of games and reveal its bugs and beauty more quickly than generations of human play could ever do. It can test all the outcomes of a game and decide if the game is worth playing. Consequently, the human-machine team Kramnik-AlphaZero are exploring new forms of chess that bring about human mastery and aesthetics, and they have come up with all sorts of new and alluring types of chess as a result.Reimagining the business processWe should not expect the future of machine learning and robotic design to be about humans versus machines but rather how humans and machines can form the best teams. A survey of a thousand companies working with AI published in Harvard Business Review stated in 2018 that, “Most activities at the human-machine interface require people to do new and different things (such as train a chatbot) and to do things differently (use that chatbot to provide better customer service). So far, however, only a small number of the companies we surveyed have begun to reimagine their business processes to optimize collaborative intelligence.”Today, at least 90,000 of IBM’s 388,000 employees are applying design-thinking methods to develop the company’s business domains - such as AI and CPU. As such, IBM is iterating and experimenting with how they can improve the user’s experience of working with computational power. The future will not be about creating the fastest CPU or cultivating prototypical employee skills, but it will be about designing the most compatible combinations of humans and machines, and optimising and simplifying the interaction between the two. And the most pioneering companies already know it.Have you read?Artificial intelligence will save jobs, not destroy them.

ON AN upper floor, something stirs in the semi-darkness of a closed shopping centre. It stops in front of a clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other malls and hospitals in Singapore. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.
Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.
This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”
And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?
The rise of robotics…

Researchers use artificial intelligence language tools to decode molecular movements

By applying natural language processing tools to the movements of protein molecules, University of Maryland scientists created an abstract language that describes the multiple shapes a protein molecule can take and how and when it transitions from one shape to another.





A protein molecule's function is often determined by its shape and structure, so understanding the dynamics that control shape and structure can open a door to understanding everything from how a protein works to the causes of disease and the best way to design targeted drug therapies. This is the first time a machine learning algorithm has been applied to biomolecular dynamics in this way, and the method's success provides insights that can also help advance artificial intelligence (AI). A research paper on this work was published on October 9, 2020, in the journal Nature Communications.
""Here we show the same AI architectures used to complete sentences when writing emails can be used to uncover a language spoken by the molecules of life,"" said the paper's senior author, Pratyush Tiwary, an assistant professor in UMD's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute for Physical Science and Technology. ""We show that the movement of these molecules can be mapped into an abstract language, and that AI techniques can be used to generate biologically truthful stories out of the resulting abstract words.""






Biological molecules are constantly in motion, jiggling around in their environment. Their shape is determined by how they are folded and twisted. They may remain in a given shape for seconds or days before suddenly springing open and refolding into a different shape or structure. The transition from one shape to another occurs much like the stretching of a tangled coil that opens in stages. As different parts of the coil release and unfold, the molecule assumes different intermediary conformations.
But the transition from one form to another occurs in picoseconds (trillionths of a second) or faster, which makes it difficult for experimental methods such as high-powered microscopes and spectroscopy to capture exactly how the unfolding happens, what parameters affect the unfolding and what different shapes are possible. The answers to those questions form the biological story that Tiwary's new method can reveal.
Tiwary and his team applied Newton's laws of motion—which can predict the movement of atoms within a molecule—with powerful supercomputers, including UMD's Deepthought2, to develop statistical physics models that simulate the shape, movement and trajectory of individual molecules.

University of Maryland researchers used an artificial intelligence system to create an abstract language from the constant motion of biological molecules, such as the lysozyme molecule shown here. This language describes the multiple shapes a protein molecule can take and how and when it transitions from one shape to another--key information for understanding disease and developing therapeutics. Credit: Zachary Smith/UMD
Then they fed those models into a machine learning algorithm, like the one Gmail uses to automatically complete sentences as you type. The algorithm approached the simulations as a language in which each molecular movement forms a letter that can be strung together with other movements to make words and sentences. By learning the rules of syntax and grammar that determine which shapes and movements follow one another and which don't, the algorithm predicts how the protein untangles as it changes shape and the variety of forms it takes along the way.
To demonstrate that their method works, the team applied it to a small biomolecule called riboswitch, which had been previously analyzed using spectroscopy. The results, which revealed the various forms the riboswitch could take as it was stretched, matched the results of the spectroscopy studies.
""One of the most important uses of this, I hope, is to develop drugs that are very targeted,"" Tiwary said. ""You want to have potent drugs that bind very strongly, but only to the thing that you want them to bind to. We can achieve that if we can understand the different forms that a given biomolecule of interest can take, because we can make drugs that bind only to one of those specific forms at the appropriate time and only for as long as we want.""
An equally important part of this research is the knowledge gained about the language processing system Tiwary and his team used, which is generally called a recurrent neural network, and in this specific instance a long short-term memory network. The researchers analyzed the mathematics underpinning the network as it learned the language of molecular motion. They found that the network used a kind of logic that was similar to an important concept from statistical physics called path entropy. Understanding this opens opportunities for improving recurrent neural networks in the future.
""It is natural to ask if there are governing physical principles making AI tools successful,"" Tiwary said. ""Here we discover that, indeed, it is because the AI is learning path entropy. Now that we know this, it opens up more knobs and gears we can tune to do better AI for biology and perhaps, ambitiously, even improve AI itself. Anytime you understand a complex system such as AI, it becomes less of a black-box and gives you new tools for using it more effectively and reliably.""

“Usama will work with senior leadership to create a pioneering research hub that places human skills and intelligence at the forefront of artificial intelligence development, from the earliest design steps to final implementation,” wrote David Madigan, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, in a letter welcoming Fayyad to the university.
Launched a year ago, the institute is university-wide in scope but will work especially closely with the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine.
The Institute of Experiential Artificial Intelligence focuses on application-driven, human-centered AI, says Carla Brodley, dean of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Joseph E. Aoun, president of Northeastern, has championed the institute based on his belief that “the true promise of AI lies not in its ability to replace humans, but to optimize what humans do best.”
Fayyad, whose work has been advancing AI for three decades, believes in the institute’s mission as well as its opportunity to become a world leader.









Here’s what it takes to test a COVID-19 vaccine with clinical trials




“I used to call it ‘pragmatic AI’ and ‘hybrid AI,’ but I think ‘experiential AI’ is a better term for it—which is AI with humans in the loop,” says Fayyad, whose leadership of the institute will commence “Northeastern is committed to building the top research institute in the world when it comes to experiential AI. One of the reasons I’m excited about that is because no one has yet claimed the space. There is a chance to be number one [in the field].”
Since 2008, Fayyad has been leading Open Insights, a company that he founded near Seattle that deploys data-driven solutions to grow revenue from data assets. 
Prior to that, he was co-founder and chief technical officer of OODA Health, a venture capital-funded company. He served as global chief data officer and group managing director at Barclays Bank in London, after having been appointed executive chairman of Oasis 500. He has been chairman and chief executive of several startups, including Blue Kangaroo Corp., DMX Group, and digiMine Inc. 
When one of Fayyad’s startups was acquired by Yahoo! in 2004, he became the first person known to hold the title of chief data officer; there are now thousands of chief data officers at companies around the world. He founded Yahoo! Research Labs and built Yahoo!’s Strategic Data Solutions group.
Fayyad has served in leadership positions at Microsoft, and he founded the Machine Learning Systems group at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where his work on machine learning earned him the top Excellence in Research award from Caltech, and a U.S. Government medal from NASA.









Self-driving cars could revolutionize transportation for people with disabilities. These researchers are trying to make it happen.




Fayyad holds more than 30 patents and has published more than 100 technical articles on data mining, data science, AI and machine learning, and databases. He has edited two influential books on data mining/data science and served as Founding Editor-in-Chief on two key industry journals.
He is co-founder of KDD—the largest international data science conference—and SIGKDD, the Association for Computing Machinery’s special interest group on knowledge discovery and data mining.
“I have known and respected Usama for three decades, and he is literally perfect for this position,” says Brodley. “We had an amazing slate of candidates, and he just really fit the bill with both his research experience and his entrepreneurship. He is going to be building experiential AI across the entire Northeastern network.”
Fayyad says he is looking forward to getting to know the Northeastern community in order to develop interdisciplinary partnerships that can help the institute confront many of the issues that are hindering experiential AI.
“This is a continued evolution of a path I’ve been on all of my professional life,” Fayyad says. “The first order of business is mapping out the strengths of the university; and mapping out the market weaknesses of what is missing and where are the real opportunities in experiential AI; and then figuring out how to leverage our strengths and resources that we will have at the institute in order to address those areas with a maximum impact. That gives you the ability to take the lead in certain areas that are in high demand, and it gives you the ability to attract the best minds to join in the journey because you are addressing problems that many of the other great research institutions are not working on.
“That’s how I normally like to do it, because you can add value and achieve distinction very quickly.”

Professor Shawn Newsam, left, and graduate student Shrishail “Shree” Baligar are using computer science to help conservation efforts.


Bird species usually are counted twice a year by wildlife surveyors: once during the breeding season and again during the Christmas Bird Count.
New technology, however, is increasing the accuracy of bird population studies. A team of UC Merced researchers is developing a model to recognize bird calls.
Recording devices called AudioMoths have been placed across bird habitat in Sonoma County. During two-week periods, the device wakes up every 10 minutes and records one minute of sound. Department of Computer Science and Engineering professor Shawn Newsam and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science graduate student Shrishail “Shree” Baligar are using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect bird calls in the recordings.
Their model can detect 45 different species so far, and will be used to produce maps of where, when and how many species are present.
Newsam and several colleagues joined up to explore the idea with two recently funded awards.
“I love working on multidisciplinary problems. It charges me,” Newsam said. He and Baligar are working with geography professor Matthew Clark from Sonoma State University, and Leo Salas, a quantitative ecologist at Point Blue Conservation Science, a nonprofit focused on climate-smart conservation.
“I’m excited to apply AI for the benefit of the Earth,” Newsam said. “Being able to passively detect and map species distributions using low-cost audio recording devices allows a range of down-stream research by domain scientists.”

The tiny AudioMoth recorders will capture recordings in nature, which can later be used to teach a computer model to recognize bird sounds.

The “Soundscapes to Landscapes (S2L): Monitoring Animal Biodiversity from Space Using Citizen Scientists” program is supported by $1.1 million over three years through NASA’s Citizen Science for Earth Systems program. It uses citizen scientists to deploy the AudioMoths. Other birders knowledgeable in bird calls will annotate a subset of the recordings, which serve as the training data for the AI models.
This summer, Newsam also received a $90,000, one-year “AI for Earth Innovation” grant from Global Wildlife Conservation in partnership with Microsoft. The nonprofit relies on research to work with local communities to address the root causes of threats to wildlife.
Newsam’s is one of only five projects funded out of 135 applications. The grant supports AI projects that can scale quickly. The research will benefit many other projects because it is open source.
For Newsam, there are many questions about processing the data, and many technical challenges. The recordings have biophony, geophony and anthrophony noise, and the bird calls are often faint. Some species have different calls for different communications: warning calls, mating calls and others. Which one should the AI focus on?
“Birds often modify their calls by changing frequency, for example, if other birds are also calling,” Newsam said. “I am learning a lot about bird calls.”
Baligar hears the calls as something more than just bird communication.
“I like to think of birds as musical instruments,” he said. “All the violins are orange crowned warblers, but no two violins are the same. A bird song plays different notes, and every bird likes to play a song differently every time.”
Each AudioMoth gathers about 2,000 minutes of data per site. So far, the team has more than 500,000 minute-long recordings — more than 8,000 hours of data from over 600 locations — and terrabytes of data to manage.
However, training the AI model requires a lot of annotated data.
“Deep learning is data hungry,” Baligar said. “The more data the better. On average, we have just 650 training clips per bird species, which is not a lot.”
Newsam, who co-founded the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SpARC) at UC Merced, is an expert in image analysis and understanding.
“Image and audio are sensorily very different but in the end, it is just data — data that we are turning into information through several processes,” he said.
Baligar did not set out to study sound or bird calls when he was a master’s student. He was more interested in time-series questions. Now, audio over time is the focus of his dissertation, and potentially the basis for a company he hopes to launch after graduation.
Computer science and environmental science are two of UC Merced’s growing number of strengths, said professor Josh Viers, director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at UC Merced.
“Professor Newsam’s research is indicative of the progress UC Merced has made in attracting top talent and solving important global problems,” Viers said. “Shawn is a leader in developing computer science tools that interpret and integrate massive amounts of information, from Earth imagery to sound recordings, and his research is pushing the envelope on innovation in sustainability and technology. It is really exciting to see this example of artificial intelligence used to benefit wildlife conservation efforts.”
Future work for the team includes trying to identify individual birds and be able to track them over their range.
“If we can overcome some of the modeling challenges,” Newsam said, “we might be able to replace satellites with much more fine-scaled information about all kinds of wildlife.”

The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry



In the past two decades, the world has made tremendous advances in technology and has affected many aspects of human life. Dental health has also benefited from technological advances. The intelligent toothbrush, virtual reality, laser technology, and 3D printing have fundamentally changed the dentistry landscape.
The next big topic in dentistry will be the use of artificial intelligence in diagnostics and treatment.
How is AI Currently Being Used in Dentistry?
In dentistry, AI is used for a wide variety of applications. For example, it is used in voice commands such as DEXvoice.
DEXvoice, created by Simplifeye and DEXIS is the “Alexa” for the dentist. DEXvoice is able to pull up things like x-rays, patient records and charts. The DEXvoice solution creates a “hands-free” approach and can ultimately speed up the work of a dentist, as the technician or assistant does not have to constantly try to find documents, x-rays and diagrams on the computer. It also makes the work area cleaner and safer as there is no need to put on and take off gloves to use the computer.
Anyone who has been treated for tooth decay by the dentist knows how painful the process can be. Isn’t it great if artificial intelligence can help make the treatment fast and less painful?
Interpreting X-rays
Interpreting X-rays and properly planning treatment are some of the most important skills a dentist must master. Still, they remain some of the most difficult skills to develop, especially because much of the images are not clearly visible with the naked eye. At the moment, AI is helping with caries detection.
ParallelDots, an AI company, launched a cloud-based AI application to detect cavities on dental x-rays. They named this new clinical device Dentistry.AI. The device contains thousands of X-ray images that serve as a data set.
The AI ​​algorithm is trained to recognize patterns from this large amount of data. Another Industry 4.0 technology, blockchain, guarantees this data’s immediacy and validity to all the system participants.
AI enables better identification of tooth decay by analyzing bone density.
The correct interpretation of X-ray and 3D images requires a lot of experience, and the AI ​​assistant makes work a lot easier, as millions of images have already been evaluated. The artificial intelligence algorithm, trained with thousands of X-ray images, achieves a high degree of accuracy in predicting tooth decay.
The AI ​​has also brought us a smart assistant – the ChairFill program developed by MMG Fusion – that can help optimize dental practices schedule by contacting patients to coordinate treatments that have not yet been completed.
On the one hand, it is about finding out which types of patients dentists need at what times to fill the calendars as best as possible, on the other hand, it is about contacting and coordinating these patients.
The program works like an intelligent assistant. It can also be connected to the marketing system to start new patient marketing campaigns. Profit maximization strategies and algorithms are examined to determine which campaign is running and who it is aimed at.
Is Artificial Intelligence Already an Ally for Dental Health Care?
While these advances in dental care provide an outlook on what may be possible in the future in this area, some experts in the field such as Dr. Sunali S. Khanna and Prita A. Dhaimade, members of the National Academy of Medical Sciences in India, noted that advances still have many drawbacks and challenges to be overcome. For example, the high initial investment costs.
AI Recognizes Tooth Decay Better than Humans
Jaroslav Bláha reported that a group of dentists found only about 50 percent of caries cases in X-rays than AI. He was also able to show that AI is better able than humans to detect orthodontic landmarks on X-rays.
In some cases, AI systems already outperform humans. And even if the quality of AI were only as good as humans, its speed is already significantly higher today. By saving time and the associated cost reduction alone, AI systems will play an increasingly important role in dentistry in the future.
AI-Assisted Dentists
In addition to acquiring factual knowledge about diseases, a strong focus should be placed on the use of AI systems to support decision-making in dentistry. The aim should be to train the next generation of dentists to learn the basics of how decision support systems work in order to be able to understand their decisions and, if medically indicated, to counter them.
Looking Into the Future
The use of AI in dentistry has the potential to introduce solutions with personalized diagnostics more quickly. It will improve communication between doctors and patients and allow for an accurate analysis of patient tests.
The AI ​​platform offers much more suitable alternatives for diagnosing patients. While the existing orthodontic CAD is performed manually by an operator according to the orthodontist’s instructions and may involve human error, the AI-based analysis will have an accurate setup with a precise diagnosis and prognosis before and after orthodontic treatment.
Personally, I hope that with the advent of artificial intelligence in dental health, visits to the dentist will in some ways, become more pain-free and stress-free.
I myself am the son of a dentist and already have experience with painful orthodontic treatment that lasted a total of 3 years. I know that dental visits that go wrong can have lasting psychological effects for many patients, children, and adults alike.
But it’s also exciting to think about the positive results that artificial intelligence and dentistry may have for dental health care in the future.
Conclusion
While AI systems are becoming more and more involved in people’s everyday lives and represent a meaningful and homogeneous addition to life, some challenges are associated with them.
People are afraid of change – including artificial intelligence. In this context, it is, therefore, essential that users always know why a particular decision was made. Understanding the reasons for decisions ensures not only transparency but also increases acceptance.
Another challenge of the future concerns the “distortion” of the data. The artificial intelligence-based on machine learning – can arrive at neutral findings, the output data must also be free of any kind of distortion.
In ethical and legal issues, in particular, we still have a long way to go before we can count on the use of strong artificial intelligence. According to Kreutzer, global agreements are necessary for this – but in view of the geopolitical situation, this seems to be a utopia.

Countries across the world are making efforts to be part of the AI-led digital economy, which is estimated to contribute around $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. India, with its “AI for All” strategy, a vast pool of AI-trained workforce and an emerging startup ecosystem, has a unique opportunity to be a major contributor to AI-driven solutions that can revolutionise healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, education and skilling. AI is the branch of computer science concerned with developing machines that can complete tasks that typically require human intelligence. With the explosion of available data expansion of computing capacity, the world is witnessing rapid advancements in AI, machine learning and deep learning, transforming almost all sectors of the economy. India has a large young population that is skilled and eager to adopt AI. The country has been ranked second on the Stanford AI Vibrancy Index primarily on account of its large AI-trained workforce. Our leading technology institutes like the IITs, IIITs and NITs have the potential to be the cradle of AI researchers and startups. India’s startups are innovating and developing solutions with AI across education, health, financial services and other domains to solve societal problems. Machine Learning-based deep-learning algorithms in AI can give insights to healthcare providers in predicting future events for patients. It can also aid in the early detection and prevention of diseases by capturing the vitals of patients. A Bengaluru based start-up has developed a non-invasive, AI-enabled technology to screen for early signs of breast cancer. Similarly, hospitals in Tamil Nadu are using Machine Learning algorithms to detect diabetic retinopathy and help address the challenge of shortage of eye doctors. For the COVID-19 response, an AI-enabled Chatbot was used by MyGov for ensuring communications. Similarly, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) deployed the Watson Assistant on its portal to respond to specific queries of frontline staff and data entry operators from various testing and diagnostic facilities across the country on COVID-19. AI-based applications have helped biopharmaceutical companies to significantly shorten the preclinical drug identification and design process from several years to a few days or months. This intervention has been used by pharmaceutical companies to identify possible pharmaceutical therapies to help combat the spread of COVID19 by repurposing drugs. Opinion | An AI future set to take over post-Covid world AI-based solutions on water management, crop insurance and pest control are also being developed. Technologies like image recognition, drones, and automated intelligent monitoring of irrigation systems can help farmers kill weeds more effectively, harvest better crops and ensure higher yields. Voice-based products with strong vernacular language support can help make accurate information more accessible to farmers. A pilot project taken up in three districts — Bhopal, Rajkot and Nanded — has developed an AI-based decision support platform combined with weather sensing technology to give farm level advisories about weather forecasts and soil moisture information to help farmers make decisions regarding water and crop management. ICRISAT has developed an AI-power sowing app, which utilises weather models and data on local crop yield and rainfall to more accurately predict and advise local farmers on when they should plant their seeds. This has led to an increase in yield from 10 to 30 per cent for farmers. AI-based systems can also help is establishing partnerships with financial institutions with a strong rural presence to provide farmers with access to credit. An AI-based flood forecasting model that has been implemented in Bihar is now being expanded to cover the whole of India to ensure that around 200 million people across 2,50,000 square kilometres get alerts and warnings 48 hours earlier about impending floods. These alerts are given in nine languages and are localised to specific areas and villages with adequate use of infographics and maps to ensure that it reaches all. The Central Board of Secondary Education has integrated AI in the school curriculum to ensure that students passing out have the basic knowledge and skills of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had launched a “Responsible AI for Youth” programme this year in April, wherein more than 11,000 students from government schools completed the basic course in AI. As AI works for digital inclusion in India, it will have a ripple effect on economic growth and prosperity. Analysts predict that AI can help add up to $957 billion to the Indian economy by 2035. The opportunity for AI in India is colossal, as is the scope for its implementation. By 2025, data and AI can add over $500 billion and almost 20 million jobs to the Indian economy. Opinion | Automation and AI in a changing business landscape India’s “AI for All” strategy focuses on responsible AI, building AI solutions at scale with an intent to make India the AI garage of the world — a trusted nation to which the world can outsource AI-related work. AI solutions built in India will serve the world. AI derives strength from data. To this end, the government is in the process of putting in place a strong legal framework governing the data of Indians. The legislation stems from a desire to become a highly secure and ethical AI powerhouse. India wants to build a data-rich and a data-driven society as data, through AI, which offers limitless opportunities to improve society, empower individuals and increase the ease of doing business. The RAISE 2020 summit has brought together global experts to create a roadmap for responsible AI — an action plan that can help create replicable models with a strong foundation of ethics built-in. With the participation of more than 72,000 people from 145 countries, RAISE 2020 has become the true global platform for the exchange of ideas and thoughts for creating a robust AI roadmap for the world.

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not limited to businesses, but economies have also turned their focus on building up their AI capabilities as a means to augment growth. Developed economies like the US, China and EU countries are already in the race. Now, India too is set to join them. In the last couple of years, the Government of India established a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence and mandated the NITI Aayog to prepare a National strategy on AI with a view to leverage AI for inclusive growth. However, AI adoption remained at a nascent stage in India. India's first Artificial Intelligence summit, Responsible AI for Social Empowerment (RAISE) 2020 has turned the possibility of AI adoption into an imminent reality.Amidst the accelerated adoption of AI-based technologies, India seems to stand at the precipice of the fourth industrial revolution. The competitive advantage of low-cost labour may fade away in the near future as economies begin to reap the benefits of AI in the form of increased productivity and cost advantages, and become more profitable than labour. Hence, it would be a timely move for India to build its AI capabilities, lest the global digital divide widens even more and we are left behind.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeNew and Permanent Teeth in 24 Hours - Life Changing!G4 By GolpaLearn MoreThe report titled “Rewire for Growth” by Accenture estimates that AI has the potential to add $957 billion to India’s economy in 2035. As the post-Covid economy begins to rebuild itself, AI will present an opportunity to leapfrog by opening up newer sources of value and growth, beyond the physical limitations of capital and labour. However, AI elicits excitement and apprehension in equal measures. As much as AI and machine learning (ML) hold immense possibilities for the future of economy, there are a number of issues and apprehensions surrounding it, and one of them is job displacement and by extension, unequal growth.The skill-biased technological changes in the past have been assumed to be the cause for rising wage inequality. Contrary to this assumption, technological advancements have proven to be beneficial for everyone in the long-run. Since the first industrial revolution and up to the advancement in the information technology now, the world has only stood to gain more. AI is only one of the many phenomena that have disrupted economies and the way we work. according to experts, AI, like any other new technology in the past, will create more jobs than it destroys. Since we look at employment from the narrow confines of existing jobs, it limits our understanding of the extent of impact that AI can have in generating employment.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 0.70%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Thus, government interventions as well as private sector innovations will be instrumental in steering AI to create equitable growth. While there are positive cascading effects to realise in the future, the past technological changes show that newer technologies are often accessible only to the wealthy. The past couple of decades have also showed that innovation can democratise the access of such newer technologies. The mobile phone and the internet are two examples of such technological advancements whose cost went down enough to reach the larger population. The continued innovation by businesses made it possible to lower the cost of these entities that were once considered a luxury, and India was able to usher a digital revolution.Nevertheless, initial adoption of a technology has its sets of challenges, and more so for the developing economies. The limited access to the select few can widen the income inequality, and the transformation phase of adoption is likely to replace some jobs before it generates them. In a developing economy like India that has an overflowing labour market coupled with unemployment, the transition could become particularly difficult. While historically, newer technologies have proven to be beneficial in the long-run, the short-term losses cannot be justified. The onus however lies on the policies rather than the technology. Governments in the past could not anticipate the comprehensive impact of technological revolutions, but the GoI’s focus on responsible AI should allay such fears with respect to governance.AI is one of the many tools that can be used to either bridge the inequalities or create more. To achieve the former, the right policy approach and business practices at the outset are crucial for cushioning the negative externalities. Hence, a collaborative approach is the first step to realise the vision of AI-driven equitable growth. The knowledge gap could become the biggest impediment for designing policies for the futures, and therefore, the government, the industry and the academia are three spheres that need to work synergistically to bridge that knowledge gap. With technologies progressing much faster than they used to in the last century coupled with the pandemic-induced threats to the economy, the policymakers cannot design policies fast enough unless an AI ecosystem is built with the industry and academia as vital partners.The collaborative efforts are the key to accelerate technology diffusion by promoting innovations that democratise the access of new technologies, enhancing research and development in AI that address the issues of data protection, transparency and accountability so that it gains public trust and encourages greater investment. With greater inclusion of stakeholders and greater diversity at each step of building an AI ecosystem, India can look to reap the gains of automation in not only the long-run, but also the short-run.Amit Kapoor is chair, Institute for Competitiveness, India and visiting scholar, Stanford University.

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not limited to businesses, but economies have also turned their focus on building up their AI capabilities as a means to augment growth. Developed economies like the US, China and EU countries are already in the race. Now, India too is set to join them. In the last couple of years, the Government of India established a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence and mandated the NITI Aayog to prepare a National strategy on AI with a view to leverage AI for inclusive growth. However, AI adoption remained at a nascent stage in India.
