Well, is artificial intelligence a job-killer or not? We keep hearing both sides, from projections of doom for many professions that will necessitate things such as universal basic income to help sidelined workers, to projections of countless unfilled jobs needed to build and manage AI-powered enterprises. For a worker losing his or her job to automation, knowing that an AI programming job is being created elsewhere is of little solace.


Perhaps the reality will be somewhere in between. An MIT report released at the end of last year states recent fears about AI leading to mass unemployment are unlikely to be realized. “Instead, we believe that—like all previous labor-saving technologies—AI will enable new industries to emerge, creating more new jobs than are lost to the technology,” the report’s authors, led by Thomas Malone, director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, conclude. “But we see a significant need for governments and other parts of society to help smooth this transition, especially for the individuals whose old jobs are disrupted and who cannot easily find new ones.”

The future of AI and job growth — or losses — may be nuanced, a recent report from BCG and Faethm suggests. “Though these technologies will eliminate some jobs, they will create many others,” the report’s team of authors, led by BCG’s Rainer Strack. “Governments, companies, and individuals all need to understand these shifts when they plan for the future.”

PROMOTED
What needs to be understood? For starters, “the net number of jobs lost or gained is an artificially simple metric to gauge the impact of digitization,” Strack and his co-authors state. “For example, eliminating 10 million jobs and creating 10 million new jobs would appear to have negligible impact. In fact, however, doing so would represent a huge economic disruption for the country—not to mention for the millions of people with their jobs at stake.”

There’s even a paradox in play. Computers tend to perform well in tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming to do, “but they tend to work less effectively in tasks that humans find easy to do,” the report notes. Also, in many areas, technologies “will improve the quality of work that humans do by allowing them to focus on more strategic, value-creating, and personally rewarding tasks.”

In other words, AI can’t take over many of the soft skills essential to businesses growth — initiative, intuition, passion, and ability to sell ideas and concepts. Add that to more technical abilities needed to build and maintain AI and digital environments — and keep them focused on what the business needs. “In many sectors, severe shortages of skilled workers will mean that growth in demand for talent will be unmet,” Strack and his co-authors state. “This is particularly true for computer-related occupations and jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math, since technology is fueling the rise of automation across all industries. This is why the computer and mathematics job family group is likely to suffer by far the greatest worker deficits.”

At the same time, there will also be increasing demand for jobs requiring compassionate human contact, such as health care, social services, and teaching, they add.
Along with the BCG-Faethm’s observations, it should be noted that AI cannot replicate the entrepreneurial skills that will be pulling together technology solutions and platforms to connect to the needs of markets. Humans are the innovators.
What to do? Strack and his team urge people to take charge of their professional development through lifelong learning. “Individuals will have to take greater responsibility for their own professional development, whether that means through upskilling or reskilling,” they state. “Pay attention to sources of information and update skills accordingly, either by searching out high-quality providers of education or by charting your own course amid the vast amount of online-learning offers.”
The BCG-Faethm team also makes the following recommendations from a corporate perspective:


Think strategically in terms of hiring. “A company should regularly assess the current size, composition, and development of its workforce. It should also evaluate future demand on the basis of strategic direction and determine the gaps for certain jobs and specific skills.”
Support upskilling and reskilling. “Given the rapid shifts in skill requirements and the number of entirely new tasks and roles that are emerging, the labor market will be unable to supply sufficient new talent to fill available positions. Companies therefore need to supplement external hiring with internal development initiatives and on-the-job training.”
Create a lifelong learning culture. “Corporate training used to consist of certifications or intermittent training programs, but the digital economy will demand a constant upgrading of skills. Content and skill upgrades should be delivered in a variety of formats so that they can be integrated into the daily routine of every employee, ensuring a nimble and agile workforce.”
Rethink talent recruitment and retention strategies. “Companies may need to shift the recruitment focus from hiring for skill to hiring for will: as some of the skills needed in the future (such as coding computer languages) will most likely be self-taught or come without an explicit certification, HR professionals will need to view candidate criteria with a more open mind and embrace diverse curricula. Companies may also opt to create an employee pool to which people with new skills can be added without yet knowing which field of operations they’d be best suited for.”

A major call centre company has refuted claims that specialist webcams will be fitted to check up on employees while they are working from home. 
According to an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, French company Teleperformance had informed employees that the cameras are connected to an artificial intelligence system that can scan for and detect “infractions” such as looking at their phones or eating. It claims that if workers need to leave their desks, they will need to click on “break mode” in the system and give a reason in order to avoid being reported for a breach.

Policy on mobile telephone use 

The system is called TP Observer, and can be programmed to take photos every time a breach of pre-set rules is detected. This could include an ‘unknown person’ sitting at the desk (facial recognition software knows who should be there), a period where there have been no keystrokes or unauthorised mobile phone usage.
Teleperformance operates in 34 countries and employs around 380,000 people. According to a spokesperson, 85% of the UK workforce (or 8,000 employees) are currently working from home.
The spokesperson said the claims raised by the newspaper were not true, adding: “We absolutely trust [staff] to do their jobs in a professional manner. It is important to reaffirm that regardless of the new technologies, tools and third-party providers that are being used, our work-at-home tools and processes ensure that the processing of our employees data complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable regulations.”  
The webcam would purely be used for collaboration purposes in the UK and South Africa, and “at no time will we be using the tools to spy on our staff”. 
“Use for collaboration purposes means use for meetings and training sessions and for scheduled video calls between team managers and work-at-home employees and voluntary use by our work-at-home staff in team-building activities, to embrace the social aspect of online work, to connect with coworkers, and to promote healthier working environments,” they said. 
“Use for security purposes means use of webcams to ensure that employees who are processing personal and sensitive personal data of customers on behalf of clients maintain an adequate level of security, as well as a clean desk policy, in line with our office environment. Such monitoring will only be carried out on an intermittent or random basis and not over the entire employee shift.  It will always take place with the employee’s knowledge and at no time be used to conduct covert surveillance on our people.”
AdvertisementEnd of ad break in 37 sYou can close Ad in 4 sThe Guardian had reported that around 10,000 staff in the UK were told last week that the cameras and scanning system would be installed next month while they continued to work from home. Teleperformance’s UK clients include NHS Digital, the Student Loans Company and Vodafone.
Last week the TUC called for new legislation to address “huge gaps” in protection for employees in the use of artificial intelligence at work.

Artificial intelligence presents itself in both grand and mundane ways. It accelerates the scientific process, leading most recently to the development of Covid-19 vaccines at record speed. It runs self-driving cars, allowing them to smoothly navigate downtown streets. And it manages our emails and online calendars, improving our productivity and well-being.But A.I.’s potential for transforming human learning and experience also sparks unease and raises fundamental questions. Who should control the creation and use of these tools? Are we comfortable handing a small group of technologists the keys to our social and economic development engine? And what role should philanthropy play in protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring that A.I. benefits the greater good?Controversies over facial recognition, automated decision making, and Covid-19 tracking have shown that realizing A.I.’s potential requires strong buy-in from citizens and governments, based on their trust that the technology is built and used ethically.To explore these challenges, we recently brought together a group of 20 senior philanthropic leaders representing institutions including the Schmidt Family Foundation, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, and the Berggruen Institute at a virtual convening of the World Economic Forum. Our conversation reflected philanthropists’ profound interest in both the positive potential for A.I. and the need to more deeply understand how to harness, steer, and govern these tools to prevent misuse and ensure they are deployed for social good. Those conversations contributed to the launch of a new Global AI Action Alliance — a platform for philanthropic and technology leaders to engage in the development of ethical A.I. practices and tools. They also led to the creation of an action plan that can help pave the path forward for deeper philanthropic participation in the effective, safe, and equitable use of A.I. to address societal need. The plan encompasses four key areas:


ADVERTISEMENT





A commitment to learning. While some foundations are tech-savvy, philanthropy as a field is not at the forefront of digital transformation. But we shouldn’t leave philanthropy’s response to A.I.’s challenges and potential to a handful of foundations focused on technological innovation. A broad swath of philanthropic organizations, regardless of their focus, need to invest in learning about A.I., sharing their perspectives across the field and with grantees, and adapting traditional strategies to incorporate these technologies.We need to be honest about our organizational blind spots and commit to building internal capacity where needed. That means learning from and hiring data scientists and A.I. practitioners. The Rockefeller Foundation has led the way in this area, hiring a chief data officer early on and convening working groups on the design and implementation of responsible A.I.And today, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, which one of us — Vilas Dhar — heads, deepened its own knowledge base by announcing plans to merge with Silicon Valley-based Cloudera Foundation to provide greater A.I. resources and expertise to grantees. Cloudera’s $9 million endowment and $3 million in existing grants, along with its staff and CEO, Claudia Juech, will form a new Data and Society program within the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation.Integration of A.I. into key grant-making areas. Rather than relegating topics involving A.I. and data to the IT team, foundation leaders should consider how these technologies affect their key focus areas. Educational outcomes, for example, can be addressed through A.I. technologies that provide better language translation, increased access to online learning platforms, and interactive teaching tools. A.I. can also play an integral role in addressing issues such as food insecurity. For example, a nonprofit called the Common Market uses A.I. to improve its food supply chains between farmers, growing networks, and food banks across Texas, the Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic.At each stage of the decision making and programming process, philanthropic leaders should be asking, “What is the potential application of A.I., and what are the benefits and risks?”

Investment in safe data sharing. Philanthropic institutions have the advantage of looking across a wide range of organizations in a particular field or region and are well positioned to support the aggregation and sharing of data and technical knowledge. The fact that they rarely do so is a missed opportunity. A.I. tools rely on massive amounts of data to learn and pinpoint patterns on issues such as policing, homelessness, and public health. But for many nonprofits, it is challenging to amass data in meaningful quantities or to securely store and analyze the data they gather, especially since funding for such internal operations is typically scarce.Philanthropic organizations should play a central role in supporting efforts to make data more accessible to grantees through vehicles such as data cooperatives and data trusts. These entities link data held by otherwise separate groups, providing even small nonprofits with robust data and analysis capabilities. Unlike many commercial data-gathering sources, they also address privacy concerns by ensuring that data is held confidentially and applied only for its intended use.The Himalayan Cataract Project, for example, which seeks to cure blindness around the world through simple and inexpensive cataract surgery, is building a shared framework for how patient data is gathered, distributed, and used among ophthalmologic health organizations. This common standard not only gives health workers better insights on how to treat patients who may be served by multiple organizations but also ensures their privacy by imposing strict guidelines on how the data is used.Diversification of voices. The conversation about development, ownership, and use of technology should expand to include philanthropists, activists, policy makers, and business leaders. In recent A.I. gatherings, we’ve brought together social-change activists and business leaders to facilitate discussions between those who understand the problems facing society and those who can build the solutions. Platforms such as data.org, launched by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, are furthering this type of dialogue by highlighting and funding A.I. solutions from around the world on issues such as improving economic well-being and creating safe and sustainable cities.During our roundtable conversation at the World Economic Forum, Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing and board chair of the MacArthur Foundation, observed that “A.I. can help us leapfrog some of the societal challenges we face, but we have to design it to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘good technology’ in and of itself — we have to make it work for us.”

Philanthropy occupies a position of financial privilege, moral responsibility, and public leadership. We must use that position as a platform for collaboration among those inside and outside of our field to build a future in which A.I. works safely and effectively to help solve humanity’s greatest challenges.

Several research groups have recently tried to apply machine learning to large databases of artworks to sort and describe them in a meaningful way. 

First, researchers from Zhejiang University of Technology in Hangzhou, China, compared different neural networks to find out how well they perform at art classification. They used images from WikiArt and other digital collections to train the neural networks to learn what images of a certain art style look like. Then they asked the different neural network models to identify the art style of other images. 


This is quite a tricky task, even for humans. Some art styles are easy to recognize from the way the image is created. Learning which artworks fall under the cubism genre wasn’t a problem for the neural networks. But some genres are quite similar to each other and occurred around the same time. That made it difficult for the programs to learn which is which.

The art classification neural networks also had trouble with tasks that humans wouldn’t find very difficult at all, such as understanding the difference between cityscapes and landscapes. The difference between buildings and nature is obvious to us, but to a computer, they both look like images with similar elements of “outside”. It doesn’t have a way of knowing that the clouds and sky in these images are not the key defining factor of these two categories.  

For human art lovers, learning which style or category a piece of art falls in is a relatively straightforward and objective task. Like the neural networks, we can learn how to do that by looking at a lot of art and finding patterns. But there’s something humans do that computers don’t: we also form opinions about the art and can share in words how looking at it makes us feel. Computers can’t do that yet - or can they?

Artificial intelligence is only as good as its training data, so to be able to teach an AI to form opinions and emotional statements about art, you need a vast collection of human-created descriptions of different artworks. That’s exactly what researchers from Stanford University, Ecole Polytechnique and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology have done. They created the ArtEmis dataset which includes over 400 thousand emotional attributes and descriptions for over 80 thousand images indexed in WikiArt.

To create ArtEmis, the team asked volunteers to share their main emotion about an artwork, and to explain that in a sentence. As you would expect, people’s reactions varied widely. One person might find a painting of a field peaceful while someone else finds it slightly ominous. In fact, having both positive and negative reactions to the same painting was so common, this happened to 61% of the images in the ArtEmis database.

So what does an AI make of all those human descriptions of art? When trained on the ArtEmis dataset, different systems started creating their own captions for given artworks. Some of them were very convincing, but others missed the mark. AI-generated descriptions of Rembrandt’s painting “The Beheading of John the Baptist” included “the woman looks like she is having a good time” and “the man in the middle looks like he is in pain”. Any human would recognize these descriptions as complete nonsense (or at the very least a major understatement) considering the scene in the painting.An AI algorithm creating descriptions of images based on replicating human emotion said of ... [+] Rembrant's ""The Beheading of John the Baptist"" that “the woman looks like she is having a good time” and “the man in the middle looks like he is in pain”.WikiArt / public domain
About half of the computer-generated descriptions passed the Turing test, which means that AI’s can indeed learn to create new (and believable) descriptions of art, but it’s still far from perfect. That’s not surprising, considering it’s already a challenge to teach an AI whether a painting is a landscape or a cityscape. 
Art can be hard to classify and people’s opinions about paintings are highly subjective, which makes it even harder for artificial intelligence to understand the patterns of our classifications and descriptions. But the experiments done in these two new studies show that computers are getting better at these tasks. Humans are still better at categorising and describing art, but AI programs are learning quickly.

The way AI is advancing, we should prepare ourselves for the future where we will coexist with machines that will imitate human behavior and perception. While the work for such a future is already a reality, this disruptive technology won't just be able to capture the human element by the virtue of automation and decision-making but will also be able to emote like humans and read emotions accurately. That's the road to emotional AI or emotional artificial intelligence. .The process of building a layer of EQ or emotional quotient on top of artificial intelligence is called affective computing. How does this work? For an AI program to demonstrate emotions (to become an emotional AI program), it needs to see emotions, hear our voices, and feel our anxiety. For this, emotional AI must be able to extract emotional data from humans through conversational means by eye-tracking, skin response, voice, and written word analysis, brain activity via EEG, facial mapping, etc. .This technology can be used for hiring talent, sports personality traits analysis, advertising, marketing, event planning, predicting purchase behavior, finding a companion, security, amongst many others. Here is a list of the top 15 global emotional AI companies that are creating a global disruption. .Promobot + Neurodata Lab.Promobot is an autonomous service robot for business and is designed to work in places that have an increased concentration of people, and helps people with navigation as it autonomously moves, communicates, and answers any questions. The company in collaboration with Neurodata Lab, an Emotion AI hub is enabling the robot to better understand and interpret human emotions, and engage in human-like conversations and interactions..Promobot shows promotional materials and remembers everyone it has communication with. Promobot is programmed to work as an administrator, museum guide, promoter, and host. Promobot can operate in crowded places like cinemas, convention centers, exhibition halls, museums, shopping malls, business centers. Promobot's increased applications can boost the quality of service, financial performance, and customer loyalty of companies where these robots operate. .Emotibot.Founded in 2015, by Mr.Kenny Chien and two angel investors, Emoitbot brings the unlimited potential of AI technology to achieve higher business values. Emoitbot is the only artificial intelligence company with image, language multimodal emotion recognition technology, and voice triple human-computer interaction technology. Emotibot aims to build an Artificial Intelligence companion that can read, see, listen, remember, self-learn, and understands the user's emotion to understand the affective states, emotions, and intentions of the speaker.

The platform supports fast access to mobile phones, websites, App, intelligent devices with an aim to closely connect people with the world..Affectiva.Affectiva is an emotion measurement technology company incepted and developed at MIT's Media Lab to recognize human emotions based on facial cues or physiological responses. This emotion recognition technology is used to commercially help brands improve their marketing messages and advertising targets. Affectiva partnered with Millward Brown, in 2011 for political polling estimates. The company's technology enables software applications to use a webcam in order to track a user's smirks, furrows, smile, and frowns to measure the levels of surprise, confusion, and amusement. Affectiva's technology allows a person's heart rate to be measured from a webcam without the need of the user to wear a sensor. This is accomplished by tracking the color changes in the person's face, which pulses each time the heartbeats..Affectiva's Affdex technology can be used to train a webcam on users while they are watching ads, to track their furrows, smirks, smiles, and frowns to measure their levels of surprise, amusement, or confusion throughout a commercial. This helps for a comparison with other viewers across different demographics.

(This article is part of a series on Artificial Intelligence for Board Members and Senior Executives.)


Elon Musk has famously said, ""AI is far more dangerous than nukes."" His statement has some truth to it, and it has succeeded in raising our awareness of the dangers of AI.

As leaders, part of our job is to ensure that what our companies do is safe. We don't want to harm our business partners, employees, customers, or anyone else we are working with. We can manage AI to reduce risk even before regulatory bodies step in to force us to do so.

Most industries have regulations to govern how we manage risks to ensure safety. However, in the world of AI, there are very few regulations applying to AI as it relates to safety. We have regulations around privacy, and those are extremely important to the AI world, but very few regulations around safety.

PROMOTED
AI has the potential to be dangerous. As a result, we need to create ways to manage the risk presented by AI-based systems. Singapore has provided us with a Model AI Governance Framework. This framework is an excellent place to start understanding the key issues for governing AI and managing risk.
The two main factors in this framework consist of:
● The level of human involvement in AI

The first main factor: the level of human involvement
At times, AI will work alone, and many times, AI will work closely with humans in making decisions. Let’s look at three ways this can manifest itself.

Human-out-of-the-loop: This AI runs on its own, without human oversight. The AI system has full control, and the human cannot override the AI's decision.
An example of AI where we are comfortable with the human-out-of-the-loop is for most recommendation engines, such as what song to listen to next or what piece of clothing to look at next on an e-commerce website.
Human-in-the-loop: This AI runs only to provide suggestions to the human. Nothing can happen without a human command to proceed with a suggestion.
An example of AI where we really want a human-in-the-loop is medical diagnostics and treatment. We still want the physician to make the final decision.
Human-over-the-loop: This AI is designed to let the human intercede if the human disagrees or determines the AI has failed. If the human isn't paying attention, though, the AI will proceed without human intervention.
An example of where we want a human-over-the-loop system might be AI-based traffic prediction systems. Most of the time, the AI will suggest the shortest route to the next destination, but humans can override that decision whenever they want to be involved.

The second main factor: the potential harm caused by AI. 
In thinking about managing risk, we need to ask about the severity of harm and the probability of harm. Let's use a matrix to look at how this could work.Should a human be in the loop?Glenn Gow
Quadrant 1: Human-over-the-loop
Probability of harm is low; Severity of harm is high
Example: you have important corporate data, but that data is not only protected behind strong firewalls, but it is encrypted as well. It’s unlikely that hackers can both penetrate your firewalls and decipher the encrypted data as well. However, if they do, the severity of that attack is high.
You will want a human-over-the-loop approach where your AI-based cybersecurity solution handles these types of attacks quite well. In certain circumstances, like discovering a particularly insidious brand-new attack, you will want humans to keep a close eye on what is happening. (See If Microsoft Can Be Hacked, What About Your Company? How AI is Transforming Cybersecurity.)
Quadrant 2: Human-in-the-loop
Probability of harm is high; Severity of harm is high
Example: your corporate development team uses AI to identify potential acquisition targets for the company. Also, they use AI to conduct financial due diligence on the various targets. Both the probability and severity of harm are high in this decision.
AI can be extremely helpful in identifying opportunities humans can't see. Also, AI can provide excellent predictive models of how a potential acquisition will work out. You will want a human-in-the-loop for this type of decision. AI is useful for augmenting the decision, not making it.
Quadrant 3: Human-out-of-the-loop 
Probability of harm is high; Severity of harm is low
Example: any recommendation engine that helps consumers make product-buying decisions. Many e-commerce sites will help a consumer find the products they are most likely to buy. Also, companies like Spotify will recommend what songs you might want to hear next.
For recommendation engines, the probability of harm is quite low, and the severity of looking at a shoe you don't like or listening to a song you don't like is also low. Humans are not needed.
Quadrant 4: Human-over-the-loop 
Probability of harm is high; Severity of harm is low
Example: some AI systems can help with compliance audits. The probability of harm is high because the systems may not yet be perfect. Yet, the severity of harm is low because the company may be allowed to correct the non-compliance or suffer a small fine as a result.
Some compliance audits are more important than others. A human can decide where they should be involved depending on how important that particular compliance issue is to the company.
The Modern AI Governance Framework gives boards and management a starting place to manage risk with AI projects. While many other factors determine the best risk-management approach, this framework has the advantage of being very easy for the non-AI executive to help drive the best risk management approach for the company.
AI could be dangerous, but managing when and how humans will be in control enables us to reduce our company's risk factors greatly.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, and how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, I encourage you to stay tuned.

At least with AI, the intelligence behind the screen would still be there..Artificial intelligence is transforming education, but it remains an open question whether AI can replace live, in-person instructors entirely..The Digital Classroom.Already, classrooms are moving toward a digital future. Many companies provide software platforms that let a single instructor oversee massive numbers of students, managing their learning remotely with the help of digitized lessons and grading software. Some schools use AI to analyze and identify their students' strengths and weaknesses in order to tailor the curriculum to their needs. So-called &quot;adaptive assessment&quot; programs can make homework questions easier or harder depending on individual students' success. In such software, the program uses student performance to develop what is essentially a personalized curriculum. In that sense, this type of machine-based learning can be compared to artificial intelligence engaging students in real learning. .However, there are problems that have emerged in the digital classroom. Some studies have found that students do not engage as completely with digital learning and AI instruction as they do with real-world instruction. As a result, their performance doesn't always measure up. .So why do students treat digitized learning differently?.Where AI Doesn't Measure Up.One of the most important differences between in-person and AI learning is that an AI instructor isn't a real human being. Evolution has honed the human mind to respond to other humans, but when the instructor is just text on a screen—or we know it isn't human—we don't empathize with it the same way, or develop the same sense of engagement. Similarly, it's difficult to imagine a computer caring about us the same way a real instructor might empathize with us and care about us. All told, this make it difficult for students to engage with a machine with the same level of involvement as a human..Some argue, too, that robots aren't able to inspire students the same way that a real person might. For example, in a classroom, a student might ask a challenging question that inspires the instructor to make cross-connections, go off in a unique direction, or discuss the topic in ways that are unexpected. A machine, however, can't go off on a tangent or connect to other areas of learning and will instead answer the question in a rote way, providing information but not inspiration..In the end, learning isn't just about delivering facts and information. It's about creating meaning. While machines can teach skills effectively, they have yet to develop an ability to create meaning. A machine can gather data about students, but it can't yet understand a student holistically in order to appeal to that student, understand the student's needs, and show how learning can be meaningful to them..Where AI Is Going Next.So, while AI isn't going to completely replace the role of the educator anytime soon, it is going to change how educators work with students—and it might well threaten the job of teaching assistants. AI might not be able to empathize with the students, but it sure can process data and push through grades and evaluations, and computer analytics. We already use computers to mechanically grade multiple-choice quizzes, and services like Turnitin evaluate papers to search for signs of plagiarism. Even gradebooks are now digitized, calculating final grades from data inputted during the term. .In the coming years, AI will continue to take over the routine tasks of teaching. Already, some instructors have developed AI interfaces that can handle routine student inquiries, freeing instructors to focus their limited time on complex or unique student queries. In Japan and South Korea, artificial intelligence-powered robots are used in language instruction, giving students the opportunity to practice their language skills by engaging AI in chats..Many believe that the future of AI in the classroom is as an enhanced digital assistant, proctoring tests, handling routine inquiries, providing data and supporting information, and tailoring assignments in response to student needs. But a real person will still need to be there to watch over it all..However, as more homework is graded by machine, more students will make use of professional online academic writing services in order to get help with their papers and essays written by someone from scratch. An expert team of legitimate essay writers from Write My Paper Hub services will write papers for students, and more college students will feel free to use and pay them online to get ahead. After all, if no human actually reads assignments, does it matter who wrote them or what they say? As long as the machine grades it well, isn't that enough? This is one ethical issue that AI can't solve on its own..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
