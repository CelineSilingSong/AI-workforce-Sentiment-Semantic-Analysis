Notably, the pandemic is expected to significantly accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Have you read?5 charts showing the jobs of a post-pandemic future – and the skills you need to get themWhat you need to know about education, skills and life-long learningHow artificial intelligence is redefining the role of managerThis is because the coronavirus crisis forced people to stay at home and minimize contact to contain the spread of infection. As a result, contactless technology will become even more widespread in society.The technologies that will disseminate fastest are in digital transformation (DX), including online conferencing, virtual reality and augmented reality (VR and AR), robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones and automated driving. It was the Fourth Industrial Revolution that supported the rapid development of all these technologies.So, what are the consequences of this acceleration the Fourth Industrial Revolution caused by the coronavirus crisis? Massive unemployment will occur because the technologies of robotics, AI, drones and automated driving that are proliferating in society in response to the crisis. This revolution will take jobs away from many workers in a variety of occupations.Those who are engaged in simple manual work that can be replaced by technologies such as robots, drones, and automated driving will lose their jobs. However, these people can probably get new jobs by learning slightly more advanced skills in manual labour, even if their jobs are eliminated.A more serious unemployment issue created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the prospect of many workers previously engaged in the knowledge economy losing their jobs to rapidly developing AI.Notably, many of those to be thrown out of work are people engaged in jobs that depend on the application of professional knowledge and judgement based on logical thinking – two skills in which AI has an overwhelming advantage. Lawyers, accountants, doctors, pharmacists, and other professions are no exception.There’s widespread belief that robots will take the jobs of humans. Image: Mckinsey & CompanySo what kind of abilities should we develop in the coming years, given the rapid progress of the Fourth Industrial Revolution? And what abilities should nations and businesses focus on in their human resource development?While a broad range of discussions have taken place at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, and the Global Agenda Council, many experts are in agreement over the three advanced abilities that cannot be substituted by AI: hospitality, management and creativity.In reality, however, rapidly developing AI technologies are going to replace these three abilities at rudimentary levels. Therefore, we need to acquire and refine more sophisticated abilities in these areas so they cannot be replaced by AI.With regards to hospitality, AI can easily take over standardized services based on verbal communication, such as reception and information services. For this reason, humans will need to acquire more advanced hospitality skills.First is the ability to undertake non-verbal communication. In other words, we need to improve our ability to listen to the silent voice of customers, to grasp what they are feeling and communicate warm feelings that transcend words. Second is the ability to show deep empathy to customers. This is the most important ability that enables us to exercise our non-verbal communication skills at the highest level. Needless to say, these two skills can never be replaced by AI.Secondly, with regards to management, AI is set to replace workers in tasks such as financial management, materials management, human resource management and project management, areas in which AI’s abilities are expected to exceed those of humans in the future. This will direct people towards more advanced management tasks that cannot be replaced by AI. The following two abilities play a key role in this area.First is the ability to undertake growth management. This is the ability to support organization members to develop their skills and grow professionally, and this is founded on coaching ability.Second is the ability to employ mind management. This is the ability to support the recovery of organization members in distress when they suffer from issues arising from interpersonal relationships or other problems, and it is founded on counselling skills. Both of these skills, which can never be replaced by AI, will be extremely important for managers and leaders in the workplace in the forthcoming Advanced Knowledge Society.Regarding creativity, AI will never be able to substitute genius: comprising skills such as the invention of innovative technology and the proposition of novel designs. Such abilities are, however, out of reach for most individuals. So what constitutes creativity, which everyone can demonstrate in the age of AI? First is the ability to perform collective intelligence management. This is the ability of leaders to manage organization members by putting them together, encouraging them to share their knowledge and wisdom, and facilitating the emergence of new knowledge and wisdom arising from that process. The vital elements that enable the demonstration of this skill are the ability to express a vision that excites members of your organization; and the ability to undertake ego management, creating a forum where members can transcend the individual and cooperate with one another. Second is the ability to realize new ideas in an organization. This is the ability to go beyond simply proposing new ideas, to attractively explain the idea, skillfully persuade the boss, and move the organization forward smoothly to implement the idea.In fact, the creativity that is truly required in a corporate organization involves much more than the ability to propose new ideas. It also requires the two other abilities that can never be replaced by AI: the ability to perform collective intelligence management and the ability of realizing new ideas in an organization.DiscoverWhat is the World Economic Forum doing about the Fourth Industrial Revolution? Show moreThe World Economic Forum was the first to draw the world’s attention to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the current period of unprecedented change driven by rapid technological advances. Policies, norms and regulations have not been able to keep up with the pace of innovation, creating a growing need to fill this gap.The Forum established the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network in 2017 to ensure that new and emerging technologies will help—not harm—humanity in the future. Headquartered in San Francisco, the network launched centres in China, India and Japan in 2018 and is rapidly establishing locally-run Affiliate Centres in many countries around the world.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesThe global network is working closely with partners from government, business, academia and civil society to co-design and pilot agile frameworks for governing new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, blockchain, data policy, digital trade, drones, internet of things (IoT), precision medicine and environmental innovations.Learn more about the groundbreaking work that the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network is doing to prepare us for the future.Want to help us shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution? Contact us to find out how you can become a member or partner.This profound crisis and fast-paced revolution are expected to result in the elimination of many jobs in the coming years, and highly skilled professionals are not immune from this predicament.Unless both nations and businesses extend full support to their citizens and employees to acquire these six abilities, we will not be able to move past the upcoming era of massive unemployment.

Enterprises seeing real success with artificial intelligence have something in common: they are capable of learning quickly from their successes or failures and re-applying those lessons into the mainstream of their businesses.


Of course, there’s nothing new about the ability to rinse, learn and repeat, which has been a fundamental tenet of business success for ages. But because AI is all about real-time, nanosecond responsiveness to a range of things, from machines to markets, the ability to leap and learn at a blinding pace has taken on a new urgency.

At this moment, only 10% of companies are seeing financial benefits from their AI initiatives, a survey of 3,000 executives conducted by Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management Review finds. There is a lot of AI going around: more than half, 57%, piloting or deploying AI — up from 46% in 2017. In addition, at least 70% understand the business value proposition of AI. But financial results have been elusive.

PROMOTED
So, what are the enlightened 10% doing to finally realize actual, tangible gains from AI? They do all the right things, of course, but there’s an extra piece of the magic thrown in. For instance, scaling AI — seen as the path to enterprise adoption — has only limited value by itself. “Adding the ability to embed AI into processes and solutions improves the likelihood of significant benefits dramatically, but only to 39%,” the survey shows.

Successful AI adopters have figured out how to learn from their AI experiences and apply them in forward-looking ways to their businesses, the survey report’s authors, led by Sam Ransbotham, conclude. “Our survey analysis demonstrates that leaders share one outstanding feature — they intend to become more adept learners with AI.” This ability to learn and understand the potential and pitfalls of AI enable them to “sense and respond quickly and appropriately to changing conditions, such as a new competitor or a worldwide pandemic, are more likely to take advantage of those disruptions.”

In other words, they give executives and employees the space they need to better understand, adjust and adapt to AI-driven processes — and figure out their roles in making it all work. Automation is not thrust upon them with no preparation or training. “Realizing significant financial benefits with AI requires far more than a foundation in data, infrastructure, and talent,” the researchers state. “Even embedding AI in business processes is not enough.”

Those organizations that lead the way with AI success pursue the following strategies:
They facilitate systematic and continuous learning between humans and machines. “Organizational learning with AI isn’t just machines learning autonomously. Or humans teaching machines. Or machines teaching humans,” Ransbotham and his co-authors state. “It’s all three. Organizations that enable humans and machines to continuously learn from each other with all three methods are five times more likely to realize significant financial benefits than organizations that learn with a single method.”
They develop multiple ways for humans and machines to interact. “Deploying the appropriate interaction modes in the appropriate context is critical,” the co-authors state. “For example, some situations may require an AI system to make a recommendation and humans to decide whether to implement it. Some context-rich environments may require humans to generate solutions and AI to evaluate the quality of those solutions.”
They change to learn, and learn to change. Successful initiatives “don’t just change processes to use AI; they change processes in response to what they learn with AI.”
AI has great potential to expand our visions of where and how businesses can deliver greater service in the months and years ahead. But it requires more than simply installing new systems and processes and waiting to see the results. It’s a continuous process of improvement and innovation,

 How Artificial Intelligence helps Huawei build green data centres



Mark Bowen | 23 October, 2020









Huawei tells Intelligent CIO how and why it is using Artificial Intelligence in data centres to promote green tech adoption, reduce repetitive work, monitor and manage fragmented resources which might otherwise easily be overlooked.
Data centres are being overhauled, revamped and modernised to support Digital Transformation and the power-hungry cloud deployments they contain.
Artificial Intelligence is a key part of this overhaul as energy conservation – to address both cost and environmental concerns – becomes a top consideration for data centres. AI solutions are being deployed in the push to get data centres to become more energy efficient as well as safer and more reliable.
The growth in data traffic volumes shows no sign of letting up, nor does the global demand for high-performance computing. This comes with an increase in high-density servers, the use of graphics processing units and specialised AI processing chips and all of these generate significantly more heat than traditional CPUs. It leads data centres then to require even more power to dissipate the heat they generate. It’s no surprise then that heat dissipation and energy management have become a vital topic for the data centre industry.
A data centre’s power usage effectiveness or PUE, is seen as a key indicator for evaluating its energy efficiency. The PUE value rises as the data centre becomes less efficient. Huawei’s cloud data centre in Ulanqab, for example, achieves an annual PUE as low as 1.15, and is seen as a good example of how green data centres should be built.
Huawei has leveraged Machine Learning to develop its iCooling intelligent thermal management solution for data centre infrastructure and address the energy consumption issue. The iCooling system incorporates Deep Learning to analyse historical data and identify key factors which affect energy consumption and create a PUE prediction. An optimisation algorithm then establishes the ideal parameters which are transmitted to various control systems.
At Huawei’s cloud data centre Langfang in China, the deployment of iCooling has resulted in a PUE that is eight percent lower than it previously was, meaning a big saving in annual power costs. And at a China Mobile data centre in Ningxia the introduction of iCooling technology has reduced the data centre’s total energy consumption by 3.2%, saving more than 400,000 kWh of electricity a year. According to Huawei, as data centre loads increase and AI learning capability improves, six million kWh of electricity will be saved in the data centre every year, the equivalent to a reduction of about three million kilogrammes of carbon dioxide emissions.
While improved power management is a striking example of the value of AI to the data centre industry, Artificial Intelligence is proving hugely valuable in the management of data centres in other ways. It’s used to improve the safety and reliability of data centres.
Prior to the introduction of AI, fault detection would need to be done on a case by case basis, isolating the faulty component. By collecting information from the power supply and distribution systems, AI can predict impending device and component failure, warn operations and maintenance personnel and furnish additional information to assist decision making.
Huawei’s iPower intelligent power supply and distribution technology, for example, can detect and isolate faults and then recover from them at sub-second speeds, improving the reliability of the data centre’s power infrastructure and reducing the risk of fire. iPower also accurately predicts battery life span and health, allowing preventative maintenance before any failure occurs.
Artificial Intelligence can also be used to in the data centre to reduce repetitive work and to monitor and manage fragmented resources which might otherwise easily be overlooked. Huawei’s iManager data centre infrastructure management system uses intelligent hardware and IoT sensors to manage power, cooling and space to optimise utilisation, with AI managing the allocation and operation of assets. It’s estimated that iManager increases the resource utilisation rate by 20%. iManager also supports network management, with centralised management for multiple data centres across different locations. As edge data centres increase in popularity, iManager can be used to reduce the need for site visits, thus improving the efficiency of data centre management.
Research from the McKinsey Global Institute finds that AI has the potential to add about US$13 trillion to global economic activity by 2030, and to boost global GDP by 1.2 percent a year. AI is spurring profound and potentially disruptive changes in the world, and data centres are no exception. The use of AI is leading to safer, more reliable, energy efficient and cleaner data centres. And with the data centre industry forecast to grow by as much as 15% over the next five years, according to M Capital Group, this can only be a good thing.

As I settled into my new life, I found myself spending more hours with my laptop than with any other human being.
I felt isolated and incredibly homesick. Chatting online with my family back home, I was often in tears, but they had no idea how I was feeling behind my screen (with the exception of a sad face emoticon that I would send).
I realised then that our technology and devices – which we consider to be “smart"", and helpful in many aspects of our lives – are emotion blind. Technology has a high IQ, but no EQ, no emotional intelligence, and that comes with a cost.
Face-to-face, people share so much emotion and meaning beyond the words they say, through facial expressions, gestures, vocal intonations.

Why is social isolation so hard?
Why social media makes us so angry, and what you can do about it

But online, we’re relegated to texts, emojis, and one-dimensional expressions of how we feel. All of the richness of our communication disappears in cyberspace, making it more difficult to meaningfully and empathetically connect with one another.
That issue is even more pressing now that we’ve all been separated from each other by social distancing. We’re leaning on technology to stay in touch with loved ones, to work and learn remotely, and everything in between. But we all know it doesn’t feel the same. This begs the question: what can we do to preserve our humanity and our emotions in a digital world?
I believe that we can harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to redesign technology to not mask these elements of what makes us human, but emphasise them. I’ve staked my career on this idea, and believe that AI with emotional intelligence – “Emotion AI” – will become ingrained in the fabric of the devices we use every day.

There’s a rapidly evolving market around Emotion AI: software that can detect nuanced human emotions and complex cognitive states from people’s facial and vocal expressions.
As with any new technology, we need to be thoughtful about how Emotion AI is developed, and where it is deployed, given the highly personal and private nature of people’s emotions. But I fundamentally believe that this technology has the power to amplify our empathy, online and offline, if applied mindfully and deliberately.
So, what would an emotionally intelligent digital world look like?
One area I’ve been thinking a lot about recently is online conferences and virtual meetings. Like everyone else, I have spent more than my fair share of hours on Zoom over the past few months while my company, Affectiva, is remote, and many conferences where I was scheduled to speak have shifted to virtual.

When I’m leading a team meeting or presenting a keynote in person, I’m able to take a pulse on how the audience is feeling based on the energy in the room.
I can riff off of signs of interest or excitement if I see people’s faces light up at an idea; or I can change course if I sense that people are becoming bored or zoning out. But presenting online is like being in a vacuum. I have no idea how people are reacting to what I’m saying, or if they’re even paying attention.
If online video platforms were built with Emotion AI, we could restore some of the energy and emotion that’s lost, and make meetings and conferences much more engaging as a result. If participants were willing to turn on their device’s camera, and opted in to using Emotion AI, the technology could decipher people’s emotional expressions and aggregate that data in real time.
Picture an emotion newsfeed or graph that skyrocketed when attendees were excited or smiling, and tapered off when they became bored or disengaged. Not only would that insight help me as a presenter; but also, it could give attendees a sense of the energy in the (virtual) meeting room, helping restore the camaraderie we feel at in-person events or meetings.

The applications of Emotion AI aren’t limited to our work lives, though. Equally, if not more exciting, is its potential to bolster our interpersonal communications, and help us interact with each other more meaningfully. That drove one of the very first applications of Emotion AI that I explored: building an Emotion AI application for autism.
People on the autism spectrum often struggle with recognising and responding to non-verbal communications and emotions. But Emotion AI could be used as a tool to help people learn to navigate challenging social and emotional situations. Picture smart glasses with Emotion AI built in, that could give the wearer insight into the emotions of people they’re interacting with.
Companies are already turning this idea into reality. For example, a company called Brain Power is developing the world’s first augmented smart glass system (powered by Emotion AI) for kids and students on the autism spectrum.
The results are powerful: parents recount stories of being able to connect with their kids on an emotional level that was previously unimaginable, and the impact that has is incredibly moving.Rana el Kaliouby © Remi Carlioz Photography
Another exciting application is in the automotive industry, where Emotion AI can improve road safety. Each year, dangerous driving behaviour (such as drowsy and distracted driving) causes thousands of accidents and fatalities in the UK alone.
Automakers are turning to Emotion AI to address these issues, by developing in-vehicle systems that use Emotion AI to detect signs of distracted or drowsy driving. The idea is that, if a vehicle recognised that its driver was starting to doze off, or was becoming distracted, the system could send an alert to remind the driver to keep their eyes on the road or pull over if the behaviour reaches a dangerous point.
Beyond making our roads safer, Emotion AI could also improve the transportation experience. Automakers are exploring in-cabin sensing systems that can understand the state of the driver, the cabin, and the occupants in it, in order to optimise and personalise the ride.
For example, after a long day at work, your car might be able to sense if you’re tired or stressed. Perhaps it could play soothing music, or recommend stopping for take-out from your favourite restaurant on the way home.

When I think about the future with Emotion AI, I envision a world where the de-facto human-machine interface more closely mirrors the way humans interact: through conversation, perception and empathy.
I believe this technology will be built into the fabric of the devices we use each day, ranging from our phones to our cars, our smart fridges to our smart speakers… in turn, making our lives safer, healthier and more productive; while making our interactions with others more meaningful and empathetic.
Still, we cannot ignore the potential risks of AI. We need to be deliberate in recognising them and mitigating them. Human-centric AI systems – including Emotion AI – deal with data that is highly personal, and we may not (and should not) always be okay with that.
For example, I feel strongly that AI should not be deployed for use cases like security or surveillance, where there is no opportunity for people to opt-in and consent. Beyond considering how AI is deployed, it’s critical for the tech industry to examine how AI is developed.

The risk of bias in AI is a significant concern: if AI is not built with diverse data, and by a diverse team, they will fail to recognise all people, and stand to disenfranchise those they interact with.
It’s up to tech leaders to come together and establish standards for AI ethics, and to advocate for thoughtful regulation. The industry still has a ways to go, but this movement is critical in order to realise the positive potential of this technology.
At the end of the day, we need to put the human before the artificial – both in arming our technology with emotional intelligence and in determining the role it will play in our world.

Humans have been teaming up with machines throughout history to achieve goals, be it by using simple machines to move materials or complex machines to travel in space. But advances in artificial intelligence today bring possibilities for even more sophisticated teamwork — true human-machine teams that cooperate to solve complex problems.
Much of the development of these human-machine teams focuses on the machine, tackling the technology challenges of training AI algorithms to perform their role in a mission effectively. But less focus, MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers say, has been given to the human side of the team. What if the machine works perfectly, but the human is struggling?
""In the area of human-machine teaming, we often think about the technology — for example, how do we monitor it, understand it, make sure it's working right. But teamwork is a two-way street, and these considerations aren't happening both ways. What we're doing is looking at the flip side, where the machine is monitoring and enhancing the other side — the human,"" says Michael Pietrucha, a tactical systems specialist at the laboratory. 
Pietrucha is among a team of laboratory researchers that aims to develop AI systems that can sense when a person's cognitive fatigue is interfering with their performance. The system would then suggest interventions, or even take action in dire scenarios, to help the individual recover or to prevent harm. 
""Throughout history, we see human error leading to mishaps, missed opportunities, and sometimes disastrous consequences,"" says Megan Blackwell, former deputy lead of internally funded biological science and technology research at the laboratory. ""Today, neuromonitoring is becoming more specific and portable. We envision using technology to monitor for fatigue or cognitive overload. Is this person attending to too much? Will they run out of gas, so to speak? If you can monitor the human, you could intervene before something bad happens.""
This vision has its roots in decades-long research at the laboratory in using technology to ""read"" a person's cognitive or emotional state. By collecting biometric data — such as video and audio recordings of a person speaking — and processing these data with advanced AI algorithms, researchers have uncovered biomarkers of various psychological and neurobehavioral conditions. These biomarkers have been used to train models that can accurately estimate the level of a person's depression, for example.
In this work, the team will apply their biomarker research to AI that can analyze an individual's cognitive state, encapsulating how fatigued, stressed, or overloaded a person is feeling. The system will use biomarkers derived from physiological data such as vocal and facial recordings, heart rate, EEG and optical indications of brain activity, and eye movement to gain these insights.
The first step will be to build a cognitive model of an individual. ""The cognitive model will integrate the physiological inputs and monitor the inputs to see how they change as a person performs particular fatiguing tasks,"" says Thomas Quatieri, who leads several neurobehavioral biomarker research efforts at the laboratory. ""Through this process, the system can establish patterns of activity and learn a person's baseline cognitive state involving basic task-related functions needed to avoid injury or undesirable outcomes, such as auditory and visual attention and response time.""
Once this individualized baseline is established, the system can start to recognize deviations from normal and predict if those deviations will lead to mistakes or poor performance.
""Building a model is hard. You know you got it right when it predicts performance,"" says William Streilein, principal staff in the Lincoln Lab's Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division. ""We've done well if the system can identify a deviation, and then actually predict that the deviation is going to interfere with the person's performance on a task. Humans are complex; we compensate naturally to stress or fatigue. What's important is building a system that can predict when that deviation won't be compensated for, and to only intervene then.""
The possibilities for interventions are wide-ranging. On one end of the spectrum are minor adjustments a human can make to restore performance: drink coffee, change the lighting, get fresh air. Other interventions could suggest a shift change or transfer of a task to a machine or other teammate. Another possibility is using transcranial direct current stimulation, a performance-restoring technique that uses electrodes to stimulate parts of the brain and has been show to be more effective than caffeine in countering fatigue, with fewer side effects.
On the other end of the spectrum, the machine might take actions necessary to ensure the survival of the human team member when the human is incapable of doing so. For example, an AI teammate could make the ""ejection decision"" for a fighter pilot who has lost consciousness or the physical ability to eject themselves. Pietrucha, a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force who has had many flight hours as a fighter/attack aviator, sees the promise of such a system that ""goes beyond the mere analysis of flight parameters and includes analysis of the cognitive state of the aircrew, intervening only when the aircrew can't or wont,"" he says. 
Determining the most helpful intervention, and its effectiveness, depends on a number of factors related to the task at hand, dosage of the intervention, and even a user's demographic background. ""There's a lot of work to be done still in understanding the effects of different interventions and validating their safety,"" Streilein says. ""Eventually, we want to introduce personalized cognitive interventions and assess their effectiveness on mission performance.""
Beyond its use in combat aviation, the technology could benefit other demanding or dangerous jobs, such as those related to air traffic control, combat operations, disaster response, or emergency medicine. ""There are scenarios where combat medics are vastly outnumbered, are in taxing situations, and are as every bit as tired as everyone else. Having this kind of over-the-shoulder help, something to help monitor their mental status and fatigue, could help prevent medical errors or even alert others to their level of fatigue,"" Blackwell says.
Today, the team is pursuing sponsorship to help develop the technology further. The coming year will be focused on collecting data to train their algorithms. The first subjects will be intelligence analysts, outfitted with sensors as they play a serious game that simulates the demands of their job. ""Intelligence analysts are often overwhelmed by data and could benefit from this type of system,"" Streilein says. ""The fact that they usually do their job in a 'normal' room environment, on a computer, allows us to easily instrument them to collect physiological data and start training.""
""We'll be working on a basic set of capabilities in the near term,"" Quatieri says, ""but an ultimate goal would be to leverage those capabilities so that, while the system is still individualized, it could be a more turnkey capability that could be deployed widely, similar to how Siri, for example, is universal but adapts quickly to an individual."" In the long view, the team sees the promise of a universal background model that could represent anyone and be adapted for a specific use. 
Such a capability may be key to advancing human-machine teams of the future. As AI progresses to achieve more human-like capabilities, while being immune from the human condition of mental stress, it's possible that humans may present the greatest risk to mission success. An AI teammate may know just how to lift its partner up.

The rise of AI in the workplace has the potential to improve some aspects of work – such as repetitive and dangerous tasks – but much of the public discussion has focused on AI’s potential to displace workers and the grave impacts this could pose to their livelihoods and quality of life.Less discussed – but equally important – is how AI can also be part of the solution to train, upskill, and reskill employees, future-proofing and preparing them for the future of work. Disruption and automationThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2020 found as automation increases, the amount of time spent on tasks at work by humans and machines will be equal in just five years. According to the report, 85 million jobs will be displaced across 26 countries and 15 industries by 2025, and more than 80% of employers expect to make wider use of remote work and to digitize work processes. In other words, even with no further advances of AI, today’s workers will face enormous disruptions as labour markets are transformed by automation tools already on the market.The challenge ahead will be even greater for two reasons: First, COVID-19 has taken an enormous toll on the global economy, leading to an estimated loss of 14% of working hours or approximately 400 million full-time jobs in the second quarter of 2020. Second, far from remaining static, automation technologies are being developed and commercialized at an accelerating pace during the pandemic, and their capacities are expanding as they harness growing quantities of data, computing power, and experience. A positive futureDespite these significant headwinds, AI holds great potential for workers and the future of labour. The Future of Jobs Report found that 97 new million jobs that are adapted to the new division of labour between humans and machines could be created by 2025. Instead of worrying about job displacement, we should get to work creating the new, high-quality jobs of tomorrow while massively expanding our upskilling and reskilling efforts to transition displaced workers into these new opportunities. This is where AI can help solve some of the very problems it helped create. Fortunately, a new cohort of purpose-driven AI innovators has begun mobilizing to ensure that workers around the world share not only in the risks that AI poses but also its powerful benefits. Here are four ways that AI is helping create a just transition to a positive future of work:1. Invest in reskilling and upskillingSome AI start-ups are focused directly on reskilling and upskilling today’s workers, using AI algorithms to create personalized training programmes that build on workers’ existing skillsets to prepare them for future opportunities that leverage technology. For example, California-based EdCast combines a detailed assessment of workers’ skills with data-driven analysis of future labour market needs, allowing users to identify potential future jobs and gain the skills and qualifications they need to secure them.2. Embed learning into everyday activitiesOther innovators are focused on embedding learning into everyday work activities so that workers are continuously growing their skillsets and expanding their capacity to fulfil future workforce needs. For example, Canadian start-up Axonify has pioneered the idea of ‘microlearning’ in which employees spend three to five minutes per shift on learning and performance improvement activities that are matched to their individual needs by an AI algorithm.3. Match workers to new opportunitiesWhile AI-driven reskilling can help prepare workers for the disruptions underway, there is still an enormous need to match workers to new opportunities being created. AI can help here too, and start-ups like SkyHive and Kalido have created AI-driven platforms that connect workers to new opportunities within and outside their current organizations, based on their individual skillsets, career goals, and retraining needs.4. Prepare the next generation of workersAI is not only being used to future-proof today’s workers and match them with tomorrow’s opportunities but also to prepare the next generation of workers for a future disrupted and transformed by technology. Recent years have seen an explosion in AI-powered education technology (EdTech) tools to improve learning outcomes at the K-12 level, primarily in the developed world but increasingly amongst less privileged populations. For example, New Delhi-based start-up ConveGenius has targeted the 100 million students in India with the most limited access to quality teaching, using AI to assess each student’s learning needs and deliver the educational content they need to succeed as workers and citizens. Scores of other start-ups are racing to address this significant business challenge and seize the opportunity to upskill and reskill workers for the future. AI as part of the solution No single technology will solve all the problems facing workers today. Achieving a just transition to a positive future of work will require smart government policies, ambitious corporate programs, and individual action by workers in addition to new technologies. But as we work to improve our responses to the disruptions underway, we should encourage innovators and entrepreneurs to focus on new ways to use AI technologies to empower the workers of today and create exciting new opportunities for the workers of tomorrow.Don't miss any update on Davos AgendaSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Earlier this year, I discussed how IoT and internet access companies are working to better understand how to provide better service in the connected home. This article moves up stream to look at how the cable industry is working to provide better infrastructure support through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). As the current pandemic is showing, many people were not prepared for the change of network demand that moved from offices to home, and the industry is looking at improving services even as demands become more variable and the underlying technology changes.


Internet broadband access has become a required utility. The pandemic has, hopefully, pointed out to elected officials the importance of that critical infrastructure. Chris Bastian, CTO, SCTE•ISBE (The Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers, International Society of Broadband Experts), says that 80% of US households now have access to 1gbs broadband access. Those missing it are primarily rural and in the inner city, so are most at risk of being left behind as the digital divide expands.

As the nation works on expanding high speed access, the cable industry is working to ensure they can meet the needs and provide appropriate service levels. On the pure hardware side, fiber continues to move into the backbone, but is also still a problem in the “last mile”, in the connectivity to homes. That means there are nodes near residences that convert between fiber and coaxial cable. Mr. Bastian points that there are more than 70 types of fiber/coax node enclosures, with some service providers having more than 40 in their systems. Downstream of those nodes are, of course, the wide variety of modems that exist in household and businesses, and the operators must be able to identify and work with those. While SCTE•ISBE is working with industry members to develop a standard fiber/coax node, managers in all industries can all understand that this issue isn’t one that will disappear tomorrow.

PROMOTED
SCTE•ISBE has created a working group to look at multiple aspects of where AI and machine learning (ML) can help diagnose issues to improve routing, preventative maintenance and problem diagnostics. In support of the importance of AI to the industry, the working group includes network operators such as Charter, Comcast, Cox, Rogers and more. Even IBM, Fujitsu, and other non-industry companies have joined in order to both bring their expertise and understand where the cable industry is heading.

An example of some early work on the problem was provided by Elad Nafshi, Senior Vice President, Next Generation Access Networks, Comcast. Prior to the pandemic, the company developed a system called Octave to collect and analyze network information. Mr. Nafshi said they tested the system checks modem usage and can adjust network and modem performance in order to optimize network performance.

Performance adjustments aren’t only based on demand. “Without machine learning, LTE interference on networks is a transient issue that is hard to track, and could be even harder to resolve,” said Elad Nafshi. “In other cases noise can originate in a loose connector in one household and then propagate upstream to impact neighborhood performance. The ability of our Octave platform to quickly identify those issues and have the network adapt in real time based on the automated analytics engine is extremely valuable to ensure that we’re delivering the best performance and maximum possible capacity to customers.”

An interesting comment by Mr. Nafshi was how Comcast is trying to balance in-house code versus calls to AWS tools, as the latter have a direct cost that drives OPEX. The ROI decisions between build versus buy have not left us in the AI age and will remain a challenge for companies of all sizes.

It helps you prepare them for higher duties — all of which can lead to business growth..However, just like in most things in life, employee training needs to be done the right way..The often-methodical and homogenized nature of employee training sessions disrupts your employees' learning pathways..This makes your training ineffective,widening your workplace skills gap and preventing them from fully attaining your desired training outcomes.If that describes your company's state right now, then it's time you level up your personnel's learning rates with an innovative solution: artificial intelligence..See eight ways AI plays a tremendous role in your employee training:.1. Enhances staff training.AI enhances your employee training sessions with unique and innovative learning methods. It can even offer feedback on your workers' areas for improvement..For instance, leverage the AI's machine learning capabilities with speech-to-text. This lets you comment on your staff's presentation in terms of their speaking speed, number of word fillers said, mentioned keywords, and others..You can even use augmented reality for practical ways to develop your staff's soft skills and give immediate feedback on their presentation..Additionally, program bots to pick up on lessons opened up by employees, tag them contextually, and disseminate them to others who previously hinted their interest in the subject..2. Improves learning efficiencies.AI-powered tutors can streamline and increase the efficiency of your staff training and learning processes.&nbsp;.As digital tutors, AI can imitate the interaction between a veteran professional and a beginner.&nbsp;.With its Natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, AI can engage in conversations that sound humanlike and suitable to your staff, relaying pieces of knowledge effectively..The result is that you shorten your employees' learning curves and the duration it takes for them to become experts in your required technical skills, boosting their work performance and helping you reach your business goals sooner..3. Personalizes employees' learning track.Every year since 2014, Donald Taylor, Chair of the Learning and Performance Institute, has asked leadership and development (L&amp;D) professionals through the Leadership and Development Global Sentiments Survey what they think the L&amp;D growth area and trend will be next year..For 2019, one of the respondents' top answers was personalization.&nbsp;.This shows how L&amp;D professionals think a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach isn't going to be as effective anymore in learning as before. After all, each person learns best using their preferred learning styles and methods..Thankfully, AI helps in delivering personalized learning and training sessions.&nbsp;.For instance, AI empowers the educational sector with individualized student behavior profiles, training materials, and teaching methods based on pupils' capacities and experiences..AI can do the same for the L&amp;D category and your employee training..It can better comprehend learning behaviors and forecast needs through its machine learning abilities through content positioning and recommendation based on those past behaviors..That way, employees will receive different training approaches based on their job responsibilities, previous learning styles and experiences, educational background, etc..AI also makes your training sessions more flexible. For instance, it can transcribe video tutorials into narratives for some employees, offer learning videos for others, gamify the lessons, give audio-guided presentations, train in person, and more..AI can even customize training quizzes and assessment measures. Able to evaluate individual capacities and learning progress, AI can tailor the next course content according to the test results..Doing so shortens your employees' learning curve and ensures they effectively absorb the knowledge you're relaying, so they can correctly use it to improve their work performance..4. Boosts completion rate.Completion rates in online training classes are often low. On Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), data shows that fewer than 4% of all their learners finished the entirety of courses in 2017 to 2018..Maximize trained AI and machine learning to give relevant training content in your employees' desired learning formats (such as audio, text, video, etc)..That way, they can more easily retain their interest in the session, digest the lessons, and finish the whole course productively..5. Scales your training content building.Researching, developing, and finding extensive training content consumes much time and effort, especially for dynamic organizations..That is why they often end up getting training materials externally to save more time. These resources, though, are not always perfectly suited to your company's needs..With a properly trained AI system, you can instantly design content or obtain the right resources both internally and online, resulting in interactive, applicable training lessons..For instance, if your employee needs to study how a conveyor belt works, the AI scours the Internet for research papers and other reliable materials. It then displays snippets from the sources for quicker learning..What's more, AI can dig for and extract relevant details and transform them into readable formats appropriate for studying.&nbsp;.With this automated process, the AI does most of the grunt work of course development, so your instructors can devote more time and attention to course design and delivery..6. Increases training accessibility.Developing training courses in ways convenient for your disabled employees takes numerous hours, which is why most content is better designed for the able-bodied staff..AI can provide accessible learning courses and experiences. Through advanced web or app accessibility features, AI adapts to the employees' impairment and enables their functioning senses in learning..Like YouTube, use AI to create and display captions instantly, automate text translation to several foreign languages, and others..Another example is Microsoft's Seeing AI app, which acts as the third pair of visually disabled people's eyes. It describes the scenes, currencies, other persons and their emotions, documents, short texts, colors, and more, wherever their smartphone camera is faced..Through AI, you help your disabled staff catch up with the other employees to develop and upgrade the skills needed for their jobs..7. Provides more objective feedback.AI removes any personal biases involved in various aspects of your employee training processes.&nbsp;.For instance, managers can create course assessments with only easy questions or subject fields they prefer the most..They can also grade and evaluate learners based solely or majorly on their background, personalities, or other limiting factors..Because of this subjective approach, your training and the learning process become ineffective in enhancing your staff's skills, performance, and, eventually, reaching your company goals..AI, however, uses concrete data to create courses and assess learning accurately and objectively..AI collects data, such as your staff's individual learning styles and behaviors, previous knowledge background, and others, and analyzes them pragmatically..It uses these data and insights to recommend the best-suited course content, design, and assessments, leading to more sensible, efficient learning paths..Keep in mind, though, that you should also be impartial when programming your AI and machine learning models and inputting variables and datasets..8. Offers data measuring your training effectiveness.Among AI's chief roles in employee training are the constant monitoring of learning progress, estimating the staff's comprehension of the topic, and tailoring courses to their needs..From the data that the AI system uncovers, you gain critical insights, such as how your employees learn and when they can best retain what was taught to them..AI also guides you in ways to ramp up learning productivity. For example, if you notice more employees having poorer assessment results, course completion rates, etc., AI can collect significant data supporting the reasons behind these conditions..You can acquire data factors such as the average duration for module fulfillment, preferred learning formats, and more.

One of the most frequently-used phrases at business events these days is “the future of work.” It’s increasingly clear that artificial intelligence and other new technologies will bring substantial changes in work tasks and business processes. But while these changes are predicted for the future, they’re already present in many organizations for many different jobs. The job and incumbents described below are an example of this phenomenon. Steve Miller of Singapore Management University and I co-authored the story.


Since the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in the U.S. in 1970, banks around the world have been held accountable by governments for preventing money laundering, suspicious cross-border flows of large amounts of money, and other types of financial crime. DBS Bank, the largest bank in Singapore and in Southeast Asia, has long had a focus on anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crime detection and prevention. According to a DBS executive,

“We want to make sure that we have tight internal controls within the bank so the perpetrators, money launderers, and sanctions evaders do not penetrate into the financial system, either through our bank, through our national system, or internationally.”

PROMOTED
Like other large banks, the area of DBS that focusses on these issues, called “Transaction Surveillance,” has taken advantage of artificial intelligence for many years to do this type of work. The people in this function evaluate alerts that are raised by a rule-based system. The rules assess transaction data that come from many different systems across the bank including those for consumers, wealth management, institutional banking and their payments, and the various channels within each of these major areas. These transactions all flow through the rule-based system for screening, and the rules flag transactions that match conditions associated with an individual or entity doing suspicious transactions with the bank—those involving a potential money laundering event, or another type of financial fraud. Rule-based systems—in the past known as “expert systems”—are one of the oldest forms of AI, but they are still widely used in banking and insurance, as well as other industries.

At DBS and most other banks across the world, these types of rule-based financial transaction surveillance systems generate a large number of alerts every day. The primary shortcoming of rule-based surveillance systems is that most—up to 98%—of the alerts generated are “false positives.” Some aspect of the transaction triggers a rule that leads it to be flagged on the alert list. However, after follow-on investigation by the human analyst, it turns out that the alerted transaction is actually not suspicious.

The transaction surveillance analysts have to follow up on each and every alert, looking at all the relevant transaction information. They also consider the profiles of the individuals involved with the transaction, their past financial behaviors, whatever they have declared in “Know Your Customer” and Customer Due Diligence documents, and anything else the bank might know about them. Following up on alerts is a time intensive process. Having an automated system that generates a large number of alerts, most of which turn out to be false positives, does not save human labor.

If the analyst confirms that a transaction is justifiably suspicious or verified as fraud, the bank has a legal obligation to issue a “Suspicious Activity Report” (SAR) to the appropriate authorities. This is a high-stakes decision so it is important for the analyst to get it right: if incorrect, law-abiding bank customers could be incorrectly notified that they are being investigated for financial crimes. On the other side, if a “bad actor” is not detected and reported, it leads to problems related to money laundering and other financial crimes.

For now at least, the rule-based systems can’t be eliminated because the national regulatory authorities in most countries still require them. But DBS executives realized there are many additional sources of internal and external information available to them that, if used correctly, could be used to automatically evaluate each alert from the rule-based system. This could be done using machine learning (ML), which can deal with more complex patterns and make more accurate predictions than rule-based systems.
A few years back, DBS set out on a project to apply the new generation of AI/ML capabilities in combination with the existing rule-based screening system. The combination would enable the bank to prioritize all of the alerts generated by the rule-based system according to a numerically calculated probability score indicating the level of suspicion. The ML system was trained to recognize suspicious and fraudulent situations from recent and historical data and outcomes.
The new ML based filtering system (see figure below) has been in use for just over one year. It reviews all of the alerts generated by the rule-based system, assigns each alert a risk score, and also categorizes each alert into higher, medium, and lower risk categories. This type of “post-processing” of the rule-based alerts enables the analyst to decipher which ones to immediately prioritize (those in the higher and medium risk categories) and which ones can wait (those in the lowest risk category). An important capability of this ML system is that it has an explainer that shows the analyst the evidence used in making the automated assessment of the probability of being a suspicious transaction. The explanation and guided navigation given by the AI/ML model helps the analyst make the right risk decision.Model to recommend ""hibernation"" of the AML alertDBS
DBS also developed other new capabilities to support the investigation of alerted transactions, including a “Network Link Analytics” system (Fig.2) for detecting suspicious relationships and transactions across multiple parties.Analysis of the networks among DBS accountsDBS
In parallel, DBS has also replaced a labor-intensive approach to investigation workflow with a new platform that automates for the analyst much of the support for surveillance-related investigation and case management called CRUISE that integrates the outputs of the rule-based engine, the ML filter model, and the network link system. Additionally, the CRUISE system provides the analyst with easy and integrated access to the relevant data from across the bank needed to follow up on the transactions they are investigating. Within this CRUISE environment, the bank also captures all the feedback related to the analyst’s work on the case, and this feedback helps to further improve DBS’s systems and processes.
Impact on the Analyst
Of course, this all makes analysts much more efficient in reviewing alerts. Few years ago, it was not uncommon for a DBS transaction surveillance analyst to spend two or more hours looking into an alert. This included the front end preparation time to fetch data from multiple systems and to manually collate relevant past transactions, and the actual analysis time to evaluate the evidence, look for patterns, and make the final judgement as to whether the alert seemed to actually be a suspicious transaction or not.
After implementation of multiple tools including CRUISE, Network Link Analytics, and the ML based filter model, analysts are able to do about a third more cases in the same amount of time. Also, for the high-risk cases that are identified using these tools, DBS is able to catch the “bad actors” faster than before.
Commenting on how this differs from traditional surveillance approaches, a senior DBS manager shared:
“In traditional transaction surveillance settings, it is very challenging for an analyst to get all of the information they needed across the various parts of the bank in order to follow up on alerts because of the abundance and variety of data involved. An analyst has to close out a review within a certain specified time period. Within this time, there is only so much data the analyst can acquire across the bank and make sense of, but the analyst just has to make a decision on the alert within that time period. Sometimes that decision is right. Sometimes it is wrong. But that is the best that could be done under the circumstances. 
Today at DBS, our machines are able to gather the necessary support data from various sources across the bank and present it on the screen of our analyst. Now the analyst can easily see the relevant supporting information for each alert and make the right decision. The analyst does not have to search through 60 different systems to get the supporting data. The machines now do this for the analyst much faster than a human can. It makes the life of the analysts easier and their decisions a lot sharper.
In the past, due to practical limitations, transaction surveillance analysts were only able to collect and use a small fraction of the data within the bank that was relevant to reviewing the alert. Today at DBS, with our new tools and processes, the analyst is able to make decisions based on instant, automatic access to nearly all the relevant data within the bank about the transaction. They see this data, nicely organized in a condensed manner on their screen, with a risk score and with the help of an explainer that guides them through the evidence that led to the output of the model.”
DBS invested in a skill set “uplift” across the staff who were involved in creating and using these new surveillance systems. This included the transaction surveillance analysts who had expertise in detecting financial crimes and were trained in using the new technology platform  and in relevant data analytics skillsets. Staff from these teams were cross-trained in the other two areas  (product specialists and technology specialists) so they could more effectively work with their counterparts in those areas. These teams helped to design the new systems, beginning with the front-end work to identify risk typologies. They also provided inputs to identify the data that made most sense to use, and where automated data analytics and ML capabilities could be most helpful to them.
When asked how the systems would affect human transaction analysts in the future, a DBS executive said:
“Efficiency is always important, and we must always strive for higher levels of it. We want to handle the transaction-based aspects of our current and future surveillance workload with fewer people, and then reinvest the freed-up capacity into new areas of surveillance and fraud prevention. There will always be unknown and new dimensions of bad financial behavior and bad actors, and we need to invest more time and more people into these types of areas. To the extent that we can, we will do this through reinvesting the efficiency gains we achieve within our more standard transaction surveillance efforts.”
The Next Phase of Transaction Surveillance
The bank’s overall aspiration for AML transaction surveillance is to become more integrated as well as more proactive. Rather than just relying on alerts generated from the rule-based engine, executives want to make use of multiple levels of Integrated Risk Surveillance which enables the bank to monitor holistically from ‘transaction to account to customer to network to macro’ levels. This combination would help the bank to find more bad actors, and to do so more effectively and efficiently.
A DBS senior manager elaborated:
“It is important to note that money launderers and sanctions evaders are always finding new ways of doing things. Our people need to work with our technology and data analytics capabilities to stay ahead of these emerging threats. We want to free up the time our people have been spending on the tedious, manual aspects of reviewing alerts, and use that time to keep pace with the emerging threats.” 
Human analysts will continue to play an important role in AML transaction surveillance, though the way they use their time and their human expertise will continue to evolve.
The senior manager at DBS also shared a perspective on AI :
“It’s really augmented intelligence,  rather than automated artificial intelligence in risk surveillance. We do not think we can remove human judgement from the final decisions because there will always be a subjective element to evaluations of what is and is not suspicious in the context of money laundering and other financial crimes. We cannot eliminate this subjective element, but we can minimize the manual work that the human analyst does as part of reviewing and evaluating the alerts.”

With larger projects, delays become more expensive. McKinsey projects that on-site mismanagement costs the construction industry $1.6 trillion a year. But you might usually only have five managers overseeing construction of a building with 1,500 rooms, foresees Founder and CEO of British- Israeli startup Buildots Roy Danon. &quot;There's no way an individual can control that much of detail.&quot;.Mr. Danon thinks that artificial intelligence (AI) can help developing an image recognition system, which monitors every detail of an ongoing construction project. It also flags up delays or errors automatically. Along with Buildots, the two biggest building firms in Europe, including UK construction giant Wates is using this system in large residential builds. Construction is significantly a kind of manufacturing. If high-tech factories adopt AI to manage their processes, it the high time for construction sites to start using it..Artificial intelligence (AI) has started to change various aspects of construction, ranging from design to self-driving diggers. Some companies even offer a kind of overall AI site inspector, which matches images taken on-site against a digital plan of the building. Buildots is now making that process easier and feasible than ever by using video footage from GoPro cameras ascended on the hard hats of workers..When managers visit the site once or twice a week, the camera on their head captures video footages of the entire project and then uploads it to image recognition software. It compares the status of many thousands of objects such as electrical sockets, and bathroom fittings on-site with a digital replica of the building..Artificial intelligence also uses the video feed to find out where the camera in the building within a few centimetres so that it can spot the exact location of the objects in each frame. Mr. Danon claims that the system can track the status of approximately 150,000 items several times a week. AI can identify which of three or four states it is in for each object, from not yet begun to fully deploy..Sophie Morris, a civil engineer at Buildots, says, &quot;Site inspections are slow and tedious.&quot; Buildots developed AI to get rid of many repetitive tasks and allows people to focus on making important decisions. &quot;That's the job people want to do where one doesn't have to go and check whether the walls have been painted or someone's drilled too many holes in the ceiling,&quot; says Morris..Another advantage is the way the tech works in the background. It records data without the requirement to walk the site with spreadsheets or schedules, explains Operations Director of Wates, Glen Roberts, whose firm is now planning to roll out the Buildots system at other locations..The complete status of the project and its digital plan has a big difference. It has been found after comparing it several times a week during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although construction sites were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the essential on-site workers, managers on various Buildots projects kept tabs on progress remotely..Artificial intelligence will not replace these essential workers anytime soon. Humans are still creating buildings, not AI. &quot;At the end of the day, this is an extensive labor-driven industry, and this fact won't change,&quot; foresees Morris..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
