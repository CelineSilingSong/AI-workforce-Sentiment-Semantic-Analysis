AI, as the term is most often used today is, simply put, the theory and practice of building machines capable of performing tasks that seem to require intelligence. Currently, cutting-edge technologies striving to make this a reality include machine learning, artificial neural networks and deep learning.
Meanwhile, blockchain is essentially a new filing system for digital information, which stores data in an encrypted, distributed ledger format. Because data is encrypted and distributed across many different computers, it enables the creation of tamper-proof, highly robust databases which can be read and updated only by those with permission.
PROMOTED
Although much has been written from an academic perspective on the potential of combining these ground-breaking technologies, real world applications are sparse at the moment. However, I expect this situation to change in the near future.

So here are three ways in which AI and blockchain are made for each other.

 AI and encryption work very well together

Data held on a blockchain is by its nature highly secure, thanks to the cryptography which is inherent in its filing system.
What this means is that blockchains are ideal for storing the highly sensitive, personal data which, when smartly processed, can unlock so much value and convenience in our lives. Think of smart healthcare systems that make accurate diagnoses based on our medical scans and records, or even simply the recommendation engines used by Amazon or Netflix to suggest what we might like to buy or watch next.
Of course, the data which is fed into these systems (after being collected from us as we browse or interact with services) is highly personal. The businesses that deal in it must put up large amounts of money to meet the standards expected of them in terms of data security. And even so, large-scale data breaches leading to the loss of personal data are increasingly common (and increasingly large!).
Blockchain databases hold their information in an encrypted state. This means that only the private keys must be kept safe – a few kilobytes of data – in order for all of the data on the chain to be secure.
AI has plenty to bring to the table in terms of security, too. An emerging field of AI is concerned with building algorithms which are capable of working with (processing, or operating with) data while it is still in an encrypted state. As any part of a data process which involves exposing unencrypted data represents a security risk, reducing these incidents could help to make things much safer.

 Blockchain can help us track, understand and explain decisions made by AI

Decisions made by AIs can sometimes be hard for humans to understand. This is because they are capable of assessing a large number of variables independently of each other and “learning” which ones are important to the overall task it is trying to achieve.
As an example, AI algorithms are expected to increasingly be used in making decisions about whether financial transactions are fraudulent, and should be blocked or investigated.
For some time though, it will still be necessary to have these decisions audited for accuracy by humans. And given the huge amount of data that can be taken into consideration, this can be a complex task. Walmart, for example, feeds a months’ worth of transactional data across all of its stores into its AI systems which make decisions on what products should be stocked, and where.
If decisions are recorded, on a datapoint-by-datapoint basis, on a blockchain, it makes it far simpler for them to be audited, with the confidence that the record has not been tampered with between the information being recorded and the start of the audit process.
No matter how clearly we can see that AI offers huge advantages in many fields, if it isn’t trusted by the public, then its usefulness will be severely limited. Recording the decision-making process on blockchains could be a step towards achieving the level of transparency and insight into robot minds that will be needed in order to gain public trust.

 AI can manage blockchains more efficiently than humans (or “stupid” conventional computers)

Traditionally, computers have been very fast, but very stupid. Without explicit instructions on how to perform a task, computers can’t get them done. This means that, due to their encrypted nature, operating with blockchain data on “stupid” computers requires large amounts of computer processing power. As an example, the hashing algorithms used to mine blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain take a “brute force” approach – effectively trying every combination of characters until they find one which fits to verify a transaction.
AI is an attempt to move away from this brute force approach, and manage tasks in a more intelligent, thoughtful manner. Consider how a human expert on cracking codes will, if they are good, become better and more efficient at code-breaking as they successfully crack more and more codes throughout their career. A machine learning-powered mining algorithm would tackle its job in a similar way – although rather than having to take a lifetime to become an expert, it could almost instantaneously sharpen its skills, if it is fed the right training data.
Clearly, blockchain and AI are two technological trends which, while ground-breaking in their own rights, have the potential to become even more revolutionary when put together. Both serve to enhance the capabilities of the other, while also offering opportunities for better oversight and accountability.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

From the UK to the UAE, China and the USA, governments are putting serious money and resources behind efforts to corner the artificial intelligence (AI) market. China recently published its AI strategy, which boldly declared that within a decade AI will become “the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transition”. If China’s approach to AI mirrors its 2014 semiconductor plan we could see up to $150bn being invested in AI over the next 10 years. It’s not just nations that are betting on an AI-based economy. The largest technology firms, including Alphabet (owner of Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft, are investing huge sums to develop their AI capabilities. It is estimated that in 2017 alone, companies globally completed around £15bn in mergers and acquisitions related to AI. As for the UK, in January AI was at the heart of the Prime Minister’s speech at Davos. She highlighted the potential of AI, for example, to reduce unnecessary breast cancer surgeries by a third. Public backing of AI follows on from a UK Government review, co-chaired by Professor Dame Wendy Hall, which reported in October that the technology could boost productivity, advance healthcare, improve services for customers and unlock £650bn for the UK economy. As a result, the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund - which is part of the Government’s £4.7bn increase in R&D over the next four years - has several challenge funds to support the development of practical applications in AI, robotics and autonomous vehicles.

 The different types of AI

 But exactly what is AI? AI is an umbrella term to describe technology that exhibits behaviours that appear intelligent and autonomous. From predictive text to deep neural networks, AI is an evolution in computing and the way we look at data. There are three broad categories of AI. First, basic artificial intelligence: simple algorithms and rules that give the impression of intelligent computing. For example, simplistic chat bots. Second, machine learning: computing that has the “ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. From pattern recognition, to predictions, this type of AI learns through training and the quality of analysis improves with experience. For example, Netflix recommending new films to users. Third, deep learning: a modern advance in AI, the core feature of deep learning is that it’s based on practice and feedback, rather than complicated rules. It is a subset of machine learning and is only possible through high-quality data that is processed and analysed in a similar way to the human brain. Deep learning creates a neural network that becomes more sophisticated as more data is added. For example, the ability for a computer to detect tumours in medical images.

 The notion of AI at the heart of the economy and society is not some distant ambition among a few giant corporations. The CBI is detecting a major shift on the horizon as businesses look to unlock the potential of AI. Every business has the potential to take advantage of the digital revolution and embrace the opportunities that arise from new technologies. CBI research shows that 94% of businesses believe that digital technologies are a crucial driver of increased productivity. Businesses that innovate grow twice as fast, both in employment and sales, than firms that fail to do so, and adopting new technology gets the best out of people - 50% of labour productivity is driven by innovation. But why now? The emergence of AI as a technology that is on the brink of becoming ingrained within business products and services is due to three main factors. Firstly, new, abundant and high-quality data - 90% of the world’s data has been created in the past 24 months. Secondly, development of affordable sophisticated hardware to handle the processing of vast sums of data and evolving algorithms that benefit from the richness of information and power of the computing. Finally, availability of cloud technology that enables developers and businesses across the world to collaborate and experiment with AI models. The concoction of excellent data, powerful computers and cloud technology has propelled AI to lead the charge for business investment. Some 42% of companies are planning to devote resources to adopting AI over the next five years.

 The CBI predicts sectors likely to be impacted first include media, real estate, finance and insurance, professional services and public services. Current examples of the most advanced AI to date include the following. In health, Your.MD has built an AI personal health guide that provides users immediate trustworthy healthcare advice from the NHS. In banking, to help confirm customer identity and increase security HSBC has created an AI chatbot, Olivia, who assists customers all year round. In education CENTURY, an AI platform, is helping children learn and teachers provide more personalised education programmes, Finally, in law, AI is helping lawyers to do legal searches and to draft the best standard documents. Law firm Pinsent Masons has developed its own team of computer scientists to put AI into practice for its lawyers. Indeed, just last week Futurism reported a new study from LawGeex that revealed AI outperforms lawyers in reviewing non-disclosure agreements and accurately spotting risks within the legal documents. Lawyers needed an average of 92 minutes to complete the task - the AI took 26 seconds. So how should the Welsh Government respond to AI? It is off to a good start with AI included as a priority within the new Economic Action Plan. What we need to do now is assess the potential for AI in Wales and the opportunities we can grasp.

Here’s a Swedish mine worker’s reaction to impending automation: “I’m not really worried. There are so many jobs in this mine that even if this job disappears, they will have another one. The company will take care of us.”
Germany’s experience with intensive use of robots since 1995 tells a similar story of job stability. When robots are introduced into a German manufacturing firm, largely automobile plants, this increases the chances that workers will keep a job at the firm, although many of them perform different tasks there. When German manufacturing firms deploy robots, they don’t displace existing workers. They do, however, create fewer new jobs, resulting in, over time, a decline in overall employment in manufacturing. Since there are fewer new manufacturing jobs, workers seek and find work in other industries. As a result, robot use hasn’t produced an overall decline in German employment.
There’s nothing preventing U.S. companies from doing the same
Indeed, Accenture shows how it can be done.  They automated 17,000 back office jobs over an 18-month period without displacing a single worker. CEO Richard Lamb says, “We are fortunate enough to reskill and reposition them.”











 
 
 
Amazon has done the same thing with the installation of bin-stacking robots in its warehouses. Some workers took company courses on how to operate robots. Others were repositioned to receiving stations where they sorted merchandise into bins. Amazon’s operations chief put the outcome simply, “The people didn’t go anywhere.”

This kind of win-win transition takes careful planning. A number of consulting studies have provided some guidelines for companies. Accenture recommends that companies start now, increasing their efforts to retrain people for new skills, redesigning work to fit the humans who will do the job, and developing needed talent through an improved skills pipeline. For example, AT&T launched a retraining program to fill jobs in cloud computing, data science and coding and found, during one four-month period in 2016, that the retrained employees filled half of all technology management jobs at the company.
Amazon’s Career Choice program is another example of this. It pays 95 percent of tuition and fees for employees “to earn certificates and associate degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, nursing, and many other fields.”











 
 
 
Pearson says that 20 percent of all workers are in declining occupations and 10 percent are in growing occupations. There will be increased demand for interpersonal skills, including teaching, social perceptiveness, service orientation and persuasion, and higher-order cognitive skills such as complex problem solving, originality, fluency of ideas and active learning. They encourage companies to re-design jobs “to pair uniquely human skills with the productivity gains from technology to boost demand for jobs.”  The idea is to supplement, not supplant human skills, just as in education where technology supplements but does not replace the crucial role of the teacher.
McKinsey echoes these points, saying companies should prepare for the transition by scaling and reimagining job retraining and workforce skills development, including providing on-the-job training and opportunities to workers to upgrade their skills.
But these problems are larger than any one company
McKinsey recommends an important role for government in matching workers to jobs to improve labor mobility, maintaining robust economic growth to support job creation, including increased infrastructure investments, and providing income and transition support to workers, including retraining programs, unemployment insurance, public assistance in finding work, and portable benefits that follow workers between jobs.











 
 
 
History shows that, in the long run, technological advances do not create unemployment, but they do change the nature of the work that is available. Fewer agricultural worker are needed to raise crops, so new workers move to jobs in manufacturing and service industries. That transition was enabled through the far-sighted progressive thinking of policymakers and educators who developed the U.S. system of universal education, producing the world’s most productive literate, and numerate workforce.
The OECD estimates that 65 percent of children today will do jobs that haven’t even been developed. We need to train tomorrow’s workers in the general skills that they can use flexibly to fill the ever-changing job demands of an AI-intensive workplace.  We need to equip them with the skills they need to be lifelong learners who will not be afraid to change. But they need the reassurance that if they are willing to change, there will be a place for them in our nation’s workplaces.

Photograph: AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesThe ObserverRobots This article is more than 6 years oldHow to persuade a robot that you should get the jobThis article is more than 6 years oldDo mere human beings stand a chance against software that claims to reveal what a real-life face-to-face chat can’t?Stephen BuranyiSat 3 Mar 2018 19.05 ESTShare3838According to Nathan Mondragon, finding the right employee is all about looking at the little things. Tens of thousands of little things, as it turns out.Mondragon is head psychologist at HireVue, which markets software for screening job candidates. Its flagship product, used by Unilever and Goldman Sachs, asks candidates to answer interview questions in front of a camera. Meanwhile its software, like a team of hawk-eyed psychologists hiding behind a mirror, takes note of barely perceptible changes in posture, facial expression and vocal tone.“We break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,” says Mondragon. “If you’re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes.”The program turns this data into a score, which is then compared against one the program has already “learned” from top-performing employees. The idea is that a good prospective employee looks a lot like a good current employee, just not in any way a human interviewer would notice.Approaches like vocal analysis and reading “microexpressions” have been applied in policing and intelligence with little clear success. But Mondragon says automated analyses compare favourably with established tests of personality and ability, and that customers report better employee performance and less turnover.HireVue is just one of a slew of new companies selling AI as a replacement for the costly human side of hiring. It estimates the “pre-hire assessment” market is worth $3bn (£2.2bn) a year.A study in the UK last year found an average of 24 applicants per low-wage job. Tesco, the country’s largest private employer, received well over three million job applications in 2016. With applications rising, employers have automated as much of the process as possible. This started more than a decade ago with simple programs that scanned text CVs for key words. It has now expanded to include quizzes, psychometric tests, games and chatbots that can reject applicants before a human ever glances at their CV.Jobseekers are forced to prepare for whatever format a prospective employer has chosen, a familiar power shift in the gig economy era. And without human interaction or feedback, an already difficult process has become deeply alienating.Will a robot recruiter be hiring you for your next job?Read moreBeyond the dehumanising experience lurk the usual concerns that attend automation and AI, which uses data often shaped by inequality. If you suspect you’ve been discriminated against by an algorithm, what recourse do you have? How vulnerable are those formulas to bias? And is it inevitable that non-traditional or poorer candidates, or those who struggle with new technology, will be excluded from the process?“It’s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employer,” says Robert, a plumber in his 40s whom I met at a weekly jobs club in London. He uses job boards and recruiters to find temporary work. Harry, 24, has been searching for a job for four months. In retail “just about every job opening” requires a test or game. He completes four or five a week. The rejections are often instant, piling up without a word of feedback. Every time you start again from zero.“You never know what you’ve done wrong. It leaves you feeling a bit trapped,” Harry says.The problem is worst for older jobseekers. Many rely on support from councils or voluntary services to help them fill out applications. “It’s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who was a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?” asks Lynda Pennington, who organises another jobs club in Croydon.After 86 unsuccessful job applications in two years – including several HireVue screenings – Deborah Caldeira is thoroughly disillusioned with automated systems. Without a person across the table, there’s “no real conversation or exchange”, and it’s difficult to know “exactly what the robot is looking for”, says Caldeira, who has a master’s degree from the London School of Economics.Despite her qualifications, she found herself questioning every movement as she sat at home alone performing for a computer. “It makes us feel that we’re not worthwhile, as the company couldn’t even assign a person for a few minutes. The whole thing is becoming less human,” she says.A fightback against automation has emerged, as applicants search for ways to game the system. On web forums, students trade answers to employers’ tests and create fake applications to gauge their processes. One HR employee for a major technology company recommends slipping the words “Oxford” or “Cambridge” into a CV in invisible white text, to pass the automated screening.Measures are under way to tip the balance of power back to those seeking work, according to Christina Colclough, director of digitalisation and trade at UNI Global Union, a federation of trade unions. They include a charter of digital rights for workers touching on automated and AI-based decisions, to be included in bargaining agreements.An imminent update to the EU general data protection regulation will require a company to disclose whenever a decision that “significantly affects an individual” has been automated. But even minimal human involvement – approving a list of automatically ranked CVs, for example – could exempt companies from such regulations, warns Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute. She also notes that a much-discussed “right to explanation” of automated decisions will not be legally binding.Explore more on these topicsRobotsThe ObserverArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingConsciousnessfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedLiveHakeem Jeffries reportedly did not offer Biden his endorsement in private meeting – liveKaty Perry: Woman’s World review – what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?You could sense the embarrassment as Biden spoke, a sign of how low the presidency has sunkJohn CraceWeek in wildlife – in pictures: a rare blue frog, a cheeky heron and climbing bearsTeamsters president faces backlash over ‘unconscionable’ GOP convention speech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About five in six Americans already use a product or service that features it, according to a survey that was conducted last fall and from which new findings were released on Tuesday.“Whether they know it or not, A.I. has moved into a big percent of Americans’ lives in one way or another already,” said Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, which conducted the survey with Northeastern University.The study defines artificial intelligence as any technology that can perform a task as humans do. But even if that definition feels overly broad, the findings reveal just how ubiquitous certain products have become in American life.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAbout 84 percent of Americans, for example, use navigation apps like Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps, the study found. About 72 percent of respondents said they streamed music or video with services like Netflix and Pandora.Nearly half said they used personal assistants on their smartphones, while about 32 percent use ride-sharing apps. Some 22 percent used intelligent home personal assistants, like Google Home or Amazon’s Alexa. Twenty percent said they use a smart home device, such as a self-learning light or thermostat.The technologies were used most widely among younger and more educated Americans: More than 90 percent of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree or between the ages of 18 and 35 used navigation apps, for example.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe report that was released on Tuesday reflects only some of the findings of a large survey of nearly 3,300 American adults conducted in September and October.The other findings, released in January, show that more than three in four Americans believe that artificial intelligence will fundamentally change how the public works and lives in the coming decade.About the same share expect artificial intelligence to destroy more jobs than it creates, though only about one in four were worried about losing their own job.A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2018, Section B, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: Americans See A.I.

Here’s How Artificial Intelligence Will Change the Way You Recruit 
AI is no substitute for human search professionals, but the technology is going to completely overhaul the people business, says Nachi Junankar, founder and CEO of Avrio. Cumbersome and mundane tasks are its first targets. Let’s go inside the latest thinking.

 March 2, 2018 – How often have you said to yourself, “There just aren’t enough hours in the day?” In an industry that moves as fast as talent recruitment, lack of time is a serious problem.
Recruiters are spread so thin that 75 percent of applicants never receive a response after submitting a resume.
The bigger problem for recruiters is that these candidates can eventually become clients – but if they’re ignored and treated poorly at this stage, that’s unlikely. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is becoming the solution to this and other problems that traditionally have bogged down recruiters.
“Imagine you hire someone to help you with the most cumbersome part of the recruitment process: matching candidates to jobs,” said Nachi Junankar, founder and CEO of Avrio AI, an artificial intelligence talent platform based in Boston. “Instead of spending hours of your day scanning resumes and comparing them to job descriptions, candidates are screened and ranked for you. Now, you can focus on connecting with the best applicants more quickly, making more successful placements, and ensuring a positive experience for each individual candidate.”
AI As a Solution
While this scenario may seem too good to be true, technology has advanced enough to make it a reality. Artificial intelligence has already become extremely useful for businesses looking to do more with less. “AI helps your organization scale by automating low-value tasks, allowing people to execute the tasks that truly affect the bottom line,” said Mr. Junankar. “It’s no longer just a buzzword; it’s an opportunity for businesses to minimize the amount of time spent on rote tasks so they can focus on more meaningful work.”

Adoption of AI is at an early stage, so it’s no wonder that many are skeptical of its potential. But the truth is that there is only so much a consultant can do. Certain tasks or processes can be automated, said Aviro, but AI is no substitute for recruiters, an inherently human profession.
Automate the Grind
“Most talent acquisition employees spend roughly 45 percent of their time resume matching, getting buried in resumes and job descriptions,” said Mr. Junankar. “That time is better spent building relationships with clients or candidates and gaining a thorough understanding of exactly what they are seeking.”
Time is of the essence when it comes to recruiting. If one spends too much time on the resume matching process, candidates who are identified as great fits for certain roles will be off the market by the time the recruiter contacts them, said Aviro. For smaller companies and staffing firms, it’s expensive to hire enough recruiters to reach the best talent and stay ahead of the game. “But leveraging AI gives you crucial time in your day back,” said Mr. Junankar. “Keeping up with the competition is easier when artificial intelligence takes over tedious processes, enabling you to make those vital connections with candidates.”

AI Ushers in a New Day for Companies and Recruiters
Artificial intelligence is transforming the face of workforces around the world. For executive recruiters and HR departments, it has meant a growing number of new roles to fill and untapped talent to discover. Gartner, the information technology research firm, says AI will cause millions of jobs to fall by the wayside.

Of course, recruiting is about more than filling seats and making placements. The candidate experience is a top priority, and it improves immeasurably when you no longer own cumbersome and mundane tasks, said Aviro. Understanding a candidate’s skills and background on paper is one thing, but meeting candidates in person and having a genuine conversation is the best way to make recommendations that guarantee a successful placement.

Additionally, the more time one has to focus on candidates and clients, the more proactive a recruiter can be. “You can reach out to candidates before they contact you, asking for an update,” said Mr. Junankar.
The best recruiters make their candidates feel like their job search isn’t an afterthought, said Aviro. When AI handles the tedious tasks and identifies the best people, recruiters have more time to nurture their candidates, making them feel valued, which can turn them into advocates for recruiters and their firms.
The Bottom Line 
“Artificial intelligence is presenting recruiters with an opportunity to revolutionize the way we hire,” said Mr. Junankar. “Automating processes boosts efficiency, allowing your organization scale without incurring extra expenses and keep up with the competition. Most importantly, adopting AI gets you back to the reason you became a recruiter: finding candidates not only a job, but a fulfilling career.”

Avrio is building an AI platform that uses machine intelligence to bring people and companies together. It’s AI talent platform reduces hiring workload by 35 percent. Mr. Junankar is passionate about building long-lasting companies that create amazing technologies that change the world. He recently sat down with Hunt Scanlon to discuss the impact AI will have on how we will soon search for talent. Let’s take a look into the future of hiring.


Nachi, explain how AI can help recruiters?
AI is able to eliminate repetitive tasks that slow down business operations. Speeding up business processes enables recruiters to make placements faster than ever seen before. Along with speed, AI provides cognitive insight into a candidate’s ability to perform a job at a high level. This will ensure that recruiters are matching the right candidate to the right job, every time. In addition to analyzing and matching, AI will be able to increase candidate engagement, allowing recruiters to spend more time nurturing potential candidates. Specifically, Avrio AI automates 45 percent of repetitive recruiting tasks, allowing recruiters to spend more time on developing strong relationships with candidates. Overall, AI is going to allow recruiters to become more strategic and effective.
Some feel threatened by technology taking over jobs — so how can these people embrace technology and see security in the future?
It is only natural that people are threatened by new technology, this is nothing new. However, in order to stay competitive they are going to have to embrace it. Technology is not going to wait for people to feel comfortable. It is coming whether people like it or not. What separates the people who thrive and the people who get pushed out is their willingness to adopt early. There is going to be a big shift in the labor market. On a positive note, these emerging technologies are only going to make people’s working lives better. The challenge is learning how people and technology can work side by side and I think here at Avrio AI we have found that symbiosis.

“Technology may not replace job roles entirely, but it is going to change how people work, their cognitive load and tasks that they work on.”


Hunt Scanlon’s Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Stories of 2017
One of our most important missions at Hunt Scanlon Media is to report on the trends that are altering the executive recruitment industry, and in many cases, the world of business. Among the most consequential transitions we’ve reported on this past year has been the rise of AI – and what it means for the future of …

Do you foresee technology replacing various roles with companies or more specifically HR and recruiting?
Technology may not replace the job roles entirely, but it is going to change how people work, their cognitive load and tasks that they work on. If a recruiter has 50 cognitive tasks they do in an average day and AI can now complete half of those tasks, the recruiter is going to have to find another 25 tasks to work on. This allows recruiters along with other workers to think more strategically and find the tasks that technology cannot replace such as building and fostering relationships with a candidate.
How big is AI?
As a definition, AI is something that seems it might need human intelligence but is done with a computer. AI is going to become the standard across all business functions. Its ability to optimize business operations will increase the speed at which business is done and the ability for companies to scale and therefore compete. Enhancing the decision making process is clearly a huge benefit. Ultimately, AI is going to solve problems that we don’t even know we have yet, freeing up time for people to focus on more strategic tasks. Overall, the best way to put it is, let tech do what tech does best and let people do what they do best.

Most Americans Already Using Artificial Intelligence Products
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

85% of Americans use at least one of six products with AI elements
84% use navigation apps
72% use streaming media services


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly nine in 10 Americans (85%) say they currently use at least one of six devices, programs or services that feature elements of artificial intelligence (AI). Use of these products ranges from 84% of U.S. adults using navigation applications to 20% using smart home devices such as self-learning thermostats and lighting.

These data come from a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults was conducted Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017. The study found 79% of Americans saying AI has had a very or mostly positive impact on their lives so far.
The percentage of Americans using different consumer AI products may be at least partly related to the length of time these products have been on the market. The most widely used product -- navigation apps, such as Google® Maps, Waze® or Apple® Maps -- has been on the market since the mid-2000s. Streaming media services -- including Netflix®, Hulu®, Pandora® and Spotify® -- which 72% of Americans use, first launched in 1993, though technical limitations with these limited their growth until the mid-2000s. Nearly half of Americans (47%) use digital personal assistants on their smartphones, such as Siri® or Google Voice. The first digital personal assistant launched in 2011.
Beyond the three most widely used products, ride-sharing apps, such as those used for Uber® or Lyft®, which first appeared in 2011, are used by roughly a third of U.S adults. Intelligent home personal assistants -- such as Amazon's® Alexa™ or Google Home™, which use voice commands to search for information online or control elements of their homes -- debuted in 2014. Currently, 22% of U.S. adults report using such devices. Twenty percent of U.S. adults say they use smart home devices, on the market since 2011, when the first learning thermostat was released.

NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/GALLUP SURVEY, SEPT. 15-OCT. 10, 2017





At least a majority in all key subgroups of Americans use navigation apps. However, use of these is much more common among adults aged 50 and younger -- more than nine in 10 of whom use such apps -- and falls to 80% among those aged 51 to 65 and 66% for those over age 65. Additionally, there is a 15-percentage-point gap in use of navigation apps between college graduates and those without a college degree -- 94% vs. 79%, respectively.
For streaming media use, the decline by age group is more dramatic, with 91% of those aged 18 to 35 using these services. Use falls to 84% among those aged 36 to 50, to 63% for those 51 to 65 and finally to 41% for those over age 65. There is also a 15-point gap in use of streaming media services between college graduates (82%) and those without college degrees (67%).
By age group, use of ride-sharing apps falls from a high of 45% among those 18 to 35, to a low of 14% among those over age 65. There is also a difference in ride-sharing-app use between those with a college degree (51%) and those without one (23%).
Bottom Line
The vast majority of Americans are already using consumer products that employ elements of AI. These products have made it into their homes and vehicles in the form of streaming media services and navigation applications. Even products adopted by a smaller percentage of Americans, such as smart home devices, are already being used by millions. Growth estimates suggest adoption of AI consumer products is likely to grow substantially in the future. Amazon alone predicts its intelligent home assistant, Alexa, will be adopted by 100 million or more people within the next three to five years.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University/Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.
For results based on the total sample of 3,297 U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

But the Russian capital has perhaps the most pervasive vision for AI in government yet.

“We want AI to work everywhere,” Moscow’s Chief Information Officer, Artem Ermolaev, tells GovInsider. His team is already trialling AI to advise doctors in treating cancer patients; help residents find new homes; and assess applications for government services and support.

“The Moscow vision of the future is when artificial intelligence is equal to humans - or sometimes, artificial intelligence is higher than the human,” he says.
Diagnosing cancer

Healthcare is one of the most comprehensive cases of AI in Moscow. The city government is training machines to diagnose cancer from CT scans, Ermolaev says. Patients visiting certain hospitals receive a diagnosis from a machine along with the one from their doctor.

In the next three to five years, machines will advise general practitioners on diagnoses, he says. “We expect, in the future, we have robot doctors which will have to work with you 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. It is not a really far future,” he adds.
 
“We expect, in the future, we have robot doctors”
In trials so far with thousands of CT scans, computers found cancer in 5% of cases where the doctors did not, Ermolaev says. It’s a small but critical portion, as it means that machines help cut human errors, and in this trial, about 200 cancer patients have avoided misdiagnoses. “Machines can’t be tired and the machine doesn’t have sleepless nights,” he adds.

AI everywhere

Outside clinics and hospitals, AI will be widespread in residents’ daily interactions with the government thanks to the detailed data it has on citizens. “We have a pretty big division for big data which helps us to analyse how Muscovites live, where do they live, what do they need,” he says.

In the future, residents’ applications for public services will be assessed by artificial intelligence. “The machine receives it, understand if it can be accepted or it should be declined, and does it automatically.”

AI will also help residents find new homes, he adds. About 700,000 residents move homes every year in Moscow. They can request the city to advise them on other neighbourhoods where they can lead a similar quality of life as in their current home.

The city is building AI to suggest other areas where they will have access to similar social, cultural, health, financial and education services. “What we are working on is that, using big data, we are analysing the school you are visiting and the teachers you have; the doctors you are visiting and the hospital you are also using; and we are trying to find a place which is similar to that in another part of Moscow,” Ermolaev says.
Safety

It is also building AI for facial recognition from CCTV footage. The city has a network of 160,000 cameras, one of the largest in the world, he says, which are currently monitored by humans. “We are testing in this system video analytics which will analyse the faces and face recognition.” This will help track down criminals, but can also help find missing elderly people or help parents keep track of their children,” he says.
 

 Artem Ermolaev, CIO of Moscow City


The city will use the video analytics to track garbage collectors and snow removers. “We need to control if the public objects are cleaned and the companies which maintains, for example, the major squares in the city do their job correctly or did not,” explains Ermolaev. The city is spread out over 2,000 square kilometres, and only AI, he says, can help the government ensure contractors and city officials are doing their jobs.
E-voting on blockchain

Moscow also has a vision for using Blockchain. Distributed systems to hold government records will help increase public trust in government and cut corruption, Ermolaev believes. It will “deliver the confidence that the services we are providing are fair and there is no intervention of government in it.”

Moscow’s first trial with Blockchain is on a platform that allows citizens to vote for municipal and local projects, like setting speed limits and changing bus routes. The votes are now stored on a blockchain platform that ensures no one can tamper with them, and allows citizens to monitor them in real-time, according to the city government.

It plans to connect more public services to Blockchain in the next few years, Ermolaev says. One area, for example, is admissions to free public schools, he explains, which is on a first-come, first-served basis.

At the best schools in the city, there are more applicants than available seats, which has left parents unhappy and accusing the government of meddling and corruption. Implementing Blockchain in such a process will help “convince” citizens that “there is not intervention in the system”, he believes.

There has been a great deal of hype around Blockchain and the city is still cautiously testing its value. The trials have shown that the “speed of Blockchain is still not very good”, he says, and any delays will lead to complaints from residents. Like in every other large city, “Moscow citizens are very tough customers because they don’t want to wait”, Ermolaev says.
 
“The speed of Blockchain is still not very good.”
As Moscow plans for a high-tech future, building “trust in machines” is a challenge, he notes. The city needs to “invest in explanations” for citizens to understand how the technologies like AI work and how it can help them.

Doctors, for instance, are being told that having an AI assist them on diagnosis can help them keep customers happy and earn more money. “We are explaining to them that they shouldn't be afraid that machines will replace them,” he says.
Moscow’s vision for AI is wide-ranging, but the challenges its officials face are not so different from other cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tens of thousands of little things, as it turns out. Mondragon is the head psychologist at Hirevue, a company that offers software that screens job candidates using algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI). Hirevue’s flagship product, used by global giants such as Unilever and Goldman Sachs, asks candidates to answer standard interview questions in front of a camera. Meanwhile its software, like a team of hawk-eyed psychologists hiding behind a mirror, makes note of thousands of barely perceptible changes in posture, facial expression, vocal tone and word choice.“We break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,” says Mondragon. “If you’re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent, or turn to ‘ums’ and ‘ahs’. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes. The facial movement analytics would tell us you were going into a creative thinking style.”The program turns this data into a score, which is then compared against one the program has already “learned” from top-performing employees. The idea is that a good prospective employee looks a lot like a good current employee, just not in any way a human interviewer would notice.It sounds far fetched. Approaches like vocal analysis and reading “microexpressions” have previously been applied in policing and intelligence with little clear success. But Mondragon says their automated analyses line up favourably with established tests of personality and ability, and that customers report better employee performance and less turnover.It’s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employerRobert, plumberHirevue is just one of a slew of new companies selling AI as a replacement for the costly human side of hiring. Bath-based Cognisses specialises in games that predict various aptitudes (“personality is hard to gamify, but we’re working on it,” Boris Altemeyer, their head of technology, told me.) San Francisco’s Mya Systems offers a reactive, AI-powered chatbot that will conduct the entire interview process. Hirevue estimates the “pre-hire assessment” market is worth £2.14bn (US$3 billion) a year. According to Doug Rode, senior managing director at recruiter Michael Page, the past year has seen a marked increase in companies aggressively selling AI packages of widely variable quality.A study last year by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found an average of 24 applicants for an average low wage job. Tesco, the UK’s largest private employer, received well over three million job applications in 2016. As the number of people applying for jobs has increased, employers have removed human beings from the hiring side whenever possible, automating more and more of the decisions in the process. This started over a decade ago with simple programs that scanned text CVs for keywords about education, skills and past employers in order to flag them for recruiters. It has expanded to include a bewildering range of quizzes, psychometric tests and custom built games that can be used to reject applicants before a human ever sees their application.This shift has already radically changed the way that many people interact with prospective employers. The standardised CV format allowed jobseekers to be evaluated by multiple firms with a single approach. Now jobseekers are forced to prepare for whatever format the company has chosen. The burden has been shifted from employer to jobseeker – a familiar feature of the gig economy era – and along with it the ability of jobseekers to get feedback or insight into the decision-making process. The role of human interaction in hiring has decreased, making an already difficult process deeply alienating.Beyond the often bewildering and dehumanising experience lurk the concerns that attend automation and AI, which draws on data that’s often been shaped by inequality. If you suspect you’ve been discriminated against by an algorithm, what recourse do you have? How prone are those formulas to bias, and how do the multitude of third-party companies that develop and license this software deal with the personal data of applicants? And is it inevitable that non-traditional or poorer candidates, or those who struggle with new technology, will be excluded from the process?View image in fullscreenGroceries are prepared for distribution at a Tesco distribution plant in Reading, England.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images“It’s all these artificial barriers, it makes people feel the hiring process is impenetrable,” says Heather Davies, a retired HR coordinator and one of the organisers of a Christians Against Poverty jobs club that meets weekly in a church hall in Muswell Hill, London. While there’s acceptance among attendees that increasing automation is inevitable (“it’s 2018 after all”), there’s real frustration at the hollowing out of human interaction.“It’s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employer,” says Robert, a plumber in his forties who uses job boards and recruiters to find temporary work. Harry, 24, has been searching for a job for four months. In retail, where he is looking, “just about every job” has some sort of test or game, anything from personality to maths, to screen out applicants. He completes four or five tests a week as jobs are posted. The rejections are often instant, although some service providers offer time-delay rejection emails, presumably to maintain the illusion that a person had spent time judging an application that had already failed an automated screen. The rejections pile up without ever signposting a different path. Every time you start again from zero.“It’s frustrating. You never know what you’ve done wrong; it leaves you feeling a bit trapped,” Harry says.It’s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who is a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?Lynda Pennington, Croydon jobs clubThe problem is compounded amongst older jobseekers. Many rely on support from council or voluntary services to help them fill out applications or submit CV forms. “It’s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who is a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?” asks Lynda Pennington, who organises another jobs club in Croydon.Kirsty McHugh, head of the Employment Related Services Association (ERSA), which advocates for jobseekers, raises concerns about programs that “screen out non-traditional applications without thinking”. ERSA members wouldn’t encourage employers to use them, she added.Most of the data on unemployment in the UK ignores the vast ocean of people who have given up looking for work. The ONS says 8.7 million people aged 16 to 64 are “economically inactive”– not working and not seeking work. It’s impossible to predict how many people will be put off looking for a job by the new realities of the hiring process.Even amongst the groups where automated hiring is seen as the biggest success, there is some apprehension. Several professional recruiters told me that at every job level many candidates were put off by these systems, and that they failed to engage “passive but talented” applicants. A survey by the recruiter Allegis Global Solutions found that 58% of North American job applicants said they were comfortable interacting with an automated program – an ambiguous statistic widely interpreted as a green light.Rise of the racist robots – how AI is learning all our worst impulsesRead moreDeborah Caldeira, a masters student at the London School of Economics, told me that after 86 unsuccessful job applications over the past two years – including several Hirevue screenings – she is thoroughly disillusioned with automated systems. She says that without a person across the table, there’s “no real conversation or exchange,” and it’s difficult to know “exactly what the robot is looking for”. Despite her excellent grades and extracurriculars, she was plagued by doubts that she didn’t look or sound like the ideal candidate, whose form was unknown to her. Sitting at home alone performing for a computer, she found herself questioning every movement.“It makes us less confident, and feel that we’re not worthwhile, as the company couldn’t even assign a person for a few minutes. The whole thing is becoming less human, which is concerning. What’s the limit for the use of automation when we are evaluating people?” she says.Q&AWhat is AI?ShowArtificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.An underground fightback of sorts against automation has emerged, as applicants search for ways to game the system. On web forums, students trade answers to employers’ tests and create fake applications to scope out their processes. A colleague relayed a story about a HR employee for a major technology company who recommended slipping the words “Oxford” or “Cambridge” into their CV in invisible white text, to pass the automated screening. I spoke with a jobs counsellor for high school students who has observed similar strategies.The apex of this practice is perhaps the Wales-based company Practice Aptitude Tests, which collates information from jobseekers and former employees about recruitment tests and sells practice versions, as well as tips and tricks for navigating them. Guy Thornton, the head of the company, claims the service has been used over three million times.It’s difficult to determine exactly how widespread the automation of hiring is, chiefly because companies aren’t keen to disclose how much automation they make use of. Several of the UK’s largest employers, including Sainsbury’s and Tesco, declined requests for interviews about their application process. Both Sainsbury’s and Tesco use a simple situational quiz to prescreen shop floor-level jobs.People are getting more conscious about these systems and may take the right to contest decisionsSandra Wachter, Oxford Internet InstituteBut most large companies use some form of screening, according to reports from jobseekers and jobs counsellors. And Thornton says that over the past few years, small and medium businesses are increasingly adopting it.There are a variety of popular and legislative pushes to tip the balance of power back towards those seeking work, according to Christina Colclough, director of digitalisation and trade at UNI Global Union, which represents skills and services globally. Labour unions have been slow to respond to technological change, but UNI Global and others are working on a variety of workers digital rights charters governing automated and AI-based decisions, to be included in bargaining agreements.And an imminent update to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will require a company to disclose whenever a decision that “significantly affects an individual” was automated. The applicant will also be entitled to contest the decision, or request human intervention.But the GDPR is not a catch-all, warns Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute. Wachter notes that even minimal human involvement – approving a list of automatically ranked CVs, for instance – could exempt companies from the obligation of disclosing that they use automated systems and of enabling individuals to challenge the decision. She also says a much-discussed “right to explanation”, requiring a company to explain how a given automated decision was made, will not be legally binding.“Legislators find this difficult because these programs are very technical, highly complex and difficult to understand, even to the experts who build them. And their workings are often protected by copyright held by a company,” she says.Its significant that the GDPR specifically mentions recruiting as an area targeted for regulation. Its an acknowledgement of how comprehensively the field has changed. And it opens the door for jobseekers to take more power in the process. “People are getting more conscious about these systems and may take the right to contest decisions,” Wachter says.Explore more on these topicsInequalityArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWork & careersJob huntingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedLiveHakeem Jeffries reportedly did not offer Biden his endorsement in private meeting – liveKaty Perry: Woman’s World review – what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?You could sense the embarrassment as Biden spoke, a sign of how low the presidency has sunkJohn CraceWeek in wildlife – in pictures: a rare blue frog, a cheeky heron and climbing bearsTeamsters president faces backlash over ‘unconscionable’ GOP convention speech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence: A New Look for Business Productivity Tools








While artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied on a massive scale to alter the very nature of how the world works, it turns out AI is also very good at making everyday drudgery disappear. Productivity apps powered by AI are emerging that will help you, for example, come up with snappier and more personalized e-mails, transcribe all your phone calls into searchable text or find just the right photo that goes with the color scheme you’re using for your presentation.
                

And while most of us are well acquainted with everyday apps designed to help us work more efficiently, the best of the new incarnations powered by AI have been programmed to learn over time and become ever-smarter at the everyday tasks they’re handling for you.

The latest search tool for Microsoft Office, for example, goes far beyond searching for things that you’re looking for and actually gets to know how you work. The idea: The better the program “knows” you, the better search results it can bring back to you.
                

“AI is not some next-generation technology that will be available in 20 years. It’s being used now, across our economy, and the potential economic benefit for fleet operators is immense,” said Hoyoung Pak, head of transportation, logistics and supply chain at Uptake, an AI transportation software firm.
                

John Reed, chief information officer at Aim NationaLease, added: “Like most disruptive technologies, there is an enormous upside potential to AI when properly used.”
                

As time goes on, some trucking executives envision an expanding role for AI within the transportation industry.
                

Sarah Riggs Amico, executive chairwoman at Jack Cooper, said: “Eventually, I suspect AI will be used to manage the efficiency of the entire supply chain in our industry — including the use of deep neural networks and predictive analytics to prepare for likely weather events or traffic disruptions, for example.”
                

 
Scott Sullivan, CFO and chief information officer at Pitt Ohio, yearns for the day — which is being promised by AI technologists — that AI is infused into every aspect of logistics planning, particularly in the less-than-truckload sector.
                

“Can you imagine — if you can ‘AI’ the whole LTL process based on history — how you can drive efficiency into the customer experience and the process?”
                

Brian Wood, director for enterprise technology services at Ryder System Inc., has similar hopes: “I’m looking forward to when the systems we support, as well as the trucks and smart warehouse systems, are calling me to tell me there’s something I should be aware of. This is already happening with real-time route optimization and monitoring.”
                

Even today, scores of productivity tools currently are being completely remade by AI.

It’s a great time to take a look at what’s out there, and where the software category is headed.
                

Here’s a representative sampling:
                

• Personalize Your E-mails With an AI Web Crawler: Aizimov adds a personal touch to your ­e-mails by auto-crawling the web for interesting insights on the people you do business with.
                

“All you have to put in are four things: first name, last name, e-mail and company,” said Jerome Devosse, Aizimov’s CEO. After that, the software searches Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks for insights about your contacts, including their likes, dislikes and passions.
                

“If the guy, for example, has done a marathon, I may finish the e-mail by saying, ‘By the way, I also did a marathon in Rome, here’s my time — how do we compare?’ to get their attention,” Devosse said.
                

Aizimov also works for you after you send your e-mail, collecting info on the types of e-mails you send that get the best responses, based on tone, length, content and time-of-day sent.
                

Using these insights, it will put together a draft of an e-mail the next time you want to communicate with your marathon buddy — which you can use as is or customize to your own tastes.
                

• Leverage Microsoft Office’s New AI: Stop one for millions of computer users each day, Microsoft Office has been given an AI face-lift. It will now automatically transcribe your conference calls into text and even organize that text with automatic subtitles.
                

Joe White, owner of CostDown Consulting, sees calls-to-text as a natural for trucking.
                

“Transcribing phone calls to searchable text would provide an excellent tool for researching recruiting calls,” White said. “From driver conversations, we could identify, quantify and rank their ‘must-have’ job influences by the questions they ask. The top influences could then be used to adjust and improve a company’s employment offering. From recruiter conversations, we could analyze how effectively they communicate their company’s employment offering and what additional training they may need.”
                

PowerPoint users will also appreciate the new AI version of the program, which can automatically create a presentation after you type a line or two of text over each slide you plan to use.
                

And Office search is now completely powered by AI. Cortana, an AI assistant that made its debut in Microsoft Windows 10, also has been integrated into Microsoft Office.
                

• Transcribe Your Phone Conversations: Tetra uses AI to translate any conversation you have into searchable text. Almost immediately after you finish a phone call using Tetra, you’ll receive a detailed text synopsis of the conversation in your inbox — searchable by keyword.
                

All of Tetra’s transcripts also include two-way speaker ID, so you’ll always know by looking at the text who said what.
                

Eva, Voicera’s AI assistant, is another app in this genre that’s also worth checking out.
                

• Send Out for an AI Rewrite: If you’re looking for a different take on some text you’ve just written, SpinnerChief will rework it for you so you can present it from a slightly different perspective. The software has also been designed to ensure the text it produces is optimized for the search engines.
                

Another AI program in the same genre is Writer. Writer is designed to learn everything you need to know about a specific topic by crawling the web and then presenting the results to you in a text article. The program works best when you instruct it to research an extremely narrow topic.
                

• Index Your Photo Library With AI: Imagga is able to analyze your entire photo library, studying one picture at a time at blazingly fast speed and then tagging each image so you’ll be able to quickly call up any image with a text search.
                

• Find Images for Your Color Theme: Everypixel bests the other stock images libraries on the web by offering you the ability to find an image based on the color scheme you’re using for your ad or presentation.
                

• Add an AI Tax Adviser to Your Virtual Staff: While most of us try not to spend all of our time thinking about taxes, Andy can’t get enough. He’s at it every day, making sure you get all the tax deductions you deserve by keeping a steady eye on everything you do financially, 24/7.
                

The result: Instead of frantically trying to put together your deductions at midnight on April 14, Andy will have them all ready for you when it comes time to sit down and tell Uncle Sam all about the year you had. Andy also stays current on all the tax laws and tax changes that impact your business. And he’ll auto-prepare your tax return for you, too.
                

• Have an AI Assistant Schedule Your Meetings: There are a number of AI assistants dedicated to using e-mail to auto-schedule your meetings for you using e-mail. Those worth a try include Julie Desk, Kono, Clara and Hire Amy.
                

• Pick an AI Personal Assistant to Your Liking: Unlike task-specific AI apps, AI personal assistants attempt to handle a number of everyday tasks for you simultaneously. It’s a popular AI productivity category, so you’ll have plenty to check out.
                

Zoom.AI, for example, is designed to help organize your schedule, prepare meeting notes, handle travel logistics, search for files, order a car and more.

Braina and Vesper can perform similar functions.
                

“I do think items such as Zoom.AI can help save time if plugged in correctly to the right tools,” Ryder’s Wood said.
                

Wood said his own experience with AI-driven productivity apps is that the simpler ones tend to work right out of the box, while more sophisticated applications may need a bit of training for optimum performance.
                

Besides off-the-shelf products, people who follow AI in trucking have their own list of dream AI products they would like to see in the industry.
                

“One very useful AI application would be a driver satisfaction tool that analyzes driver performance and activities to forecast which drivers may be considering quitting,” said CostDown’s White. “Using factors such as declining wages and hours worked, increased absences, load refusals, excessive home time and complaints to driver managers, the app would generate a list of dissatisfied drivers, allowing managers an opportunity to address individual driver problems before they result in another turnover.”
                

Aim NationaLease’s Reed added: “The difference between AI and old-fashioned data analytics is AI can modify its recommendations in seconds and keep up with any new set of events in near-real time. Yes, today it’s an overused buzzword. But there’s meat behind the concept.”

They are identifying faces, recognizing spoken words, reading medical scans and even carrying on their own conversations.ImageThe original image and three more visualizations after it was put through a neural network. The first layer is primarily detecting edges and color. The other layers begin recognizing more complex concepts like flowers, vases and lemons.Credit...The Building Blocks of InterpretabilityAll this is done through so-called neural networks, which are complex computer algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. But these neural networks create a problem that scientists are trying to solve: It is not always easy to tell how the machines arrive at their conclusions.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.
