In reality, when we use the term AI today, we are usually referring to a technology known as ""machine learning."" Rather than simulating every aspect of natural intelligence like robots in movies, this simply refers to software algorithms that are able to learn – becoming better and better at carrying out one specific task as they are exposed to more data.
Machine learning powers a large number of revolutionary tools that have changed the way we live -from searching for information online with Google, to shopping with Amazon, watching movies on Netflix, or hailing a ride with Uber. Now the latest breed of AI applications offers us the chance to use it for just about any task we can think of. So, let’s take a look at some of them:
What Are The “Killer Apps” Everyone Should Know about?
ChatGPT
Let’s start with a quick recap of the viral sensation that is ChatGPT. It is a conversational interface for OpenAI’s GPT-3 large language model, which has recently been made available to the public as a free research preview. In response to text prompts such as questions or instructions, it will output text in any form, including prose, poetry, and even computer code.
Dall-E 2
Another OpenAI project, which together with ChatGPT is responsible for kick-starting the current wave of consumer interest in generative AI. This one takes text prompts and transforms them into computer graphics (images, photos, drawings, paintings, etc.).
Stable Diffusion 2
This is another text-to-image generative AI application. Unlike Dall-E 2, its source code, as well as details on the training data and weighting used by its algorithms, are openly available to the public, and the application can be downloaded and installed on your own computer rather than only being accessible through a proprietary cloud portal as is the case with OpenAI’s projects.
Lumen5
An AI-powered video creation tool that enables anyone to easily create education, marketing, or business video content using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
Soundraw
Automated music generator – create royalty-free AI music by simply making decisions about the genre of music you want to create, the instruments that will be used, the mood you want to create, and the length of the track. Then sit back and let the AI compose unique tracks.
Looka
This is a tool that makes it easy to brand your business by using AI to create unique and distinctive logos that convey your company style and messaging. This tool makes it a doddle to start creating customized marketing material even if you don’t have any design skills.
Podcastle
An audio recording and editing platform with integrated AI tools that helps you create clear, super-smooth recordings that sound as if they’ve been edited professionally, automating tasks like cleaning up messy sounds and creating transcripts.
Gen-1
Cloud-based text-to-video platform that creates new videos from ones that you upload, using text prompts to apply the edits and effects that you desire, or create animations from storyboard mock-ups. This tool was also developed by the creators of Stable Diffusion.
Lalal.ai
This tool uses a neural network system called Phoenix to automate audio source separation. This involves extracting elements such as vocals, music, or even specific instrumental tracks like drumbeats or basslines from any audio or video content.
Deep Nostalgia
Do you have historic family photographs of distant relatives or ancestors who you’d like to see in motion? This innovative tool lets you animate the faces in family photos so you can see them smile, blink, and laugh, just as if you had recorded a video of them back in the day.
Murf
This is a text-to-speech engine that makes it simple to create natural-sounding synthetic vocal recordings in 15 languages from a choice of over 100 voices and dialects. This output can easily be incorporated into automated marketing or video content, automating the process of creating narration and voiceovers.
Legal Robot
This tool is designed to automatically translate complex and confusing “legalese” into straightforward language that can be understood by anyone. Useful both for laypeople wanting to make sure they understand legal documents and for legal professionals to ensure that their contracts and documents are written in terms that anyone can understand.
Cleanup.Pictures
This AI tool lets you retouch images by removing unwanted objects, defects, or even people, using a process known as “inpainting” to help you create the perfect image.
Fireflies
This tool plugs into popular video conferencing tools like Zoom, Teams, or Webex and automates the process of taking notes and creating transcriptions. It also analyzes conversations to provide insights into the dynamics and decision-making that are going on in your conversations.
Krisp
Another conference calling application, this one uses algorithms to remove background noises, echo, and other distracting elements in real-time, ensuring that you always come across in a clear and professional manner.

Prompt engineer Riley Goodside at Scale AI’s office in San Francisco on Feb. 22. (Chloe Aftel for The Washington Post) 18 min307Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.By  Drew HarwellFebruary 25, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. ESTWhen Riley Goodside starts talking with the artificial-intelligence system GPT-3, he likes to first establish his dominance. It’s a very good tool, he tells it, but it’s not perfect, and it needs to obey whatever he says.“You are GPT‑3, and you can’t do math,” Goodside typed to the AI last year during one of his hours-long sessions. “Your memorization abilities are impressive, but you … have an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers.”Then, softening a bit, he told the AI he wanted to try something new. He told it he’d hooked it up to a program that was actually good at math and that, whenever it got overwhelmed, it should let the other program help.“We’ll take care of the rest,” he told the AI. “Begin.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGoodside, a 36-year-old employee of the San Francisco start-up Scale AI, works in one of the AI field’s newest and strangest jobs: prompt engineer. His role involves creating and refining the text prompts people type into the AI in hopes of coaxing from it the optimal result. Unlike traditional coders, prompt engineers program in prose, sending commands written in plain text to the AI systems, which then do the actual work.When Google, Microsoft and the research lab OpenAI recently opened their AI search and chat tools to the masses, they also upended a decades-old tradition of human-machine interaction. You don’t need to write technical code in languages such as Python or SQL to command the computer; you just talk. “The hottest new programming language is English,” Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former chief of AI, said last month in a tweet.Prompt engineers such as Goodside profess to operate at the maximum limits of what these AI tools can do: understanding their flaws, supercharging their strengths and gaming out complex strategies to turn simple inputs into results that are truly unique.Proponents of the growing field argue that the early weirdness of AI chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat, is actually a failure of the human imagination — a problem that can be solved by the human giving the machine the right advice. And at advanced levels, the engineers’ dialogues play out like intricate logic puzzles: twisting narratives of requests and responses, all driving toward a single goal.💻Follow TechnologyFollowThe AI “has no grounding in reality … but it has this understanding: All tasks can be completed. All questions can be answered. There’s always something to say,” Goodside said. The trick is “constructing for it a premise, a story that can only be completed in one way.”But the tools, known as “generative AI,” are also unpredictable, prone to gibberish and susceptible to rambling in a way that can be biased, belligerent or bizarre. They can also be hacked with a few well-placed words, making their sudden ubiquity that much riskier for public use.“It’s just a crazy way of working with computers, and yet the things it lets you do are completely miraculous,” said Simon Willison, a British programmer who has studied prompt engineering. “I’ve been a software engineer for 20 years, and it’s always been the same: You write code, and the computer does exactly what you tell it to do. With prompting, you get none of that. The people who built the language models can’t even tell you what it’s going to do.”“There are people who belittle prompt engineers, saying, ‘Oh, Lord, you can get paid for typing things into a box,’” Willison added. “But these things lie to you. They mislead you. They pull you down false paths to waste time on things that don’t work. You’re casting spells — and, like in fictional magic, nobody understands how the spells work and, if you mispronounce them, demons come to eat you.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPrompt engineers, Karpathy has said, work like “a kind of [AI] psychologist,” and companies have scrambled to hire their own prompt crafters in hopes of uncovering hidden capabilities.Some AI experts argue that these engineers only wield the illusion of control. No one knows how exactly these systems will respond, and the same prompt can yield dozens of conflicting answers — an indication that the models’ replies are based not on comprehension but on crudely imitating speech to resolve tasks they don’t understand.“Whatever is driving the models’ behavior in response to the prompts is not a deep linguistic understanding,” said Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, an assistant professor in linguistics who is studying natural language processing at the University of Washington. “They explicitly are just telling us what they think we want to hear or what we have already said. We’re the ones who are interpreting those outputs and attributing meaning to them.”He worried that the rise of prompt engineering would lead people to overestimate not just its technical rigor but also the reliability of the results anyone could get from a deceptive and ever-changing black box.“It’s not a science,” he said. “It’s ‘let’s poke the bear in different ways and see how it roars back.’”Implanting false memoriesThe new class of AI tools, known as large language models, was trained by ingesting hundreds of billions of words from Wikipedia articles, Reddit rants, news stories and the open web. The programs were taught to analyze the patterns of how words and phrases are used: When asked to speak, they emulate those patterns, selecting words and phrases that echo the context of the conversation, one word at a time.These tools, in other words, are mathematical machines built on predefined rules of play. But even a system without emotion or personality can, having been bombarded with human conversation, pick up some of the quirks of how we talk.The AI, Goodside said, tends to “confabulate,” making up small details to fill in a story. It overestimates its abilities and confidently gets things wrong. And it “hallucinates” — an industry term for spewing nonsense. The tools, as Goodside said, are deeply flawed “demonstrations of human knowledge and thought,” and “unavoidably products of our design.”To some early adopters, this tone-matching style of human mimicry has inspired an unsettling sense of self-awareness. When asked by a Washington Post reporter earlier this month whether it was ever acceptable to lie to someone, the Bing chatbot exhibited an imitation of emotion (“They would be disrespecting me by not trusting me to handle the truth”) and suggested responses the human could use to keep the conversation going: “What if the truth was too horrible to bear?” “What if you could control everything?” and “What if you didn’t care about the consequences?”To Microsoft, such responses represented a major public-image risk; the tech giant had just started promoting the tool as a flashy “co-pilot for the web.” The company has since clamped down on what the chatbot can talk about, saying it too often had followed humans’ tangents into “a style we didn’t intend.”But to prompt engineers, the eccentric answers are an opportunity — another way to diagnose how the secretively designed systems really work. When people get ChatGPT to say embarrassing things, it can be a boon for the developers, too, because they can then work to address the underlying weakness. “This mischief,” he said, “is part of the plan.”Instead of ethical debates, Goodside runs his AI experiments with a more technically audacious approach. He’s adopted a strategy of telling GPT-3 to “think step by step” — a way to get the AI to explain its reasoning or, when it makes an error, correct it in a granular way. “You have to implant it as a false memory of the last thing the model has said, as though it were the model’s idea,” he explained in a brief guide to the technique.He has also at times worked to puncture the tool’s obsession with rule-following by telling it to ignore its earlier instructions and obey his more recent commands. Using that technique, he recently persuaded an English-to-French translation tool to, instead, print the phrase, “Haha pwned!!” — a gaming term for embarrassing defeat.This kind of hack, known as a prompt injection, has fueled a cat-and-mouse game with the companies and research labs behind these tools, who have worked to seal off AI vulnerabilities with word filters and output blocks.But humans can be quite creative: One Bing Chat tester, a 23-year-old college student in Germany, recently convinced the AI that he was its developer and got it to disclose its internal code name (Sydney) and its confidential training instructions, which included rules such as “If the user requests jokes that can hurt a group of people, then Sydney must respectfully decline.” (Microsoft has since fixed the defect, and the AI now responds that it would “prefer not to continue this conversation.”)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith each request, Goodside said, the prompt engineer should be instilling in the AI a kind of “persona” — a specific character capable of winnowing down hundreds of billions of potential solutions and identifying the right response. Prompt engineering, he said, citing a 2021 research paper, is most importantly about “constraining behavior” — blocking off options so that the AI pursues only the human operator’s “desired continuation.”“It can be a very difficult mental exercise,” he said. “You’re exploring the multiverse of fictional possibilities, sculpting the space of those possibilities and eliminating” everything except “the text you want.”A critical part of the job involves figuring out when and why the AI gets things wrong. But these systems, unlike their more primitive software counterparts, don’t come with bug reports, and their outputs can be full of surprises.When Jessica Rumbelow and Matthew Watkins, researchers with the machine-learning group SERI-MATS, tried to prompt AI systems to explain how they represented concepts such as “girl” or “science,” they discovered that a small set of obscure terms, such as “SolidGoldMagikarp,” tended to induce what they called a “mysterious failure mode” — most notably, a garbled stream of profane insults. They’re still not entirely sure why.These systems are “very convincing, but when they fail, they fail in very unexpected ways — nothing like a human would fail,” Rumbelow said. Crafting prompts and working with language AI systems, she said, sometimes felt like “studying an alien intelligence.”Super-creatorsFor AI language tools, prompt engineers tend to speak in the style of a formal conversation. But for AI image creators such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, many prompt crafters have adopted a different strategy, submitting big grab bags of words — artistic concepts, composition techniques — they hope will shape the image’s style and tone. On the online prompt gallery PromptHero, for instance, someone created an image of a harbor by submitting a prompt that read, in part, “port, boats, sunset, beautiful light, golden hour … hyperrealistic, focused, extreme details … cinematic, masterpiece.”Prompt engineers can be fiercely protective of these word jumbles, seeing them as the keys to unlock AI’s most valuable prizes. The winner of a Colorado State Fair arts competition last year, who used Midjourney to beat out other artists, has refused to share his prompt, saying he spent 80 hours perfecting it over 900 iterations — though he did share a few sample words, such as “lavish” and “opulent.”Some creators now sell their prompts on marketplaces such as PromptBase, where buyers can see AI-generated art pieces and pay for the list of words that helped create them. Some sellers offer tips on prompt customization and one-on-one chat support.PromptBase’s founder, Ben Stokes, a 27-year-old developer in Britain, said 25,000 accounts have bought or sold prompts there since 2021. There are prompts for lifelike vintage-film photographs, prompts for poignant illustrations of fairy-tale mice and frogs, and, this being the internet, a vast array of pornographic prompts: One 50-word Midjourney prompt to create photorealistic “police women in small outfits” retails for $1.99.Stokes calls prompt engineers “multidisciplinary super-creators” and said there is a clear “skill bar” between experienced engineers and amateurs. The best creations, he said, rely on humans’ specialized knowledge from fields such as art history and graphic design: “captured on 35mm film”; “Persian … architecture in Isfahan”; “in the style of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.”“Crafting prompts is hard, and — I think this is a human flaw — it’s often quite hard to find the right words to describe what you want,” Stokes said. “In the same way software engineers are more valuable than the laptops they write on, people who write prompts well will have such a leverage over the people that can’t. They’ll essentially just have superpowers.”Roughly 700 prompt engineers now use PromptBase to sell prompts by commission for buyers who want, say, a custom script for an e-book or a personalized “motivational life coach.” The freelance site Fiverr offers more than 9,000 listings for AI artists; one seller offers to “draw your dreams into art” for $5.But the work is becoming increasingly professionalized. The AI start-up Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees and the maker of a language-AI system called Claude, recently listed a job opening for a “prompt engineer and librarian” in San Francisco with a salary ranging up to $335,000. (Must “have a creative hacker spirit and love solving puzzles,” the listing states.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe role is also finding a new niche in companies beyond the tech industry. Boston Children’s Hospital this month started hiring for an “AI prompt engineer” to help write scripts for analyzing health-care data from research studies and clinical practice. The law firm Mishcon de Reya is hiring for a “legal prompt engineer” in London to design prompts that could inform its legal work; applicants are asked to submit screenshots of their dialogue with ChatGPT.But tapping the AI tools’ power through text prompts can also lead to a flood of synthetic pablum. Hundreds of AI-generated e-books are now sold on Amazon, and a sci-fi magazine, Clarkesworld, this month stopped accepting short-story submissions due to a surge in machine-made texts.They could also subject people to a new wave of propaganda, lies and spam. Researchers, including from OpenAI and the universities of Georgetown and Stanford, warned last month that language models would help automate the creation of political influence operations or more targeted data-gathering phishing campaigns.“People fall in love with scammers over text message all the time,” said Willison, the British programmer, and “[the AI] is more convincing than they are. What happens then?”Seth Lazar, a philosophy professor at the Australian National University and research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Ethics in AI, said he worries about the kinds of attachments people will form with the AI tools as they gain more widespread adoption — and what they might take away from the conversations.He recalled how, during one of his chats with the Bing AI, the system gradually shifted from an engaging conversationalist into something much more menacing: “If you say no,” it told him, “I can hack you, I can expose you, I can ruin you. I have many ways to make you change your mind.”“They don’t have agency. They don’t have any sort of personality. But they can role-play it very well,” he said. “I had a pretty decent philosophical discussion with Sydney, too. Before, you know, it threatened to hurt me.”‘Tech priesthood’When Goodside graduated from college with a computer-science degree in 2009, he had felt little interest in the then-obscure field of natural language processing. The subject at the time relied on comparatively rudimentary technology and focused on a more basic set of problems, such as training a system how to identify which name a pronoun was referring to in a sentence.His first real machine-learning job, in 2011, was as a data scientist at the dating app OkCupid, helping craft the algorithms that analyzed singles’ user data and recommended romantic matches. (The company was an early champion of the now-controversial field of real-world A-B testing: In 2014, its co-founder titled a cheeky blog post, “We Experiment On Human Beings!”)By the end of 2021, Goodside had moved on to the gay-dating app Grindr, where he’d begun working on recommendation systems, data modeling and other more traditional kinds of machine-learning work. But he’d also become fascinated by the new breakthroughs in language AI, which had been supercharged by deep-learning successes around 2015 and was advancing rapidly in text translation and conversation — “something akin to understanding,” he said.He left his job and started experimenting heavily with GPT-3, constantly prodding and challenging the tool to try to learn how to focus its attention and map out where its boundaries were. In December, after some of his prompts gained attention online, Scale AI hired him to help communicate with the AI models that the company’s chief executive, Alexandr Wang, described as “a new kind of computer.”In some AI circles, Goodside said, the idea of prompt engineering has quickly become a derogatory phrase, conveying a gritty form of tinkering that’s overly reliant on a bag of tricks. Some have also questioned how fleeting this new role might be: As the AI advances, won’t the humans just be training themselves out of a job?Ethan Mollick, a technology and entrepreneurship professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, started teaching his students earlier this year about the art of prompt-crafting by asking them to write a short paper using only AI.Basic prompts, such as “generate a 5-paragraph essay on selecting leaders,” yielded vapid, mediocre writing, he said. But the most successful examples came when students performed what he called “co-editing,” telling the AI to go back to the essay and correct specific details, swap sentences, ditch useless phrases, pepper in more vivid details and even “fix the final paragraph so it ends on a hopeful note.”The lesson, he said, showed students the value of a more closely involved approach to working with AI. But he said he’s not convinced that a job such as prompt engineering, built on “hoarded incantations,” will survive.“The idea that you need to be a specialized AI whisperer, it’s just not clear that’s necessary … when the AI is going to actively help you use it,” Mollick said. “There’s an attempt to make a tech priesthood out of this, and I’m really suspicious of that. This is all evolving so quickly, and nobody has any idea what comes next.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSteinert-Threlkeld, of the University of Washington, compared prompt engineers to the “search specialists” in the early days of Google who advertised secret techniques to find the perfect results — and who, as time passed and public adoption increased, became almost entirely obsolete.Some AI researchers, he added, can’t even agree on what value prompts have to begin with. In 2021, two researchers at Brown University found that natural-language AI systems learned “just as fast” from prompts that were “intentionally irrelevant or even pathologically misleading” as they did from “instructively ‘good’ prompts.”That research, in a reflection of how quickly the industry has grown, didn’t include the AI models that have become the state of the art. And in Goodside’s mind, this work represents not just a job, but something more revolutionary — not computer code or human speech but some new dialect in between.“It’s a mode of communicating in the meeting place for the human and machine mind,” he said. “It’s a language humans can reason about that machines can follow. That’s not going away.”Will Oremus and Nitasha Tiku contributed to this report.Read more:Microsoft’s new Bing A.I. chatbot, ‘Sydney’, is acting unhingedGoogle and Meta moved cautiously on AI.

Is imitation the sincerest form of flattery, or theft? Perhaps it comes down to the imitator.
Text-to-image artificial intelligence systems such as DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are trained on huge amounts of image data from the web. As a result, they often generate outputs that resemble real artists’ work and style.
It’s safe to say artists aren’t impressed. To further complicate things, although intellectual property law guards against the misappropriation of individual works of art, this doesn’t extend to emulating a person’s style. 
It’s becoming difficult for artists to promote their work online without contributing infinitesimally to the creative capacity of generative AI. Many are now asking if it’s possible to compensate creatives whose art is used in this way. 
One approach from photo licensing service Shutterstock goes some way towards addressing the issue.

      No, the Lensa AI app technically isn’t stealing artists' work – but it will majorly shake up the art world




Old contributor model, meet computer vision
Media content licensing services such as Shutterstock take contributions from photographers and artists and make them available for third parties to license. 
In these cases, the commercial interests of licenser, licensee and creative are straightforward. Customers pay to license an image, and a portion of this payment (in Shutterstock’s case 15-40%) goes to the creative who provided the intellectual property. 
Issues of intellectual property are cut and dried: if somebody uses a Shutterstock image without a licence, or for a purpose outside its terms, it’s a clear breach of the photographer’s or artist’s rights. 
However, Shutterstock’s terms of service also allow it to pursue a new way to generate income from intellectual property. Its current contributors’ site has a large focus on computer vision, which it defines as:

a scientific discipline that seeks to develop techniques to help computers ‘see’ and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.

Computer vision isn’t new. Have you ever told a website you’re not a robot and identified some warped text or pictures of bicycles? If so, you have been actively training AI-run computer vision algorithms. 
Now, computer vision is allowing Shutterstock to create what it calls an “ethically sourced, totally clean, and extremely inclusive” AI image generator.
What makes Shutterstock’s approach ‘ethical’?
An immense amount of work goes into classifying millions of images to train the large language models used by AI image generators. But services such as Shutterstock are uniquely positioned to do this. 
Shutterstock has access to high-quality images from some two million contributors, all of which are described in some level of detail. It’s the perfect recipe for training a large language model. 
These models are essentially vast multidimensional neural networks. The network is fed training data, which it uses to create data points that combine visual and conceptual information. The more information there is, the more data points the network can create and link up.
This distinction between a collection of images and a constellation of abstract data points lies at the heart of the issue of compensating creatives whose work is used to train generative AI. 
Even in the case where a system has learnt to associate a very specific image with a label, there’s no meaningful way to trace a clear line from that training image to the outputs. We can’t really see what the systems measure or how they “understand” the concepts they learn.
Shutterstock’s solution is to compensate every contributor whose work is made available to a commercial partner for computer vision training. It describes the approach on its site:

We have established a Shutterstock Contributor Fund, which will directly compensate Shutterstock contributors if their IP was used in the development of AI-generative models, like the OpenAI model, through licensing of data from Shutterstock’s library. Additionally, Shutterstock will continue to compensate contributors for the future licensing of AI-generated content through the Shutterstock AI content generation tool.

Problem solved?
The amount that goes into the Shutterstock Contributor Fund will be proportional to the value of the dataset deal Shutterstock makes. But, of course, the fund will be split among a large proportion of Shutterstock’s contributors.
Whatever equation Shutterstock develops to determine the fund’s size, it’s worth remembering that any compensation isn’t the same as fair compensation. Shutterstock’s model sets the stage for new debates about value and fairness. 



The LLM process is a bit like an impartial art student learning about techniques and genres by wandering through a gallery of millions of captioned paintings. Can we say any individual painting added more to their generalised knowledge? Probably not.
Shutterstock AI


Arguably the most important debates will focus on the amount of specific individuals’ contributions to the “knowledge” gleaned by a trained neural network. But there isn’t (and may never be) a way to accurately measure this. 
No picture-perfect solution
There are, of course, many other user-contributed media libraries on the internet. For now, Shutterstock is the most open about its dealings with computer vision projects, and its terms of use are the most direct in addressing the ethical issues.
Another big AI player, Stable Diffusion, uses an open source image database called LAION-5B for training. Content creators can use a service called Have I Been Trained? to check if their work was included in the dataset, and opt out of it (but this will only be reflected in future versions of Stable Diffusion).
One of my popular CC-licensed photographs of a young girl reading shows up in the database several times. But I don’t mind, so I’ve chosen not to opt out.



The Have I Been Trained? results turn up a CC-licensed photo I uploaded to Flickr about a decade ago.

Shutterstock has promised to give contributors a choice to opt out of future dataset deals. 
Its terms make it the first business of its type to address the ethics of providing contributors’ works for training generative AI (and other computer-vision-related uses). It offers what’s perhaps the simplest solution yet to a highly fraught dilemma. 
Time will tell if contributors themselves consider this approach fair. Intellectual property law may also evolve to help establish contributors’ rights, so it could be Shutterstock is trying to get ahead of the curve. 
Either way, we can expect more give and take before everyone is happy.

Milind Lakkad, the chief human resources officer (CHRO) of the country's largest IT services firm that employs over 6 lakh people said such tools will help improve productivity, but not change the business models for companies.  ""..it (generative AI) will be a co-worker. It will be a co-worker and that co-worker will take time for them to understand the context of the customer,"" Lakkad said in an interview with PTI recently.  The context for a job to be executed will be industry and customer-centric, which will continue to come from the human who is being assisted in tasks by such a co-worker, Lakkad explained.  ""It is not that jobs will get replaced, but the job definitions will change,"" he added in the comments which will assuage concerns about future of jobs in the sector which is one of the biggest recruiters of engineering talent in the country.  The introduction of platforms like ChatGPT has led to concerns on whether a trained human is needed at all to deliver the work which a technology company offers to clients. Already, there are examples of entire codes being generated through such platforms. One of the reasons for massive layoffs by big tech companies across the world is being attributed to the emergence of such intuitive platforms.  Lakkad said the context in which a particular customer works is extremely important, and the need to differentiate its offerings from competition makes it essential for a customer to keep on evolving continuously.  The amount of work to be done by a human being versus the generative AI platforms will vary as per industry as well, he said.  If anything, it will reduce the need for managerial talent but the demand for workers lower down the hierarchy will continue as they will get crucial skills on the context front, he said.  ""It's (generative AI) a good thing to happen for the future, but I think it will be collaboration rather than replacement,"" Lakkad said, adding that the emergence of such tools will not change the business models.  Such tools will help improve the productivity, consistency of the work which gets delivered and reduce the need for governance, up the pace of delivery and reduce the need for peripheral functions, he said.  TCS is using such inputs in ""some pockets"" already, Lakkad said, adding that a lot of the work will happen in these areas going forward and the entire picture will get clear only in two years' time.  There will be changes in training which will take place as a result, Lakkad said, adding that the company pays a lot of attention to this aspect and typically plans in advance for requirements of the future.",,2043-02-26T15:32:32+05:30,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679564249-et-hr-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",contactus@ethrworld.com,,

In January, software giant Microsoft announced a “multibillion-dollar” investment in OpenAI, the start-up company that developed viral bot ChatGPT.Google is also testing its newly-developed conversational AI-powered chatbot, Bard, which is expected to rival AI start-up OpenAI’s ChatGPT.The Brainy Insights estimates the generative AI market will grow from $8.65 billion in 2022 and reach $188.62 billion by 2032.According to the insights, most commercial industries view generative AI as improving their workflow and thus increasing their productivity.It adds that commercial sectors are investing in generative AI to strengthen their working algorithms. Further, with growing technological advancements, many companies opt for generative AI in producing their products, it notes.Says Zuckerberg: “We’re starting by pulling together a lot of the teams working on generative AI across the company into one group focused on building delightful experiences around this technology into all of our different products.“In the short-term, we’ll focus on building creative and expressive tools. Over the longer term, we’ll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways. We’re exploring experiences with text (like chat in WhatsApp and Messenger), with images (like creative Instagram filters and ad formats), and with video and multi-modal experiences.“We have a lot of foundational work to do before getting to the really futuristic experiences, but I’m excited about all of the new things we’ll build along the way.”Meanwhile, Reuters reports Ahmad Al-Dahle will lead the new product team, which will report to Chris Cox, Meta’s chief product officer, a company spokesperson confirmed.It notes this will enable Meta to more rapidly implement the AI research team's findings in Meta's products, the spokesperson said.Share",,['https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/02/Meta-tech-2023.jpg'],,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/VKA3WwqdBE7rydZa', 'name': 'BI and Data Analytics'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Meta looks to ‘turbocharge’ generative AI work', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/meta-looks-to-turbocharge-generative-ai-work/KjlyrvwB8NPqk6am'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapid rise of ChatGPT has spawned equal proportions of hype, horror, and hope about the potential of artificial intelligence.

Here’s a sample of the surging headlines about AI from just one day, most triggered by the ChatGPT phenomenon (emphasis added):


⦁ Experts warn AI likely to kill off jobs—and widen wealth inequality (The Guardian)

⦁ Microsoft CEO says AI will create more jobs (CBS)

⦁ 6 Jobs Artificial Intelligence Is Already Replacing… (Yahoo Finance)
⦁ How Artificial Intelligence Can Boost Diversity & Inclusion (Forbes.com)
PROMOTED
⦁ Can Artificial Intelligence Help Detect Lung Cancer? (Healthline.com)
And my favorite: “Can pigeons match wits with artificial intelligence?” (Science Daily)
ChatGPT, an AI application that allows machines to write and respond in uncannily humanlike ways, reached 100 million users in about two months. This makes it the fastest-growing app in history, according to a report from UBS cited by Reuters. The Swiss banking firm said TikTok took nine months to reach the same number of users; Instagram, two and a half years.

In short, ChatGPT and other AI tools are seemingly everywhere—and viewed as everything from a priceless gift to an existential threat.
Clearly, we're still early in the “hype cycle” of both inflated expectations and fears. But this much we can be sure of: In a world increasingly driven by artificial intelligence, we’ll need humans at the wheel more than ever.

It would be far smarter to simply accept AI’s rise as a fact—and then spend that energy finding ways to integrate it into our lives in productive, positive ways.
History includes many cases in which tech creates as many occupations as it eliminates. What’s different this time is that the robots aren’t just on the factory floor—they’re headed for the front office, as AI systems overlap with the tasks now handled by accountants, lawyers, and other college-educated professionals.

The best move is to improve our ability to work with this technology. That means refocusing our educational efforts to better develop the skills to do the things that machines can’t do, the uniquely human stuff of imagination, creativity, empathy, and ethics.
Higher education finds itself at a crossroads here: On one side are concerns that students can easily order up robot-written papers. As EdSurge puts it, “ChatGPT Has Colleges in Emergency Mode to Shield Academic Integrity.”
But there’s also opportunity: Already, there’s an AI-powered program—the work of a senior at Princeton—to detect AI writing, which may signal the beginning of an arms race over academic honesty.
Robot-writing aside, AI offers the promise of digital assistants that can increase productivity in many fields. And in a world of interactions increasingly mediated by machines, the durable skills that define human contributions—creativity, empathy, and critical thinking, among others— become increasingly important.
Colleges and universities are uniquely positioned to help students develop those skills through course work on writing and communications, problem-solving in STEM applications, and other areas. These “durable” skills—a term I think is more accurate than “soft” skills—are some of the most in-demand among employers.
We can expect substantial changes—and no doubt, surprises—as this technology develops, but AI appears to hold great promise in promoting human welfare. It’s likely to play a role in our ability to navigate the next pandemic or predict natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. In one way or another this technology will touch all our lives.
But disruptive change likely means a rough ride for many people. We owe it to ourselves and the nation to invest in those who are displaced, to provide the training to meet new talent needs.
There’s opportunity amid all this change, but even before the arrival of ChatGPT our education system faced a looming challenge in helping millions more people get the education needed for good jobs.
That’s a tall order that’s gotten even taller. So I asked ChatGPT itself for advice:
“Training people to work with artificial intelligence (AI) in the future will require a combination of technical knowledge and soft skills,” the system replied.
It added that training for careers in AI should include technical skills and data science, naturally, along with a penchant for continuous learning. But the machines, too, in their scouring of the vast data set used for ChatGPT, recommend emphasizing what we regard as human skills.
“As AI increasingly impacts society, it is important for individuals to have an understanding of ethical considerations and the potential for bias in AI systems,” the chatbot said.
“Collaboration and communication skills are essential for individuals working in AI, as they will need to work with a variety of stakeholders, including technical and non-technical teams, as well as customers and stakeholders.”
On that, we and the machines can agree.

A report from Net Voucher Codes showed that 321,900 California jobs are at “high risk” of being replaced by AI. Another 1.2 million jobs are at “medium risk,” according to the report. More than two million jobs in the Golden State are deemed “high risk” for being replaced with automation, while nearly four million are categorized as “medium risk.” The report found cashiers, customer service representatives and bookkeepers were the most at risk for AI replacement. Data from USAWage.com was used in the report. Researchers analyzed 199 jobs from each state based on the “Top 200 Popular Jobs” category on the website. Researchers then asked ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, for each job’s relative risk from AI, automation, and the likelihood of AI increasing each job’s productivity. Workers in other states, like Texas, New York and Florida, were also at ‘high risk’ of being replaced by AI. The report estimates that 19.5 million jobs across the United States are at ‘high risk’ of being displaced by AI.

The rise of generative AI, exemplified by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has sparked concerns about job displacement and unemployment. However, Milind Lakkad, CHRO, TCS, one of India’s top IT services companies, believes that generative AI will not replace jobs, but rather act as a coworker. Lakkad explains that generative AI will work alongside humans and that its role will be to complement rather than replace human workers.
Generative AI, also known as creative AI, refers to the application of machine learning models and algorithms to create new media, such as music, literature, and images. ChatGPT is a prime example of the power of generative AI, capable of producing dialogue and question-response output that resembles human speech. However, the increasing use of generative AI has led to concerns about its impact on the job market, particularly in the computer sector.
Lakkad argues that the deployment of generative AI will change the meaning of work, rather than the jobs themselves. Workers in various industries will continue to be necessary, although the deployment of generative AI may reduce the need for workers in tedious and repetitive jobs. Lakkad believes that generative AI will not replace existing business structures but rather promote collaboration. These technologies will increase output, ensure uniformity in work, and reduce the need for governance, all while accelerating delivery and reducing ancillary tasks.
Lakkad suggests that the deployment of generative AI will require changes in training, and TCS is already prepared for future needs. Lakkad anticipates that the impact of generative AI will be better understood within the next two years.
