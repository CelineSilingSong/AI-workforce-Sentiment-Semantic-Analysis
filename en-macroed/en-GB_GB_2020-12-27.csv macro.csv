Building the better battery may be too big a job for humans alone, according to researchers at the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, so the researchers are enlisting the help of artificial intelligence and robots.


In 2016, JCESR Director George Crabtree announced the group had settled on an organic flow battery to provide energy storage on the grid longer and cheaper than lithium-ion can. Such a battery would rely on a combination of molecules made from earth-abundant, low-cost elements like carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

The question is, which combination?

‚ÄúThere are thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of candidates out there,‚Äù Crabtree said this month during Stanford University‚Äôs StorageX Symposium. ‚ÄúWe just haven't found the right one yet.‚Äù

PROMOTED
That search could take years if researchers did it the traditional way. During most of human history, researchers employed direct design, Crabtree said, by thinking of candidate molecules, making them, putting them in a battery and seeing if it works.
‚ÄúThat was dramatically changed when we started to do computational screening.‚Äù
Using computational screening, researchers could simulate hundreds or thousands of molecules on a computer much faster than synthesizing and testing them in a laboratory.

But JCESR researchers need the process to be quicker still, so they have turned to what Crabtree calls a self-driving laboratory, using artificial intelligence to find molecular structures that might satisfy the multitude of performance requirements needed for a battery, things like solubility, stability, voltage crossover, or multi-electron transfer.

‚ÄúThis is a new feature,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo with AI, instead of simulating hundreds or thousands of molecules you go immediately to the most promising five or ten and consider only those.‚Äù
That‚Äôs when the robots take over.

‚ÄúYou could then have automatic synthesis. So the laboratory, using a robot, would make the material‚Äîautomatic characterization, run it through lots of machines, send that information back to the artificial-intelligence brain here to score the material. Did it actually work? If it failed I wonder why it failed; let's try something else. So it actively learns from every cycle of this synthesis route. And this is what's coming to the fore.‚Äù
JCESR is in the ninth year of what was originally a five-year project to develop much better batteries for grid storage and transportation.
‚ÄúIf you want to have a completely carbon-free grid, you're going to have to have somewhere between 500 and 1,000 hours of continuous storage discharge,‚Äù Crabtree said, ‚Äúand this, of course, is well beyond what lithium-ion can do.‚Äù
The organic redox-flow candidate for grid storage would contain liquids infused with organic molecules that carry a charge. The organic molecules should be inexpensive, recyclable, and harmless to the environment.
""The big advantage of this so-called flow battery is that it's scalable, so if I make that tank of active ions 10 times larger I can store 10 times the energy density,"" Crabtree said at an earlier talk. ""You can't do that with a lithium-ion battery.""

Demis HassabisRocio Montoya
IN THE run up to the match, Lee Sedol was feeling confident. He was about to play an artificial intelligence that had been trained to play the board game Go. But as one of the world‚Äôs best players of the game himself, Lee thought he would easily win. ‚ÄúI thought AlphaGo was based on probability calculation and it was merely a machine,‚Äù he said at the time. Even after he lost the first game of the match, Lee believed it was just because AlphaGo had made no mistakes. Then, in the now infamous move 37 of the second game, the AI seemed to be rewriting the rules of Go and played a move no human would have dreamed of. Lee, who ultimately lost the match 4-1, was dumbstruck: ‚ÄúThis move was really creative and beautiful,‚Äù he said.
This contest marked a pivotal moment in the development of AI, and Demis Hassabis was one of the main people responsible for it. In 2010, he co-founded the research company DeepMind and began working on AIs that could play games better than people. At the time, Go was considered too hard for artificial intelligence to master. It has more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe. Yet the win over Lee in 2016 catapulted DeepMind ‚Äì and Hassabis ‚Äì to worldwide fame. AlphaGo‚Äôs victory was the biggest moment in AI since IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
Since then, Hassabis‚Äôs firm, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, has been honing its algorithms and looking beyond games. In November, its new AI, AlphaFold, ‚Ä¶

How Is Artificial Intelligence Shaping Patient Engagement Tools?


Artificial intelligence is finding its place with patient engagement tools, helping to personalize an efficient patient experience.

Although patient engagement principles are rooted in timeless concepts like good interpersonal skills and patient motivation, the technologies used to push engagement are indeed at the cutting edge. Most recently, healthcare organizations have tapped patient engagement tools that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to drive a personalized and convenient healthcare experience.







As the medical industry continues to embrace the patient as a healthcare consumer, providers and technology developers alike have sought to create a personalized healthcare experience. AI has proven to fill that gap, helping to make sense of patient data and needs and generate action items that can ideally activate the patient.
And patients are primed for this new type of technology, research has shown. In 2018, Accenture‚Äôs Consumer Survey on Digital Health showed that patients are welcoming of AI technology in healthcare. And again in 2019, patients expressed a strong interest in AI for helping to manage their own health and drive convenient care.
Healthcare organizations are beginning to respond to that need, implementing tools that leverage AI, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to aid in not just clinical operations, but in patient engagement efforts, as well.

Using chatbots for automated communication
Chatbots have begun to emerge as essential tools for providing convenient access to care. As in other service sectors, healthcare consumers want medicine that is easy to access, seamless, and frictionless. They want it to be easy to book an appointment, simple to get to their provider offices, and intuitive to engage in and manage their own care.
Except healthcare has proven anything but simple.
Medical providers have begun to adopt AI chatbots to begin to streamline the patient experience. Healthcare organizations want to create the same experience consumers have in other service sectors, even if that feels next to impossible.
‚ÄúI've often said, we need that Disney-like experience,‚Äù Kevin Pawl, MS, FACMPE, senior director of Patient Access at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, said in a previous interview.
Patients want to access their medical care quickly and easily, have all of the relevant information for getting to the hospital, and have a good interaction with their providers all in one.
‚ÄúYou're not calling a hospital with the joy of going on vacation or going on a trip or staying in a hotel,‚Äù Pawl acknowledged. ‚ÄúBut it would be awful nice if the service and the experience were similar. That's what we were trying to achieve as we tap into artificial intelligence.‚Äù
AI chatbots work on the frontlines of the patient experience. For Pawl, and many other organizations, chatbots help filter out patient phone calls and refer patients to relevant resources. A patient might call the hospital looking for parking information, and instead of being placed on hold for several minutes to an hour, they will get the answer right from a chatbot.
More recently, healthcare organizations and technology developers have put AI chatbots to work to sift through patients‚Äô clinical needs. The chatbot might field some patient symptoms and produce recommendations for care.
Other organizations, like Intermountain Healthcare, utilized AI in a similar fashion as a COVID-19 symptom checker.
Simply installing a chatbot isn‚Äôt a patient experience cure-all, however. Patients may get fed-up with the technology, which could actually have a negative impact on satisfaction, most experts agree.
In 2020, as more organizations began deploying the tools as part of their COVID-19 hotlines, evidence emerged that chatbots that seemed human-like, competent, and referred patients to resources that actually answered their questions were rated more highly.
Organizations should thus be judicious about which AI chatbots they implement. Additionally, they should test which functions are well-served by a chatbot and which require human interaction. This may vary based on typical call center requests, community needs, and patient demographics.


Tapping risk assessments for patient outreach
Similar to the artificial intelligence used as part of symptom checkers, the tools can also work for improving patient outreach. Healthcare organizations conduct patient outreach based on health data and key risk factors. Patients who fit certain risk factors may warrant outreach about chronic disease management plans or referrals to social determinants of health services.
But again, sifting through that patient data can prove a daunting task, leaving room for AI. Some organizations are deploying the technology to first risk stratify patients and then push out automated patient outreach messages either via text message, email, telephone, or a combination of the three.
CommonSpirit Health, for example, recently adopted AI to identify high-risk patients, predict their healthcare needs, and push out targeted text message outreach. The tool from Docent Health will help address medical needs outside the four walls of the hospital, according to CommonSpirit‚Äôs System Vice President of Population Health and Innovation Policy Alisahah Cole, MD.
‚ÄúIt initially started out as a pilot in one of our markets that had a pretty significant amount of patients with Medicaid as well as Medicare, and was really looking at how we help patients navigate through different clinical episodes of care,‚Äù Cole previously told¬†PatientEngagementHIT.
‚ÄúIf someone was coming in for a right knee replacement or somebody was pregnant and having a baby those are considered episodes of care. So how do we help patients navigate through not just our own healthcare system, but also through all of the resources that they may need in order to have a successful clinical outcome?‚Äù
In Illinois, similar AI technology helped Medical Home Network, a managed care organization, identify members who were high-risk for COVID-19 infection and refer them to testing sources.
For both organizations, understanding the right risk factors, medium for patient outreach, and messaging proved crucial. According to Cole, text message outreach was preferable because most Americans own a cell phone, although not everyone has a phone that lets them download apps.
Additionally, offering patient outreach in multiple languages and incorporating considerations for social determinants of health also made patient messaging more actionable for both organizations.


Utilizing NLP for patient health literacy, patient portal use
As more patients gain access to their patient portals and clinical notes‚Äîsomething mandated by the 21st Century Cures Act and going into effect come April‚Äîmedical providers have expressed concern about patients understanding that data.
Those concerns are not entirely unfounded. Patient health literacy is generally low, so it might be hard for a patient to see her clinical notes and know exactly what they mean. Natural language processing, a form of artificial intelligence, may be able to fill in that gap.
In 2017, researchers wrote in the Journal of Medical Internet Research indicated that NLP could sift through the medical language in a clinical note or patient portal and give a patient a layperson translation.
In a follow-up 2018 report, researchers found that NLP programs need to offer a good display for patients and improve the way they define medical terms that vary depending on the context. Additionally, NLP systems need to account for clinicians who use abbreviations, misspell words, or have illegible handwriting.
As medicine becomes more digitized‚Äîand as it answers calls for more personalization‚ÄîAI and related technologies will become more important. This technology allows providers to not just understand more about a patient‚Äôs health, but to target interventions and outreach to drive patient engagement.

It simulates natural intelligence in machines to learn and imitate people's behavior. These machines can learn through experience and perform tasks similar to humans..Like other emerging innovations in the past, AI has the ability to make employees more efficient, improve economic growth, and make life easier for millions of people. Governments at all levels must debate policies that help maximize the advantages of AI and reduce their risks..AI would reshape government in two ways, according to the Centre for Public Impact. First, the speed, reliability, and consistency of government results will be improved. Secondly, it will allow us to reconsider the structure of the government itself. As the world shifts rapidly around it, the government now needs to think about these challenges or it risks losing out on the major benefits that this technology provides..Artificial intelligence is now helping to run the government with intelligent apps doing everything we can't easily do on our own, from eliminating backlogs and reducing costs to managing duties, such as predicting fraudulent transactions and recognizing criminal suspects through facial recognition. Even so, while we anticipate AI-based technology to radically change in the years ahead, the nature of many occupations is already evolving and the aspects of government operations are revolutionizing..Risks and challenges often emerge with advantages. Some important challenges for AI are bias, protection, transparency, awareness of employees, and federal budgets and procurement. However, unemployment is the most frightening aspect of artificial intelligence when we ignore the hypothetical AI takeover scenario. As public service providers, governments should be worried about the effect of AI on human employment in government. Governments need to ensure that workers concentrate on higher value-added tasks, or migrate into the private sector to mitigate the effect of possible unemployment due to automation..Indeed, the introduction of AI in company and government entails risks and challenges. But, much like the two opposite faces of a coin, there are many possibilities for AI as well. It could facilitate more informed and customized products &amp; services, internal process efficiencies, improved cybersecurity, and reduced risks due to AI-related opportunities..The government's use of artificial and augmented intelligence (AI) grows as the use of these technologies and techniques continues to evolve. Building better governance requires difficult change management and consideration of people's desires and concerns for a brighter future..It is most important to note that AI has the power to influence almost any area of government. If the private and public sectors could work together and both contribute to an ethical AI regulatory framework, we have a chance to prevent mistakes of the past and to create a better future..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

And although a few years ago this might seem like an aphorism taken from one of Asimov's works, it is a reality that has ended up reaching us as humans and that no longer belongs to the field of science fiction and speculation..Within the world of video games, we could summarize and define artificial intelligence as the techniques used by developers to design the behavior of famous NPCs (Non Playable Characters). However, this is a definition that has become increasingly concise in the face of a technology that has been growing along with the video game industry itself, and that now not only focuses on determining the behavior of adversaries, but which is capable of designing increasingly demanding maps, levels and challenges for players. In some online casino list, they offer some games equipped with AI technology..The first steps.The origin of Artificial Intelligence in video games occurs before the industry itself became an essential part of popular culture worldwide. One of the best known precedents for the use of this technology in a game dates back to the 1950s, with computer chess titles that were developed based on the MiniMax algorithm. This software had the ability to analyze the position of the pieces on the board to choose the best possible move. Starting in the seventies, with video games revolutionizing the market and the entertainment experiences of users, Artificial Intelligence began to play a key role in the conception and development of the titles of major brands..In 1972 Pong, your opponent was already able to move based on the movement of the ball you hit to return the impact, while Space Invaders gave clear signs of how the enemies evolved and were increasingly intelligent, challenging the players who they spent hours in the arcade trying to pass each of the levels..For its part, in the eighties Pac-Man took another step, since it was the first video game that featured a route search system for enemies, who were able to more easily decipher the path that the player took under certain circumstances.
