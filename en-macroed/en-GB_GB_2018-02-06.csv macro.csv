Start-ups










 




The objective of the new Business Finland programme, AI Business, is to make Finland the best country in the world to develop and utilise artificial intelligence and platform economy and to build global ecosystems and test platforms to attract investment.
The AI Business program funds Finnish start-up, SME, midcap and large companies in all fields developing and utilising AI and platform economy in business. The programme also offers international networks and export services like matching selected companies with large global companies.
The four-year AI Business programme’s (2018-2022) budget is EUR 200 million, of which Business Finland covers approximately half. In addition EUR 60 million can be used e.g. to fund digital platforms, resulting in significant network effects.

Humans ignore the coming AI revolution at their peril.Artificial intelligence aims to replace the human mind, not simply make industry more efficient.Modern civilization needs employment — not simply for our livelihoods, but for our emotional wellbeing.monsitj / Getty ImagesFeb. 7, 2018, 9:44 AM ESTBy Subhash KakRobots have transformed industrial manufacturing, and now they are being rolled out for food production and restaurant kitchens. Already, artificial intelligence (AI) machines can do many tasks where learning and judgment is required, including self-driving cars, insurance assessment, stock trading, accounting, HR and many tasks in healthcare. So are we approaching a jobless future, or will new jobs replace the ones that are lost?According to the optimistic view, our current phase of increasing automation will create new kinds of employment for those who have been made redundant. There is some historical precedent for this: Over a hundred years ago, people feared that the automobile revolution would be bad for workers. But while jobs related to horse-drawn carriages disappeared, the invention of the car lead to a need for automobile mechanics; the internal combustion engine soon found applications in mining, airplanes and other new fields.The difference, however, is that today’s AI technology aims to replace the human mind, not simply make industry more efficient. This will have unprecedented consequences not predicted by the advent of the car, or the automated knitting machine.The effects of AI technology on society cannot be measured purely based on productivity.The effects of AI technology on society cannot be measured purely based on productivity. Modern civilization needs employment — not simply for our livelihoods, but for our emotional wellbeing. If AI increases to the point that a significant portion of workers are suddenly unemployed, this research suggests this could have a profound impact on our social well-being — even with the guaranteed minimum income that is being proposed by leading economists as a way to soften the effects of an increasingly jobless society.So let’s see where we stand. Automation technologies are already impacting many different aspects of the restaurant industry, and it is anticipated that they will put pressures on job availabilities for the food system workers. Self-driving cars will perhaps have an even greater impact on general employment, although they have a greater challenge in winning public trust. Still, many companies have already received permits to test self-driving car technology. General Motors has announced that it is ready to mass produce self-driving cars.So delivery and truck drivers, professors, brokers in the investment business, and accountants will likely become redundant, but so will lawyers, if a new start-up has its way. Meanwhile, information technology is already having a great impact on the education industry. Due to the challenges from online courses, and the high costs of running centralized campuses with expensive infrastructure, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has suggested that half the colleges and universities in the U.S. will close in the next couple decades. (And it’s not just in the U.S. either: The Indian Council for Technical Education (ICTE), which regulates engineering colleges in one of the world’s fastest growing economies, recently announced that 800 colleges will be shut down.)      A November 2017 report from global management consulting firm McKinsey on the effects of automation on jobs, skills and wages for the period ending in 2030 estimates that fully 50% of current work activities are automatable by technologies that have already been tested and found effective. The report predicts that in 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of activities could be automated. The report expects 400 million to 800 million people could be displaced by automation in the next 12 years, creating a challenge potentially greater than past historic shifts, at least in the modern era.One way of meeting the challenge of automation is by retraining the workforce. But this retraining will not simply be the replacing of one set of skills for another. It used to be that users of a technology needed to know how it worked; now many consumer machines are too complex to be repaired.RecommendedOpinionOpinion'Alice, Darling' isn't your average thriller OpinionOpinionMy new co-worker George Santos is a liar, a disgrace — and a danger to democracyIndeed, very few people need to know how the computer systems in a robot work; they just need to be able to interpret sensor readings and error messages. Even a car mechanic uses a computer to identify what system is not working properly and needs replacement.In other words, the number of jobs involving routine skills — both physical and cognitive — is shrinking. Increasing automation at factories is rapidly replacing workers at factories, even in low-wage countries like China. With robots and AI machines doing most of the work, the demand for specialized training related to the tasks where humans have been made redundant will go down. We will still need engineers, but not as many as in the past.Tech advances can be spurned by a society at its peril — rival nations with less to lose will press ahead.The remaining jobs will likely involve fewer routine tasks. We would need more generalized education so that it is possible for workers to be trained in short order for different tasks in in a highly automated labor market. Given that colleges and universities have institutional inertia, this challenge is not being addressed with any priority.We live in an age of unprecedented worldwide migration, where most migrants are finding employment in unskilled jobs. Since these jobs will likely become most at risk as the use of automation advances, societies must also prepare for the challenges of retraining and educating this unique segment of the workforce.Some scientists and tech titans are calling for the regulation of artificial intelligence machines. But the evolution of technology has its own momentum and technological advances can be spurned by a society only at its peril — rival nations with less to lose will press ahead. As a result, machines will continue to replace humans at jobs. The challenge is to be cognizant of the costs and risks, so that one can develop strategies to meet the future with resilience.Subhash KakSubhash Kak is Regents Professor of electrical and computer engineering at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater.

I glance around for the security guard, then reach towards the apple and broccoli superfood puffs. After dropping them into my empty shopping cart, I put them right back. “Did you get it?” I ask my coworker filming on his iPhone. It’s my first paid acting gig. I’m helping teach software the skills needed for future robots to help people with their shopping.Whole Foods was an unwitting participant in this program, a project of German-Canadian startup Twenty Billion Neurons. I quietly perform nine other brief actions, including opening freezers, and pushing a cart from right to left, then left to right. Then I walk out without buying a thing. Later, it takes me around 30 minutes to edit the clips to the required 2 to 5 seconds, and upload them to Amazon’s crowdsourcing website Mechanical Turk. A few days later I am paid $3.50. If Twenty Billion ever creates software for a shopping assistant robot, it will make much more.In sneaking around Whole Foods, I joined an invisible workforce being paid very little to do odd things in the name of advancing artificial intelligence. You may have been told AI is the gleaming pinnacle of technology. These workers are part of the messy human reality behind it.Proponents believe every aspect of life and business should be and will be mediated by AI. It’s a campaign stoked by large tech companies such as Alphabet showing that machine learning can master tasks such as recognizing speech or images. But most current machine-learning systems such as voice assistants are built by training algorithms with giant stocks of labeled data. The labels come from ranks of contractors examining images, audio, or other data—that’s a koala, that’s a cat, she said “car.”Now, researchers and entrepreneurs want to see AI understand and act in the physical world. Hence the need for workers to act out scenes in supermarkets and homes. They are generating the instructional material to teach algorithms about the world and the people in it.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThis Is the Moment RFK Jr. Has Been Waiting ForBy Vittoria Elliott, WIREDGearAI's Energy Demands Are Out of Control. Welcome to the Internet's Hyper-Consumption EraBy Reece RogersGearSemaglutide for the PeopleBy Michael Calore, WIREDThat’s why I find myself lying face down on WIRED’s office floor one morning, coarse synthetic fibers pressing into my cheek. My editor snaps a photo. After uploading it to Mechanical Turk, I get paid 7 cents by an eight-person startup in Berkeley called Safely You. When I call CEO George Netscher to say thanks, he erupts in a surprised laugh, then turns mock serious. “Does that mean there’s a conflict of interest?” (The $6.30 I made reporting this article has been donated to the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics.)Netscher’s startup makes software that monitors video feeds from elderly-care homes, to detect when a resident has fallen. People with dementia often can’t remember why or how they ended up on the floor. In 11 facilities around California, Safely You’s algorithms help staff quickly find the place in a video that will unseal the mystery.Safely You was soliciting faked falls like mine to test how broad a view its system has of what a toppled human looks like. The company’s software has mostly been trained with video of elderly residents from care facilities, annotated by staff or contractors. Mixing in photos of 34-year-old journalists and anyone else willing to lay down for 7 cents should force the machine-learning algorithms to widen their understanding. “We’re trying to see how well we can generalize to arbitrary incidents or rooms or clothing,” says Netscher.The startup that paid for my Whole Foods performance, Twenty Billion Neurons, is a bolder bet on the idea of paying people to perform for an audience of algorithms. Roland Memisevic, cofounder and CEO, is in the process of trademarking a term for what I did to earn my $3.50—crowd acting. He argues that it is the only practical path to give machines a dash of common sense about the physical world, a longstanding quest in AI. The company is gathering millions of crowd-acting videos, and using them to train software it hopes to sell clients in industries such as automobiles, retail, and home appliances.Games like chess and Go, with their finite, regimented boards and well-defined rules, are well-suited to computers. The physical and spatial common sense we learn intuitively as children to navigate the real world is mostly beyond them. To pour a cup of coffee, you effortlessly grasp and balance cup and carafe, and control the arc of the pouring fluid. You draw on the same deep-seated knowledge, and a sense for the motivations of other humans, to interpret what you see in the world around you.How to give some version of that to machines is a major challenge in AI. Some researchers think that the techniques that are so effective for recognizing speech or images won’t be much help, arguing new techniques are needed. Memisevic took leave from the prestigious Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms to start Twenty Billion because he believes that existing techniques can do much more for us if trained properly. “They work incredibly well,” he says. “Why not extend them to more subtle aspects of reality by forcing them to learn things about the real world?”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThis Is the Moment RFK Jr. Has Been Waiting ForBy Vittoria Elliott, WIREDGearAI's Energy Demands Are Out of Control. Welcome to the Internet's Hyper-Consumption EraBy Reece RogersGearSemaglutide for the PeopleBy Michael Calore, WIREDTo do that, the startup is amassing giant collections of clips in which crowd actors perform different physical actions. The hope is that algorithms trained to distinguish them will “learn” the essence of the physical world and human actions. It’s why when crowd acting in Whole Foods I not only took items from shelves and refrigerators, but also made near identical clips in which I only pretended to grab the product.Twenty Billion’s first dataset, now released as open source, is physical reality 101. Its more than 100,000 clips depict simple manipulations of everyday objects. Disembodied hands pick up shoes, place a remote control inside a cardboard box, and push a green chili along a table until it falls off. Memisevic deflects questions about the client behind the casting call that I answered, which declared, “We want to build a robot that assists you while shopping in the supermarket.” He will say that automotive applications are a big area of interest; the company has worked with BMW. I see jobs posted to Mechanical Turk that describe a project, with only Twenty Billion's name attached, aimed at allowing a car to identify what people are doing inside a vehicle. Workers were asked to feign snacking, dozing off, or reading in chairs. Software that can detect those actions might help semi-automated vehicles know when a human isn’t ready to take over the driving, or pop open a cupholder when you enter holding a drink.Who are the crowd actors doing this work? One is Uğur Büyükşahin, a third-year geological engineering student in Ankara, Turkey, and star of hundreds of videos in Twenty Billion’s collection. He estimates spending about 7 to 10 hours a week on Mechanical Turk, earning roughly as much as he did in a shift with good tips at the restaurant where he used to work. Büyükşahin says Twenty Billion is one of his favorites, because it pays well, and promptly. Their sometimes odd assignments don’t bother him. “Some people may be shy about taking hundreds of videos in the supermarket, but I’m not,” Büyükşahin says. His girlfriend, by nature less outgoing, was initially wary of the project, but has come around after seeing his earnings, some of which have translated into gifts, such as a new set of curling tongs.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThis Is the Moment RFK Jr. Has Been Waiting ForBy Vittoria Elliott, WIREDGearAI's Energy Demands Are Out of Control. Welcome to the Internet's Hyper-Consumption EraBy Reece RogersGearSemaglutide for the PeopleBy Michael Calore, WIREDBüyükşahin and another Turker I speak with, Casey Cowden, a 31-year-old in Johnson City, Tennessee, tell me I’ve been doing crowd acting all wrong. All in, my 10 videos earned me an hourly rate of around $4.60. They achieve much higher rates by staying in the supermarket for as long as hours, binging on Twenty Billion’s tasks.Büyükşahin says his personal record is 110 supermarket videos in a single hour. He uses a gimbal for higher-quality shots, batting away inquisitive store employees when necessary by bluffing about a university research project in AI. Cowden calculates that he and a friend each earned an hourly rate of $11.75 during two and half hours of crowd acting in a local Walmart. That’s more than Walmart’s $11 starting wage, or the $7.75 or so Cowden’s fiancee earns at Burger King.Cowden seems to have more fun than Walmart employees, too. He began Turking early last year, after the construction company he was working for folded. Working from home means he can be around to care for his fiancee’s mother, who has Alzheimer’s. He says he was initially drawn to Twenty Billion’s assignments because, with the right strategy, they pay better than the data-entry work that dominates Mechanical Turk. But he also warmed to the idea of working on a technological frontier. Cowden tells me he tries to vary the backdrop, and even the clothing he wears, in different shoots. “You can’t train a robot to shop in a supermarket if the videos you have are all the same,” Cowden tells me. “I try to go the whole nine yards so the programming can get a diverse view.”Mechanical Turk has often been called a modern-day sweatshop.

To fake falling asleep, a shirtless man in a darkened room leans gently backwards with a meditative look; a woman who appears to be inside a closet lets her head snap forward like a puppet with a cut string.Some of the crowd actors are children—a breach of Amazon’s terms, which require workers to be at least 18. One Asian boy of around 9 in school uniform looks out from a grubby plastic chair in front of a chipped whitewashed wall, then feigns sleep. Another Asian boy, slightly older, performs “drinking from a cup or a can” while another child lies on a bed behind him. Twenty Billion’s CTO Ingo Bax tells me the company screens out such videos from its final datasets, but can’t rule out having paid out money for clips of child crowd actors before they were filtered. Memisevic says the company has protocols to prevent systematic payment for such material.Children also appear in a trove of crowd-acting videos I discover on YouTube. In dozens of clips apparently made public by accident, people act out scripts like “One person runs down the stairs laughing holding a cup of coffee, while another person is fixing the doorknob.” Most appear to have been shot on the Indian subcontinent. Some have been captured by a crowd actor holding a phone to his or her forehead, for a first-person view.I find the videos while trying to unmask the person behind crowd-acting jobs on Mechanical Turk from the “AI Indoors Project.” Forums where crowd workers gather to gripe and swap tips reveal that it’s a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle. Like Twenty Billion, they are gathering crowd-acted videos by the thousand to try and improve algorithms’ understanding of the physical world and what we do in it. Nearly 10,000 clips have already been released for other researchers to play with in a collection aptly named Charades.Gunnar Atli Sigurdsson, a grad student on the project, echoes Memisevic when I ask why he’s paying strangers to pour drinks or run down stairs with a phone held to their head. He wants algorithms to understand us. “We’ve been seeing AI systems getting very impressive at some very narrow, well-defined tasks like chess and Go,” Sigurdsson says. “But we want to have an AI butler in our apartment and have it understand our lives, not the stuff we’re posting on Facebook, the really boring stuff.”If tech companies conquer that quotidian frontier of AI, it will likely be seen as the latest triumph of machine-learning experts. If Twenty Billion's approach works out the truth will be messier and more interesting. If you ever get help from a robot in a supermarket, or ride in a car that understands what its occupants are doing, think of the crowd actors who may have trained it. Cowden, the Tennessean, says he liked Twenty Billion’s tasks in part because his mother is fighting bone cancer. Robots and software able to understand and intervene in our world could help address the growing shortage of nurses and home-health aides.

I quietly perform nine other brief actions, including opening freezers, and pushing a cart from right to left, then left to right. Then I walk out without buying a thing. Later, it takes me around 30 minutes to edit the clips to the required 2 to 5 seconds, and upload them to Amazon’s crowdsourcing website Mechanical Turk. A few days later I am paid $3.50. If Twenty Billion ever creates software for a shopping assistant robot, it will make much more.
In sneaking around Whole Foods, I joined an invisible workforce being paid very little to do odd things in the name of advancing artificial intelligence. You may have been told AI is the gleaming pinnacle of technology. These workers are part of the messy human reality behind it.
Proponents believe every aspect of life and business should be and will be mediated by AI. It’s a campaign stoked by large tech companies such as Alphabet showing that machine learning can master tasks such as recognizing speech or images. But most current machine-learning systems such as voice assistants are built by training algorithms with giant stocks of labeled data. The labels come from ranks of contractors examining images, audio, or other data—that’s a koala, that’s a cat, she said “car.”
Now, researchers and entrepreneurs want to see AI understand and act in the physical world. Hence the need for workers to act out scenes in supermarkets and homes. They are generating the instructional material to teach algorithms about the world and the people in it.
That’s why I find myself lying face down on WIRED’s office floor one morning, coarse synthetic fibers pressing into my cheek. My editor snaps a photo. After uploading it to Mechanical Turk, I get paid 7 cents by an eight-person startup in Berkeley called Safely You. When I call CEO George Netscher to say thanks, he erupts in a surprised laugh, then turns mock serious. “Does that mean there’s a conflict of interest?” (The $6.30 I made reporting this article has been donated to the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics.)
Netscher’s startup makes software that monitors video feeds from elderly-care homes, to detect when a resident has fallen. People with dementia often can’t remember why or how they ended up on the floor. In 11 facilities around California, Safely You’s algorithms help staff quickly find the place in a video that will unseal the mystery.
Safely You was soliciting faked falls like mine to test how broad a view its system has of what a toppled human looks like. The company’s software has mostly been trained with video of elderly residents from care facilities, annotated by staff or contractors. Mixing in photos of 34-year-old journalists and anyone else willing to lay down for 7 cents should force the machine-learning algorithms to widen their understanding. “We’re trying to see how well we can generalize to arbitrary incidents or rooms or clothing,” says Netscher.
The startup that paid for my Whole Foods performance, Twenty Billion Neurons, is a bolder bet on the idea of paying people to perform for an audience of algorithms. Roland Memisevic, cofounder and CEO, is in the process of trademarking a term for what I did to earn my $3.50—crowd acting. He argues that it is the only practical path to give machines a dash of common sense about the physical world, a longstanding quest in AI. The company is gathering millions of crowd-acting videos, and using them to train software it hopes to sell clients in industries such as automobiles, retail, and home appliances.
Games like chess and Go, with their finite, regimented boards and well-defined rules, are well-suited to computers. The physical and spatial common sense we learn intuitively as children to navigate the real world is mostly beyond them. To pour a cup of coffee, you effortlessly grasp and balance cup and carafe, and control the arc of the pouring fluid. You draw on the same deep-seated knowledge, and a sense for the motivations of other humans, to interpret what you see in the world around you.
How to give some version of that to machines is a major challenge in AI. Some researchers think that the techniques that are so effective for recognizing speech or images won’t be much help, arguing new techniques are needed. Memisevic took leave from the prestigious Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms to start Twenty Billion because he believes that existing techniques can do much more for us if trained properly. “They work incredibly well,” he says. “Why not extend them to more subtle aspects of reality by forcing them to learn things about the real world?”
To do that, the startup is amassing giant collections of clips in which crowd actors perform different physical actions. The hope is that algorithms trained to distinguish them will “learn” the essence of the physical world and human actions. It’s why when crowd acting in Whole Foods I not only took items from shelves and refrigerators, but also made near identical clips in which I only pretended to grab the product.
Twenty Billion’s first dataset, now released as open source, is physical reality 101. Its more than 100,000 clips depict simple manipulations of everyday objects. Disembodied hands pick up shoes, place a remote control inside a cardboard box, and push a green chili along a table until it falls off. Memisevic deflects questions about the client behind the casting call that I answered, which declared, “We want to build a robot that assists you while shopping in the supermarket.” He will say that automotive applications are a big area of interest; the company has worked with BMW. I see jobs posted to Mechanical Turk that describe a project, with only Twenty Billion's name attached, aimed at allowing a car to identify what people are doing inside a vehicle. Workers were asked to feign snacking, dozing off, or reading in chairs. Software that can detect those actions might help semi-automated vehicles know when a human isn’t ready to take over the driving, or pop open a cupholder when you enter holding a drink.
Who are the crowd actors doing this work? One is Uğur Büyükşahin, a third-year geological engineering student in Ankara, Turkey, and star of hundreds of videos in Twenty Billion’s collection. He estimates spending about 7 to 10 hours a week on Mechanical Turk, earning roughly as much as he did in a shift with good tips at the restaurant where he used to work. Büyükşahin says Twenty Billion is one of his favorites, because it pays well, and promptly. Their sometimes odd assignments don’t bother him. “Some people may be shy about taking hundreds of videos in the supermarket, but I’m not,” Büyükşahin says. His girlfriend, by nature less outgoing, was initially wary of the project, but has come around after seeing his earnings, some of which have translated into gifts, such as a new set of curling tongs.
Büyükşahin and another Turker I speak with, Casey Cowden, a 31-year-old in Johnson City, Tennessee, tell me I’ve been doing crowd acting all wrong. All in, my 10 videos earned me an hourly rate of around $4.60. They achieve much higher rates by staying in the supermarket for as long as hours, binging on Twenty Billion’s tasks.
Büyükşahin says his personal record is 110 supermarket videos in a single hour. He uses a gimbal for higher-quality shots, batting away inquisitive store employees when necessary by bluffing about a university research project in AI. Cowden calculates that he and a friend each earned an hourly rate of $11.75 during two and half hours of crowd acting in a local Walmart. That’s more than Walmart’s $11 starting wage, or the $7.75 or so Cowden’s fiancee earns at Burger King.
Cowden seems to have more fun than Walmart employees, too. He began Turking early last year, after the construction company he was working for folded. Working from home means he can be around to care for his fiancee’s mother, who has Alzheimer’s. He says he was initially drawn to Twenty Billion’s assignments because, with the right strategy, they pay better than the data-entry work that dominates Mechanical Turk. But he also warmed to the idea of working on a technological frontier. Cowden tells me he tries to vary the backdrop, and even the clothing he wears, in different shoots. “You can’t train a robot to shop in a supermarket if the videos you have are all the same,” Cowden tells me. “I try to go the whole nine yards so the programming can get a diverse view.”
Mechanical Turk has often been called a modern-day sweatshop. A recent study found that median pay was around $2 an hour. But it lacks the communal atmosphere of a workhouse. The site’s labor is atomized into individuals working from homes or phones around the world.
Crowd acting sometimes give workers a chance to look each other in the face. Twenty Billion employs contract workers who review crowd-acting videos.

In addition to human-like flute and drum players, the collection contained a golden duck, standing on a pedestal, quacking and defecating. It was, in fact, a digesting duck. When offered pellets by the exhibitor, it would pick them out of his hand and consume them with a gulp. Later, it would excrete a gritty green waste from its back end, to the amazement of audience members. Vaucanson died in 1782 with his reputation as a trailblazer in artificial digestion intact. Sixty years later, the French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin gained possession of the famous duck and set about repairing it. Taking it apart, however, he realised that the duck had no digestive tract. Rather than breaking down the food, the pellets the duck was fed went into one container, and pre-loaded green-dyed breadcrumbs came out of another. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently exploding, with computers able to perform at near- or above-human level on tasks as diverse as video games, language translation, trivia and facial identification. Like the French exhibit-goers, any observer would be correctly impressed by these results. What might be less clear, however, is how these results are being achieved. Does modern AI reach these feats by functioning the way that biological brains do, and how can we know? In the realm of replication, definitions are important. An intuitive response to hearing about Vaucanson’s cheat is not to say that the duck is doing digestion differently but rather that it’s not doing digestion at all. But a similar trend appears in AI. Checkers? Chess? Go? All were considered formidable tests of intelligence until they were solved by increasingly more complex algorithms. Learning how a magic trick works makes it no longer magic, and discovering how a test of intelligence can be solved makes it no longer a test of intelligence. So let’s look to a well-defined task: identifying objects in an image. Our ability to recognise, for example, a school bus, feels simple and immediate. But given the infinite combinations of individual school buses, lighting conditions and angles from which they can be viewed, turning the information that enters our retina into an object label is an incredibly complex task – one out of reach for computers for decades. In recent years, however, computers have come to identify certain objects with up to 95 per cent accuracy, higher than the average individual human. Like many areas of modern AI, the success of computer vision can be attributed to artificial neural networks. As their name suggests, these algorithms are inspired by how the brain works. They use as their base unit a simple formula meant to replicate what a neuron does. This formula takes in a set of numbers as inputs, multiplies them by another set of numbers (the ‘weights’, which determine how much influence a given input has) and sums them all up. That sum determines how active the artificial neuron is, in the same way that a real neuron’s activity is determined by the activity of other neurons that connect to it. Modern artificial neural networks gain abilities by connecting such units together and learning the right weight for each. The networks used for visual object recognition were inspired by the mammalian visual system, a structure whose basic components were discovered in cats nearly 60 years ago. The first important component of the brain’s visual system is its spatial map: neurons are active only when something is in their preferred spatial location, and different neurons have different preferred locations. Different neurons also tend to respond to different types of objects. In brain areas closer to the retina, neurons respond to simple dots and lines. As the signal gets processed through more and more brain areas, neurons start to prefer more complex objects such as clocks, houses and faces. The first of these properties – the spatial map – is replicated in artificial networks by constraining the inputs that an artificial neuron can get. For example, a neuron in the first layer of a network might receive input only from the top left corner of an image. A neuron in the second layer gets input only from those top-left-corner neurons in the first layer, and so on. The second property – representing increasingly complex objects – comes from stacking layers in a ‘deep’ network. Neurons in the first layer respond to simple patterns, while those in the second layer – getting input from those in the first – respond to more complex patterns, and so on. These networks clearly aren’t cheating in the way that the digesting duck was. But does all this biological inspiration mean that they work like the brain? One way to approach this question is to look more closely at their performance. To this end, scientists are studying ‘adversarial examples’ – real images that programmers alter so that the machine makes a mistake. Very small tweaks to images can be catastrophic: changing a few pixels on an image of a teapot, for example, can make the network label it an ostrich. It’s a mistake a human would never make, and suggests that something about these networks is functioning differently from the human brain. Studying networks this way, however, is akin to the early days of psychology. Measuring only environment and behaviour – in other words, input and output – is limited without direct measurements of the brain connecting them. But neural-network algorithms are frequently criticised (especially among watchdog groups concerned about their widespread use in the real world) for being impenetrable black boxes. To overcome the limitations of this techno-behaviourism, we need a way to understand these networks and compare them with the brain. An ever-growing population of scientists is tackling this problem. In one approach, researchers presented the same images to a monkey and to an artificial network. They found that the activity of the real neurons could be predicted by the activity of the artificial ones, with deeper layers in the network more similar to later areas of the visual system. But, while these predictions are better than those made by other models, they are still not 100 per cent accurate. This is leading researchers to explore what other biological details can be added to the models to make them more similar to the brain. There are limits to this approach. At a recent conference for neuroscientists and AI researchers, Yann LeCun – director of AI research at Facebook, and professor of computer science at the New York University – warned the audience not to become ‘hypnotised by the details of the brain’, implying that not all of what the brain does necessarily needs to be replicated for intelligent behaviour to be achieved. But the question of what counts as a mere detail, like the question of what is needed for true digestion, is an open one. For example, by training artificial networks to be more ‘biological’, researchers have found computational purpose in, for example, the physical anatomy of neurons. Some correspondence between AI and the brain is necessary for these biological insights to be of value. Otherwise, the study of neurons would be only as useful for AI as wing-flapping is for modern airplanes. In 2000, the Belgian conceptual artist Wim Delvoye unveiled Cloaca at a museum in Belgium. Over eight years of research on human digestion, he created the device – consisting of a blender, tubes, pumps and various jars of acids and enzymes – that successfully turns food into faeces. The machine is a true feat of engineering, a testament to our powers of replicating the natural world. Its purpose might be more questionable. One art critic was left with the thought: ‘There is enough dung as it is. Why make more?’ Intelligence doesn’t face this problem.

Predicting Our Future is a podcast about the next revolutions in technology, as seen through the eyes of a serial entrepreneur. Below is an edited transcript excerpt from ""Episode 16: How Homes Powered By Artificial Intelligence Will Know You And Take Care Of You"" — the final episode in a 7-part series on the future of the smart home.

In this episode of Predicting Our Future, I’ll paint a picture of what life in our future homes might look like and explore how smart homes will use personas and Artificial Intelligence to fulfill our needs before we’re even aware of them.
Drowning In To-Do Lists
For my smart home podcast series, I’ve been interviewing my friends to find out what tools they use to manage their list of to-do’s. “I keep them in a Google doc,” one friend told me. “I keep it multiple Google Docs,” said another friend. “Each one is dated, and I when I think I’m no longer serious about following a list, I simply create another one with a new date.” One guy used Evernote. Best of all was a friend of mine who explained how his to-do lists are memorialized with stickies on his bedroom wall, much to the chagrin of his wife.
PROMOTED
While the tools were all different, the one thing that everyone seemed to have in common was a general feeling of failure when it came to crossing enough things off their list and an abiding belief that there was too much to do in too little time. Everyone seemed to be searching for a magic elixir that would save them more time

I often wonder how technology can improve our lives. One area in particular that fascinates me is identifying tasks that technology can handle so that they don’t need to appear on my to-do list, and just as importantly, so that they won't occupy space in my mind. I read once about the dressing habits of people like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg who seemingly wear the same outfit everyday. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that both men have multiple identical pants and identical shirts. The reason for wearing the same outfit every day? If you always wear the same thing, then there is no decision to make. You can then turn to more important decisions and lead a more productive life.
How, you might ask, are to-do lists and clothes connected to the smart home? I've explored how technology like the smart thermostat or smart lighting could save me money if they only turned on when I was in a room in need of heat or air conditioning or light. That’s interesting, but what’s infinitely more exciting to me is if the smart home could offload my decisions and work by completing tasks independently of me. Fewer decisions that I need to make means more time for me to focus on the things that really matter.

A Smart Home Driven By Artificial Intelligence
In many industries, when you interview an ambitious leader, he or she will talk with you about how they will reinvent factory-built housing or the fitness space or retail. However, in some, people will talk about how they are part of an ecosystem and how their success is in large part predicated on the success of other companies in the ecosystem. In the case of the smart home, almost all of the players I interviewed talked about a future where the holy grail was a home driven by Artificial Intelligence. 
Think of Artificial Intelligence as computing power that is able to perform particularly complex tasks that would otherwise require a human brain to perform. A motion sensor might trigger a light to turn on. But if a home had Artificial Intelligence, it might consider the time of day, the person walking around the home, and where she was walking in deciding which light to turn on and how long to keep it on for. Not every person I spoke to used the words “Artificial Intelligence.” A hot phrase you’ll hear again and again from experts is that a house needs to be “aware” or “contextually aware” before you can bring Artificial Intelligence into the home.  
Let’s imagine the universe of things a house can be aware of: it can be aware of the presence of the people who live in the house (along with their personas); it can be aware of what they’re doing; it can even be aware of what every device in the house is doing. If you want the house to think like a human, the house needs to be able to analyze the data a human would analyze before making a decision.

Your Home As Your Personal Caretaker
How would it work for a smart home to free me of some of my decision-making? How could it lighten the load for me, literally and figuratively? Let’s imagine a day together. You wake up in the morning and your alarm goes off. It’s not a buzzer. You want to discover new music on Spotify and this song is on your suggested Discover Weekly list. What’s really interesting, though, is not the song. It’s the fact that you didn’t have to set the alarm the night before. 
That’s because there is some level of intelligence in the cloud that’s watching over you and trying to simplify your life. It knows that today you have a spin class because it checked your workout goals, which then checked availability for a class at SoulCycle, which then purchased the class, which then put it on your calendar. The system was smart enough to calculate travel time and set the alarm appropriately. 
You stagger out of bed and walk down the stairs to the kitchen. The coffee just finished brewing. You have your smart home to thank for that. Your yogurt and granola is ready in the exact proportions you want inside the refrigerator. The refrigerator knew earlier in the week that you were running low on breakfast foods and placed an order online. You’re in a rush, so you walk out the door and leave for the gym. 
There’s no time to set the alarm or draw the blinds (which is something you do when you leave the house so that people can’t look in while you’re away). You don’t think to turn off the music or the lights or lower the heat, as you won’t need to heat the house to 72 degrees while you’re away. It’s not that you forget to do all of those things. You just don’t have to think about them, because the house knows that you left. It knows to lock the door behind you, to turn off the coffee maker, to pull the blinds, to reduce the heat, to shut off the music, and to turn off the lights.
Today is shopping today. Really, every day is shopping day. The sensors in your drawers measure the toilet paper that is left, and the sensors in the closet monitor cleaning supplies and laundry detergent. You’re running low on a few things. The online order is placed. When it arrives, the cameras at your front door will recognize the FedEx truck and coordinate with the lock to pop open your front door. The delivery man’s picture will be taken and a gentle voice will come on over your speakers, asking him to set down the packages just inside the house. Cameras will be watching him from beginning to end, and the door will close on its own behind him when he leaves. Your home’s robot then proceeds to unpack the items and place them where they belong.

After a long day at work, it’s time to return home. As you leave the office and get in your car, your home is alerted that you’re on your way. The house begins to heat up. When you pull into the driveway and walk up your stoop to the front door, you pause briefly for a retinal scan. It’s you. The house knows and opens the front door. You are represented by a persona to the smart home that you partially configured and that the house has partially developed on you, based upon patterns it was able to recognize through sensors and cameras. This is Artificial Intelligence in the cloud at work in your home. 
There are a couple of big objectives you’ve set for yourself this past New Year’s. You want to eat healthier and lose some weight. You are also hoping find a routine at night that might help with your anxiety and sleep. Your sleep has been uneven for quite some time. The diet, the anxiety-reducing routine, and the sleep hygiene are all associated with your persona in the cloud that the house is now relying on to welcome you home. 
Your wife isn’t home just yet, so the lights in the entryway are adjusted to a calming setting as the music comes on, which is so faint and melodic that it fades into the background. Dinner tonight will be fresh salmon and steamed vegetables — selected for you by the cloud, based on your objectives and tastes (which are all part of the persona). The ingredients are there in the refrigerator, which were delivered and put there a day earlier. You start cooking so that when your wife arrives, dinner will be ready. After dinner, you retire to the den while your wife goes to the office. The smart home has created a different persona for your wife and would have greeted her differently if she had come home from work before you. 
A gentle chime comes on over the speakers, followed by a voice telling you that the big game starts in 10 minutes. For your wife, a voice announces it’s time for her to begin the 90 minutes of work she wanted to do before going to bed. The blinds are pulled, lights are dimmed, and TV is turned on for you, while your wife has different background music and lighting in the office. For both of you, your watches read your internal temperatures and blood pressures, signaling the house to adjust the temperature, fans, and lighting accordingly. 
You don’t have to particularly worry about cleaning up. In the morning after you both leave for work, your home robot will pick up after you and then the vacuum cleaner will vacuum the house. You both like listening to a meditative app before sleep. Wind down begins promptly at 10PM. 15 minutes later, with the breathing exercises finished, you both go to bed. Lights out.

                            The Swiss food and beverage giant and the Dublin-based biotech company are to work together on discovering bioactive peptide networks in target high-value areas.
        








The collaboration will make use of Nuritas’ innovative technology platform, which uses DNA analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict, unlock and validate bioactive peptide compounds from food sources.Nestlé will further develop and validate the efficacy of the new discoveries within the target application areas. “At Nuritas our mission is to positively impact billions of lives worldwide and we therefore are delighted to be collaborating with Nestlé, the world’s largest food and beverage company on such an important project. We are really looking forward to beginning this impactful journey together,”​ said Nora Khaldi, Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Nuritas.“The fruition of our collaboration carries the promise to be truly industry-changing,”​ added Emmet Browne CEO at Nuritas, formerly of Nestlé. “We are very excited to partner with Nestlé as they look to continue their own admirable purpose to help shape a better and healthier world.”​Hinting at the depth of impact the partnership would have on the industry, Browne told NutraIngredients, “The power and accuracy of the Nuritas approach is so, that it makes sense to apply it to the areas of greatest consumer need or industries toughest problems. In our collaboration with Nestlé we are looking to do just that”. ​The collaboration is also a good fit for Nestlé’s objectives.“As our understanding of food and nutrition continues to grow, our global research and development network is looking ahead to discover how we can help enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future for everyone. Research partnerships such as that with Nuritas help us achieve that goal​,” commented Richard Stadler at the Nestlé Research Centre.Rapid growth​Nuritas’ new tie-up with Nestlé comes on the back of another collaboration with German giant BASF announced in early 2017 and a successful round of funding later in the year. Nuritas is in the process of rapidly growing the workforce and scaling up the business to take advantage of the expansion opportunities that its internationally recognised, award-winning platform appears to provide.Additional collaborations are likely to be revealed in the future which will continue to drive this expansion, suggested Browne.“We are incredibly proud of all our partnerships to date, both those that are publicly disclosed and those that are not yet. We aim to partner with the world’s most innovative and far-reaching leaders in health and nutrition, a description that is perfectly embodied by both Nestlé and BASF.​“In addition to the obvious validation that both these agreements provide, working in partnership with such great companies also affords us tremendous opportunities to learn from the best,” ​he added. ​AI – the future?​The use of AI, together with DNA analysis, in the discovery of new bioactive compounds has the potential to revolutionise the speed of product development.“The traditional approach to finding new active molecules is close to random, it’s like searching the ocean for a treasure chest without a map. It usually takes years and millions,” ​Khaldi said. “What the Nuritas technology does is create a map​.”Despite the impressive science underlying AI-based bioactive molecule discovery, the bottom-line was still the commercial end product, emphasised Browne.“We are very much a commercial business not an academic institution. For us a project is not a success until an ingredient that works in the end application exists. ​“Our data-driven approach powered by machine learning enables us to progress through the development cycle at incredibly fast rates at all stages from in vitro to as far as scaling of ingredient production,” ​ he concluded.

Believe it or not, great minds have been thinking about artificial intelligence long before Hanna-Barbera brought us Rosie, the Jetsons' domestic wonder-bot.For tens of thousands of years, humans and our ancestors have been trying to figure out how to make the world work for us. Twigs for fire. Wheels for transportation. We get there; some discoveries just take longer than others. Modern innovations have come in fits and starts. There are four big leaps, to be exact.UBS lays them out. In 1784, the first industrial revolution with mechanical production, leading to steam-based energy powering hulking machines like trains.Related StoryVoice-Sensitive Tech Dominated CES — Even With Its Security DrawbacksSkip ahead almost 100 years to 1870: the second revolution with mass production in factories and harnessing electrical energy, lighting homes and businesses. During WWII, engineer Alan Turing created a powerful German-code-breaking computer and developed the ""Turing test"" in 1950.Wired describes the test as ""a benchmark to determine a machine's ability to 'think' like a human. Though his ideas were ridiculed at the time, they set the wheels in motion, and the term 'artificial intelligence' entered popular awareness in the mid-1950s.""What began in Turing’s lab became part of the third revolution in 1969: computing power. Computers have since become interwoven into just about every part of our daily lives. Dishwashers. DVRs. Cash registers. Cellphones.We are now living in the middle of the fourth revolution: A.I.Check out this rapid-fire timeline published by Oxford and Yale professors looking at when experts in the field predict A.I. will outperform humans in certain tasks: — Translating languages: 2024. — Writing high-school essays: 2026. — Driving a truck: 2027 (this accounts for almost 2 million jobs). — Working in retail: 2031 (nearly 5 million jobs). — Writing a bestselling book: 2049.Economists foresee upheavals ahead as industries reorient themselves to the age of A.I. Some developments will be painful, inevitably introducing automation and job loss, but possibly creating new fields as a byproduct.Other developments will make life easier — like having Rosie to flip the pancakes and a smart car to get Judy and Elroy to school on time.

Most U.S. Workers Unafraid of Losing Their Jobs to Robots
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

23% of employed Americans worry they will lose their jobs to AI
Fear of job loss varies by education
Manufacturing and construction sectors seen as most vulnerable


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly three in four working Americans (73%) say the rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate more jobs than it creates across the country. However, a far smaller percentage of these workers (23%) say they are ""very"" or ""somewhat"" worried that they will lose their own jobs to this new technology.

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017





These data come from a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward AI and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults, including 2,871 who are employed, was conducted Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017.
Employed Americans with less than a bachelor's degree are almost twice as likely to feel their jobs are at risk as are those with a four-year degree or more, 28% vs. 15%. Americans with less than a bachelor's degree are also less optimistic about the impact of AI in general and may feel that their own lower education levels leave them vulnerable to job loss attributable to the new technology.
There is a smaller gap in fear of job loss between employed Americans with blue-collar jobs (those working in industries largely composed of hourly wage earners) and those with white-collar positions (those working in largely salaried industries ), 26% vs. 19%, respectively. Similar to the gap in overall optimism seen in educational attainment, white-collar workers also tend to be more positive than blue-collar workers about the overall impact of AI.
Among American workers in their prime years of work -- those aged 18 to 65 -- worry varies modestly, ranging from 21% among those aged 36 to 50, to 27% among workers 51 to 65 years of age.

Construction and Manufacturing Seen as Most Vulnerable to AI
Americans who say AI will result in a net loss of jobs were asked to indicate which of a series of 12 economic sectors they believe would see jobs eliminated first by the new technology. More than six in 10 Americans (62%) who believe AI will result in a net job loss say the construction or manufacturing industries are the most likely to be eliminated by AI first. More than half also say the retail (55%) and transportation (52%) sectors are particularly vulnerable to replacement of jobs by new technology.


 

Americans who see AI adoption resulting in net job loss say the legal and public policy sector is the least vulnerable to replacement from this new technology, with 9% saying cuts in jobs related to AI will occur first in these fields. Additionally, jobs in the fields of arts, entertainment and sports, as well as those in community and social services, are seen as safe from AI -- with 15% and 16%, respectively, saying these positions will be eliminated first.
Implications
Although many Americans believe AI adoption will result in a net loss of jobs, about three in four are not worried about losing their own positions. This is reaffirmed in separate Gallup research on the issue, which found that a similar level of Americans (72%) thought it was ""not too likely"" or ""not likely at all"" that they would lose their jobs to new technology in the next 20 years. However, anxiety about job loss to new technology is substantially higher than the 8% of employed Americans who say they are ""very"" or ""fairly"" likely to be laid off in the next year.
Americans who expect AI to lead to job losses in the U.S. identify the construction and manufacturing sectors as particularly vulnerable to new technology. This may be because of the long association of the introduction of robotics with job loss in the manufacturing sector. Additionally, retail may be seen as vulnerable because of the increasing popularity of online retail and changes such as self-checkout lines, which many Americans already use. Finally, transportation may stick out in Americans' minds because of extensive media coverage about self-driving vehicles.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University/Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.
For results based on the total sample of 3,297 U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.
For results based on the sample of 2,871 employed U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

Mr. Yang, a former tech executive who started the nonprofit organization Venture for America, believes that automation and advanced artificial intelligence will soon make millions of jobs obsolete — yours, mine, those of our accountants and radiologists and grocery store cashiers. He says America needs to take radical steps to prevent Great Depression-level unemployment and a total societal meltdown, including handing out trillions of dollars in cash.“All you need is self-driving cars to destabilize society,” Mr. Yang, 43, said over lunch at a Thai restaurant in Manhattan last month, in his first interview about his campaign. In just a few years, he said, “we’re going to have a million truck drivers out of work who are 94 percent male, with an average level of education of high school or one year of college.”“That one innovation,” he continued, “will be enough to create riots in the street. And we’re about to do the same thing to retail workers, call center workers, fast-food workers, insurance companies, accounting firms.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAlarmist? Sure. But Mr. Yang’s doomsday prophecy echoes the concerns of a growing number of labor economists and tech experts who are worried about the coming economic consequences of automation. A 2017 report by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, concluded that by 2030 — three presidential terms from now — as many as one-third of American jobs may disappear because of automation. (Other studies have given cheerier forecasts, predicting that new jobs will replace most of the lost ones.)Perhaps it was inevitable that a tech-skeptic candidate would try to seize the moment. Scrutiny of tech companies like Facebook and Google has increased in recent years, and worries about monopolistic behavior, malicious exploitation of social media and the addictive effects of smartphones have made a once-bulletproof industry politically vulnerable. Even industry insiders have begun to join the backlash.To fend off the coming robots, Mr. Yang is pushing what he calls a “Freedom Dividend,” a monthly check for $1,000 that would be sent to every American from age 18 to 64, regardless of income or employment status. These payments, he says, would bring everyone in America up to approximately the poverty line, even if they were directly hit by automation. Medicare and Medicaid would be unaffected under Mr. Yang’s plan, but people receiving government benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could choose to continue receiving those benefits, or take the $1,000 monthly payments instead.The Freedom Dividend isn’t a new idea. It’s a rebranding of universal basic income, a policy that has been popular in academic and think-tank circles for decades, was favored by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the economist Milton Friedman, and has more recently caught the eye of Silicon Valley technologists. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have all expressed support for the idea of a universal basic income. Y Combinator, the influential start-up incubator, is running a basic income experiment with 3,000 participants in two states.Despite its popularity among left-leaning academics and executives, universal basic income is still a leaderless movement that has yet to break into mainstream politics. Mr. Yang thinks he can sell the idea in Washington by framing it as a pro-business policy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m a capitalist,” he said, “and I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.”Mr. Yang, a married father of two boys, is a fast-talking extrovert who wears the nu-executive uniform of a blazer and jeans without a tie. He keeps a daily journal of things he’s grateful for, and peppers conversations with business-world catchphrases like “core competency.” After graduating from Brown University and Columbia Law School, he quit his job at a big law firm and began working in tech. He ran an internet start-up that failed during the first dot-com bust, worked as an executive at a health care start-up and helped build a test-prep business that was acquired by Kaplan in 2009, netting him a modest fortune.He caught the political bug after starting Venture for America, an organization modeled after Teach for America that connects recent college graduates with start-up businesses. During his travels to Midwestern cities, he began to connect the growth of anti-establishment populism with the rise of workplace automation.“The reason Donald Trump was elected was that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,” he said. “If you look at the voter data, it shows that the higher the level of concentration of manufacturing robots in a district, the more that district voted for Trump.”ImageMr. Yang has proposed monthly payments of $1,000 for every American from age 18 to 64. “I’m a capitalist,” he said, “and I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.”Credit...Guerin Blask for The New York TimesMr. Yang’s skepticism of technology extends beyond factory robots. In his campaign book, “The War on Normal People,” he writes that he wants to establish a Department of the Attention Economy in order to regulate social media companies like Facebook and Twitter. He also proposes appointing a cabinet-level secretary of technology, based in Silicon Valley, to study the effects of emerging technologies.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCritics may dismiss Mr. Yang’s campaign (slogan: “Humanity First”) as a futurist vanity stunt. The Democratic pipeline is already stuffed with would-be 2020 contenders, most of whom already have the public profile and political experience that Mr. Yang lacks — and at least one of whom, Senator Bernie Sanders, has already hinted at support for a universal basic income.Opponents of universal basic income have also pointed to its steep price tag — an annual outlay of $12,000 per American adult would cost approximately $2 trillion, equivalent to roughly half of the current federal budget — and the possibility that giving out free money could encourage people not to work. These reasons, among others, are why Hillary Clinton, who considered adding universal basic income to her 2016 platform, concluded it was “exciting but not realistic.”

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.“In our political culture, there are formidable political obstacles to providing cash to working-age people who aren’t employed, and it’s unlikely that U.B.I. could surmount them,” Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, wrote last year.But Mr. Yang thinks he can make the case. He has proposed paying for a basic income with a value-added tax, a consumption-based levy that he says would raise money from companies that profit from automation. A recent study by the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning policy think-tank, suggested that such a plan, paid for by a progressive tax plan, could grow the economy by more than 2 percent and provide jobs for 1.1 million more people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Universal basic income is an old idea,” Mr. Yang said, “but it’s an old idea that right now is uniquely relevant because of what we’re experiencing in society.”Mr. Yang’s prominent supporters include Andy Stern, a former leader of Service Employees International Union, who credited him with “opening up a discussion that the country’s afraid to have.” His campaign has also attracted some of Silicon Valley’s elites. Tony Hsieh, the chief executive of Zappos, is an early donor to Mr. Yang’s campaign, as are several venture capitalists and high-ranking alumni of Facebook and Google.Mr. Yang, who has raised roughly $130,000 since filing his official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission in November, says he will ultimately raise millions from supporters in the tech industry and elsewhere to supplement his own money.Mr. Yang has other radical ideas, too. He wants to appoint a White House psychologist, “make taxes fun” by turning April 15 into a national holiday and put into effect “digital social credits,” a kind of gamified reward system to encourage socially productive behavior. To stem corruption, he suggests increasing the president’s salary to $4 million from its current $400,000, and sharply raising the pay of other federal regulators, while barring them from accepting paid speaking gigs or lucrative private-sector jobs after leaving office.And although he said he was socially liberal, he admitted that he hadn’t fully developed all his positions. (On most social issues, Mr. Yang said, “I believe what you probably think I believe.”)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe likelihood, of course, is that Mr. Yang’s candidacy won’t end with a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Still, experts I spoke with were glad to have him talking about the long-term risks of automation, at a time when much of Washington is consumed with the immediate and visible.Erik Brynjolfsson, the director of M.I.T.’s Initiative on the Digital Economy and a co-author of “The Second Machine Age,” praised Mr. Yang for bringing automation’s economic effects into the conversation.“This is a serious problem, and it’s going to get a lot worse,” Mr. Brynjolfsson said. “In every election for the next 10 or 20 years, this will become a more salient issue, and the candidates who can speak to it effectively will do well.”Mr. Yang knows he could sound the automation alarm without running for president. But he feels a sense of urgency. In his view, there’s no time to mess around with think-tank papers and “super PACs,” because the clock is ticking.“We have five to 10 years before truckers lose their jobs,” he said, “and all hell breaks loose.” Email Kevin Roose at kevin.roose@nytimes.com, or follow him on Facebook at facebook.com/kevinroose and on Twitter: @kevinroose.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 11, 2018, Section BU, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: His 2020 Slogan: Beware of Robots.

But 7.30 has discovered just two physician assistants are employed in Queensland's public health system.Both work in the emergency department at Townsville Hospital.This year the university suspended all new student enrolments, but 16 students are continuing with their studies.7.30 understands three students have made official complaints about the course, but JCU refused to confirm this, citing ""policy and privacy considerations"".Do you know more about this story? Email 7.30@abc.net.au'We knew we were going to be pioneers'Sorry, this video is not yet available or has expired Some physician assistants like Judith Beneke have found work in private practice.Hoping to leave his career as a paramedic, Derek Greaves enrolled in the physician assistant course at JCU.He graduated in 2017 but has been unable to find a job, and has returned to work as a paramedic.""It's soul-sapping. This has actually damaged my family [and] they've actually damaged me,"" he said.""Why have a course where there's no outcome?""The degrees cost $27,000 and many students quit full-time employment in their final year of study to complete clinical placements. ""I would say if you really want to do the course, go to America or England,"" Mr Greaves said.""Both of those countries actually have physician assistants and they're actually working in the health system."" David Ashard has returned to work as a paramedic after failing to find work as a physician assistant.(ABC News: Michael Atkin)David Ashard left his job as a paramedic six years ago to study at the University of Queensland to become one of the first physician assistants in Australia.""Lifestyle, employability, monetary factors — it was just a really good job,"" he said.""I thought, 'Well, if this is going to be anything like it is in America this is going to be fantastic.'""""I personally was pretty naive about what was going to be required to introduce the new position into Australia."" After graduating, Mr Ashard got a job as a physician assistant working with the Aboriginal community at Cherbourg in Central Queensland.But since the clinic lost funding in 2015, he has returned to work as a paramedic.""We all knew that we were going to be pioneers,"" he said.""I don't think too many of us understood the ramifications of that.""Medical turf war Will Alexander is president of the Australian Society of Physician Assistants.(ABC News: Jerry Rickard)The University of Queensland axed its course in 2011, partly because of ""the significant uncertainty about the future of a physician assistant workforce in Australia"".Perth's Edith Cowan University scrapped plans for a course for the same reason.Is health insurance worth it?If you're about to hit your 30s and you haven't yet got private health insurance, the time to decide is now.Read morePhysician assistants are not eligible for a Medicare provider number, which significantly increases the cost to either the patient or their employer, and the profession is not registered by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA).Beth Mohle, secretary for the Queensland Nurses' Union, said physician assistants could take clinical placements and training positions from young doctors and threaten nursing positions.""We've already got a large number of regulated health professionals, some of whom aren't currently working to their full scope of practice, such as registered nurses, registered midwives,"" she said.""Is a new role that currently is not regulated and hasn't got the same accountability mechanism the answer to the problems of the bush?""Despite the poor employment prospects for graduates, JCU's dean of medicine, Professor Richard Murray, defended the physician assistant course.""We've made an important contribution partly by merely providing the opportunity for those who are enthusiastic about this as an emerging profession,"" he said.""No university degree or course comes with a money-back guarantee of employment, that's just a reality.""The president of the Australian Society of Physician Assistants, Will Alexander, said he was working towards the profession being able to charge for Medicare.""[If successful] we will be able to bill for the services that we provide, which would greatly increase our employability, particularly in the rural and remote regions,"" Mr Alexander said.Posted 7 Feb 20187 Feb 2018Wed 7 Feb 2018 at 9:32pm, updated 7 Feb 20187 Feb 2018Wed 7 Feb 2018 at 10:30pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesRural patients waiting up to eight weeks to see a GPRural Australians want Government to fix healthcare access issuesCalls to stop giving overseas-trained doctors visas to address rural shortageMore on:AustraliaDoctors and Medical ProfessionalsHealthHealthcare FacilitiesMedical ProceduresQLDTownsvilleTop StoriesThe red flags at the centre of AFP's suspicions about the couple charged with spying for RussiaPicasso estate responds to MONA's faked artworksAnalysisVice-President Trump and President Putin of Ukraine — Joe Biden's gaffes keep coming, but he says he's not budgingSeven stand-out moments from Joe Biden's high-pressure press conferenceCFMEU boss John Setka steps down 'Time is running out': Collingwood's premiership defence on thin ice after loss to Geelong in crucial clashBritish man sentenced to life in prison for attempted kidnap and murder of UK presenter Holly WilloughbyWhy Shelley Duvall disappeared from HollywoodBenji apologises to fans after the Tigers are smashed 58-6 by CronullaVenice's debated tourist fee expected to increase 'in coming years', says tourism councillorAussie killed in Ukraine among many 'lulled' to fight war without military trainingRussian-Australian woman charged with spying offences was well-travelled, made lifestyle videosPhilippines police open special investigation into suspected murder of Australian couple as hunt for suspect continuesDubbed the 'Star Wars Project', South Korea plans to use drone-melting lasers against North Korea'All they took was two pies', says Gippsland bakery owner after armed robbers tie up staff in early morning raidPopular NowDon't miss news that matters to you.
