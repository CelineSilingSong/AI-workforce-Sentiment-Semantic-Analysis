The pandemic has accelerated workplace innovation across sectors to the point of no return, with contemporary businesses now almost entirely reliant on new technologies simply to exist. 

 What role, then, does artificial intelligence (AI) have to play in this drastic shift? For some time now, I’ve firmly maintained the belief that AI would take over the vast majority of process-driven work within 15 years. However, with years of key developments in the world of work having recently been crammed into a matter of months, the future has unfolded very differently than we imagined. 


Rather than coming about through careful planning, companies have been thrust into this new way of working. Without doubt, many were unprepared for it and have had to move quickly to put in place remote working solutions to keep business going. They simply didn’t have the time to manage change and implement AI-driven solutions. 

However, many predict that we’ll see remote working becoming part of the ‘new normal’ even after lockdown measures are eased. Companies like Twitter, for example, have already announced that their employees can work from home indefinitely. Assuming that the growing trend towards permanent remote working continues, organisations will need to carefully consider the AI solutions they turn to for automating process-driven work. Yet, how does this affect the security considerations required to make remote working effective for companies? 

PROMOTED
Every time we send a message to a colleague or share a company file, we share bits of data electronically. Data, of course, is the lifeblood of every modern organisation, so when it is shared, it must be done so securely. If we add AI into the mix, we run into a potential data security issue. 
This is because, fundamentally, AI needs data to work properly. Its purpose is to access data, analyse it and generate better outcomes for organisations through automation. In doing so, it replaces certain tasks, but also enables employees to perform existing jobs more effectively.

Yet, despite the productivity gains, this new era of remote working doesn’t necessarily lend itself to AI being used appropriately when it comes to the secure transmission of data. AI-driven communications are just as vulnerable to security flaws as those performed by humans.

This is especially evident when we look closely at the kind of technology enterprises use to communicate internally – a crucial component of any business model outside an office’s four walls. According to Morten Brøgger, CEO of messaging and collaboration platform Wire, AI may not be as intertwined with the future of work as we think: “AI and the future of work aren’t necessarily compatible. Definitely not in the collaboration and communication market or in the future of work 2.0.”

Brøgger continues: “The reason is that if you start building a lot of AI into communication tools, it means surveillance for your users, which is a clear breach of their privacy. If you do need an AI, you need to have the data to examine behavioural patterns. This means breaking end-to-end encryption, because there will be a machine that receives a copy of everything a user is doing.” 
Wire is one of a crop of collaboration tools that have enabled many organisations to continue operating during COVID-19. It found its niche by specifically targeting large enterprises back in 2017, who Brøgger believes have an advanced understanding of the importance of security and privacy. With its leadership team comprising ex-Skype employees, the company now positions itself as being on a mission to change the way employees communicate in the workplace. 
Though organisations can safely integrate AI technology, this abrupt new iteration of the workplace that we’ve suddenly found ourselves in has perhaps gone some way to exposing why AI isn’t the panacea for everything - at least not without careful security planning at the outset. 
As Brøgger notes: “There were a lot of companies who were basically caught in this situation that weren’t ready for it. So, how do they put infrastructure in place that is sufficiently secure to allow people to work from home and work on things that are absolutely confidential? There are no longer any global rules – no one size fits all. That’s not how the world is, even with collaboration.”
It’s clear that the world of work is changing, though it took a pandemic to accelerate that change. Companies need to take stock of how they can make the most of the tools available to them to reduce inefficiencies, and I still maintain that AI is, in many ways, at the heart of that. But it must be done in a way that doesn’t come at the expense of breaching a company’s security and putting its most valuable data assets at risk.

But the basic dynamics of Pac-Man are all there: eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and try not to die. “It learns all of these things just by watching,” Nvidia’s Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation technology, told journalists in a briefing. “[It’s] similar to how a human programmer can watch many episodes of Pac-Man on YouTube and infer what the rules of the games are and reconstruct them.” Lebaredian said the work had been done in collaboration with Pac-Man’s creator, Bandai Namco, which is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the arcade classic today. The AI-generated Pac-Man is a little blurry, but all the basics are there. Image: NvidiaNvidia says work like this shows how artificial intelligence will be used for game design in the future. Developers can input their work into the AI and use it to create variations or maybe design new levels. “You could use this to mash different games together,” Sanja Fidler, director of Nvidia’s Toronto research lab, told journalists, “giving additional power to games developers by [letting them] blend together different games.”Creating AI that can learn the rules of a virtual world just by watching it in action also has implications for tasks like programming robots. “Eventually we’d like it to learn the rules of the real world,” says Lebaredian. The AI might watch videos of robotics trolleys navigating a warehouse, for example, and use that information to design navigation software of its own.The program that recreated Pac-Man is called GameGAN. GAN stands for generative adversarial network and is a common architecture used in machine learning. The basic principle of a GAN is that it works in two halves. The first half of the GAN tries to replicate the input data, while the second half compares this to the original source. If they don’t match, the generated data is rejected and the generator tweaks its work and resubmits it. AI systems like this could be used to train warehouse robots like the one above, which is powered by Nvidia’s hardware and software. Image: NvidiaUsing AI to generate virtual worlds like video games has been done before. But Nvidia’s researchers introduced several new aspects, including a “memory module” that allowed the system to store an internal map of the game world. This leads to greater consistency in the game world, a key characteristic when recreating the mazes of Pac-Man. They also allow for the static elements of the game world (like the maze) to be separated from the dynamic ones (like the ghosts), which suits the company’s goal of using AI to generate new levels.David Ha, an AI researcher at Google who’s worked on similar tasks, told The Verge that the research was “very interesting.” Earlier teams have tried to recreate game worlds using GANs, said Ha, “but from what I know, [this] is the first to demonstrate good results.” “All in all, a very exciting paper, and I look forward to see more developments using this approach,” said Ha. Some elements of the process definitely need tweaking, though, and demonstrate the particular fragility of artificial intelligence when learning new tasks. Fidler told journalists that to recreate Pac-Man, GameGAN had to be trained on some 50,000 episodes. Getting that gameplay data from humans wasn’t feasible, so the team used an AI agent to generate the data. Unfortunately, the AI agent was so good at the game that it hardly ever died.  “That made it hard for the AI trying to recreate the game to learn the concept of dying,” says Fidler. Instead, in early versions of the AI-generated Pac-Man, GameGAN tweaked the game so that ghosts never actually reached the title character but trail directly behind it like baby ducks following a parent. “It’s a funny effect of the way we trained it,” says Fidler.

After the COVID-19 pandemic is over and the economy reopens, many students will resume work on their careers. But for many young people, their priorities are going to shift. After seeing the pain and suffering caused by a single invisible enemy, some will naturally prioritize biomedical research over other easier and more lucrative trades, like law and finance. And some will choose to pursue possibly the most impactful area, which lies on the borderline of computer science and biomedicine - Artificial Intelligence (AI) for drug discovery.  


However, many women have historically seen both AI and drug discovery as predominantly male professions. And, according to a study we performed with a group of colleagues a few years back, women comprised only a small fraction of the top executives and board members in the Forbes 500 list of corporations.

However, news over the last two weeks has allowed the industry to take a breath of fresh air and has given renewed hope to the millions of young high-performing women entering the workforce. 

PROMOTED
Dr. Fei-Fei Li appointed to the board of Twitter after leaving Google 

Two years after Google removed its motto of “don’t be evil” from the corporate code of conduct and replaced it with “do the right thing”, “the right thing” started yielding lucrative military contracts, including the now famous Project Maven. One of the greatest AI scientists of our time, Dr. Fei-Fei Li, a computer science professor at Stanford and VP at Google, was one of the first to raise concerns about how this military engagement could impact the company. Dr. Li was the mastermind of the ImageNet project, which ignited a revolution in AI by demonstrating that deep learning systems can now outperform humans in image recognition. These ultra-fast and highly-accurate machine vision systems can now be widely used in military drone applications and have the potential to  be grossly misused. Dr. Li quit Google and joined Twitter last week as an independent board member. Twitter has a lot to gain from this celebrity appointment.

Many of the frequently-invited speakers to the top AI, data science, and drug discovery conferences know Dr. Najat Khan as one of the most well informed executives in AI for drug discovery and development. Previously, Janssen was comparatively slow with the adoption of AI joining a couple of university and industry AI consortiums and showcasing these as achievements. And to take data science efforts to the next level, Janssen’s new Global Head of Research and Development, Dr. Mathai Mammen, set up R&D Data Science as a top priority with a focus on Applied Data Science - the central figure in this is Dr. Najat Khan, who has already demonstrated a strong track record of delivering on measurable outcomes using Data Science tied to Janssen’s pipeline priorities. She has researched the field so deeply that the top management from other big pharma and AI companies started seeking her advice. She has a very unusual biography where she started her career as a Computational scientist, followed by a PhD in Organic Chemistry from an Ivy League school, almost a decade of leadership and strategy management consulting experience at the Boston Consulting Group across R&D and Commercial at top firms, deep knowledge of technology, and a track record to solve complex problems and deep experience leading teams with diverse skillsets. So when the company started executing on its Data Science strategy and vision, Najat was promoted to a newly-formed role of a Chief Data Science Officer (CDSO). In the pharma industry, the word “AI” is often associated with hype and the more conservative scientists in the trenches often use it as an excuse to resist change. My guess is that this was one of the reasons why “Data Science” was chosen for this critical organizational role and we should expect the other pharma companies to follow. Kudos to J&J.

Dr. Iya Khalil recruited by Novartis as the head of the new AI Center established in collaboration with Microsoft
When you meet Dr. Iya Khali at a conference for the first time, you will see a postdoctoral student or a young university professor in her 20s or early 30s. But when she walks on stage and starts presenting her case studies you will naturally start looking for a bio in a conference program. 
Founded in the year 2000 by Iya Khalil and Colin Hill out of Cornell University in New York,  Gene Network Sciences (GNS) was focusing on the applications of computational biology to drug discovery.  In 2010 it formed a subsidiary, GNS Healthcare to focus on the applications of data science in the healthcare industry. The company built a strong brand and presence in multiple industries driven by Dr. Khalil’s relentless pursuit of innovative solutions that solve practical problems. In fact, GNS Healthcare was doing so well that the move to a new role with a big pharma company caught many industry insiders by surprise. 
In 2017 Novartis surprised the market by appointing then 41-year-old Dr. Vasanth (Vas) Narasimhan as the CEO of the company. His major strategic directive - digital transformation. In October 2019 this strategy culminated in a partnership between Novartis and Microsoft intended to transform medicine with artificial intelligence. While Novartis is clearly one of the leaders in innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, Microsoft is not as well-known for pioneering innovative work in AI in drug discovery or drug development. But it also managed to partner with AstraZeneca and added the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, Emma Walmsley, to its board of directors. On a side note, the Chief Digital & Technology Officer (CDTO) of GSK is also a brilliant female executive, Karenann Terrell.  
The partnership between Microsoft and Novartis resulted in the formation of an AI Innovation Lab at Novartis intended to develop AI for end-to-end drug discovery and development across the entire organization. The success of this lab technically defines the success of the entire organization in its AI efforts. It had to be a sure bet and Novartis started looking for an AI expert with an impeccable track record of delivering results.  Many industry insiders held their breath and debated who is it going to be and who could fill this highly-visible and demanding role. Some theorized that either Novartis or Microsoft would acquire an existing platform and team to accelerate. However, to everyone’s surprise, and cheers, Novartis managed to miraculously lure Dr. Iya Khalil to take the driver’s seat. The industry insiders can now rest easy. The lab is in good hands. Congratulations to Novartis on grabbing one of the high-power female AI executives from a top startup. 
BioPhamaTrend published a report on 11 Inspiring women in AI for drug discovery
A new industry publication and analytical house, BiopharmaTrend, compiled a list of female scientists leading the way in AI-powered drug discovery and development. The list is structured by the publication record and impact. I know many of these women personally and some of them are the original inventors of technologies that are transforming the way we think about drug discovery. While I know over half of these leaders personally, I was also very happy to see Dr. Elena Tutubalina, one of the rising stars in deep learning for natural language processing (NLP) on this list. 
A Spring for Women in AI 
To conclude, while there is still a long way to go before we see equal numbers of women in AI for healthcare, the glass ceiling is breaking and I cannot think of a better career choice for a young woman. From personal experience, I may add that just a week ago I got to take part in the AI and longevity group meetings in our organization where I was the only male. AI-powered drug discovery is likely to be the most impactful field of research in the 21st century, and it would be great to see it being led by a group of ambitious women. The two fields that were previously dominated by males are converging and attracting many great female leaders. The glass ceilings are breaking, and soon cease to exist.

 Deepfake is a new media technology wherein a person simply takes existing text, picture, video, or audio and then manipulates, i.e., ‘fakes’ it to look like someone else using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network (NN) technology After its first appearance a few years back, deepfake technology has evolved from an innocuous tech geek’s chicanery to a malicious slandering weapon. In this article, we’ll see what exactly this dreaded deepfake tech is, how it works, what different forms it comes in, and how we can detect or bust a deepfake. Recommended Video for you:PlayWhat Is An AI Camera? What Makes It So Powerful?  What Is Deepfake? Deepfake is one of the buzzwords in media technology wherein a person simply takes existing text, picture, video, or audio and then manipulates, i.e., ‘fakes’ it to look like someone else using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network (NN) technology. Want to put abusive words in the mouth of your nemesis? Or swap the movie protagonist with your favorite Hollywood superstar? Or do you just want to make yourself dance like Michael Jackson? Then deepfake is what you need! Deepfake content is growing exponentially. Unfortunately, deepfake tech has already been repeatedly used to gain political mileage, to tarnish the image of a rival, or to commit financial fraud. Let’s now look into the three main types of deepfakes and explore the data science that allows them to work. We’ll also focus on deepfake detection technologies that researchers and security consultants are working on to curb the malicious use of deepfakes.  Also Read: How Does FaceApp Work?Deepfake Text In the early days of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), it was posited that it would be a challenge for a machine to do a creative activity like painting or writing. Fast-forward to 2021; with the powerful language models and libraries that have been built over the years by the incremental work of researchers and data science professionals, top-rated AI-generated prose can now write with humanlike pith and coherence. With the powerful language models and libraries, AI-powered software tools can now compose prose with humanlike pith and coherence. (Photo Credit : kung_tom/Shutterstock) GPT-2 Take, for example, GPT-2—the latest breed of the text-generation system released by research lab OpenAI from Silicon Valley. This tech has impressed both the layman and domain experts with its ability to churn out coherent text with minimal prompts. OpenAI engineers used over 8 million textual documents that were scrapped (method of relevant data extraction from webpages) and combined with a billion parameters for modeling and training of GPT-2 AI. The essence of deepfake and other such technologies like deeplearning, which leverage artificial technologies, lies in training the software to think and adapt itself using past data it is fed through data sets. You can read more about artificial intelligence in this article. Using GPT-2, you can just punch in the headline and the deepfake text algorithm will generate a fictitious news story around that headline. Or simply supply it a first line of a poem and it will return the whole verse. Many media houses are using deepfake algorithms coupled with web scrapping to generate stories or blogs that are written by the software themselves. Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counter-terrorism (CTEC) warns that tools like GPT-2 can be misused to propagate racial supremacy or disseminate radical messages by extremist organizations. by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeHappy in ShapeFarmer Finds Missing Cow After 8 Months - Watch What Happend To The Cow!Happy in ShapeUndoVoIPGoodbye Cell Phone, Hello VoIP (Find Out Why Everyone Is Switching to VoIP)many Americans still don't know about these new cell phone and landline alternativesVoIPLearn MoreUndoDeepfakes On Social Media In tandem with writing stories or blogs, deepfake technology can also be leveraged to create a fake online profile that would be hard for a normal user to discern. For example, a Bloomberg (non-existing) journalist with the name Maisy Kinsley on social networking sites like LinkedIn and Twitter was plausibly a deepfake. Her profile picture appeared strange, perhaps computer generated. The profile was probably created for financial benefit, as the profile of Maisy Kinsley repeatedly tried to connect with short-sellers of Tesla stock on social media. Short-sellers are people who are bearish on the stock market and they short, i.e, sell the stock with the conviction that the stock price will fall and then buy stock at a lower price, effectively generating a handsome profit. Another profile with the name Katie Jones, which supposedly mentioned working at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was found to be a deepfake created with the mala fide intention of spying. Detecting Textual Deepfakes Researchers from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence have developed a software tool called Grover to detect synthetic content floating online. Researchers claim that this software is able to detect deepfake-written essays 92% of the time. Grover works on a test set compiled from Common Crawl, an open-source web archive and crawler. Similarly, a team of scientists from Harvard and the MIT-IBM Watson laboratory have come together to design Giant Language Model Test Room, a web tool that seeks to discern whether the text inputted is generated by AI.  Also Read: Bot Or Not: How To Tell A Bot From A HumanDeepfake Video Making fake photos and videos is the main arsenal of deepfakes. It is the most used form of deepfake, given that we are living in the ubiquitous world of social media, wherein pictures and videos elucidate events and stories better than plain text. Modern video-generating AI is more capable, and perhaps more dangerous, than its natural language counterpart. Seoul-based tech company Hyperconnect recently developed a tool called MarioNETte that can generate deepfake videos of historical figures, celebrities, and politicians. This is done through facial reenactment by another person, whose facial expressions are then superimposed on the targeted personality whose deepfake is to be created.  How Deepfake Video Is Produced? This video trickery employs a technique called generative adversarial network (GAN). GAN is a part of a machine learning branch called neural networks. These networks are designed to emulate the neuronal processes of the human brain. Programmers can train neural networks to recognize or manipulate a specific task. In GAN used for deepfake generation, two neural networks are pitted against each other to generate a realistic output. The purpose of doing so is to ensure that the deepfakes are created to look as real as possible. The essence of GAN lies in the rivalry between the two neural networks. In GAN, the picture forger and the forgery detector repeatedly attempt to outsmart one another. Both the neural networks are trained using the same data set. The first net is called the generator, whose job it is to generate a forged image using noise vectors (a list of random numbers) that look as realistic as possible. The second net, called the discriminator, determines the veracity of the generated images. It compares the forged image generated by the generator with the genuine images in the data set to determine which images are real and which are fake. On the basis of those results, the generator varies the parameter for generating images. This cycle goes on until the discriminator fails to ascertain that a generated image is bogus, which is then used in the final output. This is why deepfakes look so eerily real. Demonstration of generative adversarial network (GAN) (Photo Credit : ShadeDesign/ Shutterstock) Detecting Deepfake Videos Forensic experts across the globe are toiling hard to come up with ways and tools to identify deepfakes, as they are becoming more and more convincing every day. For example, consider this deepfake demonstration video of Obama released by Buzzfeed in 2018, which stupefied viewers across the globe. You can check it out here: Play As machine-learning tools are reaching the masses, it has become much easier to create convincing fake videos that could be used to disseminate propaganda-driven news or to simply harass a targeted individual. The US Defense Department (DARPA) has released a tool for detecting deepfakes called Media Forensics. Originally, the program was developed to automate existing forensic tools, but with the rise of deepfakes, they have used AI to counter AI-driven deepfakes. Let’s see how it works. The resultant video generated using deepfake technically has discernible differences in the way the video’s metadata is distributed, as compared to the original one. These differences are referred to as glimpses in matrix, which is what DARPA’s deepfake detection tool tries to leverage when detecting deepfake media. Siwei Lyu, professor from the computer science department at the State University of New York, has noted that faces created using deepfake technology seldom blink. Even if they do, it seems unnatural. He posits that this is because most of the deepfake-driven videos are trained using still images. Still, photographs of a person are generally taken when their eyes are open. Besides eye blinking, other data points on facial movements, such as when they raise upper lip while conversing, how they shake their heads etc. can also provide clues as to whether the streamed video is fake.  Deepfake Audio The power of artificial intelligence and neural networks isn’t just limited to text, pictures, and video. They can clone a person’s voice with the same ease. All that is required is a data set of the audio recording of a person whose voice needs to be emulated. Deepfake algorithms will learn from that data set and becomes empowered to recreate the prosody of a targeted person’s speech. Commercial software is being released in the market like Lyrebird and Deep Voice, wherein you need to speak only a few sentences before the AI has grown accustomed to your voice and intonation. As you feed in more audio of yourself, this software becomes powerful enough to clone your voice. After feeding in the dataset of your own audio samples, you can just give a sentence or a paragraph and this deepfake software will narrate the text in your voice! Detecting Deepfake Audio Right now, there are not many dedicated deepfake audio tools available, but developers and cybersecurity companies are working in this domain to come up with better protective solutions in this regard. For example, last year, developers at tech startup Resemble developed an open-source tool called Resemblyzer for the detection of deepfake audio clips. Resemblyzer uses advanced machine-learning algorithms for deriving computation representations of voice samples to predict whether they are real or fake. Whenever a user submits an audio file for evaluation, it generates a mathematical representation summarizing the unique characteristics of the submitted voice sample. Through this conversion, it becomes possible for the machine to detect whether the voice is real or artificially produced by deepfake tools.  Also Read: What Is Artificial Intelligence And How Is It Powering Our Lives?The Road Ahead With Deepfakes An investigation done by Deeptrace labs last year found that over 14,000 deepfake videos are lurking online. They have also noted a jump of 84% in their production in a span of just seven months. Interestingly, more than 90% of deepfake videos are pornographic material, wherein famous women are face-swapped in porn. As deepfake is getting serious traction, it is posing a serious problem of intruding not just on the privacy, but also the dignity of individuals. Ironically, to counter AI-powered deepfakes, artificial intelligence itself is being used. Although a ‘good’ AI is helping to identify deepfakes, this detection system relies highly upon the dataset it consumes for training. This means they can work well to detect deepfake videos of celebrities, as a vast amount of data is available about them. But to detect the deepfake of a person who has a low profile would be challenging for such detection systems. Social media tech giants are working on deepfake detection systems as well. Facebook recently announced that it is working on an automated system to identify deepfake content on its platform and weed it out. On similar lines, Twitter proposed flagging deepfakes and eliminating them if they’re found to be provocative. Although we acknowledge and appreciate efforts by these tech companies, only time will tell how successful they are at keeping malicious deepfakes at bay!

H The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic seems to generally have dispelled a few hardened organisational “myths” (for example, large scale work-from-home is not possible) and forced companies to relook at how they work and interact with key stakeholders. Companies, and subsequently employees have been compelled to innovate-on-the-go (for example, quickly shipping large screen monitors and printers to the home of employees before lockdown closed the markets). Perhaps, it would not be an exaggeration to say that even the best drafted Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) for most companies were stretched to the limit and yet struggled to cope with the rapid and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic. From the evidence available thus far, it seems apparent that the world will have to learn to adapt swiftly and significantly to a “new normal” of work to deal with the current (and potential future) phases of Covid-19. Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a very important role in defining this “new normal” of work in the Covid-19 (and post-Covid-19) world. More specifically, automation and AI can help companies infuse three key attributes of agility/flexibility, responsiveness, and frugality, enabling companies to better adapt to the fast changing situations in the times of Covid-19. Agility/flexibility: Most organisations in the pre-Covid-19 world were “human intensive,” wherein most work (especially in the non-manufacturing sectors) was performed by humans. A fundamental challenge with “human intensive” organisations is swift scalability based on the demands that the dynamic environment Covid-19 presents. For instance, when most governments announced policies related to mortgage payment deferment to help citizens better cope with Covid-19-related economic challenges, several banks and financial institutions had to scamper for additional human resources to process the sudden spike in these additional (and probably one-time and time-sensitive) transactions. This is where Automation and AI can help organisations significantly. Both Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and AI bots are typically hosted on servers and hence, do not need to change work locations as humans were required to. They can also be replicated (scaled up or down) almost on demand. The evidence in the marketplace suggests that those banks who had employed automation to deal with these demand fluctuations in work generally fared much better than those who relied primarily on humans working remotely to handle the additional workload.

For instance, in several companies, IT and HR support were typically located in defined physical spaces or in call centres. However, as most employees began to work remotely, it became difficult for them to get answers on important IT and HR-related questions. Automation and AI can help manage these interactions efficiently and also enhance the stakeholder experience. For example, certain companies leveraged technologies such as chatbots to answer employee queries quickly, effectively, and remotely. This helped reduce employee anxiety and improve productivity. The same interaction technology can be leveraged to enhance interaction experience with other important stakeholders such as customers and vendors. Another example is that of a global automobile player, which recently launched its online sales, 360 degree digital services, and a contactless-service experience in the first week of April. They leveraged robotics, AI, and ML technologies to bring continuity to their operations and minimise disruptions for their customers.

Hence, it is crucial that companies focus on their bottom line to actively manage profitability. Automation and AI can help companies effectively manage and optimise costs. For example, technologies such as RPA, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can automate 25–50 per cent of processes. This will help companies achieve better outcomes at lower costs and also free up human time for higher value work (e.g., better serving high-value customers, responding faster to regulatory requirements or government directives). Also Read: Govt staff may get work from home option for 15 days a year Cyborg chess has demonstrated that when human and machine capabilities come together, they produce better results than both “human only” and “machine only” capabilities. As companies across the world adapt to new ways of working, automation and AI can create a HumBot (human + robot) workforce to effectively combine the human capability of superior thinking with the fast-execution capability of robots. Companies that successfully combine human and machine capabilities will not only survive the challenging conditions but will likely come out with newer, better, and stronger capabilities. These enhanced capabilities will enable organisations to “rewrite the rules of the game” in their industries and occupy a place of sustainable prominence in the revamped competitive landscape of the current and post-Covid-19 world.

Trump launched the American Artificial Intelligence Initiative, the Nation's strategy for promoting American leadership in AI, by signing Executive Order 13859 in February 2019. Reportedly, the American AI Initiative focuses the resources of the Federal Government to support AI innovation that will increase prosperity, enhance national security, and improve quality of life for the American people. This national strategy for promoting United States leadership in AI emphasizes the following key policies and practices:.Invest in AI research and development.The United States has decided to promote Federal investment in AI R&amp;D in collaboration with industry, academia, international partners and allies, and other non-Federal entities to generate technological breakthroughs in AI. President Trump called for a 2-year doubling of non-defense AI R&amp;D in his fiscal year (FY) 2021 budget proposal, and in 2019 the Administration updated its AI R&amp;D strategic plan, developed the first progress report describing the impact of Federal R&amp;D investments, and published the first-ever reporting of government-wide non-defense AI R&amp;D spending..Unleash AI resources.The United States is adamant on enhancing access to high-quality Federal data, models, and computing resources to increase their value for AI R&amp;D, while maintaining and extending safety, security, privacy, and confidentiality protections. The American AI Initiative called on Federal agencies to identify new opportunities to increase access to and use of Federal data and models. In 2019, the White House Office of Management and Budget established the Federal Data Strategy as a framework for operational principles and best practices around how Federal agencies use and manage data..Remove barriers to AI innovation.The United States is making efforts in reducing barriers to the safe development, testing, deployment, and adoption of AI technologies by providing guidance for the governance of AI consistent with our Nation's values and by driving the development of appropriate AI technical standards. As part of the American AI Initiative, The White House published for comment the proposed United States AI Regulatory Principles, the first AI regulatory policy that advances innovation underpinned by American values and good regulatory practices. In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the first-ever strategy for Federal engagement in the development of AI technical standards..Train an AI-ready workforce.The United States is empowering current and future generations of American workers through apprenticeships; skills programs; and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with an emphasis on computer science, to ensure that American workers, including Federal workers, are capable of taking full advantage of the opportunities of AI. President Trump directed all Federal agencies to prioritize AI-related AMERICAN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVE: YEAR ONE ANNUAL REPORT – apprenticeship and job training programs and opportunities. In addition to its R&amp;D focus, the National Science Foundation's new National AI Research Institutes program will also contribute to workforce development, particularly of AI researchers..Promote an international environment supportive of American AI innovation.The United States is working on engaging internationally to promote a global environment that supports American AI research and innovation and opens markets for American AI industries while also protecting our technological advantage in AI. Last year, the United States led historic efforts at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop the first international consensus agreements on fundamental principles for the stewardship of trustworthy AI. The United States also worked with its international partners in the G7 and G20 to adopt similar AI principles..Embrace trustworthy AI for government services and missions.The United States is readily embracing technology such as artificial intelligence to improve the provision and efficiency of government services to the American people and ensure its application shows due respect for our Nation's values, including privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The General Services Administration established an AI Center of Excellence to enable Federal agencies to determine best practices for incorporating AI into their organizations..America's strong innovation ecosystem, fueled by strategic Federal investments, visionary scientists and entrepreneurs, and renowned research institutions, has propelled United States global leadership in AI. However, continued leadership is not predetermined. Maintaining America's preeminent role in AI can only be realized by continually building upon our progress and pursuing a strategic, forwardlooking approach in partnership with industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and other non-Federal entities..Global leadership in AI matters. With the United States in the lead — together with like-minded allies — we will shape the trajectory of AI development for the good of the American people — enriching our lives, promoting innovation, fostering trust and understanding, and ensuring our national defense and security..Importance of partnerships to maintaining United States leadership in AI .In all areas of strategic emphasis, partnerships and collaboration with academia, industry, nonprofit organizations, civil society, other non-Federal entities, and international partners and allies are of growing importance. Concurrent advances across government, universities, and industry mutually reinforce an innovative, vibrant American AI sector. Public-private partnerships enable strategic leveraging of resources, including facilities, datasets, and expertise. These partnerships also accelerate the transition of research innovations to practice, by leveraging industry expertise to turn open and published research results into viable products and services in the marketplace for economic growth..In the education and workforce area, partnerships are enhancing education and training for next-generation researchers, technicians, and workers, so that all can contribute to the 21st century economy. Partnerships with nonprofit organizations and civil society can help address important societal challenges arising from technological developments. The Nation also benefits from relationships between Federal agencies and international partners who work together to address key challenges. AI partnerships with allies and partners represent one of our sources of strategic competitive advantage..US Global Leadership in AI in Numbers.According to Analytics Insight,.Total number of Open AI Jobs in 2020: 743,682.Average Salary of AI Professionals in 2020: US$114,061 per annum.AI Market Revenue in 2020: US$25.9 billion.Moreover, the AI market in North American region with market share of 47%, is expected to grow from US$20.0 billion in 2019 to US$71.9 billion in 2023 with a CAGR of 29.2% during the forecast period of 2019-2023.

To give a head start to those aspiring to build a career in this domain, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, and TSW, the executive education division of Times Professional Learning (a part of The Times of India Group), have joined hands to offer a postgraduate certificate programme in artificial intelligence and deep learning.In a virtual launch ceremony on Thursday, Professor Sarit Kumar Das, director of IIT-Ropar, and Anish Srikrishna, CEO, Times Professional Learning, signed an MoU for a long term collaboration. The postgraduate certificate programme is the first to be launched as a part of the collaboration. The six-month course will have an exhaustive curriculum that includes modules on emerging technologies and AI, data science, machine learning (ML), programming with Tensorflow, deep learning (DL) and neural networks, image recognition, speech recognition, AI applications and a capstone project.Designed with inputs from industry and striking the right balance between rigour and effort to make it highly suitable for working professionals, the programme will be conducted on weekends via live online sessions. Upon completion of the course, the scholars will be awarded a joint certificate by TSW and IITRopar. They will also be accorded the status of IIT-Ropar executive education alumni.Applications for the course will commence from July 20, and classes are likely to begin from the first week of September. To be eligible, an aspirant should have a minimum of two years of work experience in the IT industry. Though an engineering degree is desirable, a coding or mathematics background is not a criterion for admission. Selection will be on the basis of application and an interview.IIT-Ropar has a global reputation, with high ranking in Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020, QS India Rankings 2020 and Union HRD ministry’s National Institutional Ranking Framework. Professor Das said, “IIT-Ropar focuses on promoting cutting-edge research and high-quality publications in all disciplines. It is expanding its outreach to industry and the best academic institutions in the world through active collaborations.”The AI and machine learning components will be coordinated by Indo-Taiwan Joint Research Centre (ITJRC, supported by the ministry of science and technology, Taiwan) at IIT-Ropar. The online sessions will be delivered by faculty from IIT and by industry experts. Rohit Sharma, coordinator of the centre, said, “ITJRC focuses on academia-to-academia and academia-to-industry collaborations in AI and ML domains. This partnership with TSW will help us take our expertise to a wider audience.”Times Professional Learning’s Srikrishna responded, “We are happy to partner IIT-Ropar in bringing AI and DL to our learner community. With the job market for AI poised to grow substantially, the programme will surely help meet the career aspirations of professionals.”To know more, you can email: tswadmission@timesgroup.com or call: 7400084666",,,,,,en,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/75880765'}",,,,,,,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/iit-ropar-tsw-join-hands-on-artificial-intelligence-certificate-programme/articleshow/75880765.cms,,,,,,
