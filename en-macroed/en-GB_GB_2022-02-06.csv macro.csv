Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning technologies have entered the mainstream; they are being adopted by enterprises all over the world. While these technologies certainly hold the potential to vastly improve the quality of operations in the corporate sector, they also stand to disrupt many existing markets.
AI can easily be extended, adapted, and applied to different business operations. When considering that AI is just a computer program, we can begin to see the potential scope of the technology. The reason that AI is being adopted on such a large scale is due to its capacity to bring intelligence to tasks that previously did not have it.
This, coupled with the technology’s ability to automate repetitive processes with intelligence, makes it a highly disruptive power in various sectors. Keeping this in mind, we explored some of the industries that are most likely to be impacted by the widespread adoption of AI technology. Let us see why companies are so eager to adopt artificial intelligence.

Why AI Is a Disruptive Force
To look at the capabilities of AI, we must first look at what AI is. In simple terms, artificial intelligence is a computer program that can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence. Instead of simply following commands given to it, AI employs intelligent strategies and heuristics to bring a human-like intelligence to solving problems like any other computer program.
1. Improvement Through Machine Learning
Machine learning programs form a subset of AI that has the ability to learn from the data fed to them, even after being deployed. This gives a utility factor to companies adopting ML algorithms, as maintenance and upgrade costs are reduced. Moreover, the self-improving nature of ML allows solutions to dynamically develop according to the needs of the problems at hand.
The capabilities of AI range far and wide in an enterprise setting, but one of the biggest things to note is that clean data makes AI better. Hence, such algorithms are well-suited to businesses, where there is an established data workflow with a large volume of data. Today, data collection and data storage have become a norm, but sectors which have maintained long-standing data banks, such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, will stand to benefit the most from an AI solution.
While the capabilities of AI are varied and different from deployment to deployment, some characteristics exist across all kinds of AI. Primarily, they can utilize large amounts of data to iterate towards better solutions. This is a huge draw for companies that have collected large amounts of data. They can simply train an AI to solve a certain problem using this data and deploy a solution explicitly suited to their needs.
AI can be deployed and improved upon with minimal effort and can also be tailored to a company’s requirements using data. This close fit of solutions for the problem at hand is one of the biggest reasons companies are flocking to AI solutions. This, combined with the capability of machine learning algorithms to improve upon themselves with additional data, makes AI an easy buy for enterprises.
2. Reduced Expenses
Another unique selling proposition of artificial intelligence solutions is that they are not only orders of magnitude faster than human labor, but also considerably cheaper. This softens the blow for companies looking to explore AI as a solution, as the potential monetary gains are much higher than the initial investment.
Cloud computing and the vast variety of cloud service providers are also helping in AI adoption. Not only is the cloud deployment of AI cheaper than an on-premise solution, but it also comes with plug-and-play tools. The pricing is flexible, which further decreases the initial investment that companies have to make in order to try an AI solution.
3. Predictive Advantage
Predictive analytics, a branch of AI, is very useful across industries. Using machine learning algorithms and predictive models, a program can be trained to find the relationship between various variables. The program then uses this information to predict what the relationship between the variables will be like in the future.
For example, a predictive algorithm employed in a supply chain scenario will be trained using the data of the shipments. The quantity, supply, and demand of each item will be ingested by the algorithm, among other data. Then, the program can accurately predict the required quantity to be shipped by looking at past relationships between supply and demand.
As one can imagine, predictive analytics can optimize processes vastly, cutting down on warehousing costs and overheads. This is especially useful in retail, supply chain, and logistics markets. Predictive analytics is simply indicative of another useful characteristic of complex AI programs; pattern recognition.
By utilizing concepts from statistics and computer science, an ML program can be trained to recognize patterns. This not only includes patterns in the harvested data but also in areas, such as image and video recognition. This gives it considerable use in healthcare, defense, and customer service.
Let’s delve deeper into industries that are most likely to be disrupted by AI and ML solutions.

Industries That Will Get Disrupted by AI
Artificial intelligence has entered various industries over the past five years. With the enterprise adoption of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, many existing sectors have seen widespread disruption by the new technology. Let’s take a look at the ten industries that will get disrupted by AI the most.
1. Healthcare
AI’s adoption in the healthcare sector promises to bring a lot of benefits to adopters. Primarily, the healthcare sector as a whole has been geared towards collecting accurate and relevant data about patients and those who come into care. This makes AI a good fit for the data-rich world of healthcare. Secondarily, AI can find a variety of use-cases in the healthcare sector.
The introduction of AI can enable the widespread deployment of predictive healthcare. Using the power of predictive analytics, AI can help doctors make proactive moves towards ensuring their patients’ health. This is a much better approach to healthcare than the reactive approach taken today. With the rise of IoT-enabled embedded devices, doctors can remotely monitor the health of patients, and can also be informed in case a patient is in an emergency.
Apart from predictive healthcare, AI can also enable an easier analysis of scan results through image recognition. This has already been used to help doctors diagnose symptoms at a much higher rate, as AI can comb through multiple scans much faster than humans. Health chatbots are also being developed. These bots will allow doctors to collect preliminary data regarding the symptoms of the patient.
industry conducts mission-critical operations.
2. Customer Service and Experience
AI has already begun to disrupt customer service. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have found their way into customer-facing helplines in the form of chatbots. These chatbots can collect information about a customer’s issues and enable customer support executives to work more efficiently. In certain cases, they are also able to resolve the customer’s issues on their own, only escalating to human executives if necessary.
Due to their ability to accurately understand what the customer is saying, sufficiently advanced NLP algorithms may replace customer support executives altogether. Instead of being a statically assigned algorithm with a set of predefined responses, the chatbot can dynamically adapt itself to any issue the customer is facing. Moreover, as the customer does not need to wait to get connected with a support executive, the waiting time is reduced, thereby improving customer experience.
Apart from chatbots and customer helplines, recommendation engines can also prove beneficial. Amazon is an excellent example of this. The website dynamically generates a distinct homepage for all of its customers based on their browsing habits. Netflix also utilizes recommendation engines to a great extent, thus enhancing customer experience by providing tailored recommendations for each user.
3. Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)
AI and the financial sector are a great fit for each other. Similar to healthcare, BFSI companies have been collecting, collating, and organizing data for many decades, making AI a natural addition to the field. The technology has been used to detect the chance of an individual conducting a fraudulent transaction.
Banking is a sector where paperwork and documentation are ever-present. AI can also automate processes that were previously done manually, such as paperwork and documentation. This will not only decrease the time required to solve issues but also enable banks to serve customers better.
Moreover, predictive analysis has also found great success in the BFSI sector. Banks can identify high-value customers using predictive analytics through data mining and parsing text online. They can also retain customers longer by providing additional services based on their spending and financial activities.
By looking at the customer’s credit history, an AI can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan. This streamlines the process of onboarding new customers while reducing the likelihood of non-payment.

4. Logistics
AI in logistics holds the potential to drastically change operations. Predictive analytics can accurately predict the inventory required by a vendor and optimize routes to minimize overhead costs.
Ab InBev, the worldwide distributor for beverages like Budweiser and Corona, has used AI to optimize logistics to a great extent. Using predictive analytics, the organization was not only able to brew the optimal amount of each beverage, but also accurately predict the demand of a certain product. This allowed them to cut down the warehousing expenses and overhead costs significantly.
Shipping companies also stand to benefit greatly from implementing AI. Usually, document checks at customs stations hold up the shipping process. Today, it takes multiple working days for a ship to get clearance to ship all its goods. Image recognition algorithms and intelligent automation can help customs officials conduct checks more seamlessly by scanning the documents involved, transitioning it into a digital realm.
This data can then be used to accurately keep track of shipments while cutting down on time spent at ports. Due to the technology’s benefits, the worldwide shipping industry has also adopted AI, especially predictive analytics, to optimize supply chain economics.
5. Retail
Retail analytics is already seeing widespread adoption among retailers. Apart from optimizing the supply chain, retailers are also able to accurately predict how much to stock in their supermarkets. Moreover, by collecting data about the way that customers access the store, they are able to arrange the products according to customer preferences, thereby increasing the overall sales.
Retail is also set to be disrupted by AI in the form of self-shop stores. Amazon has already demonstrated a proof-of-concept for completely autonomous shopping. Amazon Go has already opened several stores all over the United States. It utilizes machine learning, deep learning, image recognition, and smart automation to allow customers to walk in and walk out with the products of their choice.
Apart from brick-and-mortar establishments, Amazon has cemented its leadership role in online marketplaces through retail analytics. By analyzing the customer browsing patterns and their purchases on the site, Amazon is able to accurately predict similar products, thus maximizing sales.
6. Cybersecurity
AI in cybersecurity can work with vast databases that most cybersecurity companies maintain to check for virus attacks. The technology is also being adopted by antivirus companies to provide a proactive method of combating cyberattacks.
Due to a large amount of existing data on the kinds of cyber-attacks, malware, and attack vectors, AI can be trained to exhibit reasoning. This will allow companies to employ set-it-and-forget-it AI solutions that will continually monitor the network for any suspicious activity. If an out-of-place activity is detected, the algorithm can immediately patch the hole in security or notify human handlers of the problem. This reduces the time required to solve the problem, thus minimizing risk and loss of information.
In addition to this, long-term cyberattacks on high-profile targets, such as multinational enterprises, can also be detected sooner by AI solutions. AI actively monitors the networks for malicious activities, thus allowing a company to detect an attack a lot sooner. This is integral in reducing damage and protecting the company from financial and data losses.
7. Transportation
Autonomous driving is considered as one of the most revolutionary uses of AI in the real world. Self-driving cars have already made their way into the mainstream due to companies like Tesla, and even Uber is looking into deploying autonomous vehicles. Giants like Google are also creating self-driving technology.
Apart from this, autonomous driving can also be used for goods transportation. Self-driving trucks will enable quicker deliveries and more efficient spending, as they will not require rest stops and will cost lesser than human drivers. An example of this is Tesla’s Semi automobile. This truck has safety features that are made possible by AI algorithms. These image processing algorithms can determine if a collision is imminent based on the speed of the vehicle and the perceived depth of other vehicles on the road.
Soon, this technology will advance enough to allow humans to take the position of a supervisor, who will only be required to monitor the AI. Driving will become autonomous in such circumstances, thereby reducing the strain on human drivers and cutting down the expenses for companies.

8. Marketing
The marketing industry will benefit from AI in two main ways. The first is more personalized messaging, and the second is better targeting. Other smaller benefits, such as intelligent automation and AI-based tools, have already begun surfacing and are being adopted.
AI marketing solutions can also determine the most effective messaging for a company based on customer preferences. For example, if a customer orders a pair of shoes, the algorithm sends out a notification to the customer for similar products, thereby increasing the likelihood of the customer buying another product.
AI will enable marketing departments to reach customers more easily, as targeted advertising using neural networks becomes more widespread. Services like Google and Facebook ads have already started using AI technology for better targeting. Recommendation engines can also be used for personalized advertisements on a user-to-user basis.
9. Defense
Even though the advancement of autonomous weapons has been regulated heavily, this sector is sure to develop with the amount of capital being poured into it. Ethical consequences of creating autonomous weapons have also been considered, but AI-powered weapons are said to be indicative of the next arms race.
Apart from autonomous weapons, image recognition and video recognition may be used for surveillance of the general population. By building upon existing databases with biometric and facial scans, a citizen can be identified using facial recognition algorithms in surveillance networks. This increases the general security of the nation while reducing human intervention.
Ethical discussions about the use of this technology have also emerged, as it can be misused to enforce an authoritarian style of rule. Such technology has already seen deployment in China, where widespread facial recognition algorithms are being used to create a social credit system. Citizens are graded, based on their actions, which are logged using AI-based cameras.
10. Lifestyle
AI will also lead to several lifestyle changes, such as smart homes and integrated living. Devices such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa have become popular all over the world, and chatbots might see more representation in the coming years across industries.
Such devices have already seen widespread use among the general populace. Along with the rise of the internet of things, predictive algorithms can enable an automated way of living for adopters. For example, a fridge can use image recognition algorithms to detect if it is running low on vegetables. It can then place an order at a nearby grocery store and have the groceries delivered to the user’s doorstep through a robot.
This method of living will extend into an everyday household undertaking. Moreover, the overall disruption brought about by AI will fundamentally change life as we know it.
Expert Insights
Talking about the industries that will get disrupted by AI the most, Michael BeckleyOpens a new window , CTO and founder, AppianOpens a new window , says, “Stories about AI Disruption used to center around fintech startups or truck drivers getting replaced by autonomous vehicles. That all changed on September 14, 2019, when a swarm of 19 AI-powered drones crippled Saudi Arabia’s oil production and disrupted the national security industry forever.
Multi-billion dollar air defenses, Patriot missiles, satellites, and fifth-generation fighters are virtually powerless to stop inexpensive, easy to produce, drones and missiles powered by today’s readily available, commercial-grade AI technology. We are just beginning to process the consequences for global security, let alone the disruption to the defense industrial base. Nothing less than a revolution in speed and agility in procuring and fielding new technology and doctrine is required.”
Talking about the ones that will be the last to be disrupted by AI, he says, “Highly regulated industries are proving especially resilient to AI disruption. You need to be able to explain to financial regulators why you turned someone down for a mortgage, and that is difficult or even impossible with today’s deep learning technology.
While we work on inventing explainable AI, financial services firms are using AI and RPA with Low-Code platforms to augment human decisions rather than replace them. AI-powered image recognition, document classification, entity extraction, and translation services can make humans far more efficient without fundamentally disrupting the way humans process claims and make decisions.”
Jeff DenworthOpens a new window , VP products and co-founder, VAST DataOpens a new window , says, “I think the transportation and logistics industry is going to be severely disrupted as the machines that warehouse and move goods through our economy become smart enough to make their human operators obsolete.
The AI driving a truck from the port of Long Beach to Chicago doesn’t have to stop for legally required meal and sleep breaks, doesn’t drive off the road because it didn’t get a good night’s sleep, and doesn’t need health insurance or a pension.
Unfortunately, this will create real disruption in people’s lives as all the drivers have to make the transition from the king of the open road to finding new professions in mid-life.
He further adds, “The industries that will be the most resistant to AI are those based on some combination of personal service and creativity. As AI becomes “smart” enough to take over mundane tasks, people will start valuing the human touch.
Sure, you can order your drinks from a tablet, and they can be delivered by a simple robot, but a human bartender does more than just mixing gin with tonic. People will still want to talk to their bartender and barber, and even more importantly, when things go wrong, they want to talk to a human being who can both listen and do something about the problem.
If we’re lucky, as automation and AI take over ordinary tasks, some company in a service industry like an airline or hotel chain will realize that granting their humans more authority to deal with the failures of AI will lead to greater customer loyalty and therefore profits rather than having the AIs treat humans like more AIs.”
Stan ChristiaensOpens a new window , CTO and co-founder, CollibraOpens a new window , has more to add. He shares, “Before I tackle the industry disruptions, I want to unpack AI a little bit to provide context for my choices:

AI automates decision making. When a human gets incoming data – such as a report – they make a handful of decisions. Per minute? Per hour? Per day? AI can process a lot more incoming data while producing a lot more decisions much faster. From a disruption perspective, this means industries with a large workforce spending over 80% of their time making medium complexity decisions.
AI is only as meaningful as the data available to feed the machine. From a disruption perspective, this means industries that access to a wide variety and volume of data, or where innovative ways to quickly and economically collect data can exist.

Media has already been disrupted by AI as their advertising based business models were hijacked by platforms with AI-driven bidding markets and audience targeting. The reason third party platform players have been able to do this is because they found a scalable, economic way to collect the data that powers their AI (e.g., web searches or social network interactions). Banks and insurance are clear candidates for similar disruption.
Talking about the industries that will be the last to be disrupted by AI, he says, “At first glance it would seem that healthcare has a lot of opportunity for disruption (e.g., scan analysis, patient monitoring, etc.) but its legacy and regulatory environments create a barrier on the required data which will slow down the disruption.
Industries that strongly depend on physical activity such as mining or steel would be very hard to disrupt as well. Sure, AI can optimize where you have to mine or how to better process steel, but the optimization would have to be very significant (10x) to make disruption possible.
If I can only give one answer to the question who will be the last to be disrupted by AI, it would be Strategic Consulting. AI has a long way to go before it can reach the levels of complex decision making and creativity required.”
Closing Thoughts for Techies
While artificial intelligence is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, its effects on existing markets are yet to be seen. We are at the beginning of the adoption curve for AI and its accompanying technologies, and the long-term benefits will soon be witnessed.
With that being said, the current capabilities of AI make it clear that we are nowhere near discovering its full potential or impact on society. From lifestyle changes to behind-the-scenes improvements in normal societal institutions, AI is changing the way every industry conducts mission-critical operations.

AI Job Roles and Titles
Job roles in the AI market are varied, both in terms of the required skill sets as well as the responsibilities. The AI market creates specializations in the required roles, as it results in a higher degree of compartmentalization and specialized roles.
In a company using AI for data analysis-related tasks, roles are split between the various methods of handling data. These include data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. These roles involve using AI as a tool, with most of the focus being handling and wrangling data to derive knowledge known as ‘insights’.
However, in the AI field as a whole, individuals specialize in creating algorithms, researching the capabilities of AI technologies, and organizing solutions for use on a larger scale. These are AI developers, researchers, and architects, respectively. This approach of creating specific designations for each part of an AI algorithm’s workflow allows companies to scale quickly by hiring specific talent.
One of the most prominent roles in the market is that of the machine learning engineer. The responsibilities of machine learning engineers include the responsibilities of data scientists and software engineers, with a special focus on using and managing machine learning algorithms.
AI Job Roles
Here’s how you can plan your career path for some of the most prominent roles in the AI domain.
How to Become an AI Developer?
AI developers are hired to provide solutions to various issues using AI and programming. AI developers are responsible for designing, developing, and deploying AI-based systems. This includes keeping up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI and coming up with new ways to improve existing infrastructures.
AI developers are expected to have an intrinsic understanding of AI concepts, statistics, and mathematics, along with expertise in programming languages, such as Python. They are also required to build the accompanying infrastructure of AI models, such as ingesting data, transforming data, and creating data lakes.
This requires AI developers to develop their knowledge of a specific skill set under AI-based skills, especially Python and R programming languages. These languages make up the core of many AI systems. Under Python, knowledge of libraries, such as TensorFlow, SciKit Learn, and Keras are heavily sought-after.
Aspirants are also required to have a working knowledge of the fundamental concepts and principles behind machine learning. Expertise in fields, such as text mining, data pre-processing, and data cleaning is another must-have.
How to Become an AI Architect?
The role of AI architect requires professionals to have a big-picture outlook of AI operations of an organization. The AI architect is in charge of the AI platform, thus providing services for customers while evolving the product according to the changing requirements of the company.
AI architects are responsible for putting AI systems in operation and managing them. This includes creating the required infrastructure and managing the compute needs of the systems. They are also responsible for looking at the data-to-insight-to-action loop closely, thus requiring a bigger outlook of the general state of the company’s operations.
AI architects are also responsible for ensuring secondary objectives, such as the security of the solution, stability of the product in general, and how easy it is to use. Owing to the higher skill level required for this job, aspirants are expected to have experience in other AI-related roles before considering the role of an AI architect. It is recommended to have over five years of experience in a job of the same domain.
This job requires high-level, in-depth knowledge of machine learning concepts and advancements.

How to Become a Machine Learning Engineer?
Machine learning engineers are expected to be subject matter experts in their sub-field as well as in devising AI solutions and applying the right solution to a problem. This is more of a generalist approach that requires a professional to have a working knowledge of various fields of AI.
Since this is a mid-level role, individuals can transition from similar roles to this one. Machine learning engineers can also consider a more generalized role in an environment where various concepts of AI can be used in conjunction with each other. The actual problems that organizations face are rarely solved with the help of one specialization.
Knowledge in fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, deep learning, and visualization, is required for the role of a machine learning engineer. As with any AI role, expertise in data wrangling software, such as Hadoop and Spark and statistical languages like R are also common requirements.
Knowledge of machine learning concepts also comes with the ability to work with Python and C++ efficiently. Depending on the requirements of the job, specialized knowledge in programming libraries relating to specific sub-fields may also be required.
How to Become a Data Analyst?
Data analysts are discrete from machine learning and AI-related roles, as they directly focus on deriving insights from data using machine learning as a tool. Machine learning-related roles focus on the AI solution instead. In a nutshell, data analysts have the capability to transition an ordinary business into a data-driven one.
Data analysts focus on providing data to the individuals that require it and are tasked with analyzing the data and determining its importance. By doing so, they aim to gauge its impact on the larger scheme of a company’s functioning. Overall, they take data and use it to supercharge operations for more efficient decision-making.
Their primary role is to perform data analysis and present the results in a way that is easy for stakeholders to perceive. Using this analysis, data analysts provide information regarding any changes in the company’s market, along with a potential solution to maximize adaptiveness. This makes communication skills one of the must-have skills for a data analyst.
Along with in-depth knowledge of statistics and data management methods, data analysts must make use of effective communication skills to convey information accurately. It has to be done in a way that is easy for non-technical professionals to understand. This makes data analysts the bridge between AI-powered solutions and business decision-makers.

How to Become a Data Scientist?
Termed “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” by the Harvard Business Review, data scientist roles are one of the most sought-after in the AI/ML domain. Data scientists use machine learning as one of the tools in their vast arsenal, with the end goal of deriving useful insights from data and providing them to the company.
Along with cleaning and organizing big data, data scientists make heavy use of statistics to identify patterns in collected datasets. Descriptive statistics and analysis are also a big part of data science roles, as they have to use these to derive actionable insights for companies.
Data scientists use ML and deep learning (DL) models to solve a business need for the company. This requires them to have a specialization in programming languages, such as Python and Java. Machine learning is used by data scientists as a tool for smart automation and as a means to derive helpful insights from large datasets.
Communication is an important part of a data scientist’s role, as they are required to communicate insights to the stakeholders of the company. Data scientists are also required to be familiar with software, such as Tableau, R, and MatLab for data wrangling and visualization needs.
When asked about the most lucrative job role in artificial intelligence, Ryan FoltzOpens a new window , PhD., data scientist, ExabeamOpens a new window , says, “Academia is attractive for a lot of reasons, but it’s a field where it can be extremely challenging to forge a career. That helps to explain why over the last 10 years approximately 60% of new physics PhDs end up taking jobs in areas of industry, such as engineering, computer software and hardware, business, and non-STEM.
As a former astrophysicist and current data scientist in cybersecurity, I’ve seen the overlap within the fields, and it is substantial at a fundamental level.
Emerging technical fields like data science offer an exciting, innovative way to apply the software, math and statistics skills learned from non-traditional sources like astrophysics to make real contributions to the field, which is moving rapidly.
Data scientists have the opportunity to apply cutting-edge techniques to solve real-world, difficult problems. And those studying non-traditionally tech-related subjects possess the core skills needed to solve those problems creatively, proficiently, and efficiently.”
Talking about the talent shortage in the field, Sergey KolychevOpens a new window , distinguished engineer, WhiteHat SecurityOpens a new window , says, “Research scientist is the most lucrative role and the one that is facing most shortage at present and for a good reason.
It’s quite easy and not time-consuming to become a machine learning engineer because current ML applications and libraries are well documented, easy to use, there’s a lot of examples on how to create an ML model, how to deploy it to production, how to prepare the data, and so on.
So, the ML engineer role has a pretty low barrier for entry. Consequently, there is a lot of proposition in the market, reducing earning potential and shortage. Data scientist is a second in the food chain and has more of earning potential but requires longer time spent on education and work experience, excellent grasp on statistics, and data preparation.
However, one can still be pretty successful in this role by only utilizing off the shelf solutions, libraries, and techniques. But due to a considerable time investment required, potential shortage for this type is more acute than for an ML engineer.
Most lucrative (if this person works in industry and not in academia) role is a research scientist, a role that certainly requires a PhD and multiple published papers in respected journals. Such individuals are able to lead ML teams, develop novel ML techniques from scratch, according to unique client needs.
To become a research scientist, one will require a considerable raw talent and a significant time investment. There are not a lot of these people and as far as I know they are compensated extremely well in the right places.”
Closing Thoughts for Techies
The ML/AI field has various specializations for aspirants, which means that the pay scale and job responsibilities for each of these roles must factor into their decision. The examples listed here are just a few compared to all the different roles that companies offer today. Specializations definitely make for better market value and experience.
That being said, these specializations must not be a hasty decision. Owing to the varied technology stack and requirements for these jobs, aspirants must choose a job role that they feel comfortable with. There are various online courses for AI specializations so that aspirants can choose something that they are interested in.
In addition to pursuing the right certificate courses, job seekers must also aim to execute a project relevant to their area of expertise. This is listed as a requirement for many job listings and allows employers to determine the quality of an aspirant’s work. Those willing to get into the AI domain must also decide whether they have the required soft skills for the job.

The AI revolution was &amp;ndash; is &amp;ndash; supposed to accomplish all this, and more.But it turns out that the revolution is more of an evolution, especially in traditional sectors like manufacturing, maintenance and insurance, where physical objects play a key role. AI has had an important impact on numerous industries, but it has yet to reach its full potential &amp;ndash; either because the technology is still under development, or businesses are not quite ready for it.The commercial progress and success of AI has indeed been slower than many expected - but that &amp;ldquo;delay&amp;rdquo; can actually work in favor of business. As machine learning, neural networks, and other AI technologies improve, more businesses will be implementing them &amp;ndash; and that gives businesses time to get in on the ground floor of technology that is already making itself felt &amp;ndash; and will make itself felt even more in the coming years.console.log(&quot;2390 BODY2.

And there is still plenty of opportunity to do so; a US Census Bureau study shows that AI technologies have yet to catch on in most industries. The study of nearly 600,000 US businesses shows that only a few percent were using advanced AI technologies like machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, and others.Even if its capabilities are currently limited, AI can have a significant impact among businesses that use it. An Accenture study shows that the top ten percent of companies that adopted AI and cloud-based strategies grew revenue during a three year period by 25% over competitors who did not aggressively implement those technologies. And that&#x27;s just with the limited AI capabilities available today.The benefits of those limited capabilities are available right now &amp;ndash; and businesses should be taking advantage of them, even if the benefits they can realize now are limited. It&#x27;s not just about this quarter&#x27;s profits &amp;ndash; it&#x27;s about preparing for the day in the very near future when AI technology will be a centerpiece of successful businesses. That preparation &amp;ndash; including building infrastructure that will enable the organization to easily implement AI technologies, guiding customers on how that infrastructure will work, and developing work habits and procedures to accommodate AI technologies &amp;ndash; needs to begin now, while AI is still evolving, before the revolution has really gotten underway.A good example of this process at work is in the insurance inspection business, where adjusters are increasingly turning to AI in order to work more quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Inspections are, by their nature, time-consuming, and even experienced adjusters can make mistakes. In addition, because each inspector and inspection system is different, it&#x27;s difficult to achieve real objectivity; &amp;ldquo;damage&amp;rdquo; is often labeled as such based on the subjective impression of the adjustor, instead of an objective standard.Home inspections can also greatly benefit from AI &amp;ndash; especially roof inspections, considered by many to be the weak link in an inspection. Roofs are difficult to access - safety issues such as climbing on ladders and working on pitched roofs abound - and roof damage is often hidden beneath tiles or other coverings. In recent years, insurers have begun using drones to take photos of roofs, but those who go a step farther &amp;ndash; analyzing those images using machine learning and other AI-based technologies &amp;ndash; will be able to realize more extensive benefits.Using machine learning, AI systems can compare between thousands of images, with the system honing in on imperfections or anomalies that could indicate hidden damage, similar to systems being developed in other areas, like medical imaging. Inspections based on such analysis would be more objective and efficient. The system could analyze images based on a machine learning-powered engine that could quickly determine an objective standard for damage. AdvertisementAnother area where AI can be an important addition is vehicle inspection. Here, too, &amp;ldquo;damage&amp;rdquo; is often a subjective call by the adjustor &amp;ndash; but with AI, objective standards can be implemented. AI would help make the vehicle inspection process much more efficient; for example, if a manual inspection takes 45 minutes, an AI-based one could take 10 minutes. While some early systems are indeed available, they are not widely used &amp;ndash; generally still requiring a professional rather than a consumer who can simply use their phone &amp;mdash; and the full range of benefits are still not attainable. But they will be in the near future &amp;ndash; and businesses that want to remain ahead of the curve and benefit from the changes AI will bring need to get on the bandwagon right now.The key is for potential beneficiaries of these technologies to realize that the slight incremental improvement they can see now will soon be a significant improvement &amp;ndash; but if they don&#x27;t begin implementing these systems now and guiding customers &amp;ndash; as well as their own personnel &amp;ndash; in how to use them, they will be riding the coattails of the revolution, when it inevitably breaks out. Then they will be playing catch-up to companies that did have the vision to move forward when AI was still evolutionary &amp;ndash; and often, companies never do catch up from that innovation lag.

When most people hear “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence,” the last thing that comes to mind is a technology that requires human interaction. Usually, it’s the opposite. More computers and more technology mean fewer humans need to be involved.
Machine learning can, however, improve the daily lives of humans in industries of all natures, particularly in construction.
While machine learning in construction may appear to be a distant concept decades away from becoming a reality, the technology’s future is closer than you think. In reality, machine learning has been gaining traction in the construction business for years and, simply put, rather than removing humans from the equation, it allows individuals to accomplish their jobs more efficiently.

Driving Forces: Why Isn’t the Construction Industry Further Along in Adopting New Technology?
Because the construction industry has been slower to adopt the level of technological advancements applied in other industries, the job of constructing buildings has become increasingly difficult for its workers.
However, finding the resources to incorporate new technology while staying on track with building projects is difficult. Machine learning has the potential to propel the construction sector forward, improving conditions and productivity for workers, contracting organizations, and clients on a daily basis.
What Is Machine Learning and How Does It Work?
Before we delve too far into the topic, let’s make sure we cover the basics, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the notion. The definition of machine learning provided by the book Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach centers on the definition of what it means to be intelligent: “the ability to learn is one of the most fundamental aspects of intelligent behaviour.”
With machine learning, machines essentially have the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. So machines can self-learn and forecast outcomes based on what statistically significant patterns they discover in the data they are receiving. Instead of having a human program them, they employ software with algorithms that enable them to make predictions based on data analysis. A machine, for example, can alert you to the need for preventative maintenance based on data it collects from the equipment it’s monitoring.
Machine learning is now considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It sounds like science fiction, but it has many technical and practical uses.
3 Ways Machine Learning Can Be Useful in Construction
There are plenty of ways in which machine learning can be used to help humans in the construction workplace, and it covers a range of different niches and considerations. Some of the most important include:
1. Improving Design Quality
Machine learning has the potential to improve the overall design of a building for its occupants. Workspace businesses (WeWork, for example) use the technology to better analyze and estimate the frequency of use for meeting rooms, allowing companies to optimize the design of those spaces before construction begins.
Machine learning can also assist workers in identifying potential design flaws and omissions before proceeding with construction.
2. Creating a Safer Workplace
Of course, safety on building jobsites is a top priority, and machine learning can help. Consider the testing of VINNIE [Very Intelligent Neural Network for Insight and Evaluation] artificial intelligence as reported by Engineering News-Record in 2016:
“VINNIE detected safety hazards, such as a person who was not wearing a hard hat, far more quickly and accurately than the human team. In comparison, a team of human specialists took over 4.5 hours to review over 1,000 entries, whereas VINNIE took less than 10 minutes. The human team correctly identified 414 photographs with persons, while VINNIE correctly identified 446.” 
At the end of the day, a safer work environment benefits the entire workforce.
3. Assessing and Reducing Risk
Hand in hand with the above example is one of the most wonderful aspects of machine learning: its ability to predict dangers before they occur. For instance, using predictive analytics, machine learning can help you identify hazards, quantify their impact, and reduce or avoid them.

What Does the Future of Machine Learning in Construction Look Like?
Machine learning requires enormous subsets of data to be effective and accurate. Lack of sufficient data is what’s currently preventing many small and medium-size construction firms from using this technology. Increasing the amount of data available and integrating it will help the entire sector progress to a better, more efficient, and more productive future, creating a critical mass of construction firms that can benefit from machine learning … especially if technological systems are integrated. 
But lack of integration is one of the current hurdles construction faces because even if you have a large amount of digitized data available, unless technology platforms are adequately integrated, data will remain separated. That’s the case now in the construction industry overall and also within many building companies, which use multiple unintegrated platforms within their business. This will be something that needs to be addressed over time.
However, this is a challenge many businesses in a wide range of industries face, and is therefore a problem best solved collectively.
Conclusion: Machine Learning Works
Machine learning and AI in construction share an intriguing future together, starting right now. But while machine learning is expected to have an impact on the future of construction, this doesn’t mean machines and technology will take away human jobs.
Construction is and always will be a human endeavor. To win the future, we need our workers’ talents, competence, and invention to remain, we just need to optimize it. Machine learning can be used as yet another instrument to showcase our industry’s expertise and growth.

Over the years, the further evolution of AI into a more advanced form has changed our outlook on everything. Quite similarly, AI has a drastic impact on software development and testing. Experts are anticipating the increased use of artificial intelligence for software development so that it can increase the efficiency of the software development lifecycle. Currently, maximum software enterprises are adopting emerging AI technologies in software development to stay abreast in the competition. The technology is poised to alter basic development fundamentals through acute means, but many believe that it will bring serious challenges to the traditional methods of software development. But if AI is fully capable of augmenting the development lifecycle and automating the entire procedure, what will be the role of programmers and developers? .Well, tech and market analysts are quite worried about the impact of AI on their job roles. With challenges to the traditional working environments, developers and programmers are worried that they will face acute job losses and layoffs soon. With the rapid development of such advanced technologies, it is quite obvious that companies would like to cut costs of human labour and reduce errors. Nevertheless, this is a huge step for AI and companies alike that can help progress the reach of AI into various other domains, including software development and programming. .LEVERAGING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO SOLVE UI/UX DESIGN ISSUES IN 2021HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INFLUENCE THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY?ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN JOURNALISM: WHERE IS MEDIA HEADED? .Is AI code writing and development possible?.Recent reports on AI and its developments have revealed that the advancements of this technology along with its adjoining solutions will be responsible for writing better software codes, and they will do it faster than the best human developers and programmers in the global industry. Experts warn that software developers and programmers might get computerized with the advances in machine learning algorithms. The optimization of safety-critical areas in software development tasks by AI solutions is also one of the major reasons why businesses are thinking about deploying AI in software development, testing and programming tasks. The technology can ensure that the code quality is high and delivers all the functional requirements. .Besides, intelligent programming and development assistance from AI can cut down on the workload in terms of automating the creation of code and identifying faults in the code manually. Artificial intelligence can be used to develop advanced business concepts for huge projects that are labour-intensive and time-consuming. .Enterprises are continually evolving, along with the ever-changing landscape of technology. Transformation of legacy applications and large-scale refactoring is essential with critical necessities, and deploying machine learning algorithms and frameworks will analyze codes and automatically optimize them for interoperability and higher performance. .What else can AI do in software development and programming?.Software development often involves exceeding the assigned budgets and misses deadlines. But it is also critical to understand the context, map resources, and understand the strengths of the implementation team. Machine learning can correlate data from past projects regarding user experiences, estimate the accurate budget, and ensure proper planning for more efficiency. AI solutions help prioritize products and features, as well as provide near-perfect details about the different complexities that give the business leaders and managers enough time to identify the methods that help maximize profit and minimize risks. The technology is also turning around testing and maintenance which is also an integral part of the software development lifecycle. AI in software testing allows IT companies to completely transform software testing into a robust automated process reuniting minimal intervention of humans.  .So, will AI really replace developers?.A simple answer to this immensely critical question is a big 'NO' for now. AI will not be replacing developers or programmers anytime soon but might perform coding and developing tasks in the future. Researchers and AI scientists believe that it will take time for AI to be able to create actual production-worthy and usable code that spans more than a few lines. AI is not yet poised to replace developers or programmers but will be essentially designed to help developers understand their options. It is for human professionals to decide how to optimize the AI and ML solutions for their own benefit..Developers will also use AI as a coding pair to develop better software and applications. AI will not replace the true value of developers, instead, help them become more efficient. The industry will employ more such developers who will efficiently deploy such advanced technologies for better results and maximized revenues. It will take longer for AI to interpret the business value of each feature, so developers will always remain valuable for enterprises. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial Intelligence is defined as the capability to which a machine can exhibit intelligent characteristics. To determine the type and scope of their intelligence, they have been classified into three types.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has certainly started to affect our lives in significant ways, making it essential to stay ahead of the curve. The types of artificial intelligence are a way to visualize what the future of AI would be, as AI begins to take on the more human aspects of cognition. Learning about the types of AI is integral to understand how they would progress in the future. Read on to learn about the endgame of artificial intelligence.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence refers to any cognitive process exhibited by a non-human entity. Today’s AI includes computer programs that perform tasks similar to human cognition, including learning, vision, logical reasoning, and more.
Owing to its several benefits, AI is prevalent in the enterprise and consumer space today. Modern algorithms can provide labor that is as accurate as a human employee, except many times faster.
AI has long been researched as a way to bring automation to the same level of cognitive functioning as humans. Now, smart automation is but one of the many applications of AI algorithms and software.
Artificial intelligence has many subcategories, such as neural networks and deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. These are used mainly in smartphones and Internet applications, as they offer a quick and easy way to optimize the user experience.
When asked about the benefits of artificial intelligence, Oliver Tearle, Head of Research, The ai Corporation, says, “AI and machine learning exist for two purposes: solving problems that require a lot of repeated, often complex manual effort, and to solve problems humans can’t solve. It is impossible for a human to continually understand and extract insight from very large data sources that grow over time. A machine can do this very efficiently and never gets tired. It continually works on the problem with sustained effectiveness.
Applying AI and machine learning throughout a business not only saves time and effort by replacing manual processes with machines, but it allows those teams to innovate and pursue revenue generation activities.
What’s more, the machine can use the insight from the data it has seen to predict future behavior. AI and ML can be implemented as an insight generation tool, allowing a business to remain on top of the critical behavior of its customers. Enabling a business to take swift action to make the most of events identified by the technology.”
Types of Artificial Intelligence
In order to differentiate between the degree to which AI applications can conduct tasks, they are generally split into three types. These types are distinct from each other and show the natural progression to AI systems today.
Contrary to popular belief, artificial intelligence is not here to replace humanity, as it is nothing but a technology that is used by humans. In its current state, it is merely a program that can be trained to perform tasks. As it advances in the future, it is important to create a legal, ethical, and moral framework to govern AI.

The consequences of AI’s advancement must be considered when taking a look at the types of artificial intelligence that have been proposed to exist in the future. As the scale progresses from generally lower to higher intelligence, more human-like characteristics, such as emotions and thought processes, might present themselves. This makes the regulation of AI and its related technologies a difficult undertaking for a developed society.
It’s crucial to have a forward-thinking mentality as the future of artificial intelligence has been mapped out, primarily by the types of AI that are described today. Let’s dive deeper into what these types are.
Narrow Artificial Intelligence
Narrow AI is the most prevalent kind of AI today. From applications in mobile phones to the Internet to big data analytics, narrow AI is taking the world by storm.
The name stems from the fact that this kind of artificial intelligence systems are explicitly created for a single task. Owing to this narrow approach and inability to perform tasks other than the ones that are specified to them, they are also called as ‘weak’ AI. This makes their intelligence highly-focused on one task or set of tasks, allowing for further optimization and tweaking.
Why Is It Called Narrow Intelligence?
Narrow AI is designed for specific tasks and cannot perform tasks other than the ones specified to it. This narrow focus is mainly due to the following factors:
Narrow AI is a Complex Computer Program
Narrow AI is usually restricted in its scope because it is created to solve a problem. It is built with the explicit focus of ensuring that a task is completed, with its architecture and functioning representing this.
Today’s narrow AI is not made up of non-quantifiable parts; it is just a computer program running as per the instructions given to it. Due to these constraints and specified use-case, narrow AI has a laser focus on the tasks it was created for.
Narrow AI is Created as per Today’s Standards and Tools
With the increase in adoption of AI by enterprises, the technology is expected to do one thing and do it well. While the use-case might differ from company to company, the expectations are the same – an exponential increase to the bottom line. Today, this can be done only with narrow AI.
Narrow AI is developed in an environment where the problem is front-and-center, using the latest technology. Artificial intelligence, in general, is a highly research-oriented field, and the research groundwork to create something more than a single use-case system has not been laid out yet. This creates AI with a narrow focus.
Owing to its high efficiency, speed, and consumption rate over humans, narrow artificial intelligence is one of the go-to solutions for corporates. For a wide variety of low-level tasks, narrow AI can employ smart automation and integration to provide efficiency while maintaining accuracy.
This makes it a favored choice for tasks that involve million-scale datasets, known as big data. With personal data collection being prevalent, companies have a large amount of big data at their disposal that can be used for training AI and deriving insights from it.
Examples of Narrow AI
Today, narrow AI is also used in various Internet applications that we use on a daily basis. Following are a few examples of narrow AI:
Recommendation Systems
Whenever you see a ‘recommended’ tag on a website, it is usually put there by a narrow AI. By looking at a user’s preferences with respect to the database of content or information, an AI is able to determine their likes and dislikes.
This is then used to offer recommendations, thus providing a more personalized experience to the user. This is commonly seen on sites, such as Netflix (“Because you watched…”), YouTube (“Recommended”), Twitter (“Top Tweets first”), and many more services.
Spam Filtering
Narrow AI with natural language processing capabilities is employed to keep our inboxes clean. Employees cannot check every spam email they receive, but it’s a perfect task for narrow AI.
Google is the leader in providing email services and has evolved its narrow AI to a point where it conducts various email-related tasks. Along with AI-powered spam filters, they can also assign a category to a particular type of email (promotions, reminders, important, and so on).

Expert Systems
Narrow AI has the capability to create expert systems, which could pave the way for the future of AI. Just as human intelligence is comprised of various senses and logical, creative, and cognitive tasks; expert systems also consist of many parts.
Expert systems may represent the future of artificial intelligence. This term is used to denote an AI system made up of many smaller narrow AI algorithms. For example, IBM Watson, which is made of a natural language processing component along with a cognitive aspect.
General Artificial Intelligence
While narrow AI refers to where artificial intelligence has reached today, general AI refers to where it will be in the future. Also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and strong AI, general artificial intelligence is a type of AI that can think and function just as humans do.
This includes perceptual tasks, such as vision and language processing, along with cognitive tasks, such as processing, contextual understanding, thinking, and a more generalized approach to thinking as a whole.
While narrow AI is created as a means to execute a specific task, general AI can be broad and adaptable. The learning part of an adaptive general intelligence also has to be unsupervised, as opposed to the supervised and labeled learning that narrow AI is put through today.
General AI is still a far off reality, as the tools required to build it are not available today. Many argue that neural networks are a dependable way to create the forerunners of what can be called general artificial intelligence, but the reality of the situation is that human intelligence is still a black box.
While we as humans are beginning to decode the inner workings of our minds and brains, we are still a long way from figuring out what ‘intelligence’ means. In addition to this obstacle, the need to define ‘consciousness’ is integral to creating a general AI. This is due to the fact that an AGI needs to be ‘conscious’ and not just an algorithm or machine.
Challenges of General Artificial Intelligence
There are various pitfalls associated with general artificial intelligence. Some of them include:
Replicating Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a term used to denote applying the knowledge learned in one domain to another. This is something that humans engage in every day and is an important part of society. For example, the knowledge of how to ride a bicycle is applied in riding a motorcycle.
This is something that neural networks have become better at doing recently; a positive sign for the future. A capable AGI needs to have strong transfer learning capabilities to avoid retraining.
Enabling Common Sense and Collaboration
Common sense is integral to human functioning, along with collaboration on tasks with other human minds. Due to the narrow nature of today’s algorithms, dependable collaboration has not been achieved, with common sense being a far-off reality.
To create a true general artificial intelligence, it needs to be imbued with such characteristics to ensure that it is not just another narrow AI. This will set it apart from the systems that came before it, as it will not only collaborate with other machines but also with humans.
Figuring Out Consciousness and Mind
Consciousness is an integral part of being human and being conscious is the most resilient method of determining the existence of intelligence. In addition to this, the human mind is still something that has not been decoded. These remain as significant obstacles to the creation and achievement of general artificial intelligence.

Artificial Super Intelligence
Artificial super intelligence (ASI) is a term used to denote an AI that exceeds human cognition by a great extent in every possible way. This is one of the most far-off theories of artificial intelligence but is generally considered to be the eventual endgame of creating an AI.
While artificial super intelligence is still a theory at this point in time, a lot of scenarios involving it have already been envisioned. A common consensus among those in the field is that ASI will come from the exponential growth of AI algorithms, also known as ‘Intelligence Explosion’.
Intelligence explosion is a concept required for the creation of artificial super intelligence. As the name suggests, it is an explosion of intelligence from human-level, general artificial intelligence to an unthinkable level. This occurs through recursive self-improvement.
Self-improvement in AI comes in the form of learning from user input in neural networks. Recursive self-improvement, on the other hand, is the capacity of an AI system to learn from itself, at rapidly increasing levels of increasing intelligence.
To illustrate this, take the example of an AGI functioning at the level of average human intelligence. It will learn from itself, using the cognitive capabilities of an average human, to reach genius-level intelligence. However, this begins compounding, and any future learning made by the AI will be conducted at a genius-level cognitive functioning.
This accelerates at a fast pace, creating an intelligence that is smarter than itself at every step. This continues to build up quickly, until the point where intelligence explodes, and a super intelligence is born. Containing or creating a super intelligence is something that we as a human race are far from, making it an entry for sci-fi novels. For now.
Theory of Mind in Artificial Intelligence
In psychology, the theory of mind is the ability to connect what one is feeling to the reality that they are feeling it. In other words, it is the ability of humans to attribute their mental state to themselves while recognizing that they are different from others.
It is an important part of social cognition and is integral for a human being to function in society. Replicating the theory of mind and a construct such as the ‘mind’ may be what we are missing to create a true general artificial intelligence.
In a way, the theory of mind is a way for individuals to create a simulation of the consequences of their actions. This can be replicated in AI by creating an internal simulation which contains a model of the AI itself, along with a model of the world.
This brings a perspective of ‘common sense’ to the model and can represent solving one of the primary challenges of creating a general AI. Experts believe that this is one of the biggest steps that will bridge the gap between the neural networks of today to create a stronger, more adaptive AI.
Key Takeaways for Techies
Artificial intelligence can be leveraged by techies to stay ahead of the curve in the IT space today. As this technology is transforming at a rapid pace, those in the market are especially required to stay ahead of the curve.
It is also important to understand concepts, such as AGI and ASI, as they may eventually turn into reality. Moreover, it is also important to note that we are at the beginning of using AI, and the algorithms used today are restricted to narrow tasks.
It is safe to say that AGI and ASI will disrupt the world in a way we cannot envision. The narratives portrayed in movies involving AI, especially those such as ‘Her’ and ‘I, Robot’, may, in fact, come true with the rise of general AI.
One of the more important topics for the techies to consider is the ethics of AGI and ASI. While it might be redundant in the latter case, the dependable regulation and ethical treatment of general AI is important for many reasons.
Society as a whole needs to catch up with the idea of computers being able to think and put laws in place to ensure the ethical treatment of such machines. Owing to the disruptive nature of general AI, the consequences must be foreseen to avoid several issues in the future.

In the fast-moving world of AI, the benefits of adopting the technology vary. To delve deeper into the real-world impact of AI in the corporate space, Toolbox reached out to ten experts to understand their take on the future of AI.
The future of artificial intelligence is a subject of many discussions and speculations. Due to the hype-filled nature of this field, the future of AI has been the epicenter of exaggerated claims and theories of ground-breaking disruption. However, the benefits that automation through AI provides to companies today is undeniable.
Many early adopters of AI-powered solutions have been able to see sizeable gains in the optimization of their processes. The field itself is seeing widespread acceptance among the enterprise sector but is still considered to be a solution that will solve any problem. Therefore, the truth about AI is not known to many who have not dealt with it, and the technology is perceived as a catch-all solution to any enterprise problem.
Keeping this in mind, the only dependable way to gauge the effect of AI on the field is to get in touch with those that interact with the technology. Toolbox reached out to industry experts to get their views on what the future of artificial intelligence would be like.

The Future of AI
The future of artificial intelligence is subject to wild speculation. In many cases, AI is marketed as an end-all solution to every problem faced by an enterprise. Whereas, in reality, it is simply a tool that can be used to optimize complex business processes through intelligent automation.
Explaining this further, Mark Gazit, CEO of ThetaRayOpens a new window , said, “The world is moving from simple AI analytics to a more powerful form – artificial intuition. Up to this point, we’ve only had what I would term “rational” AI, which is comparable to the functioning of the cerebral cortex. Intuitive AI algorithms, on the other hand, replicate the powerful decision-making of human intuition. Looking into the future, we can envision machines that are like humans in thought, memory, emotions, and self-awareness.”
Although AI is a complex concept, customers do not need to understand how it works to appreciate the benefits. This will eventually result in an environment where the end user interacts with the product, while AI provides its benefits in the background.
Agreeing to this, David Gingell, CMO at Seal SoftwareOpens a new window , said, “Few people understand (or even care) how the internet truly works, how transfer protocols work, how data moves around networks or how security is implemented. AI will be like that. It is in the background, facilitating every aspect of computation. AI will be pervasive. In the way that the internet has permeated every facet of human existence, at least in the developed world, so too will AI.”
However, for this widespread adoption of AI to occur, many of the issues that plague it today need to be remedied. This is especially relevant in the fields of data protection and privacy.
Speaking on the subject, Dr. Alain Briançon, Chief Technology Officer and VP Data Science of Cerebri AIOpens a new window , commented, “The future of AI resonates with possible successes that we cannot even dream of today. For AI to be adopted thoroughly, the backlash against the obvious abuses of privacy from social media concerns and the ‘slap happy’ approach to data security will both have to be worked out.”
Owing to its capability to be easily adapted into any field, a suitable AI implementation can often provide a better solution than existing ones. Even existing systems and networks can find improvement in the future through artificial intelligence applications.
Steve Blow, Technology Evangelist at ZertoOpens a new window , said, “In the future, a security system equipped with advanced machine learning will be able to detect the encryption taking place as it happens and then automatically connect with a recovery system to both stop the attack as it’s happening and failover to unencrypted data. This scenario will be a reality in the near future, and eventually, with the rate at which cyber threats are growing, no business will be able to survive or compete without this kind of protective technology in place.”
With the widespread use that this technology has seen over the past few years, it is evident that the field still has room to grow and develop. This makes the future of AI an exciting proposition for enterprises and customers alike.
While talking to Toolbox about the future, Al Brown, the SVP of Engineering at VeritoneOpens a new window , said, “The future of AI is nothing short of amazing. When it comes to AI’s impact on the business world, specifically, we have only scratched the surface of its potential to transform companies around the world. Over the next five years in particular, as AI continues to develop and mature, it will make companies and their employees more effective, efficient, and profitable in their work.”

Which Industries Will AI Disrupt the Most?
With the scale of adoption that AI is witnessing across verticals, widespread disruption seems to be on the horizon. Several industry experts seem to agree that AI will fundamentally change operations across verticals.
Bala Venkatrao, Founding Team & VP of Products, UnravelOpens a new window , stated, “End-users and consumers are now becoming familiar with the increasing predictive intelligence they find in tools, web sites, and the myriad of social, business, and commercial interactions.” He went on to say that any company looking to sell products or services will be disrupted by those that crack the AI code early on.
The future of artificial intelligence is not clear, even to experts, but the outlook is positive. Thomas Ash of CLARA AnalyticsOpens a new window , stated, “Nobody knows what the future will bring, but we know that AI is on the upswing, and its uses will continue to broaden as systems become more refined. Yet, with the explosion of cloud-based services and applications, there is an opportunity for organizations to no longer feel stuck in a singular way of doing business, which is a game-changer.”
When it comes to securing existing systems, AI has the capability to step up and provide tangible improvements. Cybersecurity is one of the biggest fields that is set to be disrupted by AI solutions, as it can process large amounts of data in a relatively short time.
Derek Lin, Chief Data Scientist at ExabeamOpens a new window , when talking about AI’s scope in cybersecurity, said, “AI has already disrupted the SIEM (security information and event management) market. SIEM stores and archives historical data, traditionally used as a data repository for querying post-breach incidents. In the big data era, it didn’t take long for security practitioners to realize AI can be used to comb through data haystacks to proactively search for the information nuggets.”
In an exclusive chat with Toolbox, Shailesh Majrekar, Head of Products and AI/ML Solutions Marketing at SwiftStackOpens a new window , stated, “AI is expected to disrupt existing markets in a big way. Tasks which can be automated and repetitive, can be effectively carried out using AI.” He further pointed out, “For the most part AI will be implemented as augmented artificial intelligence than pure play AI, where humans and AI will work best collaboratively.”

The Next Step for AI Enterprise Adoption
Before companies can fully see the benefits of adopting AI, they must first surpass the pitfalls that stand in their way. With many companies testing out the technology like a proof-of-concept, the pace of AI adoption is slow.
Setu Kulkarni, VP of Strategy and Business Development at WhiteHat SecurityOpens a new window , provides a possible solution, stating, “AI has to move from a proof-of-concept phase to solving real business problems that move the needle for the business by either reducing time to market, increasing profits, or reducing the costs. The key is to identify the AI-addressable problem statement in your business that can help your organization pivot.”
The general idea of AI also needs to be revamped, with important distinctions being made between hype and reality. A renewed perspective can also enable businesses to discover a new unique selling proposition (USP).
Dr. Alain Briançon, Chief Technology Officer and VP Data Science of Cerebri AIOpens a new window , commented on this, saying, “We need to differentiate what AI could be, versus what it should be. What AI should be is consumer-centric. What companies should be focusing on are new experiences.” He argues that these new experiences, which have an intrinsic focus on the customer, are likely to propel the adoption of AI among enterprises.
Some early adopters are already seeing benefits, both in seen and unseen manners. Due to the self-improving nature of AI algorithms today, it is common to see results during deployment and improved results upon deployment. This results in the next iteration of the solution being better than the previous one, providing improvements to the bottom line of processes.
Wasim Khan, Chief Digital Officer at RipcordOpens a new window , while elaborating on this, said, “Initially AI tools have helped deliver significant cost savings by helping automate the overall process experience. This is resulting in not only tangible cost savings but also intangible cost savings in terms of increasing resource efficiency – a necessary component for running a successful business. The initial success of AI process automation implementation has had (and will continue to have) an avalanche effect: organizations are now equipped with better content and data visibility by using AI tools to extract metadata.”
Speaking about the future of AI, Dr. Akhil Sahai, Chief Product Officer at Symphony SummitAIOpens a new window , stated, “I think the use of AI will expand the focus on eliminating repetitive tasks and empower organizations to make more efficient use of their skilled talent.”

Advantages of Adopting AI
Introducing AI to operations can give a USP to companies. Moreover, it can also offer optimizations that set the company apart. The USPs that AI can offer range widely. Tracy Oppenheimer, Senior Marketing Manager, Content and Communications at HelpshiftOpens a new window , said, “The unique selling proposition for AI-powered solutions is, ultimately, the incredible levels of efficiency that they have the power to drive. The caveat is that when these technologies are not used or implemented effectively, they can drain resources instead of saving them.”
Companies can also benefit from the problem-solving capabilities AI brings to the table. AI-powered solutions can help companies make crucial business decisions or identify pain points in their operations.
According to Setu Kulkarni, VP of Strategy and Business Development at WhiteHat SecurityOpens a new window , “Predictive problem-solving capabilities of AI will definitely help companies further automate the business process by anticipating consumer interaction patterns. However, it is extremely likely that artificial intelligence will almost always require human intelligence either before, during, or after processing.”
AI is not a catch-all solution for companies; it requires certain workflows to be in place before deployment. While elaborating on the factors that affect AI’s efficiency, Al Brown, the SVP of Engineering at VeritoneOpens a new window , stated, “Companies will definitely benefit from the predictive problem-solving capabilities of AI – but only if they’re already heavily driven by and using data to move the organization forward. Data gives organizations the information they need to make decisions and target the business problems that AI can solve.” He further added, “The change comes when organizations recognize the value of data resulting in them working cross-functionally to prioritize data collection and analysis.”
Will AI Take Our Jobs?
Probably one of the most commonly repeated statements about AI is the eradication of human labor due to the rise in automation. As many experts will tell you, this is a nuanced subject that needs to be investigated with more depth. This is one of the most popular debates when it comes to the future of AI.
Commenting on this, Dr. Akhil Sahai, Chief Product Officer at Symphony SummitAIOpens a new window , stated, “There is a lot of fear across industries that AI will eliminate jobs, but the reality is far more nuanced. Yes, it will eliminate some jobs that comprise mostly low-level and repetitive work. But it also will enhance people’s jobs and open new and different opportunities. AI will be able to take on tasks that the human brain cannot handle, such as analyzing vast data sets to gain insights that would elude the human mind.”
Currently, the labor market has a high rate of low-value and low-skill jobs. With the adoption of AI, these jobs are put at risk. However, companies must take up the responsibilities of upskilling their employees. This not only increases the value of the employee to the company but also provides the employee with the skills needed to survive in the AI age. This is also necessary for the future of AI growth to occur in a responsible manner.
Wasim Khan, Chief Digital Officer at RipcordOpens a new window , explained, “Emerging AI technologies, will change the current labor market. However, that change will encompass additional job creation, including new, higher-value positions. The benefits AI brings to improving processes not only frees companies to increase focus on higher-value services but also results in owning better, cleaner information which can then be analyzed and utilized to develop new offering areas.”
However, there is another side to this story. Any AI solution requires a team behind it, opening up possibilities for new jobs and positions to come into the play. Thomas Ash of CLARA AnalyticsOpens a new window , further elaborated saying, ”Developing a quality AI-based platform that effectively addresses specific needs requires a large dedicated team. To build this team your company will need to hire data scientists, product managers, software engineers, data engineers, data scientists, operational experts to develop process and operational workflows, and staff to integrate data models into operations.” He further added, “There is also a requirement for people to manage onboarding and training of the employees who will ultimately use the solution, along with staff who can quantify value generation.”
 Mark Gazit, CEO of ThetaRayOpens a new window , stated, “I believe AI will create additional employment opportunities. More importantly, it will make current jobs much more interesting. AI demonstrates the partnership between human and machine intelligence. AI does the heavy lifting that accelerates, not diminishes, who we are. It helps us to make better decisions and be more creative and in tune with the needs of the world around us.”

Closing Thoughts for Techies
With the rapid growth of the AI vertical in the enterprise sector, roles for the management and creation of solutions using the technology have ballooned. There is a significant increase in the job roles surrounding AI. From May 2017 to May 2018, job postings for AI on IndeedOpens a new window  went up by 57.9%Opens a new window , with a growth of 29.1%Opens a new window  in the following year.
Elaborating upon the need for AI talent, Bala Venkatrao, Founding Team & VP of Products, UnravelOpens a new window , revealed, “For the remainder of 2019 and beyond, AI knowledge and experience will continue to be among the most sought-after skills, as it can help remove human error, reduce tedious low-value activities, guarantee optimal technology performance by delivering recommendations, autonomous remediation of problems in both physical and virtual environments.”
Companies are looking to adopt AI in significant ways, as the solutions provided by service providers are sure to optimize processes. In the future, there will be an increased requirement for high-skilled workers who know the mechanics of creating and deploying an AI solution.
Existing job markets will also be redefined, with lower-skilled, repetitive jobs being taken up by AI. This will require new workers to be more skilled in their position, redefining the way the job market works today. Dr. Akhil Sahai, Chief Product Officer at Symphony SummitAIOpens a new window , affirmed this by saying, “AI will change jobs. With the capability AI presents for doing more with huge data sets and analytics, the opportunity for more jobs that will exist because of the use of AI is significant.”

Closing Thoughts for Techies
As a technology, artificial intelligence has advanced enough to facilitate improvements that offer visible enhancements to company processes. This means that automated processes can achieve as much accuracy as human workers. AI also can accomplish this at a much higher speed and cheaper cost than employing manual labor.
With the rise of AI applications for corporate use, many big players, such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, and SAS have begun offering artificial intelligence solutions that solve business problems through AI. With companies of this scale actively participating in the market, the AI space is quickly developing and advancing.
What Is AI?
To understand why artificial intelligence offers a sizeable benefit for companies, we must first thoroughly understand what AI is. At its base, AI is a computer program that imitates certain paradigms of human intelligence. What this means is that AI can conduct tasks that were previously only reserved for humans, such as recognizing images or finding patterns in data.
Law, for example, is one of the largest fields where AI is gaining quick adoption. Typically, a lawyer is not only required to have a working knowledge of landmark cases regarding certain laws but also to interpret laws by utilizing these cases. This is an integral part of fighting a case, and previously took a lot of time and resources on the lawyer’s part.
Today, with the progress of natural language processing, artificial intelligence software can execute several processes that take place in a typical legal setting. These include legal reasoning, evidential reasoning, argumentation and decision-making, data mining, legal task automation, risk assessment, and e-discovery.
This is just a small fraction of what specialized AI technology can achieve. Mainly, machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, is seeing widespread adoption among companies. Machine learning is the process by which programs can learn from past processes. This allows machine learning algorithms to improve upon past versions of itself. Moreover, it can also change dynamically with new data, as opposed to a static program that cannot change after it is deployed.
How Is AI Changing the Enterprise Landscape?
The rise of accessible AI solutions has transformed the enterprise landscape. This is mainly because artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions have begun to take the place of business intelligence operations. Business intelligence is the practice of utilizing software and technologies to collect, analyze, and present information systems. It holds the potential to improve the bottom line in the operation sector.
With every company now making data collection a priority through various digital mediums, there is a need to analyze much higher volumes of data. Commonly referred to as big data, these collected statistics can provide a more in-depth look into consumer expectations from a product or service, along with potential improvements.
However, manual analysis has quickly become more expensive and less scalable than AI-based solutions. Enterprise-grade algorithms can ingest data on the scale of petabytes (1 petabyte =1 million gigabytes) and provide actionable intelligence or insights.
For example, let’s consider a company that offers products for sale to the customer through an e-commerce portal. Collecting data from the website will allow the company to observe users’ actions, such as clicks, hovers, or scrolls. This data is then fed into an AI algorithm, which analyzes the data and provides insights.
In such a case, if the data shows that most users are scrolling down to click on an object, the algorithm will suggest moving the object to top. This improves the user experience and makes for a more engaging product overall.
When looking at this example, it becomes clear why AI can change the enterprise landscape. Keeping this in mind, let’s look at some artificial intelligence software, artificial intelligence tools, and artificial intelligence platforms commonly used by enterprises.

In today’s hype-filled world of artificial intelligence, myth is often confused for fact. Due to a large number of myths about AI, it becomes difficult to differentiate the truth from fiction. Join us as we tackle some of the oft-repeated myths when it comes to AI.
When it comes to myths about AI, many theories might seem incredulous, and some which are grounded in fact. Considering the hype around the technology, it might get difficult to determine the true disruptive power of artificial intelligence on society.
Many of these theories revolve around AI somehow taking over human civilization. This may even seem true when coupled with the science fiction trope of giving great power to artificial intelligence and robots. However, when looking at the actual capabilities of the technology and how it is being used by today, it becomes clear that something like this isn’t possible.
In this article, we will delve deeper into some of the most popular myths about artificial intelligence. We will also investigate the real-world implications and possibilities of such theories and attempt to separate hype from reality in the AI sphere.

Artificial Intelligence: Fact vs. Fiction
Most Common Myths About AI
Closing Thoughts
Artificial Intelligence: Fact vs. Fiction
Let’s first look at the reality of AI. Today, artificial intelligence is simply a computer program that mimics certain aspects of human thinking and intelligence. Today’s AI programs are created with a narrow focus, which does not allow them to function outside their prescribed task. They cannot reproduce the learning from their knowledge and apply it in the real world because their sole purpose is to do a well-defined task with precision and speed.
There are some algorithms which are also built to improve upon themselves by learning. This type of artificial intelligence program is called a machine learning algorithm, as it continues to iterate upon itself. With each progressive version of the algorithm, it becomes better at solving the problem faster or more accurately.
Comparatively, human intelligence widely applies a concept known as the transfer of learning. When a human being learns, they solve a given problem using cognitive processes. Using the transfer of learning, this knowledge is generalized and applied to problems that are similar to the problem faced in the first iteration.
For example, a child learning arithmetic in a class can use that knowledge when calculating the bill for groceries. The knowledge is directly carried over from previous problems, thus allowing an individual to easily come to the solution without learning the method again.
Transfer of knowledge is also possible in AI using a concept known as transfer learning. A machine learning algorithm is created with a template of the task it is going to solve. The learning is then carried forward to solve a similar problem. Transfer learning in AI functions only for a small subset of solutions, unlike humans, who are able to generalize a vast variety of problems.
Transfer of learning is one of the many things that sets human intelligence apart from AI. Currently, many complex cognitive procedures and shortcuts cannot be recreated in an AI setting. This means that all AI programs created today are narrow AI – a program designed to do one task specifically. When AI can generalize knowledge and exhibit functionality like that of humans, it is termed as general AI.
General AI is still a far-off reality, as the main focus is on using narrow AI as a tool right now. Narrow AI has found great adoption in the enterprise sector, as it can vastly improve the speed and accuracy of many company processes. Moreover, AI programs can also solve complex business problems and assist enterprises to make informed business decisions.
This means that most AI programs today are generally put into a utility category. AI is simply a tool that serves to assist companies to make better decisions or solve a problem with great speed. Even chatbots, such as Google Assistant and Siri, are simply AI programs that are optimized to process language and decipher human speech patterns into text.
AI has been widely adopted due to the vast amount of computing power at our disposal. Due to the powerful hardware we have today, it is possible to run complex AI programs and receive optimal results with great efficiency.

Most Common Myths About AI
Movies like ‘Terminator’, ‘I, Robot’, and ‘Eagle Eye’ have catapulted villainous AI into pop culture. The idea of machines thinking for themselves has been around since the late 1950s. First, as a mainstay villain of science fiction writers, then as a technology that was hailed as the next big revolution, AI has been relevant for a long time.
While the AI in these representations is shown to be omniscient and all-powerful, with access to indestructible robots or a military arsenal. However, AI today is simply a collection of complex computer programs. Therefore, most myths about AI taking over the world are not possible with today’s technology. Let us look at these myths in detail.
Myth 1: AI Will Take Over Jobs
This is, by far, the most popular AI theory. Proponents state that AI will be so advanced and cheap for companies that hiring human labor will simply seem too expensive. This will then lead to mass unemployment as AI will take up the same job roles as humans, and execute them at much better speed and cost.
This cannot occur for a multitude of reasons. Primarily, a vast variety of jobs today require cognitive tasks that humans can do much better than AI. While low-level jobs, such as data entry and sorting jobs will be at risk, the rest of the working population will simply see benefits from having AI at their disposal.
AI will be used as a tool to augment existing jobs but will replace some low-level jobs. This means that employees will have to be upskilled, thus promoting them to newer jobs that involve using AI as a tool rather than being replaced by it.
Adding to this, Daniel Shaw-DennisOpens a new window , SVP Global Strategic Marketing and Alliances, YellowfinOpens a new window , shares, “From an analytics perspective, the biggest myth we hear is, “the machine will take over my job”, particularly for data analysts. The truth is that AI technology for analytics today is largely about automating the things that are done manually.
From the machine doing the “discovery” aspect of data discovery or technology that utilizes algorithms that automatically surface statistical change, AI-technology is sifting through millions of data points to find what might be of interest.
It’s still up to the analyst to understand what’s important, add context for their organization and present that to their business users. AI is actually freeing them up to perform more high-value tasks.

Myth 2: AI Will Control the World
AI taking over the world has long been a mainstay of science fiction. Many stories describe artificial intelligence programs infiltrating the most secure systems in the world and taking over world governments. Some even describe these programs taking control of the nuclear arsenals of a country, causing the extinction of humanity.
This is not possible in any given situation. Firstly, such privileges of national security cannot be given to artificial intelligence, as AI programs will be used only as a tool. They will not be able to make such decisions without human intervention. Moreover, they cannot ‘hack’ their way into the security systems in place today, as they only have a narrow intelligence for their programmed problem.
AI also cannot rule the world through existing systems, as there is no possible way to train narrow AI to lead a country. Moreover, ruling through surveillance is also not a concern as AI or even superintelligent AI’s goal might not be to rule humans.
Myth 3: AI Robots Will Rule Humans
Usually, robots and evil AI programs go hand in hand when it comes to science fiction villains. The myth that AI will create robots that can think for themselves and lead a rebellion against human beings is one of the most popular theories.
Firstly, robot technology is far behind what is described in science fiction. They are usually not paired with intelligent algorithms today; instead, they are programmed to conduct repetitive tasks like an assembly line. Even personal assistant robots are restricted to a small set of tasks.
AI-powered robots getting a hold of weapons is commonly touched upon as an issue. However, the cognitive requirement for this will not only take up a lot of computing power but also require complicated algorithms. These algorithms cannot be deployed in such a remote state, as they will need a considerable back-end infrastructure for computing power.
Myth 4: AI Will Develop on Its Own Without Human Knowledge
This theory states that AI will suddenly ‘go rogue’ and develop itself to a point where it cannot be stopped by humans. Firstly, AI researchers have been dedicating resources towards creating AI that can not only learn from data but also its own results. There is slow progress in this field, recently resulting in unsupervised machine learning.
Otherwise, it is simply not possible for an AI to develop consciousness and sentience on its own and rebel against humanity. AI algorithms cannot develop beyond their own code, as they are simply smart programs that use computing power to solve complex problems.
If in the future, an accurate general artificial intelligence is created, this scenario has a mild possibility of occurring. However, when considering forward-thinking regulatory practices being taken towards AI today, this scenario is unlikely to occur in the near or distant future.
Myth 5: AI Will Eventually Learn to Function like the Human Brain
Artificial intelligence algorithms are just algorithms. They are simply a complex set of commands for a computer to follow and do not work like the human brain in any form. Modern AI advancements, such as neural networks, have derived inspiration from the architecture of the human brain, but are not capable of thinking like humans.
There are many cognitive processes that cannot be replicated by a computer program, at least in the case of AI as we know it today. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to reproduce a human brain completely in software form, as there are still many unknown variables in play. Barring ground-breaking advancements in both AI and neuroscience, this myth won’t turn into reality for the foreseeable future.

Myth 6: Only Big Companies Can Use AI
Today’s AI landscape is dominated by software giants, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. This has led many to believe that only big companies can effectively utilize and control AI. This introduces the possibility of a dystopian world where these companies use AI to control the population.
Of course, this theory is unfounded. Not only is the AI startup sphere booming, but efforts to democratize AI have been undertaken by these companies. Believing that more attention and research will bring better advancements in AI, most of these companies have open-sourced the tools they use for making AI algorithms. AI marketplaces are also present in great numbers, allowing any computer program to utilize complex algorithms in a pinch.
Adding to this, Daniel Shaw-DennisOpens a new window , SVP Global Strategic Marketing and Alliances, YellowfinOpens a new window , says, “The technology can be varied in its application and cost. For an SMB, our advice would be to look at the problem that they’re trying to solve or solution they’re looking to deliver and see where it would benefit from this type of technology.
This could vary from using products with these capabilities that enhance areas, such as marketing or sales. They may be looking to deliver an enhanced customer experience, such as a chatbot on their website that may, in fact, mean a lower customer acquisition cost than traditional methods. Others may go down the path of embedding this technology as part of their application.”
Myth 7: More Data Means Better AI
Another myth says that more data results in automatically better AI. Firstly, AI is only as good as the data it ingests. If the data is inaccurate or structured incorrectly, most of the benefits that come from training the AI are not present. This is because AI simply combs through the data and finds the most effective solution and does not improve upon the data that it is given.
This means that any data given to the AI must be in a machine-readable format, requiring human labeling to be truly effective. Even big companies find problems with labeling the large amounts of data that they collect. More data can mean better AI, but only if the data is clean and easily readable by the AI algorithm.
Myth 8: AI Puts Our Data at Risk
With the predatory data collection practices employed by many software giants, AI has found itself amid security concerns. These include protecting the privacy of the customers providing the data, and concerns about the leakage of private information through data breaches. As this data is fed to an algorithm, the private user data is then used, indirectly, for financial gain by deriving insights.
Regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are softening the blow for consumers, as they require companies to use data in a responsible manner. This also means that the privacy of consumers cannot be compromised in any way. However, companies may not stop these practices even with such regulations in place, leaving this myth currently unsolved.
Myth 9: Superintelligent AI Will Take over the World
Superintelligent AI, or simply superintelligence, is an advanced general AI learns not only from data but also from itself. Theoretically, this should result in exponential growth of the program’s intelligence, resulting in an ‘intelligence explosion’ and superintelligent AI.
Separating the myth and facts about superintelligent AI is not an easy task. Primarily, superintelligent AI is still far off in the future, with today’s technology being nowhere close to replicating this task. While the myths about superintelligence are well-rooted in theory, it is simply not possible to create superintelligent AI with today’s technology.
In case a superintelligent AI does come along sometime in the future, the best thing to do is to prepare for it through regulation and laws. The main thing to worry is that superintelligent AI’s goals may not be aligned with humanity. In this case, superintelligent AI may surpass all human barriers and take over the world.
Talking about superintelligence, Daniel Shaw-DennisOpens a new window , SVP Global Strategic Marketing and Alliances, YellowfinOpens a new window , shares, “I’m sure we’re going to see a lot more articles on the subject around October 23 as the new Terminator movie gets released. For our industry, this wave is known as “Augmented Analytics” and we see this as a positive transformative shift.
As people work more closely with this technology, understand it, and can apply the benefits, we’ll see our processes become more fluid and adaptive – this technology is shifting the way organizations are operating.
One key thing is the foundation you’re building this upon has to be governed. Particularly in the data world, it’s “garbage in, garbage out”, when you’re applying this type of AI-technology without a governed data foundation it becomes garbage in and garbage out, at scale!”
Myth 10: Technological Singularity Is Not Far Off
Technological singularity is an event where human technology transcends itself to a point where the universe becomes irreversibly changed. Prominent author and thinker Ray Kurzweil utilizes a concept known as ‘computronium’ to describe what singularity is. By using the energy and computation contained within an atom and engineering it, Kurzweil predicts that it will become possible to utilize anything to compute complex calculations and run AI.
In the ever-expanding quest to add more computronium to our arsenal, Kurzweil speculates that we will convert the entire universe to computronium, thus reaching a singularity. However, Kurzweil, along with other thinkers in the field, do not attempt to predict what happens after singularity as it is simply unknowable and cannot be predicted with any semblance of accuracy.

Closing Thoughts
Myths about AI are widespread, and many might seem believable. The things AI can and cannot do are not widely known, and the hype surrounding the technology might make it seem like a miraculous solution. While many companies are adopting AI to optimize their processes, this hype might cause them to make a mistake when dealing with AI.
Learning to distinguish fact from hype is extremely important when it comes to artificial intelligence, especially considering popular opinion. Pop culture has cemented AI’s place as the ultimate supervillain, or an omnipresent and omniscient ghost in the machine. In the real world, it is simply a complex computer program, as much in our control as a text processor or web browser.
Hence, anyone willing to take the AI path moving forward will have to not only formulate their own views on what the technology is capable of but also strictly keep in mind what it cannot do. General AI and superintelligent AI are best left to future generations or science fiction authors.

“I don’t want to really scare you, but it was alarming how many people I talked to who are highly placed people in AI who have retreats that are sort of ‘bug out’ houses, to which they could flee if it all hits the fan.” 
— James Barrat, Author, Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era

Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max TegmarkOpens a new window 

This book was named the Book of the Year in 2018 by The Daily Telegraph as well as The Times. A personal favorite of Elon Musk, the book revolves around Tegmark, a physicist and cosmologist by profession. Tegmark sets out to differentiate the myths of AI from reality in an approachable way. The author manages to answer some very challenging questions about creating a prosperous world with AI and how to protect AI from being hacked. It is a book which aims to help the layperson understand the areas that will be most affected by AI in our day-to-day lives.
A great starting point of all into the world of AI.

2. Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI by Paul Daugherty and H. James WilsonOpens a new window 

This book is written by Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of Accenture and James Wilson, Managing Director of IT and Business Research, Accenture. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that it has a focus on the business applications and implications of AI. The authors demonstrate that the transformation of all business processes in an organization is the essence of the AI paradigm shift. The book talks about the business areas where humans and machines are working closely together today and reveals the various ways in which companies are leveraging advancements in AI technology for more profitability.
An interesting read for all corporate officers. 
3. Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era by James BarratOpens a new window 
This is an excellent book on AI that considers the dangers of anthropomorphizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), and notes that superintelligence is a completely different type of threat. In this book, James Barrat talks about the various agencies and governments that are invested in researching artificial general intelligence (AGI). Many experts and scientists today believe that once the goal of AGI is achieved, machines will have a survival drive that’s almost similar to humans. Barratt discusses this further and concludes that artificial super intelligence (ASI) will eventually become a threat to the human race.

4. Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick BostromOpens a new window 
Animals lack the capabilities that a human brain possesses, making the human race the dominant species on earth today. Nick Bostrom discusses the implications for if this dominant position is compromised due to machine superintelligence. Like many other philosophical works, this book, too, asks more questions than it answers. It talks about the time when machines will surpass human intelligence and whether this will turn out to be positive or negative for mankind. If a day like that ever occurs, the fate of humans will more or less be dependent on machine superintelligence, much like the fate of gorillas depends on humans today. This book is quite ambitious and carefully makes its path through an intellectual terrain we’d all like to be able to ignore.
Scary but compelling, right? 
5. The Singularity is Near by Ray KurzweilOpens a new window 

Ray Kurzweil is known for his respected opinions about the role of technology in the future. In The Age of Spiritual Machines, his classic book, he discussed how computers were soon going to rival human intelligence. In The Singularity is Near, he dives into super artificial intelligence and describes singularity from a fresh perspective. Kurzweil says that singularity is the point at which the intelligence of machines and humans will merge. And once that happens, there will be no stopping these machines.
So much potential!
