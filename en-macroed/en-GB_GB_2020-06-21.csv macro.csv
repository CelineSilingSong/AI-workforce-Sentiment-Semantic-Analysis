Our global issues are complex, and AI provides us with a valuable tool to augment human efforts to come up with solutions to vexing problems. Here are 10 of the best ways artificial intelligence is used for good.
10 Wonderful Examples Of Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) For Good Adobe Stock

Cancer Screening

Artificial intelligence, powered by deep-learning algorithms, is already in use in healthcare. Specifically, AI’s imaging capabilities are promising for cancer identification and screening, including breast cancer. Artificial intelligence is also used to predict the development of diseases across a healthcare network. A group at Mount Sinai used deep learning-based AI algorithms to predict the development of diseases with 94% accuracy, including cancers of liver, rectum, and prostate. Thanks to published cancer research, clinical trials, and drug development, there's a plethora of data that AI can help to review and then guide healthcare decision-making.  

Save the Bees

Did you know The World Bee Project is using artificial intelligence to save the bees? The global bee population is in decline, and that's bad news for our planet and our food supply. In a partnership with Oracle, The World Bee Project hopes to learn how to help bees survive and thrive by gathering data through internet-of-things sensors, microphones, and cameras on hives. The data is then uploaded to the cloud and analyzed by artificial intelligence to identify patterns or trends that could direct early interventions to help bees survive. Ultimately, artificial intelligence makes it easier to share real-time information on a global scale and take action to save the bees.

Tools for People with Disabilities
Another way artificial intelligence is used for good is to help people with disabilities overcome them. Huawei used AI and augmented reality to create StorySign, a free mobile app that helps deaf children learn to read by translating the text into sign language. The company also created Track.Ai, an easy-to-use, affordable device that can identify visual disorders in children so treatment can begin before the disorders cause blindness. Facing Emotions, another AI app created by Huawei, translates emotion into short and simple sounds. The app assesses the emotion it sees on another's face to help blind people ""see"" the emotion of the person they are talking with. The app uses the rear camera on the phone to evaluate the nose, mouth, eyebrows and eyes, and artificial intelligence to analyze the expression on these facial features and what emotion they convey—contempt, anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness and surprise.
Climate Change
We can make tremendous progress in solving one of the world’s biggest issues with the support of artificial intelligence. Climate change is a gargantuan problem, but several thought leaders in AI and machine learning believe technology might be able to tackle it. Machine learning can improve climate informatics—machine learning algorithms power approximately 30 climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Artificial intelligence can also help educate and predict the impacts of climate change on different regions. Researchers from the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) use GANs (generative adversarial networks) to simulate the damage of severe storms and rising sea levels.

Wildlife Conservation
Another way AI is put to work for the planet is in conservation efforts and allows underfunded conservationists an opportunity to analyze data inexpensively. A team from the University of Hawaii’s Kauai Endangered Seabird Recovery Project used AI to analyze 600 hours of audio to detect the number of collisions between birds and power lines. In another effort to halt the decline of endangered species by using AI, the University of Southern California Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society uses an unmanned aerial vehicle to spot poachers and locate animals. The data collected by the drone is sent back to be analyzed by machine learning tools that use game theory to help predict poacher and animal activity. AI is also used by Wild Me and Microsoft to automatically recognize, log, and track endangered animals like whale sharks by analyzing photos people upload to the internet.

Combat World Hunger
One of the most viable tools in the fight to end the world hunger crisis is artificial intelligence. It can analyze millions of data points to help determine the perfect crop, develop seeds, maximize current output, and control herbicide application precisely. Many applications are in use already, but one we'll highlight here is the Nutrition Early Warning System (NEWS) that uses machine learning and big data to identify regions that are at increased risk of food shortages due to crop failure, rising food prices and drought.

Reduce Inequality and Poverty
Although one of the criticisms with AI algorithms is the human bias that can be introduced via skewed algorithms or training data sets, AI can actually help reduce inequalities. The Center for Data Science and Public Policy of the University of Chicago’s project Aequitas and IBM’s AI Fairness 360 are open source toolkits that can track and correct bias. Smart text editor Textio, that makes job descriptions more inclusive, helped one publisher grow its percentage of women recruits to 57 percent, from just 10% previously. Imperial College of London is training AI to Identify inequality based on street images of living conditions in cities, with the aim to ultimately use this information to improve the situations. Similarly, AI analyzes satellite imagery in a Stanford University project to predict regions of poverty, which can then influence economic aid. Another way AI/machine learning is working to end poverty is through IBM's Science for Social Good directive Simpler Voice to overcome illiteracy.
Spot “Fake News”
It's true: AI is the engine that pushes ""fake news"" out to the masses, but Google, Microsoft, and grassroots effort Fake News Challenge are using AI (machine learning and natural language processing) to assess the truth of articles automatically. Due to the trillions of posts, Facebook must monitor and the impossibility of manually doing it, the company also uses artificial intelligence to find words and patterns that could indicate fake news. Other tools that rely on AI to analyze content include Spike, Snopes, Hoaxy, and more.
Assess Medical Images
In general, artificial intelligence is leveraged in many ways to improve healthcare systems. German-based Siemens Healthineers is a leading medical technology company that integrates AI into many of its innovative technologies. One of these technologies is the AI-Rad Companion.4, a radiologist assistant that supports routine reading and measurement tasks on medical imaging. AI augments the review of medical imaging to help alleviate some of the workloads for over-taxed radiologists. Another innovation is the AI-Pathway Companion5. This tool integrates insights from pathology, imaging, lab and genetics for each patient to provide status and suggest the next steps based on the data.
Prioritize Upgrades
At the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS), AI is deployed to figure out how to maintain Los Angeles' water supply in the event of an earthquake. Since the city's utility infrastructure is aging, the project aims to identify strategic areas for improvement in the network of pipes, so that critical infrastructure (those that serve hospitals, evacuation centers, fire and police centers) is prioritized for upgrades to earthquake-resistant pipes. This is a problem AI is adept at solving by simulating many different scenarios to find the best solution.

More children are being vaccinated around the world today than ever before, and the prevalence of many vaccine-preventable diseases has dropped over the last decade. Despite these encouraging signs, however, the availability of essential vaccines has stagnated globally in recent years, according the World Health Organization.
One problem, particularly in low-resource settings, is the difficulty of predicting how many children will show up for vaccinations at each health clinic. This leads to vaccine shortages, leaving children without critical immunizations, or to surpluses that can’t be used.
The startup macro-eyes is seeking to solve that problem with a vaccine forecasting tool that leverages a unique combination of real-time data sources, including new insights from front-line health workers. The company says the tool, named the Connected Health AI Network (CHAIN), was able to reduce vaccine wastage by 96 percent across three regions of Tanzania. Now it is working to scale that success across Tanzania and Mozambique.
“Health care is complex, and to be invited to the table, you need to deal with missing data,” says macro-eyes Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Fels, who co-founded the company with Suvrit Sra, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Associate Professor at MIT. “If your system needs age, gender, and weight to make predictions, but for one population you don’t have weight or age, you can’t just say, ‘This system doesn’t work.’ Our feeling is it has to be able to work in any setting.”
The company’s approach to prediction is already the basis for another product, the patient scheduling platform Sibyl, which has analyzed over 6 million hospital appointments and reduced wait times by more than 75 percent at one of the largest heart hospitals in the U.S. Sibyl’s predictions work as part of CHAIN’s broader forecasts.
Both products represent steps toward macro-eyes’ larger goal of transforming health care through artificial intelligence. And by getting their solutions to work in the regions with the least amount of data, they’re also advancing the field of AI.
“The state of the art in machine learning will result from confronting fundamental challenges in the most difficult environments in the world,” Fels says. “Engage where the problems are hardest, and AI too will benefit: [It will become] smarter, faster, cheaper, and more resilient.”
Defining an approach
Sra and Fels first met about 10 years ago when Fels was working as an algorithmic trader for a hedge fund and Sra was a visiting faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley. The pair’s experience crunching numbers in different industries alerted them to a shortcoming in health care.
“A question that became an obsession to me was, ‘Why were financial markets almost entirely determined by machines — by algorithms — and health care the world over is probably the least algorithmic part of anybody’s life?’” Fels recalls. “Why is health care not more data-driven?”
Around 2013, the co-founders began building machine-learning algorithms that measured similarities between patients to better inform treatment plans at Stanford School of Medicine and another large academic medical center in New York. It was during that early work that the founders laid the foundation of the company’s approach.
“There are themes we established at Stanford that remain today,” Fels says. “One is [building systems with] humans in the loop: We’re not just learning from the data, we’re also learning from the experts. The other is multidimensionality. We’re not just looking at one type of data; we’re looking at 10 or 15 types, [including] images, time series, information about medication, dosage, financial information, how much it costs the patient or hospital.”
Around the time the founders began working with Stanford, Sra joined MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) as a principal research scientist. He would go on to become a faculty member in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS). The mission of IDSS, to advance fields including data science and to use those advances to improve society, aligned well with Sra’s mission at macro-eyes.
“Because of that focus [on impact] within IDSS, I find it my focus to try to do AI for social good,’ Sra says. “The true judgment of success is how many people did we help? How could we improve access to care for people, wherever they may be?”
In 2017, macro-eyes received a small grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to explore the possibility of using data from front-line health workers to build a predictive supply chain for vaccines. It was the beginning of a relationship with the Gates Foundation that has steadily expanded as the company has reached new milestones, from building accurate vaccine utilization models in Tanzania and Mozambique to integrating with supply chains to make vaccine supplies more proactive. To help with the latter mission, Prashant Yadav recently joined the board of directors; Yadav worked as a professor of supply chain management with the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program for seven years and is now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a nonprofit thinktank.
In conjunction with their work on CHAIN, the company has deployed another product, Sibyl, which uses machine learning to determine when patients are most likely to show up for appointments, to help front-desk workers at health clinics build schedules. Fels says the system has allowed hospitals to improve the efficiency of their operations so much they’ve reduced the average time patients wait to see a doctor from 55 days to 13 days.
As a part of CHAIN, Sibyl similarly uses a range of data points to optimize schedules, allowing it to accurately predict behavior in environments where other machine learning models might struggle.
The founders are also exploring ways to apply that approach to help direct Covid-19 patients to health clinics with sufficient capacity. That work is being developed with Sierra Leone Chief Innovation Officer David Sengeh SM ’12 PhD ’16.
Pushing frontiers
Building solutions for some of the most underdeveloped health care systems in the world might seem like a difficult way for a young company to establish itself, but the approach is an extension of macro-eyes’ founding mission of building health care solutions that can benefit people around the world equally.
“As an organization, we can never assume data will be waiting for us,” Fels says. “We’ve learned that we need to think strategically and be thoughtful about how to access or generate the data we need to fulfill our mandate: Make the delivery of health care predictive, everywhere.”
The approach is also a good way to explore innovations in mathematical fields the founders have spent their careers working in.
“Necessity is absolutely the mother of invention,” Sra says. “This is innovation driven by need.”
And going forward, the company’s work in difficult environments should only make scaling easier.
“We think every day about how to make our technology more rapidly deployable, more generalizable, more highly scalable,” Sra says. “How do we get to the immense power of bringing true machine learning to the world’s most important problems without first spending decades and billions of dollars in building digital infrastructure? How do we leap into the future?”

TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--What’s New: Intel is partnering with Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD) to launch the first Intel-designed artificial intelligence (AI) associate degree program in the United States. The Arizona Commerce Authority will also provide a workforce grant of $100,000 to support the program. It will enable tens of thousands of students to land careers in high-tech, healthcare, automotive, industrial and aerospace fields.


“We strongly believe AI technology should be shaped by many voices representing different experiences and backgrounds. Community colleges offer the opportunity to expand and diversify AI since they attract a diverse array of students with a variety of backgrounds and expertise. Intel is committed to partnering with educational institutions to expand access to technology skills needed for current and future jobs.”


– Gregory Bryant, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group


Whom It Helps: Based in Tempe, Arizona, MCCCD is the largest community college district in the U.S. with an estimated enrollment of more than 100,000 students across 10 campuses and 10,000 faculty and staff members.


How It Helps: The AI program consists of courses that have been developed by MCCCD’s faculty and Intel leaders based on Intel software and tools such as the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit and Intel Python. Intel will also contribute technical advice, faculty training, summer internships and Intel mentors for both students and faculty members. Students will learn fundamental skills such as data collection, AI model training, coding and exploration of AI technology’s societal impact. The program includes a social impact AI project that is developed with guidance from teachers and Intel mentors. Upon completion, MCCCD will offer an associate degree in artificial intelligence that can be transferred to a four-year college.


Why It’s Important: AI technology is rapidly accelerating with new tools, technology and applications requiring workers to learn new skills. Recent studies show the demand for artificial intelligence skills is expected to grow exponentially. A 2020 LinkedIn report notes that AI skills are one of the top five most in-demand hard skills. Research by MCCCD Workforce and Economic Development Office estimates an increase of 22.4 percent for these roles by 2029.


As of early June 2020, more than 43 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. Furthermore, a recent McKinsey study estimates that over 57 million jobs are vulnerable, meaning they are subject to furloughs, layoffs or being rendered unproductive. It is critical for educational institutions and corporations to collaborate to prepare for future workforce demands.


About AI Program Launch Details: The program’s first phase will be piloted online at Estrella Mountain Community College and Chandler Gilbert Community College in fall 2020.

More than a century ago, the automobile ushered in a new age that fundamentally remade the practice of veterinary medicine. Will artificial intelligence do the same?
Virtually every area of life is somehow touched by AI, enhancing our understanding of complex issues and making better outcomes more likely. In the human health care industry, AI is being used in image interpretation, disease diagnosis, patient monitoring, drug development, and even robotic surgery. Google and IBM have invested heavily in the AI health care sector, which is projected to hit $150 billion over the next decade.
Veterinary medicine and pet owners are also using AI technologies, most notably in the areas of radiography, triage, and diagnosis.

Science fact versus fiction
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science dealing with the simulation of human intelligence through the use of computers.
AI technology rapidly analyzes massive amounts of data according to a set of instructions known as algorithms to accomplish a specific task. These tasks run the gamut, from making an online book or movie recommendation to identifying a person based on their facial features.
And yet, the technology is nowhere near replicating human cognition or creativity. AI can only do what it’s instructed to do, meaning that the algorithms used to sniff out tax fraud can’t also forecast tomorrow’s weather.
Thomas Strohmer, PhD, is a mathematics professor and director of the Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research at the University of California-Davis. The center promotes interdisciplinary collaborations that use data science and AI to find solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems, such as climate change and affordable health care for everyone. Dr. Strohmer says there are two types of AI.
“One is a general, very high view of AI that can think and read like humans. This is a grand vision of AI that doesn’t exist yet, right? It’s science fiction and doesn’t exist, not even close,” he explained. “Then you have the more narrow AI that you use for driving cars, language translation, and other really impressive applications. This is what we usually mean when we talk about AI: task-specific AI.
“But I should make it very clear, there is no ‘I’ in AI, not yet. The people who write these algorithms are very intelligent, but the algorithms themselves are not intelligent in a way that they can reason.”
In a 2019 report, the National Academy of Medicine wrote, “AI has the potential to revolutionize health care” and “offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient and clinical team outcomes, reduce costs, and impact population health.”
The academy also sought to temper expectations about what AI could achieve, however. “One of the greatest near-term risks in the current development of AI tools in medicine is not that it will cause serious unintended harm, but that it simply cannot meet the incredible expectations stoked by excessive hype. Indeed, so-called AI technologies such as deep learning and machine learning are riding atop the utmost peak of inflated expectations for emerging technologies.”
Data analysis
Dr. Krystle Reagan makes it clear that she isn’t a computer scientist. Rather, she’s a veterinary internist at the UC-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital and an advocate of AI. She helped develop an algorithm to detect Addison disease with an accuracy rate greater than 99%.
“We call Addison’s disease ‘the great pretender’ because dogs come in with very vague clinical signs. The blood work can look like intestinal disease, it can look like kidney disease, it can look like liver disease. So it’s one of those conditions that you really have to be on your toes,” Dr. Reagan said.
Blood work results from more than 1,000 dogs previously treated at the teaching hospital were used to train an AI program to detect complex patterns suggestive of the disease. The computer program was then able to use these patterns to determine whether a new patient has Addison disease. Dr. Reagan and her team published their findings in the July 2020 issue of the journal Domestic Animal Endocrinology.
Now Dr. Reagan is coding data from canine patients seen at the UC-Davis teaching hospital over the past decade in which leptospirosis was diagnosed or suspected but later ruled out. The project is a collaboration among Drs. Reagan and Strohmer and the center for data science and AI.
“Then we’re using machine learning algorithms to try to identify subtle patterns in the blood work of these dogs that might help us categorize them as having leptospirosis or not earlier than we can with traditional diagnostics,” Dr. Reagan explained.
Timing is important when diagnosing leptospirosis, Dr Reagan said, because the disease can cause serious kidney problems that can become so severe as to require dialysis. “Unfortunately, the gold standard testing for leptospirosis requires two antibody tests about 10 days apart,” she continued.
“The gold standard tells us that I can’t make a diagnosis until at least 10 days after illness. And we really need some sort of tool to help us give owners some guidance in terms of prognosis when we’re looking at this ill dog and deciding whether or not to move forward with dialysis.
“We’re hopeful that we can find patterns in the data that will help us classify our canine patients as having leptospirosis or not—or at least to help us say we think there is an 80% chance that your dog has leptospirosis or we think it’s very unlikely that your dog has leptospirosis.”

X-ray vision
Radiography is another area where AI is being used with great success. Complex algorithms have been shown to be highly accurate in recognizing patterns in imaging data.
The National Academy of Medicine estimates that about 100 scientific reports dealing with AI in radiology were published in 2005, but the number of publications had increased to more than 800 in 2017.
“Tasks for which current AI technology seems well suited include prioritizing and tracking findings that mandate early attention, comparing current and prior images, and high-throughput screenings that enable radiologists to concentrate on images most likely to be abnormal,” the academy wrote in its 2019 report. “Over time, however, it is likely that interpretation of routine imaging will be increasingly performed using AI applications.”
The company Vetology has provided traditional veterinary teleradiology services since 2010. Two years ago, the company began offering the option of AI analysis of radiographs of the thorax, heart, and lungs in dogs. Results are ready within five minutes and promise an accuracy rate on par with that of a live veterinary radiologist, said Vetology founder and CEO Dr. Seth Wallack, a board-certified veterinary radiologist.
“Studies of MD radiologists have shown that, on average, they’re correct about 70% to 75% of the time. I always tell people I would love to get the diagnosis right 80% of the time,” Dr. Wallack said.
“A feedback loop is crucial to AI improvement. When we catch a problem, we can ask, ‘What did the AI report say, and why did AI interpret it that way?’ Then we tweak things a little bit to help the machine learn, improving future AI results.”
Dr. Wallack recalled a recent case involving a referring veterinarian who thought a dog might be in left-sided heart failure. The owners were contemplating euthanasia. After receiving the Vetology AI radiology report stating there was no evidence of heart disease or heart failure, the referring veterinarian asked Vetology to have a board-certified veterinary radiologist examine the images. Dr. Wallack said, “I received that submission, and there was just enough rotation and fluid in the caudal thoracic esophagus that I thought to myself, ‘I totally see how this could be interpreted as pulmonary edema.’ It wasn’t, and the Vetology AI system read it correctly. I think AI just saved a dog’s life.”
He added, “Our belief has always been that receiving a Vetology AI radiograph report within five minutes or less after taking the radiographs will positively impact patient outcomes. That said, every day I’m blown away by what Vetology AI does.”
Future perfect?
Dr. Rolan Tripp is interested in the future of the veterinary profession. He’s been talking about it for 30 years and even founded the Veterinary Future Society. Dr. Tripp believes AI is the future of veterinary medicine.
“I think most people don’t understand how huge of an effect this is going to have, any more than when a hundred years ago veterinarians saw that first tractor out in the field and laughed when it broke down. Many veterinarians today think AI is a fad, but it isn’t. It will revolutionize how we practice veterinary medicine, mostly in a good way,” Dr. Tripp said.
As president-elect of the Veterinary Medical Ethics Society, Dr. Tripp is acutely concerned about the ethical considerations of using AI in veterinary medicine. “This is an almost virgin territory because very little has been written on it and addressed it,” he said.
Dr. Tripp wants the AVMA to work with various stakeholder groups in taking a lead role in anticipating and accommodating the impacts AI technologies will have on the veterinary profession. “We should have a plan to try to steer this machine intelligence because it’s coming in a big way, and most people don’t understand that.”

Digital marketers have to deploy AI. They also have to defeat it
In October 2017, Facebook altered the Instagram API to make it harder for users to search its giant database of photos. The change was a small element of the company’s response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but it was a significant problem for parts of the digital marketing industry.


Not long before, New York-based influencer marketing agency Amra & Elma had developed a platform that ingested data from Instagram, and allowed its client to use AI image classifiers to find very specific influencers. For instance, they could find an influencer with, say, between 10,000 and 50,000 followers who had posted photos of themselves in a Jeep. Facebook’s move killed this capability in a keystroke. Another day in the digital duel between the AIs deployed by digital marketers, and those deployed by the social media platforms.

Analytics is all
Once upon a time, successful advertising was a question of artistic creativity and financial muscle. Hire a hot agency to produce a 30-second ad, spend a lot of money with TV and newspaper owners, and you were bound to make a splash. The Mad Men of Madison Avenue were about sizzle and silver, not science.

PROMOTED
The internet has changed all that. Today it is all about data, analytics, and algorithms. Google and Facebook have made off with much of Rupert Murdoch’s ad revenue, by the simple method of making adspend accountable, and much, much more targeted. With Google Ads you only pay when a consumer clicks on your ad. With Facebook ads you know far more about the type of people your ads are being served to. It is no longer “spray and pray”.

Digital marketing is now the sexy part of the advertising industry, and its currency is data. The ability to obtain and analyse data is the core skill, not a good line in patter and a generous expense account. It is more important to understand the mechanics of the social media platforms than to know the maitre d’ at the latest trendy restaurant.

Elma Beganovich, co-founder of Amra & Elma, says “AI is a game changer in digital marketing, especially influencer marketing. Brands are now able to pinpoint their target demographic precisely, and speak to them directly. Technologies like voice recognition allow us to identify what topics influencers are talking about on YouTube and Instagram TV.""

Influencer marketing is a significant and fast-growing section of the digital marketing industry. The big agency networks (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, and Interpublic) have their players, and there are hundreds of independent outfits. The industry is currently valued at $8bn, and before COVID-19 came along, was forecast to double in the next two years. Jessy Grossman, founder of Women In Influencer Marketing (WIIM), thinks that the virus might accelerate growth: “Brands have been hit hard. We are going to see them pinch every penny and demand the most ROI. Digital marketing is far more efficient, data driven and quick. It’s also the most economical way to get production quality content and large-scale distribution at a fraction of the price.”

Data tames the Wild West
In its early days, when Instagram was new, influencer marketing was a lawless, wild west environment – the least data-driven part of the digital marketing industry. Clients were eager to benefit from the adulation that influencers can inspire, but they had no way to measure the return on their investment, and unscrupulous influencers were buying fake followers by the thousand.
But analytics are taking over, even here. Clients want to know what they are getting for their money, and consumers want to know when they are receiving sponsored messages. Analytics are critical in understanding the level of engagement between influencers and their followers. And regulators have corralled influencers into using hashtags to indicate when a post has been paid for.
Influencer marketing is still mainly a B2C (business to consumer) activity, with the big three client categories being beauty, food, and fashion. But B2B (business to business) usage is taking off too, with influencers becoming important in financial services, pharmaceuticals, and technology.
The big money still goes to TV celebrities and footballers, with hundreds of millions of Instagram followers - Kylie Jenner charges $1m for a single post. But as the industry matures, it is finding roles for more modest players, and a hierarchy has evolved. Macro influencers have more than half a million followers, the mid-tier has 100,000 plus, the micro influencers have 10,000 plus, and last but not least are the nano influencers, with 1,000 to 10,000 followers. Clients can bundle influencers with more modest followings, allowing more precisely targeted marketing. And influencers with smaller followings often generate more engagement with, and attention from, their followers.
Platform evolution
Influencer marketing has been around in various forms for centuries, and its monetisation gathered pace with the rise of reality TV shows in the noughties. But it was the arrival of social media platforms which made it an industry. These platforms are evolving fast; they wield great power, but they are always at risk of being superseded by the latest trend. Millennials declined to use the platform favoured by their parents, so Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1bn (and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19bn). SnapChat refused to be acquired by Facebook, but Zuckerberg managed to overtake it by making Instagram Stories more user-friendly.
Alongside Instagram, YouTube is the other great influencer platform. Videos allow YouTubers to form more emotional bonds with their audiences. Facebook launched Instagram TV (IGTV) in June 2018, but so far it has failed to repeat the success against Google-owned YouTube that Instagram Stories achieved against Snapchat.
The new kid on the block is TikTok. Jessy Grossman says, “TikTok is all that everyone is talking about. The virality of it is like YouTube years ago. While it seems to attract a young audience, I’ve also seen all kinds of content perform well on there. The tools it provides its users directly in the platform are fairly complex, and really encourage interesting content.”
Clients, agencies and the influencers themselves are engaged in a constant battle with the platforms. They desperately want to maximise the attention secured by their posts, and they are constantly innovating, and refining their techniques, to raise their ranking on the platforms. The platforms, on the other hand, want great content to keep their audiences engaged, but if anyone is going to pay to promote a piece of content, they want it to be their own ads, not an agency. Artificial intelligence is the most powerful weapon in both sides’ armouries.
Darwin plus data
The platforms actively court the influencers, and welcome the highly curated and creative content they produce. They use machine learning and other AI techniques to help influencers raise their game still further. But they also deploy AI, and continually evolve their algorithms, to prevent influencers and agencies from gaming the system using their own data and AIs. It is a constant struggle: Darwin plus data.
AI is also helping the agencies manage the bewildering growth in the number of influencers. OMD and GroupM, the media agencies of the ad networks Omnicom and WPP, both launched AI tools in early 2018 to match influencers to brands, and assess the performance of campaigns they run together.
Virtual influencers
Influencers are often accused of being fake: fake followers, fake tans, fake lifestyles. A single photo can take a day to set up, with an army of stylists and make-up artists as well as the photographer and the lighting team. And then there is the photoshop team.
As well as working hard to get the right image, influencers have to strike the right tone. Quite a few of them have struggled with this since the murder of George Floyd and the return of the black Lives Matter movement. Influencers have been harshly criticised for using protest events as a backdrop for a fashion-related shoot. But even before the pandemic, the fakery went to an extreme: meet the virtual influencers.
Lil Miquela is a freckly Brazilian 19 year-old who lives in Los Angeles. 80,000 people stream her songs on Spotify each month, and she counts Prada among her clients. She has 2.2m followers on Instagram, and many of them know that she is entirely fictional. She was created in 2016 by Brud, a startup in LA which specialises in CGI, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Until 2018, Brud allowed Lil’s followers to believe she was real, and then they staged her “kidnap”, using another avatar, called Bermuda. A Trump-supporting “robot supremacist”, Bermuda accused Lil of being a “fake ass person” and said she could not have her account back until she told the world the truth. Brud is now said to be worth $125m.
The virtual influencer story took another turn after the virus lockdown, when the WHO contracted with Influential, another LA-based studio, to obtain the services of Knox Frost, a CGI rendering of a 20 year-old from Atlanta, with a million followers on Instagram. Frost posts about the need to observe the lockdown, and to wash hands frequently. Elma Beganovich of Amra & Elma claims these virtual influencers are not a fad, but “a genuine game-changer, with millions and followers and A-list clients.”
Like the rest of digital marketing, influencers – and the agencies which monetise them - are here to stay. The constant sparring of their AIs, their algorithms and their data, with those of the social media platforms, will continue to improve their effectiveness and their efficiency.

As the Air Force works to modernize its cybersecurity practices, it wants to deploy artificial intelligence to better support its networks’ defensive measures so airmen get more time to do white-hat hacking and other higher-level tasks.
The plan is to automate and leverage algorithms that can learn from data to fix small issues, especially those that can easily be missed by a human. Fixing bugs and sifting through reams of threat reports are assignments better left to AI instead of overloaded human workforces, Lauren Knausenberger, chief innovation officer for the Air Force, said Wednesday during CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con for Public Sector Conference, produced by FedScoop and CyberScoop.
“We are just going to miss things the more we do manually,” Knausenberger said.
The Air Force would prefer its human cyber workforce to be “creative in an evil way” by spending more time simulating real-world hacks on the service’s technology.

She envisions human analysts being able to “team” with AI systems to identify where human brain power can apply the type of complex problem solving-skills that computers can’t apply on their own.
Using AI-enabled systems to recognize the most important cyberthreat information and then alert airmen is the goal, Knausenberger said.
“Until you get that right … you will be drowning” in reams of data, she said.
Another reason for the Air Force to promote AI: The cybersecurity workforce shortage has been acute in the government. Employers like the DOD often lag behind the private sector in benefits and pay. Adding AI-powered systems to the defensive workforce ultimately will lead to stronger security, Knausenberger said.
There are also ways to attract outside help, too. The Air Force has recently expanding its bug bounty programs, including new “Hack-a-Sat” events for ethical hackers to target satellites. The department even paid out $150,000 to a teenager in recent bug bounties, and the computer whiz was later offered a job in the Defense Department, Knausenberger said.

A humanoid actress named Erica will appear in b, a sci-fi flick that eerily mirrors the android's own origin story.The roboticist who created Erica actually taught her method acting through one-on-one sessions.Professional acting involves having some close encounters on set. Whether that means talking in tight quarters, rubbing shoulders, or sharing a kiss, none of these scenarios are safe amid the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Naturally, filming movies is extraordinarily difficult at the moment.But that isn't stopping Hollywood from trying.Say hello to Erica (seen above), a special kind of thespian who is immune to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. How's that? Because she's a humanoid robot. Erica will soon be the first artificially intelligent actor to take on the lead role in a film, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Erica will star in the forthcoming sci-fi movie b, the $70 million story of a scientist who has come up with a program to ""perfect"" human DNA (a la eugenics), which glitches and becomes dangerous, according to THR. So the scientist must help Erica, the AI organism that he's created, escape the lab.  This story aligns with Erica's real-world origin tale. Japanese scientists Hiroshi Ishiguro and Kohei Ogawa designed the humanoid robot to study human-computer interaction. Ishiguro is so embedded in this stuff that he's even created an android of his own daughter in the past, which Alex Mar describes beautifully in a 2017 WIRED profile of his ingenious, yet haunting work. For her performance in b, Ishiguro and Ogawa have taught Erica to act by applying method acting principles to artificial intelligence.""In other methods of acting, actors involve their own life experiences in the role,"" Sam Khoze, a producer involved with the film, told THR. ""But Erica has no life experiences. She was created from scratch to play the role. We had to simulate her motions and emotions through one-on-one sessions, such as controlling the speed of her movements, talking through her feelings and coaching character development and body language.""This isn't the first time Hollywood has gotten creative with its casting. Last year, MOI Worldwide and Image Engine announced they'll be using James Dean in Finding Jack, a live-action film about the Vietnam War. The twist, of course, is that James Dean has been dead for 65 years.The visual effects wizards at those studios are recreating Dean using a technique called ""full body"" CGI, which means the team will use actual footage of the actor, including photos and video. A separate actor, still unnamed, will provide his voice. Finding Jack is supposed to come out this Veteran's Day, but it's unclear if COVID-19 has impacted that timeline.You won't be able to see Erica's performance in b, meanwhile, until at least sometime in late 2021. Producers are still looking for a director and Erica's human co-stars, though Erica did complete some scenes in Japan back in 2019. The team behind the flick expects to finish shooting in Europe sometime in June 2021.

AI fuels boom in innovation, investment and jobs in Canada: U of T report





Thanks to the pioneering work of researchers like U of T’s Geoffrey Hinton, Toronto has emerged as a hub of AI innovation in a range of fields, including the global fight against COVID-19 (photo by Johnny Guatto)

Canada’s artificial intelligence sector is fuelling innovation, job creation and private sector investment – and University of Toronto researchers and entrepreneurs are playing a central role in that success, according to a report based on data compiled by Ottawa’s Global Advantage Consulting Group.
The report, prepared by U of T, found that Canada’s unique combination of public investment, private capital, research capacity and talent has generated over 50,000 jobs and attracted nearly $3 billion in investment since 2010, with the number of active AI firms in Canada doubling to more than 670 since 2015.
U of T alone has produced 81 active AI startups, according to Global Advantage, a research and analytics firm that provides ecosystem mapping and analysis services to private and public sector clients. In total, AI-powered startups connected to U of T have raised $183 million in funding and created over 600 jobs in the last five years, the report says.
Vivek Goel, U of T’s vice-president, research and innovation, and strategic initiatives, says the report offers further evidence of the success of the federal government’s Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, launched in 2017 with a $125-million commitment over five years.
“Canada, and Toronto in particular, have long been recognized as global hubs of AI research thanks to the pioneering work of people like [U of T University Professor Emeritus] Geoffrey Hinton, but in the past many people trained in U of T’s machine learning group ended up going abroad to work for big tech companies,” says Goel.
“This report shows that the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy has helped create the conditions necessary to retain that talent in Canada – presenting opportunities to be involved in further research and training – so we can have the talent supply needed to fuel Canadian research, innovation and application in business sectors.”
As an example, Goel cites the impact of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, launched three years ago with $50 million in support from the government of Ontario and another $80 million from industry partners, in “taking what was happening in the university, connecting it with the business community and getting it out into the marketplace before people in other countries could do it.”
The investment in Canada’s AI research foundation is now yielding important applications and advances in the fight to contain and treat the COVID-19 virus. A few of the research projects detailed in the report – titled Canada’s AI Ecosystem: Government Investment Propels Private Sector Growth – include:

At the Vector Institute, researchers are working on tools to treat the virus and help governments manage the public health impacts. Alán Aspuru-Guzik, a professor in U of T’s departments of chemistry and computer science, is using AI to identify molecules that can be used therapeutically to target SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
U of T startup DNAstack adopted its biomedical research software to create COVID Cloud, a tool for scientists to share and track the genetic development of the virus. 
BenchSci, co-founded by U of T PhD students and developed at U of T through the Entrepreneurship Hatchery, H2i (Health Innovation Hub) and the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) uses machine learning to help scientists find and purchase antibodies for their experiments, saving time and money.  BenchSci is now using their technology to identify novel reagents to study the COVID-19 virus.

Health-related AI applications have drawn particular interest from private sector investors, with over 15 per cent of AI-related private investment between 2015 and 2019 going to companies operating in health care and related areas like cloud computing and cybersecurity.
Deep Genomics, an AI-powered drug discovery startup co-founded by U of T Professor Brendan Frey of the Edward S. Rogers Sr. department of electrical and computer engineering in the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, is one of many AI startups in the health-care space. The company has so far raised $61 million, including a recent $40-million Series B financing, as it works to develop a drug candidate for Wilson disease, a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder, based on calculations performed by its systems.

U of T startups are also applying AI to a variety of other problems, from medical imaging to quantum computing and consumer research. The report underlines that Canada is an innovation leader in the AI sector, producing the most AI patents per million people among the G7 countries and China, while Toronto “has attracted the densest cluster of AI startups in the world.”
Blue J Legal, a Toronto startup co-founded by three members of U of T’s Faculty of Law, uses AI to predict the outcomes of tax and employment law cases. The company launched its Canadian tax law product in 2017 and employment law offering in 2018. In 2019, it expanded into the U.S. tax law market, where it has already secured more than a dozen law firms as clients.
Both Blue J Legal and Deep Genomics emerged from U of T’s expansive entrepreneurship ecosystem, having received early support from CDL and UTEST – two of U of T’s many startup accelerators.
Several of U of T’s AI startups will be in focus this week during Collision at Home, the online edition of one of the world’s fastest-growing tech conferences, which draws speakers, entrepreneurs, inventors, investors and business leaders from around the world. The event is being held virtually this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But U of T entrepreneurs, researchers and students will still have a major presence, with more than two dozen U of T startups scheduled to participate.

In all, U of T’s AI programs attracted $244 million in research funding between 2015 and 2019 – a period that saw substantial increases in funding for AI research from the federal government. This, in turn, has allowed Canada to outperform many countries in two key metrics: field-weighted citation impact of AI research publications and academic-corporate collaborations, the report says.
The report also notes that the expanding AI ecosystem around U of T is attracting philanthropists in addition to investors. That includes a $100-million gift to U of T from business leaders Heather Reisman and Gerald Schwartz. The money is being used to construct the Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre, a 750,000 square foot complex that will anchor U of T’s cluster of AI and biomedical researchers, as well as entrepreneurs and their startups. It will also be home to the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, which will explore the social implications of AI and other emerging technologies.
“If you look at the most successful innovation ecosystems, they always have an anchor academic institution – a leading global university; they always have anchor multinational corporations and they have a thriving startup ecosystem,” Goel says.
“We have all those pieces coming together around the AI and tech sector here.”

We listen to music with our ears, but also our eyes, watching with appreciation as the pianist’s fingers fly over the keys and the violinist’s bow rocks across the ridge of strings. When the ear fails to tell two instruments apart, the eye often pitches in by matching each musician’s movements to the beat of each part. 
A new artificial intelligence tool developed by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab leverages the virtual eyes and ears of a computer to separate similar sounds that are tricky even for humans to differentiate. The tool improves on earlier iterations by matching the movements of individual musicians, via their skeletal keypoints, to the tempo of individual parts, allowing listeners to isolate a single flute or violin among multiple flutes or violins. 
Potential applications for the work range from sound mixing, and turning up the volume of an instrument in a recording, to reducing the confusion that leads people to talk over one another on a video-conference calls. The work will be presented at the virtual Computer Vision Pattern Recognition conference this month.
“Body keypoints provide powerful structural information,” says the study’s lead author, Chuang Gan, an IBM researcher at the lab. “We use that here to improve the AI’s ability to listen and separate sound.” 
In this project, and in others like it, the researchers have capitalized on synchronized audio-video tracks to recreate the way that humans learn. An AI system that learns through multiple sense modalities may be able to learn faster, with fewer data, and without humans having to add pesky labels to each real-world representation. “We learn from all of our senses,” says Antonio Torralba, an MIT professor and co-senior author of the study. “Multi-sensory processing is the precursor to embodied intelligence and AI systems that can perform more complicated tasks.”
The current tool, which uses body gestures to separate sounds, builds on earlier work that harnessed motion cues in sequences of images. Its earliest incarnation, PixelPlayer, let you click on an instrument in a concert video to make it louder or softer. An update to PixelPlayer allowed you to distinguish between two violins in a duet by matching each musician’s movements with the tempo of their part. This newest version adds keypoint data, favored by sports analysts to track athlete performance, to extract finer grained motion data to tell nearly identical sounds apart.
The work highlights the importance of visual cues in training computers to have a better ear, and using sound cues to give them sharper eyes. Just as the current study uses musician pose information to isolate similar-sounding instruments, previous work has leveraged sounds to isolate similar-looking animals and objects. 
Torralba and his colleagues have shown that deep learning models trained on paired audio-video data can learn to recognize natural sounds like birds singing or waves crashing. They can also pinpoint the geographic coordinates of a moving car from the sound of its engine and tires rolling toward, or away from, a microphone. 
The latter study suggests that sound-tracking tools might be a useful addition in self-driving cars, complementing their cameras in poor driving conditions. “Sound trackers could be especially helpful at night, or in bad weather, by helping to flag cars that might otherwise be missed,” says Hang Zhao, PhD ’19, who contributed to both the motion and sound-tracking studies.
Other authors of the CVPR music gesture study are Deng Huang and Joshua Tenenbaum at MIT.

While scientists have succeeded at restoring some coral reefs, humans alone can’t save all the reefs that are dying across the globe, a NOAA reef restoration manager said this month.

Even in the best of conditions, human divers can spend only three or four hours per day working under water, said Tom Moore, coral reef restoration program manager for the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration. And those best conditions are rare.


That’s not enough to halt the collapse of one of the planet’s most crucial ecosystems, Moore said at the EarthxOcean conference: half the world’s coral reefs have died and the rest are expected to perish in this century. That vanishing coral hosts 25 percent of the ocean’s biodiversity, Moore said, and supports fisheries that feed hundreds of millions of people and contribute billions of dollars to the global economy.

“We have to stop having coral biologists trying to stop this problem with PVC pipe and zip ties the way they’ve done it for a long time,” Moore said. “We have to challenge the assumption that coral-reef restoration has to be performed by snorkelers and scuba divers.”

PROMOTED
Even if human divers improved their efficiency tenfold, it wouldn’t be enough to halt the collapse of reef ecosystems, he said.
“We need to harness the power of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence to allow us to work at the scales that will be necessary to truly address this global challenge. Those solutions will not be available overnight, but we need to start inventing them now so that they’re available when we need them, while at the same time working hard with the tools that we have available today to make the change that we can make and begin to stabilize the system.”
Moore has his eye on the underwater robotics technology used by the offshore oil and gas industry. It involves heavy equipment operating at great depths and would have to be modified, he said, to work closer to the surface with delicate corals.

“A lot of these pieces are out there but they’re not being focused in this particular way,” Moore said.
“This is why I believe all the tech exists to solve this problem, it’s literally just a matter of getting all the right people in the right place at the same time,” he said.

“As you can imagine, doing those on the reef is going to be really complicated. You’ve got to have an underwater robot that’s able to navigate in and around coral heads, make a decision using AI to kind of put something in one place or another. ”
To do that, NOAA may host competitions for innovators to propose coral restoration technologies.
“Those of us who have looked closely firmly believe that the tech exists to solve the problem,” Moore said. “The challenge is huge, the goal is audacious, but saving coral reefs might just help to save the world.”Robotic engineer Tobias Kaupp prepares to launch a new robot submarine into Sydney Harbour, which is ...
