Launching in autumn 2020/21, the degree will be one of the first online courses that focuses on Machine Learning and its applications.
The degree, developed in partnership with the online education platform Coursera, will teach students in the computational, mathematical and statistical foundations of Machine Learning.Students will also have the opportunity to work with industry-standard tools like PySpark and PyTorch to develop and apply their Machine Learning and data science skills. Over the coming year a number of specialisation courses will be released which will give students the opportunity to explore these areas.
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms that computer systems use to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead1. It is seen as being closely related to Artificial Intelligence and has a number of applications in products and services used in daily life. 
""[We are] equip[ping] the data scientists and Machine Learning specialists we train with the skills to ethically apply these techniques to their future work."" Professor Niall Adams Department of Mathematics
Professor Niall Adams, one of the course leaders for the new degree, said: ""The degree integrates training in ethics and the limitations of Machine Learning in order to equip the data scientists and Machine Learning specialists we train with the skills to ethically apply these techniques to their future work. ""This is a rigorous programme with a deep focus on the foundations of Machine Learning; applicants should have an undergraduate degree in a subject such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics, or physics.""
Imperial's Machine Learning heritage
The College is world-renowned for its AI and Machine Learning expertise. One of the first high-level programming languages, Autocode, was invented at Imperial, and the university has more than 600 people working in areas related to AI.
Imperial's alumni are also having a big impact in the world of AI, with one start-up, Improbable, recently valued at $1billion. Alum, Peter Lipka (MEng, Computing 2011) founded the company which uses cloud-based distributed computing to enable the creation of virtual worlds for use in games and massive scale simulations of the real world.In April 2018 the College's reputation was confirmed by the decision by the UK government to launch its £1bn artificial intelligence fund on the campus. The deal, announced by Business Secretary Greg Clark and then Digital Secretary Matt Hancock, will fund 1,000 new government AI PhDs to keep the UK at the forefront of innovation and build the UK’s status as an AI research hotspot.
Talent shortage
There is an enormous demand for AI professionals globally, with the sector estimated to contribute £630bn of value to the UK economy alone by 2035. The next generation of Machine Learning and AI leaders will have to be prepared not only to exploit these opportunities, but also to grapple with a number of global challenges. 

Gideon Shimshon

""AI and Machine Learning are rapidly growing sectors. Through this new online Masters we are helping to train, at scale, the future workforce of highly skilled workers and researchers.” said Gideon Shimshon, Director of Imperial's Digital Learning Hub. “We are providing a flexible learning experience that enables people from all over the world to access content that otherwise would only be available to a few who can reach our campus.”
Delivering digital
“Degrees continue to be the most valuable credential in today’s job market, and this new program provides learners with critical machine learning skills businesses all over the world want to leverage."" Jeff Maggioncalda CEO, Coursera
The degrees Imperial is offering on Coursera provide students with flexible learning options. The MSc in Machine Learning is module-based, allowing learners to start by studying individual courses that can count toward their degree upon acceptance to the full program.“Degrees continue to be the most valuable credential in today’s job market, and this new program provides learners with critical machine learning skills businesses all over the world want to leverage,” said Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera. “We’re thrilled to partner with Imperial College London, a world-renowned university with a reputation for excellence in teaching and research, to offer a flexible degree program that will open doors for learners everywhere.”

As we approach the third anniversary of Panama Papers, the gigantic financial leak that brought down two governments and drilled the biggest hole yet to tax haven secrecy, I often wonder what stories we missed.
Panama Papers provided an inspiring example of media collaboration across borders and using open-source technology at the service of reporting. As one of my colleagues put it: “You basically had a gargantuan and messy amount of data in your hands and you used technology to distribute your problem — to make it everybody’s problem.” He was referring to the 400 journalists, including himself, who for more than a year worked together in a virtual newsroom to unravel the mysteries hidden in the trove of documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
Those reporters used open-source data mining technology and graph databases to wrestle 11.5 million documents in dozens of different formats to the ground. Still, the ones doing the great majority of the thinking in that equation were the journalists. Technology helped us organize, index, filter and make the data searchable. Everything else came down to what those 400 brains collectively knew and understood about the characters and the schemes, the straw men, the front companies and the banks that were involved in the secret offshore world.
If you think about it, it was still a highly manual and time-consuming process. Reporters had to type their searches one by one in a Google-like platform based on what they knew.

            How ICIJ deals with massive data leaks like the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers
          
 Jul 03, 2018 






What about what they didn’t know?
Fast-forward three years to the booming world of machine learning algorithms that are changing the way humans work, from farming to medicine to the business of war. Computers learn what we know and then help us find unforeseen patterns and anticipate events in ways that would be impossible for us to do on our own.
What would our research look like if we were to deploy machine learning algorithms on the Panama Papers? Can we teach computers to recognize money laundering? Can an algorithm differentiate a legitimate loan from a fake one designed to shuffle money among entities? Could we use facial recognition to more easily pinpoint which of the thousands of passport copies in the trove belong to elected politicians or known criminals?
The answer to all of that is yes. The bigger question is how might we democratize those AI technologies, today largely controlled by Google, Facebook, IBM and a handful of other large companies and governments, and fully integrate them into the investigative reporting process in newsrooms of all sizes?
One way is through partnerships with universities. I came to Stanford last fall on a John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship to study how artificial intelligence can enhance investigative reporting so we can uncover wrongdoing and corruption more efficiently.
Democratizing Artificial Intelligence
My research led me to Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and more specifically to the lab of Prof. Chris Ré, a MacArthur genius grant recipient whose team has been producing cutting-edge research on a subset of machine learning techniques called “weak supervision.” The lab’s goal is to “make it faster and easier to inject what a human knows about the world into a machine learning model,” explains Alex Ratner, a Ph.D. student who leads the lab’s open source weak supervision project, called Snorkel.
The predominant machine learning approach today is supervised learning, in which humans spend months or years hand-labeling millions of data points individually so computers can learn to predict events. For example, to train a machine learning model to predict whether a chest X-ray is abnormal or not, a radiologist might hand-label tens of thousands of radiographs as “normal” or “abnormal.”
The goal of Snorkel, and weak supervision techniques more broadly, is to let ‘domain experts’ (in our case, journalists) train machine learning models using functions or rules that automatically label data instead of the tedious and costly process of labeling by hand. Something along the lines of: “If you encounter problem x, tackle it this way.” (Here’s a technical description of Snorkel).
“We aim to democratize and speed up machine learning,” Ratner said when we first met last fall, which immediately got me thinking about the possible applications to investigative reporting. If Snorkel can help doctors quickly extract knowledge from troves of x-rays and CT scans to triage patients in a way that makes sense — rather than patients languishing in queue — it can likely also help journalists find leads and prioritize stories in Panama Papers-like situations.

Ratner also told me that he wasn’t interested in “needlessly fancy” solutions. He aims for the fastest and simplest way to solve each problem.
In early January, my newsroom, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and Re’s Stanford lab launched a collaboration that seeks to enhance the investigative reporting process. To honor the “nothing needlessly fancy” principle, we call it Machine Learning for Investigations.
For journalists, the appeal of collaborating with academics is twofold: access to tools and techniques that can aid our reporting, and the absence of commercial purpose in the university setting. For academics, the appeal is the “real world” problems and datasets journalists bring to the table and, potentially, new technical challenges.
Here are lessons we learned so far in our partnership:
Pick an AI lab with “real world” applications track record.
Chris Ré’s lab, for example, is part of a consortium of government and private sector organizations that developed a set of tools designed to “light up” the Dark Web. Using machine learning, law enforcement agencies were able to extract and visualize information — sometimes hidden inside images — that helped them go after human trafficking networks that thrive in the Internet. Searching the Panama Papers is not that different from searching the depths of the Dark Web. We have a lot to learn from the lab’s previous work.
Make sure there are incentives on both sides.
There are many civic-minded AI scientists concerned about the state of democracy who would like to help journalists do world-changing reporting. But for a partnership to last and be productive, it helps if there is a technical challenge academics can tackle, and if the data can be reproduced and published in an academic setting. Sort out early in the relationship if there’s goal alignment and what the trade-offs are. For us, it meant focusing first on a public data medical investigation because it fit well with research Ré’s lab was already doing to help doctors anticipate when a medical device might fail. The partnership is helping us build on the machine learning work the ICIJ team did last year for the award-winning Implant Files investigation, which exposed gross lack of regulation of medical devices worldwide.
Choose useful, not fancy.
There are problems for which we don’t need machine learning at all. So how do we know when AI is the right choice? John Keefe, who leads Quartz AI Studio, says machine learning can help journalists in situations where they know what information they are looking for in large amounts of documents but finding it would take too long or would be too hard. Take the examples of Buzzfeed News’ 2017 spy planes investigation in which a machine learning algorithm was deployed on flight-tracking data to identify surveillance aircraft (here the computer had been taught the turning rates, speed and altitude patterns of spy planes), or the Atlanta Journal Constitution probe on doctors’ sexual harassment, in which a computer algorithm helped identify cases of sexual abuse in more than 100,000 disciplinary documents. I am also fascinated by the work of Ukrainian data journalism agency Texty, which used machine learning to uncover illegal sites of amber mining through the analysis of 450,000 satellite images.
‘Reporter in the loop’ all the way through.
If you are using machine learning in your investigation, make sure to get buy in from reporters and editors involved in the project. You may find resistance because newsroom AI literacy is still quite low. At ICIJ, research editor Emilia Diaz-Struck has been the “AI translator” for our newsroom, helping journalists understand why and when we may choose to use machine learning. “The bottom line is that we use it to solve journalistic problems that otherwise wouldn’t get solved,” she says. Reporters play a big role in the AI process because they are the ‘domain experts’ that the computer needs to learn from — the equivalent to the radiologist who trains a model to recognize different levels of malignancy in a tumor. In the Implant Files investigation, reporters helped train a machine learning algorithm to systematically identify death reports that were misclassified as injuries and malfunctions, a trend first spotted by a source who tipped the journalists.
It’s not magic!
The computer is augmenting the work of a journalist not replacing it. The AJC team read all the documents associated to the more than 6,000 doctor sex abuse cases it found using machine learning. ICIJ fact-checkers manually reviewed each of the 2,100 deaths the algorithm uncovered. “The journalism doesn’t stop, it just gets a hop,” says Keefe. His team at Quartz recently received a grant from the Knight Foundation to partner with newsrooms on machine learning investigations.
Share the experience so others can learn. In this area, journalists have much to learn from the academic tradition of building on one another’s knowledge and openly sharing results, both good and bad. “Failure is an important signal for researchers,” says Ratner. “When we work on a project that fails, as embarrassing as it is, that’s often what kicks off multiyear research projects. In these collaborations, failure is something that should be tracked and measured and reported.”
So yes, you will be hearing from us either way!
There’s a ton of serendipity that can happen when two different worlds come together to tackle a problem. ICIJ’s data team has now started to collaborate with another part of Ré’s lab that specializes in extracting meaning and relationships from text that is “trapped” in tables and other strange formats (think SEC documents or head-spinning charts from ICIJ’s Luxembourg Leaks project).
The lab is also working on other more futuristic applications, such as capturing natural language explanations from domain experts that can be used to train AI models (It’s appropriately called Babble Labble) or tracing radiologists’ eyes when they read a study to see if those signals can also help train algorithms.
Perhaps one day, not too far in the future, my ICIJ colleague Will Fitzgibbon will use Babble Labble to talk the computer’s ear off about his knowledge of money laundering. And we will trace my colleague Simon Bowers’ eyes when he interprets those impossible, multi-step charts that, when unlocked, reveal the schemes multinational companies use to avoid paying taxes.
In the meantime, we stay real. Nothing needlessly fancy.

Part of the series “Supporting Today’s Workforce”

In my work as a career, executive and leadership coach for women, we often engage in the process of developing stronger resumes and LinkedIn profiles that stand out, as well as identify strategies for networking and applying for top-level roles that represent significant advancement and growth.


A question that frequently comes up has to do with the role of artificial intelligence in screening resumes, and how candidates can craft a winning a resume that will pass the bots and the system and get into human hands.

To learn more about this, I caught up with Dr. Jon Christiansen, the Chief Intelligence Officer of Sparks Research, a company that conducts primary market research and business intelligence to help executives make data-driven decisions in all areas of their business models, from hiring and onboarding, to customer service and product pricing.

PROMOTED
Christiansen serves Fortune 500 firms in the Banking, Automotive, Retail, Healthcare, and Energy industries, to name a few. He was trained in Computational Analytics at Carnegie Mellon, and holds both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Economics, and a PhD in Higher Education from Clemson University. Christiansen is also certified as a Senior Professional of Human Resources (SPHR) and a SHRM Senior Certified Professional (SHRM-SCP).
Here’s what Christiansen shares on writing your resume so that it passes the AI test with flying colors:
Kathy Caprino: Jon, how exactly do recruitment and screening algorithms work?

Jon Christiansen: Very similar to how SEO works for websites, Application Trackers and like programs use natural language processing to sift through resumes. Doing this, a program can score a resume according to a candidate’s fit for the job. The program does so largely by searching for keywords and linked phrases within the resume itself.

You will often find these keywords within the job posting. These keywords are usually the knowledge, skills and abilities a company is looking for in the ideal candidate, and often include the duties of the job. Most commonly, the most important keywords are found within the job description.

The reason for that is that HR folks are trained to defer to the job description in determining which candidates are qualified for an open position. The algorithm will sift through resumes to find matches within a resume to match against the keywords in the job description. Then, the program will look for job specifications (often called ""requirements,"" although these are often not ""required) - the qualifications necessary to be able to perform the job. This is experience, training, education, licenses and certifications. Obviously, if you are applying for a job as a CPA, you want to say you have a CPA license or certificate. If a firm is looking for a CPA with experience in working with small businesses, you want to emphasize your experience here.
From here, a program commonly scores a resume according to the number or percent of matches within the resume and will rank candidates according to match. Often, hiring managers can emphasize an order of magnitude for knowledge, skills, and abilities. So, one skill might have a greater weight in whether a candidate is a fit for the job.
Additionally, the more sophisticated programs out there can actually use the dates from a job in a resume and calculate the length in the role. So, if it wants four to six years, that program will do the calculation to see how close a candidate is to that window of experience.
Caprino: What does it mean to “algorithm optimize” your resume?
Christiansen: Just as I mentioned how the program works in searching for keywords and phrases, a candidate will want to write a resume tailored to the job itself. Ensuring the resume contains the terms that are showing up in the job description, specs and competencies. Make sure a resume hits on these keyword items.
Does the company want an individual highly competent in a specific software? Make sure to have a section that speaks to that. In my industry, there tend to be very specific skill sets within a skill cluster (multiple regression, econometric modeling, cluster analysis, etc.). They could roll these up and call them ""statistical modeling,"" but they don't, because they know these are the core important techniques. So a candidate will want to match this tit-for-tat. You’ll want to say, ""Experience in statistical modeling, specifically in____ (insert the specific ones you asked for).""
Caprino: Where are the keyword clues most often found in an online job posting?
Christiansen: There are a few things to look for. The first is the surface-level attributes, which are usually found in the job requirements. Usually the length of experience (which often includes a specific emphasis of experience), educational background desired, licenses, and other related skills. This usually shows up in the Job Specifications/Job Requirements. These are usually more observable, measurable items about a candidate. I can tell you I have a degree in Economics. It's hanging on my wall. You can call Clemson University and verify it. But you can't easily measure how I have lead teams or managed complex processes.
The next key clue is the background - does the candidates background match what we are looking for? Have they demonstrated an ability to write surveys, conduct analysis, report to senior management, etc.?
Third, there tend to be skills that are less tangible, but are highly important. Things like ""people management,"" ""project coordination,"" or other phrases that suggest something about an ability to execute a task. A job description might say they want a candidate to ""manage a project from initiation through completion."" So you want to hit on how you have produced work from end to end. More sophisticated programs will have different ways of linking text to determine this is what is being communicated.
Finally, there is some level of expressed magnitude for a skill or task. This usually shows up in the form of adverbs or adjectives - some emphasis on the desire for a skill, ability, or experience. An adjective might be terms like ""significant,"" ""strong,"" or ""compelling."" An adverb might be ""successfully,"" ""effectively,"" or ""efficiently."" This also shows up in emphasized nouns, like ""mastery,"" ""proficiency,"" or ""competency.""
Caprino: Cover letters: how important are they nowadays?
Christiansen: Highly. The job of a smart resume is to speak to the job description, job requirements, etc. The cover letter is often the product that a hiring manager will see once a candidate gets past the screening process.
The cover letter is the opportunity to speak to the job in more intimate detail in ways a resume cannot. A candidate can speak to those intangibles through experiences and stories. And speak to why he or she is a fit for the company. It is an opportunity to speak directly to the hiring manager, get noticed, and is often the key talking points when folks get in a room and decide who to bring in for an interview.
Some companies use algorithms to sift through cover letters, but the algorithms tend to be more open ended. It is less about keywords and more about sentiment, enthusiasm, and some sort of fit characteristics. These are rare, however, because a good hiring manager is going to want to see the cover letters of the top leading candidates.
Caprino: In your experience, what’s the biggest mistake job seekers make when submitting their resume digitally?
Christiansen: The first mistake is the obvious one: sending a generic resume that does not speak to the specific job. Sending out the same generic resume is a sure way to get called by a bunch of jobs that are just looking for warm bodies. Not exactly the ideal job. In terms of passing the AI test, candidates that go too far against the grain on a resume will make an algorithm throw up. Any artwork or images won't do well with a computational model. Unique fonts, while cool, won't translate well in the machine. A candidate will want to use a pretty standard template when formatting a resume. Use bullets and indention instead of tables.
Also, keep in mind that many job postings are written and search for more generalizable terms. Having a bachelor's degree that sounds unique or a job title that was a bit creative (""Brand Guru"") won't do well passing the AI test. Candidates can go on to O*Net (www.onetonline.com) and search for their job title. If the job title isn't listed anywhere, consider whether to use it. You can find one similar to use, and in doing so, make sure to open the job and check the summary report to make sure it works.
Lastly, a candidate’s LinkedIn page is becoming increasingly important, and should be consistent with the resume. If someone in HR or the hiring manager sees two different looks in a candidate, it's a red flag.
Caprino: Are there are any red flags you’d highlight for job candidates when looking through a job posting?
Christiansen: When looking at a job posting, you need to read it as if this came directly from the individual you would be reporting to. If it doesn't, then you might not want to go down that road. It's a red flag for you. A company that doesn't put thought into a job posting likely doesn't have the culture to care about that job.
If a job is seeking certain criteria that seems off, it probably is. For example, I just pulled up a job posting in a field similar to mine, and the job wanted a candidate with a bachelor's degree in marketing research. In looking into the degree, one doesn't even exist. This tells me the hiring manager doesn't really have a lot of experience in the field, or let HR come up with the job posting on their own, and they got it wrong.
Caprino: Any final thoughts for job seekers?
Christiansen: To all those job seekers out there, don't get discouraged if you don't meet all the requirements. As I noted, these are often not ""requirements"" as much as they are preferences. The key is to look at the job description. If you look at it, and it fits you, then you can do that job. It doesn't matter if they'd like a college degree and five years of experience. Companies rarely get everything they want out of a candidate, so if you don't have 100%, that's OK.
Use your cover letter as an argument for why you would fit. If you don't fit the observable traits, use your cover letter to tell that hiring manager how you would be a great fit for their team, the company, and an active part of their culture. Often, postings will include details about why that company exists. Speak to how you could be an asset to making the company's heartbeat. I've known folks in my field with two years of experience that is the equivalent of ten and others with twenty years experience doing the same thing for the last fifteen. Which one would you want to hire?

AI:  MORE THAN HUMAN



This interactive Barbican exhibition will explore the terrifying and beautiful relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.

“Alexa, play Auld Lang Syne.” An annual joke amongst me and my group of friends when one New Year’s Eve descended into madness as we shouted endless song requests into the virtual assistant pod when a pal was gifted  it for Christmas.
There’s no denying it. Technology’s presence and intervention in our day-to-day lives is becoming so increasingly commonplace, and shows like Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror only serve to heighten our fears and insecurities at our increasing reliance on tech.
And when it comes to artificial intelligence, there is an endless wealth of fear propaganda, sensationalised by that iconic impossible-to-extinguish red eye on Arnie in the Terminator films.
And now, this May, the Barbican in London will be opening its doors to a major new exhibition: AI: More than Human, which will look at the evolving relationship between humans and technology.
Telling the rapidly developing story of AI, the exhibition will include immersive installations, allowing visitors to directly interact while exploring what it means to be human, as well as other themes such as consciousness and dependancy.
One of the contributors is Matt Pyke of Universal Everything, whose studio’s previous projects have included virtual reality,  “weather installations” at fashion shows (giving the appearance of a snow storm whipping around models at Christopher Raeburn), digital sculptures, and even 360° wall projections (where a monster stomps around the room).
For the Barbican, he has created a large-scale installation where your reflection learns from your movements, eventually evolving in front of you. Terrifying stuff.
We talked to Matt about Stanley Kubrick, human behaviour and how his work has brought about emotive responses…

How would you describe your work?
The studio is a digital art and design collective, creating original artworks and brand collaborations. Our work spans video, sound, installation and architecture.
Can you explain how your interest in AI came about?
Growing up in the 1980s, “What are you doing Dave?” from Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey was a recurring phrase in my head.
How did you start your career?
I started as a graphic designer for the music industry, during the birth of the electronic music scene, designing sleeves for Warp Records and directing music videos. I started my own studio Universal Everything in 2004 to pursue self-initiated projects and design commissions for the emerging display technologies of the time, from mobile to architectural video walls. Now we are a collective which evolves from 3 people to 30 people depending on the ambition of the project.
Which installation are you bringing to this Barbican exhibition, or have you created something new?
We are bringing a new interactive installation called “Future You.” You are faced with a unique reflection of your potential, synthetic self. Starting as a primitive form, it learns from your movements to adapt and evolve, suggesting an agile, superior version of you. This artwork evolves, creating a new visual response for each visitor.
Alongside that we are screening Machine Learning, a series of futurist films exploring human-machine collaboration through performance and emerging technologies. It builds on the studio’s past experiments with motion studies, and asks: when will machines achieve human agility? 
What’s your favourite piece and why?
The favourite work is always our newest; we are striving to make something new and never seen before, everyday.
On your website it says Universal Everything is a “study of human behaviour on a mass scale” – what interests you about this?
We are interested in how the human and living forms can be represented through the eyes of today’s technology – from the movement of a single figure tracked using motion capture, to a simulation of a crowd of thousands revealing collective patterns of human behaviour.

You’ve used dance performances and botanical influences in your art – can you talk about this?
We strive to find links between mathematics and nature, between figurative and abstract form, and creating emotional technological experiences with a soul.
Your audience’s participation is actually needed to make your art work – what interests you about this symbiosis?
We love the idea that the work would not exist without the presence of the visitor. They become part of the experience, unique to each person.
How do you want people to feel when they come away from your exhibitions?
That they have witnessed a possible future.
What’s the best or most interesting piece of feedback you’ve had about your art?
At our current digital installation “Vehicle of Nature,” part of the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition, a digital river flows across the floor of the gallery. A mother who was visiting with her autistic child told me the installation had inspired him to speak for the first time in months.
Why do you think our interest with AI has increased so much in the recent past years?
AI is becoming visible in our everyday lives, thanks to Alexa, Siri, OK Google and Cortana. Now we have a human-like relationship we can see the flaws, inadequacies and future potential of AI firsthand.
How do you feel about people vilifying AI or lauding it as the future?
Perhaps it is history repeating itself. People naturally fear the new and the unknown – from luddites reacting to the industrial revolution 
What’s next for you? What are you working on next?
We are developing some large scale video art for public screens which evolve every minute, every day – always reinventing itself, forever.
AI: More than Human will run between 16 May—26 Aug 2019 at The Curve at Barbican. Find out more here.

But Ott Velsberg might change your mind. As Estonia's chief data officer, the 28-year-old graduate student is overseeing the tiny Baltic nation's push to insert artificial intelligence and machine learning into services provided to its 1.3 million citizens.""We want the government to be as lean as possible,"" says the wiry, bespectacled Velsberg, an Estonian who is writing his PhD thesis at Sweden’s Umeå University on using the Internet of Things and sensor data in government services. Estonia's government hired Velsberg last August to run a new project to introduce AI into various ministries to streamline services offered to residents.Deploying AI is crucial, he says. “Some people worry that if we lower the number of civil employees, the quality of service will suffer. But the AI agent will help us."" About 22 percent of Estonians work for the government; that’s about average for European countries, but higher than the 18 percent rate in the US.Trending NowWIRED25: Sebastian Thrun & Sam Altman Talk Flying Vehicles and Artificial IntelligenceSiim Sikkut, Estonia’s chief information officer, began piloting several AI-based projects at agencies in 2017, before hiring Velsberg last year. Velsberg says Estonia has deployed AI or machine learning in 13 places where an algorithm has replaced government workers.For example, inspectors no longer check on farmers who receive government subsidies to cut their hay fields each summer. Satellite images taken by the European Space Agency each week from May to October are fed into a deep-learning algorithm originally developed by the Tartu Observatory. The images are overlaid onto a map of fields where farmers receive the hay-cutting subsidies to prevent them from turning forests over time.The algorithm assesses each pixel in the images, determining if the patch of the field has been cut or not. Cattle grazing or partial cutting can throw off the image processing; in those cases, an inspector still drives out to check. Two weeks before the mowing deadline, the automated system notifies farmers via text or email that includes a link to the satellite image of their field. The system saved €665,000 ($755,000) in its first year because inspectors made fewer site visits and focused on other enforcement actions, according to Velsberg.AdvertisementIn another application, resumes of laid-off workers are fed into a machine learning system that matches their skills with employers. About 72 percent of workers who gain a new job through the system are still on the job after six months, up from 58 percent before the computer-matching system was deployed. In a third case, children born in Estonia are automatically enrolled in local schools at birth, so parents don't have to sign up on waiting lists or call school administrators. That’s because hospital records are automatically shared with local schools. The system doesn’t truly require AI, but it shows how automated services are expanding.In the most ambitious project to date, the Estonian Ministry of Justice has asked Velsberg and his team to design a “robot judge” that could adjudicate small claims disputes of less than €7,000 (about $8,000). Officials hope the system can clear a backlog of cases for judges and court clerks.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe project is in its early phases and will likely start later this year with a pilot focusing on contract disputes. In concept, the two parties will upload documents and other relevant information, and the AI will issue a decision that can be appealed to a human judge. Many details are still to be worked out. Velsberg says the system might have to be adjusted after feedback from lawyers and judges.Estonia’s effort isn’t the first to mix AI and the law, though it may be the first to give an algorithm decision-making authority. In the US, algorithms help recommend criminal sentences in some states. The UK-based DoNotPay AI-driven chatbot overturned 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York a few years ago. A Tallinn-based law firm, Eesti Oigusbüroo, provides free legal aid through a chatbot and generates simple legal documents to send to collection agencies. It plans to expand its “Hugo-AI” legal aid service matching clients and lawyers to Warsaw and Los Angeles by the end of the year, said CEO Artur Fjodorov.The idea of a robot judge might work in Estonia partly because its 1.3 million residents already use a national ID card and are used to an online menu of services such as e-voting and digital tax filing.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceGovernment databases connect with each other through something called the X-road, a digital infrastructure that makes data sharing easier. Estonian residents can also check who has been accessing their information by logging into a government digital portal.Estonia’s well-documented move to digital government services hasn’t been without at least one glitch. Outside experts revealed a vulnerability in Estonia's ID system in 2017 that led to some embarrassment; it was fixed and the ID cards replaced.

Estonia Thinks So'}]","""We want the government to be as lean as possible,"" says the wiry, bespectacled Velsberg, an Estonian who is writing his PhD thesis at Sweden’s Umeå University on using the Internet of Things and sensor data in government services. Estonia's government hired Velsberg last August to run a new project to introduce AI into various ministries to streamline services offered to residents.
Deploying AI is crucial, he says. “Some people worry that if we lower the number of civil employees, the quality of service will suffer. But the AI agent will help us."" About 22 percent of Estonians work for the government; that’s about average for European countries, but higher than the 18 percent rate in the US.
Siim Sikkut, Estonia’s chief information officer, began piloting several AI-based projects at agencies in 2017, before hiring Velsberg last year. Velsberg says Estonia has deployed AI or machine learning in 13 places where an algorithm has replaced government workers.
For example, inspectors no longer check on farmers who receive government subsidies to cut their hay fields each summer. Satellite images taken by the European Space Agency each week from May to October are fed into a deep-learning algorithm originally developed by the Tartu Observatory. The images are overlaid onto a map of fields where farmers receive the hay-cutting subsidies to prevent them from turning forests over time.
The algorithm assesses each pixel in the images, determining if the patch of the field has been cut or not. Cattle grazing or partial cutting can throw off the image processing; in those cases, an inspector still drives out to check. Two weeks before the mowing deadline, the automated system notifies farmers via text or email that includes a link to the satellite image of their field. The system saved €665,000 ($755,000) in its first year because inspectors made fewer site visits and focused on other enforcement actions, according to Velsberg.
In another application, resumes of laid-off workers are fed into a machine learning system that matches their skills with employers. About 72 percent of workers who gain a new job through the system are still on the job after six months, up from 58 percent before the computer-matching system was deployed. In a third case, children born in Estonia are automatically enrolled in local schools at birth, so parents don't have to sign up on waiting lists or call school administrators. That’s because hospital records are automatically shared with local schools. The system doesn’t truly require AI, but it shows how automated services are expanding.
In the most ambitious project to date, the Estonian Ministry of Justice has asked Velsberg and his team to design a “robot judge” that could adjudicate small claims disputes of less than €7,000 (about $8,000). Officials hope the system can clear a backlog of cases for judges and court clerks.
The project is in its early phases and will likely start later this year with a pilot focusing on contract disputes. In concept, the two parties will upload documents and other relevant information, and the AI will issue a decision that can be appealed to a human judge. Many details are still to be worked out. Velsberg says the system might have to be adjusted after feedback from lawyers and judges.
Estonia’s effort isn’t the first to mix AI and the law, though it may be the first to give an algorithm decision-making authority. In the US, algorithms help recommend criminal sentences in some states. The UK-based DoNotPay AI-driven chatbot overturned 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York a few years ago. A Tallinn-based law firm, Eesti Oigusbüroo, provides free legal aid through a chatbot and generates simple legal documents to send to collection agencies. It plans to expand its “Hugo-AI” legal aid service matching clients and lawyers to Warsaw and Los Angeles by the end of the year, said CEO Artur Fjodorov.
The idea of a robot judge might work in Estonia partly because its 1.3 million residents already use a national ID card and are used to an online menu of services such as e-voting and digital tax filing.
Government databases connect with each other through something called the X-road, a digital infrastructure that makes data sharing easier. Estonian residents can also check who has been accessing their information by logging into a government digital portal.
Estonia’s well-documented move to digital government services hasn’t been without at least one glitch. Outside experts revealed a vulnerability in Estonia's ID system in 2017 that led to some embarrassment; it was fixed and the ID cards replaced. But government officials say the country hasn't had a major data breach or theft since it began its digital drive in the early 2000s. In 2016, more than two-thirds of Estonian adults filed government forms on the internet, almost twice the European average.
“The really private and confidential things are not in the hands of government, but banks and telecoms,” says Tanel Tammet, a professor of computer science at Tallinn University of Technology. Tammet is a member of an Estonian government AI task force that will report its findings in May and suggest an additional 35 AI-related demonstration projects by 2020.
Stanford University’s David Engstrom, an expert in digital governance, says Estonian citizens might trust the government's use of their digital data today, but things might change if one of the new AI-based decision-making systems goes awry.

The ancestors of modern birds were the sole survivors of one of the most severe mass extinction events in the history of the world. Today, 10,000 known bird species exist, all of them the descendants of dinosaurs. Polar adaptations, seed-based diets and even nest designs may have played roles in determining who lived and who died. 
In the fourth industrial revolution era, enterprises and human workers are equally at risk of becoming extinct. This time, being proactive is essential and adaptability is the answer.

      Fourth industrial revolution: sorting out the real from the unreal




Stemming from my work on transforming passive bystanders into agents of change, I propose that understanding one’s own behaviours is key to adapting in the AI era.
Adapting to an AI era
The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has started. The technology is maturing very rapidly. The question is no longer whether we use the technologies or not, but rather how to better collaborate with them.
Ambient technologies, such as Siri, Alexa or Cortana, are integrating seamlessly in our interactions. We walk into a room and interact with them to turn on the light, play a song, change the room temperature, keep track of a shopping list, book a ride to the airport or be reminded to take the right medication at the right time.
And this is only the beginning.
Emotion AI works on teaching robots how to feel empathy. Google AI stories are about how AI is helping people solve problems. Experts race to predict how we will be living with AI in the near future. 
More-than-human work
Disruptive technologies are advancing, demographics are shifting, customers are gaining power and the gig economy and global talent markets are rising. This is shaping the future of work in all fields including education, cybersecurity, delivery, coaching, management, marketing and sales, health care, music and agriculture.
Human+ workers are individuals who work alongside machines to reach collaborative intelligence. They consolidate their individual knowledge, skills and experience with a set of tech-driven capabilities to enhance their performance.
Adaptability training
“Adapt or die” is a business mantra, and the adaptability of a workplace’s employees is their key to the future where many of the tasks cannot be imagined yet.
The next generation of employees will need to be trained as humans+ before they enter the job market, and the existing workforce will require continuous reskilling and upskilling. 
Little has been done to reimagine the training and reskilling needed for the future workplace. This said, similar to creativity (another in-demand soft skill) there is more to adaptability than meets the eye. 


Organizations and the future of work (Singularity University)

Adaptability is the capacity to adjust to new conditions and to thrive in new environments. 
To adapt is a performance that goes beyond knowledge and skills. It requires an attitudinal change that will only happen if we revise our constructs, consider new perspectives and start to perceive technology as augmenting our own capabilities instead of replacing them.
Human vs. machine
Many associate AI with science fiction stories such as the Terminator franchise or Isaac Asimov’s Robot series, where technology’s prime goal is to control or even exterminate human existence. 
Others are influenced by worldwide experts who relentlessly warn against AI and technological domination. Tesla founder Elon Musk has said on several occasions that AI is more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that it can become an immortal dictator.
Technology has eliminated jobs in the past and will eliminate others in the near future.

      How to prevent the 'robot apocalypse' from ending labor as we know it




New jobs will require the current workforce to commit to lifelong learning.
Besides, AI’s ethical problems are yet to be addressed, and establishing an AI code of ethics is complicated. Since its inception in 2017, 1,130 citizens and 28 organizations have signed the Montréal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence, a commitment to the socially responsible development and implementation of AI that serves and benefits society.
Empathetic evolution
So can dinosaurs adapt? I say they can, but it will take an empathetic village. 
Enterprises that expect their workforce to be ready for the future of work must learn fast. They must adopt a proactive mindset and support their employees in their quest to belong to the future workplace. Mostly, they need to understand where resistance to change comes from in order to address it.


How can organizations prepare for the future of work?

At the same time, enterprises need to close the digital divide between themselves and their workforces. Most importantly, they need to find ways to keep their people employed. The fear of being replaced can reinforce human dinosaurs’ unwillingness to change.
Team dynamics should function in an empathetic way to facilitate human/human and human/machine collaborations and to support individual members in their adaptation process.
On an individual level, we need to develop our mental and emotional capacity and our knowledge and skills to embrace the human+ identity and attitude. And last, we need to want to adapt, which requires a change in how we view the world. Once we identify, analyze and address the core of our resistance to change, we can move to strategies to equip and empower us to deal with uncertainties and actively experiment with new possibilities.
To adapt, training to develop knowledge and skills are necessary but will not be enough. An empathetic and supportive environment and learning about oneself are also important.

It portrays a gigantic robot who has assumed monarchy and now carries the earth as its orb and poses with its sceptre. It grins as the humans who had created it are now at its mercy. Adjacent to it stands a helpless, suited up human (symbolic of an unscrupulous businessman who had once mindlessly empowered the artificially intelligent robot and in his quest of wealth, didn’t know where to stop). He now sticks his tongue out and sheds a tear as he regrets his thoughtless actions.Doodle courtesy: Ujjaini Basu)The term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI) was coined by John McCarthy to define the theory and development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks which normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making and translation between languages. Much of the early development of AI could be attributed to the theory that all intelligent behaviour was the result of feedback mechanisms which could possibly be simulated by machines.This led to the emergence of the question, “Can a machine think?” whose affirmative answer led to the formation of the underlying principle of AI.Post this revelation, mankind saw the birth of self-learning systems that could efficiently solve problems which required the collection of huge sums of information, too cumbersome to be processed by humans. This development lured business men and industry experts into making AI an indispensable part of their fields of work as they employed it to reduce manual labour intensive jobs, thereby cutting costs and reaping huge profits. But trouble arose in Paradise when humans started succumbing to gluttony and greed. They didn’t know where to draw the line.Empowering artificially intelligent bots/robots to think and behave like a human could prove to be detrimental to the society for human thinking is often influenced by emotions, triggered by experiences, and rarely disinterested. One may refute this objection by urging people to look upon a robot as just another human but the problem lies with its strength and special abilities which it may use to its advantage over humans. Consider the following excerpt from a 2017 publication by the Independent, to understand the problem better:Facebook abandoned an experiment after two artificially intelligent programs appeared to be chatting to each other in a strange language only they understood. The two chatbots came to create their own changes to English that made it easier for them to work – but which remained mysterious to the humans that supposedly look after them. The robots had been instructed to work out how to negotiate between themselves, and improve their bartering as they went along. But they were not told to use comprehensible English, allowing them to create their own ""shorthand"", according to researchers. Indeed, some of the negotiations that were carried out in this bizarre language even ended up successfully concluding their negotiations, while conducting them entirely in the bizarre language.In the enchanting era of Netflix and chill, I urge every human to pause for a moment and travel back in time to the 1980’s to witness an American sci-fi sitcom, Small Wonder, named after its protagonist, a Voice Input Child Identicant (V.I.C.I). The show tells the tale of a family of a robotics engineer who clandestinely creates an android modeled after a 10-year old human girl, then tries to pass it off as his adopted daughter. The robot had been invented in an effort to assist handicapped children and was taken home by its inventor so that it could mature within a family environment. Upon close observation, the apparently comic sitcom unfolds some important traits of human behavior. Most conspicuously, it highlights a human’s tendency to find the easy way out to get his job done by over relying on machines, even if that means paralyzing his own abilities, just as how the inventor’s pre-teen son is shown to surreptitiously use the robot to get his homework done. The show also highlights that humans are prone to disillusionment as they are susceptible to bond with a robot emotionally, just as how all the members of the inventor’s family look upon the robot as a real human despite knowing the truth. The revelations made by the show decades ago hold true even to this day.The rise in demand for pleasure droids not only demonstrates the rapid withdrawal of humanity from humans but also highlights human submission to machines powered by AI. Read a horrific excerpt from a 2018 publication by The Sun to understand the gravity of the situation:MORE access to artificially intelligent sex robots could fuel a rise in sex addiction, warn psychology experts. While their creators claim they can prove a boon for struggling marriages and lonely or disabled men, experts aren’t convinced about their benefits to society at large. Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, said they serve the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.This precisely shows how unscrupulous humans are capitalising on the weaknesses of fellow humans, both parties digging their graves subconsciously!The World Health Organization reports that more than 300 million people currently live with depression, but nearly half of them aren’t getting the help they need. In such trying times, when humans, the ‘higher mammals’, are expected to reach out to each other, heal each other and uplift each other, robots are being built exclusively to render companionship. Target markets for companion robots include single children and the elderly people. Yet another fact to exemplify the submission of humans to Artificial Intelligence!While the effort to create Bandicoot, a robotic system for manhole and sewer line cleaning aimed at the complete elimination of manual scavenging from the face of earth, deserves appreciation and encouragement, the effort to create Sophia, a humanoid robot modeled after the desirable Audrey Hepburn that ended up becoming the first of its kind to attain the citizenship of a nation, doesn’t deserve the hype that it garnered. On the official website of Hanson Robotics, that created Sophia, the humanoid robot urges viewers to :“Think of me as a personification of our dreams for the future of AI, as well as a framework for advanced AI and robotics research, and an agent for exploring human-robot experience in service and entertainment applications.”It also adds:“With my science evolving so quickly, even many of my wildest fictional dreams may become reality someday soon.”Now that sounds really spooky!Artificial Intelligence is gradually wiping out the human touch. Not only labor intensive jobs but creative jobs like journalism are also under threat owing to its outreach. The vicious circle of humans programming robots to act like humans and disillusion them is eventually mechanizing humans. With the magnitude of autonomy that is being granted to robots, robots procreating robots may not be a distant phenomenon.

Two New Planets Discovered Using Artificial Intelligence

AUSTIN, Texas — Astronomers at The University of Texas at Austin, in partnership with Google, have used artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover two more hidden planets in the Kepler space telescope archive. The technique shows promise for identifying many additional planets that traditional methods could not catch.
The planets discovered this time were from Kepler’s extended mission, called K2.
To find them, the team, led by an undergraduate at UT Austin, Anne Dattilo, created an algorithm that sifts through the data taken by Kepler to ferret out signals that were missed by traditional planet-hunting methods. Long term, the process should help astronomers find many more missed planets hiding in Kepler data. The discoveries have been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of The Astronomical Journal.
Other team members include NASA Sagan fellow at UT Austin Andrew Vanderburg and Google engineer Christopher Shallue. In 2017, Vanderburg and Shallue first used AI to uncover a planet around a Kepler star — one already known to harbor seven planets. The discovery made that solar system the only one known to have as many planets as our own.
Dattilo explained that this project necessitated a new algorithm, as data taken during Kepler’s extended mission K2 differs significantly from that collected during the spacecraft’s original mission.
Reaping the benefits of attending a premiere research university, undergraduate Anne Dattilo, a senior in the Department of Astronomy, led the discovery of the new planets. (Credit: Anne Dattilo.)
“K2 data is more challenging to work with because the spacecraft is moving around all the time,” Vanderburg explained. This change came about after a mechanical failure. While mission planners found a workaround, the spacecraft was left with a wobble that AI had to take into account.
The Kepler and K2 missions have already discovered thousands of planets around other stars, with an equal number of candidates awaiting confirmation. So why do astronomers need to use AI to search the Kepler archive for more?
“AI will help us search the data set uniformly,” Vanderburg said. “Even if every star had an Earth-sized planet around it, when we look with Kepler, we won’t find all of them. That’s just because some of the data’s too noisy, or sometimes the planets are just not aligned right. So, we have to correct for the ones we missed. We know there are a lot of planets out there that we don’t see for those reasons.
“If we want to know how many planets there are in total, we have to know how many planets we’ve found, but we also have to know how many planets we missed. That’s where this comes in,” he explained.
The two planets Dattilo’s team found “are both very typical of planets found in K2,” she said. “They’re really close in to their host star, they have short orbital periods, and they’re hot. They are slightly larger than Earth.”
Of the two planets, one is called K2-293b and orbits a star 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius. The other, K2-294b, orbits a star 1,230 light-years away, also located in Aquarius.
Once the team used their algorithm to find these planets, they followed up by studying the host stars using ground-based telescopes to confirm that the planets are real. These observations were done with the 1.5-meter telescope at the Smithsonian Institution’s Whipple Observatory in Arizona and the Gillett Telescope at Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.
The future of the AI concept for finding planets hidden in data sets looks bright. The current algorithm can be used to probe the entire K2 data set, Dattilo said — approximately 300,000 stars. She also believes the method is applicable to Kepler’s successor planet-hunting mission, TESS, which launched in April 2018. Kepler’s mission ended later that year.
Dattilo plans to continue her work using AI for planet hunting when she enters graduate school in the fall.

But there's a catch, although the AI system can fool the bot test it doesn't live-up to the promise its creators give it.CAPTCHAs are the tests used by websites to battle back against bots, asking website visitors to prove they're human before proceeding. The leading system is Google's reCAPTCHA, which has previously asked website visitors to prove their humanity by checking words scanned from books or photographs of street signs. That was replaced with behavioural analysis, requiring humans to simply tick a box proclaiming ""I'm not a robot"".Such systems have been hacked before. Indeed, the text and image based CAPTCHAs have been so frequently cracked that researchers in China and Lancaster University dubbed their paper on generative adversarial networks ""Yet another text CAPTCHA solver"". The accessible audio version was even targeted using speech-to-text tools to listen to the audio clips and upload an answer.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched QuestionsBut that all got harder at the end of last year, when Google revealed a CAPTCHA-less reCAPTCHA. Rather than unpicking garbled text or street signs, or even ticking a box that a website visitor is not a robot, version 3 of reCAPTCHA analyses a range of signals, giving a score between zero and one. Lower scores are more likely to be bots, while higher scores are more likely  to be human.That ranking happens entirely in the background; there's no human interaction at all. Google hasn't explained what goes into the bot-or-not score — no surprise, as hackers would be sure to make use of that information — but it appears to include the browser used, IP address, and whether they're logged into a Google account. After all, if Google knows it's you, it knows you're not a bot.That system hasn't yet been hacked, despite the title claim of the authors of a recent paper, ""Hacking Google reCAPTCHA v3 using Reinforcement Learning."" Instead, Mohamed Akrout, of the University of Toronto, and his co-authors focused on tricking a secondary system with machine learning. The invisible scoring system isn't abused, but nevertheless they claim they could still get past reCAPTCHA v3.AdvertisementIn reCAPTCHA v3, websites set their own score threshold for what they are willing to consider a bot or not. If a visitor falls under that threshold at a set point, such as when they're entering a review or login details, the website has two options, says Akrout. The first is to immediately show a page denouncing that visitor as a bot, which is a little awkward if the system is wrong and it's a human; imagine working your way through an online purchase to suddenly have the page you're looking at disappear and be shown a ""You're a bot"" accusation out of nowhere. ""This is a bad practice from a user experience perspective,"" says Akrout.Instead, Akrout says, many sites choose to negotiate the process a little more kindly. If a website visitor falls below the bot-or-not threshold, the site will surface a page with the older style ""I am not a robot"" checkbox, letting humans better understand why their online shopping experience or whatever else was interrupted and giving them a chance to prove their humanity.  ""Most programmers I know add checkboxes because they don't know how to choose a time at which they ask v3 about its belief."" By that, he means that version 3 has a constant score; websites can access it at any time.

This is how it's being reinvented for the AI ageAnd it's in that gap that Akrout and his fellow researchers strike. The ""I am not a robot"" checkbox was introduced in version 2 of reCAPTCHA, analysing behaviour including mouse movements to spot bots. The researchers have created an automated system that can fool that part of reCAPTCHA.It's not directly addressing version 3's invisible scoring, but the mouse-movement analysis first introduced in version 2 — but because of how the system is implemented on some websites, it doesn't have to fool the newer system. In other words, they've found another way around reCAPTCHA using AI but it isn't quite as grand as promised.That doesn't convince Nan Jiang of the University of Bournemouth, who wasn't involved with this research. ""Theoretically, any CAPTCHA scheme purely relying on examining user behaviour can be hacked with tailored machine learning algorithms as such algorithms can be used to simulate a real user’s interaction on a page easily,"" he notes. ""However, Google ReCAPTCHA… combines other technologies to predict how much a client can be trusted and then try to whitelist that client. Once you get whitelisted, whatever you do will still allow you to pass the test.""Akrout and his fellow researchers fool the one section of reCAPTCHA using a type of machine learning called reinforcement learning, in which a software agent tries to find the best possible path, encouraged via rewards for each step it takes in the right direction. Their system lays a grid of squares across the page, working the mouse diagonally through the grid towards the ""I am not a robot button"". Given positive reinforcement if it's successful and negative if not, the system learns the right ways to move to convince reCAPTCHA the mouse is being controlled. The paper claims it works with 97.4 per cent accuracy. At the time of publication, Google had not responded to a request for comment about the paper.But Jason Polakis, assistant professor in computer science at the University of Illinois who cracked reCAPTCHA version 2, notes that there's more to v3 of reCAPTCHA than the work described in the paper. ""The attack that this paper attempts to demonstrate is simply moving from a random starting point in the page to the checkbox,"" he says. ""That is a very specific and limited subset of the interactions a user will have with an actual page in practice (e.g., filling out forms, interacting with multiple page elements, moving across more complicated patterns, etc).""He adds: ""If Google has also improved the use of more advanced techniques like browser/device fingerprinting (indications of which we had found when we did our extensive in-depth analysis and breaking of ReCaptcha v2), an attack will be even more complicated in practice.""Akrout agrees that the mouse-movement based attack has limits, but those reveal a bit about how reCAPTCHA v3 works. ""If you're connected with your Google account from a normal IP, then the system most of the time will return that you're a human,"" he says.

Akrout says the attack requires appearing neutral to Google — so no logged in accounts, but not coming in via a proxy or using browser control tools such as Selenium, either. ""It's as if I'm asking the system to go directly to the second [page], just to get the mass movement detection,"" he says.Akrout adds there are easy ways Google could protect reCAPTCHA from this technique, notably tracking the amount of time a user takes to click the button. ""The agent spends more time than humans to click on the checkbox,"" he noted. ""Anyone can always leave reCaptcha working in the background without any interaction,"" adds Akrout, leaving his attack unworkable.Shujun Li, professor of cyber security at the University of Kent, has previously designed his own systems to crack earlier versions of reCAPTCHA, but wasn't involved in this project. He says the work looks technically sound, but added that Google would be able to update its system easily to avoid the proposed attack. ""It remains unclear to what extend the proposed attack can be retrained to catch up,"" he said. ""A potentially more robust approach would be to collect real human users' responses to reCAPTCHA and build a machine learning model to simulate such responses, which can be easily retrained and will be guaranteed to work unless reCAPTCHA becomes unusable for normal human users.""Indeed, there's plenty of other ways to crack these systems, Li notes. While this particular attack may be limited, the fact that reCAPTCHA would continue to fall prey to artificial intelligence systems isn't a surprise. ""It has not been news that CAPTCHAs are crackable. Recent AI advances have significantly improved success rates of automated attacks,"" Li added. ""In principle, CAPTCHA as a technology has proved unable to resist advanced attacks."" This particular research may not crack reCAPTCHA v3, but it's a start.This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

""The agent spends more time than humans to click on the checkbox,"" he noted. ""Anyone can always leave reCaptcha working in the background without any interaction,"" adds Akrout, leaving his attack unworkable.
Shujun Li, professor of cyber security at the University of Kent, has previously designed his own systems to crack earlier versions of reCAPTCHA, but wasn't involved in this project. He says the work looks technically sound, but added that Google would be able to update its system easily to avoid the proposed attack. ""It remains unclear to what extend the proposed attack can be retrained to catch up,"" he said. ""A potentially more robust approach would be to collect real human users' responses to reCAPTCHA and build a machine learning model to simulate such responses, which can be easily retrained and will be guaranteed to work unless reCAPTCHA becomes unusable for normal human users.""
Indeed, there's plenty of other ways to crack these systems, Li notes. While this particular attack may be limited, the fact that reCAPTCHA would continue to fall prey to artificial intelligence systems isn't a surprise. ""It has not been news that CAPTCHAs are crackable. Recent AI advances have significantly improved success rates of automated attacks,"" Li added. ""In principle, CAPTCHA as a technology has proved unable to resist advanced attacks."" This particular research may not crack reCAPTCHA v3, but it's a start.

This means that India must do more to educate its general population in proper coding skills, the survey underscores.Meanwhile, the US engineers perform four times better than the Indian engineers in coding, with only 4% of them not able to write comilable code despite the fact that the base of the engineering population in the US is approximately four times smaller than in India, the report mulls.Also Read: What went wrong with Indian higher education It further emphasises that the Indian engineers need to move beyond basic coding skills to keep up with the demands of the 21st century. The tech industry needs graduates to be equipped with skills in AI, Machine Learning (ML) and data science to keep up with the changing requirements of the sector.The findings underline the sorry state of affairs in the engineering education parlance which is mainly theory-based where only 40 % of students perform internships while only 36 % undertake projects beyond their required coursework.The survey further stresses on the lack of industry exposure amongst students. &amp;quot;Students are trapped in a college bubble. They have little industry exposure. Only 47% of students attend industry talks. Sixty percent of faculty do not discuss how engineering concepts apply to industry,&amp;quot; it rues.Also Read: Good news for engineering students!
