As we are at the cusp of technological change, history shifts its pace when touched with scientific vision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such technical field that is transforming human society into one of robots and machines. AI includes machine learning, natural language processing, big data analytics, algorithms, and much more. However, as human intelligence is marked by intrinsic bias in decision-making, such characteristics can also be found in AI products that work with human-created intelligence. These phenomena of bias and discrimination – rooted in a cluster of technologies and embedded in social systems – are a threat to universal human rights. Indeed, AI disproportionally affects the human rights of vulnerable individuals and groups by facilitating discrimination, thus creating a new form of oppression rooted in technology.
AI as a tool of discrimination
With the advancement of AI in our organic societies, the issue of discrimination and systemic racism has taken increasing space in political debates about technological growth. Article 2 of the UDHR and Article 2 of the ICCPR both articulate individual entitlement to all rights and freedoms without discrimination. Of course, this is difficult to apply in practice when considering the multitude of discriminatory opinions and oppressive practices that characterise human interaction. Though some naively perceive AI as the solution to this challenge, a technological tool that frees us from the bias of human decision-making, such opinions fail to account for the traces of human intelligence in AI technology.
Indeed, AI algorithms and face-recognition systems have repeatedly failed to ensure a basic standard of equality, particularly by showing discriminatory tendencies towards Black people. In 2015, Google Photos, which is considered an advanced recognition software, categorized a photo of two Black people as a picture of gorillas. When keywords such as ‘Black girls’ were inputted into the Google search bar, the algorithm showed sexually explicit material in response. Researchers have also found that an algorithm that identifies which patients need additional medical care undervalued the medical needs of Black patients.
Facial-recognition technology is now being adopted in the criminal justice systems of different states – including Hong Kong, China, Denmark and India – to identify suspects for predictive policing. Sceptics have pointed out that instead of mitigating and controlling police work, such algorithms instead enhance pre-existing discriminatory law enforcement practices. The unevaluated bias of these tools has put Black people at bigger risk of being perceived as high-risk offenders, thus further entrenching racist tendencies in the justice and prison systems. Such racial discrimination inherited in AI disgraces its transformative implementation into society and violates equal treatment and the right to protection.
While communities are now standing up for the rights of Black people through the Black Lives Matter movement, the increased implementation of AI in society is fostering digital bias and replicating the harm that is currently being fought against. In that sense, this technology disproportionately affects the vulnerable by exacerbating discriminatory practices already present in modern society.
Technology as a source of unemployment
The right to work and protection against unemployment is guaranteed under Article 23 of UDHR, Article 6 of ICESCR, and Article 1(2) of the ILO. Though the rapid increase of AI has transformed existing businesses and personal lives by improving the efficiency of machinery and services, such change has also birthed an era of unemployment due to the displacement of human labour. Referring to the exponential growth in technology, Robert Skidelsky writes in his book Work in the Future that “Sooner or later, we will run out of jobs”. This was also reiterated in a seminal study conducted by Oxford academics Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, which estimated that 47% of U.S. jobs are at risk of future automation due to AI.
In 2017, Changying Precision Technology, a Chinese factory producing mobile phones, replaced 90% of its human workforce with machines, which led to a 250% increase in its productivity and a substantial 8% drop in defects. Similarly, Adidas has moved towards ‘robot-only’ factories to improve efficiency. Thus, business growth no longer relies on a human workforce; in fact, human labour may negatively affect productivity. Until now, technology has had a more detrimental effect on low and middle-skilled workers, with decreasing employment opportunities and falling wages, leading to the emergence of job polarisation. However, as technology continues to advance, many jobs that we would today consider protected from automation will eventually be replaced by AI. For example, AI-based virtual assistants software such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google, have steadily replaced personal assistants, foreign language translators, and other services that were previously reliant on human interaction.
The COVID-19 pandemic has already impacted millions of jobs, and a new wave of AI revolutions may further aggravate the situation. By increasingly introducing AI in different job sectors, it seems that the poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer. Indeed, AI represents a new form of capitalism that strives for profit without the creation of new jobs; instead a human workforce is perceived as a barrier to growth. There is thus an urgent need to address the consequences of AI on social and economic rights, through the development of a techno-social governance system that may protect the employment rights of humans in an AI era.
Controlling populations and movement
Freedom of movement derives itself from many international declarations and has been recognized as a fundamental individual right by many countries. AI’s ability to limit this right is specifically related to its usage for surveillance purposes. A report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace pointed out that at least 75 of 176 countries globally are actively using AI for security purposes, such as border management. There have been concerns regarding the disparate impact of surveillance on populations that are already discriminated by police – such as Blacks, refugees and irregular migrants – as predictive policing tools end up factoring in “dirty data” reflecting conscious and implicit bias. The Guardian reported that to keep a check on illegal immigration, dozens of towers equipped with feature laser-enhanced cameras were installed at the US-Mexico border in Arizona. In addition to this, the US government deployed a facial recognition system to record images of people inside vehicles entering and leaving the country.
Technological shifts have also impacted the military and humanitarian sectors. The increasing use of armed drones in warfare – in particular by the US in Pakistan and Afghanistan – has been repeatedly denounced as a violation of International Humanitarian Law in a 2010 UN report. An investigation by The Intercept of US military operations against the Taliban and al Qaeda in the Hindu Kush revealed that nearly nine out of ten people who died in drone strikes were not the intended targets. The rapid development of autonomous technology and AI has also resulted in fully autonomous weapons such as “killer robots”, which raise a host of moral, legal, and security concerns. The lack of ethical judgment of such machines has raised concerns about the reliability and error in judgement of these weapons, which might result in accidental deaths and the rapid escalation of conflicts. Indeed, Zachary Kallenborn’s article highlights the incapability of these weapons to discriminate between combatants and non-combatants.
Moreover, the advent of ‘humanitarian drones’ – for which military technology may be used for humanitarian purposes – has raised ethical dilemmas in regards to how this technology may negatively affect populations in need. There are decidedly adverse consequences for vulnerable groups, whose personal data has put them at further risk of violence. Biometrics has been used to register refugee populations with the UNHCR; while it is assumed to be an objective identification method, there is ample evidence that these tools simply codify discrimination. For example, biometric data collected from Rohingya refugees in India and Bangladesh was used to facilitate their repatriation rather than to integrate them into society, further exacerbating the suffering experienced by this community.
The rapid increase in dependency on AI to enforce social control during the present pandemic has also raised many privacy concerns. Arogya-Setu dangerous mix of health data and digital surveillance.technologies are a potent threat to basic human rights and can be used as tools of exploitation and oppression. In fact, if the use of AI continues to remain widely unregulated, the human rights of vulnerable groups will undoubtedly suffer.
Conclusion
With the continuing expansion of the AI reign, the tension between AI and human rights is increasingly manifesting itself as technology becomes central to our everyday lives and the functioning of society. As AI is perceived as an improvement of modern society, the lack of stringent Data Protection policies offers Tech companies a society ready to be digitally exploited. With little regulation or accountability, these companies freely intrude into the lives of citizens and increasingly infringe on human rights. From fostering discrimination to invasive surveillance practices, AI has proven to be a threat to equal protection, economic rights, and basic freedoms. To reverse these trends, proper legal standards ought to be implemented in our digitally transforming societies. Increased transparency in AI decision-making processes, better accountability for Tech giants, and the ability for civil society to challenge the implementation of new technologies in society are sorely needed. ‘AI literacy’ should also be encouraged through investment in public awareness and education initiatives, which would help communities to learn not only about the functions of AI, but also its impact on our day to day lives. Unless suitable measures are enforced to safeguard the interests of human society, the future of human rights in this era of technology remains uncertain.

The article has vividly brought out the conflict between technology ie AI and HR at a base level. However my take is that instead of villifying the adverse consequences of AI we as a global community should focus on integrating this key resource in the hands of the governments and the corporations towards betterment of human lives. Whenever there is a conflict between usage of AI and HR the rules of international behaviours as promulgated for internet and WWW should also be codified for AI as this will.ensure that no frankestiein monster is let loose on the human race. Technology should be for holistic betterment of mankind and not for domination over the resources be it human or natural resource

Totally agreeing with you Deepak. There is a need for AI regime to flourish but that should not be unfettered. We cannot read HR laws and AI laws in the shadows of mutual exclusivity. We have to adopt a culture where there is AI development but within the HR framework so that there can be sustainable development of the technological advanced society.

This is an excellent article. Poor nations must come up with a system to defend their rights of their citizens against the deployment of AI. AI experiments are done in rich nations by  rich individuals to perpetuate to protect the interests of the rich against the poor. Those deploying IA must be heavily taxed by Governments.

“All possible universes exist, even triangular ones”. These were the words on the cover of New Scientist on 6 June 1998, when Max Tegmark made one of his first appearances in the magazine. Inside, the then 31-year-old expanded on his idea of a multiverse on steroids, in which all logically possible universes not only can but must exist.
Tegmark, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is known for his provocative ideas. As he explains in the “Crazy” section of his website: “Every time I’ve written ten mainstream papers, I allow myself to indulge in writing one wacky one.” But the outlandish elements shouldn’t overshadow his serious track record in cosmology, quantum information science and the study of some of the very deepest questions about the nature of reality.
Recently, Tegmark has shifted his focus to intelligence, both human and artificial. He conducts front-line research in artificial intelligence (AI), most recently working with fellow MIT researcher Silviu-Marian Udrescu to create an AI that was able to rediscover some of the most fundamental equations of physics by studying patterns in data. In 2014, he co-founded the Future of Life Institute, which aims to understand and mitigate existential risks to humanity, particularly those associated with the rise of AI.
Richard Webb: What made you switch from cosmology to working on artificial intelligence?
Max Tegmark: I’ve always been fascinated by big questions, the bigger the better. That’s why I loved studying the universe, because there were philosophically very big questions like where does everything come from, what’s going to happen, what is our place in the grand scheme…

Autonomous vehicles are starting to become a real possibility in some parts of industry. Agriculture, transportation and military are some of the examples. The day when we are going to see autonomous vehicles in everyday  life for the regular consumer is quickly approaching. Many of the operations that vehicles have to perform are based on sensor information and some AI algorithms. Vehicles need to collect data, plan their trajectory and execute the trajectory. These tasks, especially the last two require non-traditional programming approaches and rely on machine learning techniques, which are part of AI.
There are many tasks for autonomous vehicles that are still presenting significant challenges and require sophisticated approaches. Replacing the cognitive and motor abilities of a human is not easy and will continue to be work in progress for years to come. There are different tasks that AI needs to solve so that we achieve reliable and safe autonomous drive.
The purpose of this two-part series is to illustrate the AI applications that make autonomous vehicles a reality, presenting their challenges and accomplishments. The nature of AI, compared to traditional software, is also explored and the specific challenges for developing, testing and deploying AI technologies in the autonomous vehicle arena is further discussed in Part 2.


1. Analysis of AI in the Autonomous Vehicle
The autonomous vehicle segment is the fastest growing segment in the automotive industry. Artificial Intelligence is indeed the most important and sophisticated component of self driving vehicles (Carmody, Thomas, 2019). A typical autonomous vehicle is shown on figure 1.




Figure 1: Self Driving Vehicle (Lentin, 2017)
The number of sensors with real time data and the need for intelligent processing of the data can    be overwhelming. AI is used in the central unit as well as in the multiple electronic control units (ECU) of the modern automobile.
Since AI has been used in many areas,  including robotics this is a natural fit of the technology which promises to master autonomy.   The promise of the technology    is that AI and perception technologies will provide a safer and more deterministic behavior which will lead to benefits such as fuel efficiency, comfort and convenience (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019).
The challenges  in developing AI systems for something as complex as a self driving vehicle are many. The AI has to interact with multitude of sensors and has to use data in real time. Many AI algorithms are computationally intensive and are therefore hard to use with CPUs that have memory and speed restrictions. Modern vehicles are an example of real time systems that have to produce deterministic results in the time domain. This is related to achieving safety while driving the vehicle. Complicated distributed systems like these require a lot of internal communications that are prone to latency which can disturb the decision making of the AI algorithms. In addition there is the issue of power consumption of the software running in the car. The more intensive AI algorithms consume more power, which is an issue, especially for electric vehicles that depend only on the charge of the battery (Carmody, Thomas, 2019).
AI is used for several important tasks in a self driving automobile. One of the main tasks is path planning.   That is the navigation system of    the vehicle (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019). Another big task for  AI is the interaction with the sensory system and the interpretation of the data coming out of sensors.
It is now apparent that providing a complete solution to replace a human behind the steering wheel is a formidable task (Boucherat, 2019). That is the reason why many manufacturers have started dividing the problem into smaller pieces and solving each one and thus taking smaller steps to achieve complete autonomy. There are always the startups, the disruptive companies in the industry, that try to solve to complete self driving problem and have vowed in the past that will have completely ready vehicles on the roads by 2020. Now it is clear that the reality is much more complex and many of the hurdles come from some of the issues that AI intrinsically has.
As AI develops and becomes better we will get closer and closer to having secure and autonomous transportation. Until then we have  to cope with many hours of development and testing and adoption will be determined by how confident consumers are and will depend on market forces. It is all going to happen even if it takes longer than was originally anticipated. The demand and the need are there and the technology is almost there. Adoption may be faster or slower based on regulation and doing it in phases, starting from simpler and more deterministic use cases such as driving in a known environment. The algorithms used can be sufficiently relieved if the vehicle operates in only specific conditions that present fewer unknowns.
2. AI Applications in Vehicles
2.1. Sensor Data Processing
There are numerous sensors providing data for the central computer of the vehicle during operation. Sensors provide information for the road, other vehicles on the road as well as any other impediments that can be noticed similarly to how a human can perceive them (Khayyam et al., 2019). Some  of these sensors can provide better perception than the average human, but for this to happen we need smart algorithms that can make sense of the data streams generated in real time.
One of the main tasks is to detect and identify objects ahead and around the vehicle (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019). Artificial neural networks (ANN) are the algorithms typically used for this task. Another term for this field is deep learning, because a neural network contains many layers that contain many nodes. A deep neural network is shown on figure 2 although the number of nodes and layers in practice  can be much higher.

Figure 2: Deep Neural Network Diagram. (Beachler, 2019)
The analysis of video input uses machine learning algorithms and most likely neural networks in order to classify objects. Since we have multiple sensors of different kind it makes sense to have dedicated hardware/software modules for each sensor. This approach allows for parallel processing of data and therefore faster decision making. Each sensor unit can utilize a different AI algorithm and then communicate its results to the other units or the central processing computer.
2.2. Path Planning
Path planning is important in order to optimize the trajectory of the vehicle and to lead to better traffic patterns.  This can help reduce delays  and avoid congestion on the road (Abduljabbar and Dia, 2019). Planning is a very suitable task for artificial intelligence algorithms. It is a dynamic task that can take into consideration a lot of factors and can solve an optimization problem while executing the path. The following definition of path planning is given: ”path planning for AVs enables self-driving vehicles to find the safest, most convenient, and most economically beneficial routes from point A to point B by using the previous driving experiences which help the AI agent make much more accurate decisions in the future” (Khayyam et al., 2019, p.56).
2.3. Path Execution
After the path is planned the vehicle is able to navigate the road conditions, by detecting objects, pedestrians,  bicycles and traffic lights in order  to reach the destination (Khayyam et al., 2019). The object detection algorithms are a primary focus of the AI community as they make it possible for human like behavior. The challenges come when different road and weather conditions come into play. Many accidents with testing vehicles happened because the simulation environment is different from the real world conditions and the AI software may react unpredictably when given unknown data.
2.4. Monitoring Vehicle’s Condition
The most promising type of maintenance is predictive maintenance. It can be defined in the following way: “Predictive maintenance employs monitoring and prediction modelling to determine the condition of the machine and to predict what is likely to fail and when it is going to happen” (Prytz, 2014, p.2). It tries to predict future problems, not problems that already exist. In this respect predictive maintenance can save a lot of time and money. Both supervised and unsupervised learning can be used for predictive maintenance. The algorithms can use on-board and off-board data to make decision for predictive maintenance. The machine learning algorithms used for this task are classification algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines and random forest algorithm.
2.5. Insurance Data Collection
Data logs from a vehicle can contain information about the driver’s behavior and this can be used in the analysis of traffic accidents. These data can be used for processing of claims (Carol, 2017). All this can contribute  to decrease in prices for insurance, since the safety is more deterministic and guaranteed. For fully automated cars the liability will shift from the passenger, who is no longer a driver, to the manufacturer. In the semi-autonomous vehicle, we will still most likely have some liability of the driver. Proving these type of cases will rely more and more on smart data captured by the  AI system of the vehicle. Data from all sensors generates enormous amounts of information. Saving all the data at every moment may not be practical,  but saving snapshots of relevant data seems the right balance of obtaining evidence that could be used for post analysis of a certain traffic event. This approach is similar to how black box information is stored and analyzed after a crash.
The next article in this two-part series discusses artificial intelligence algorithms and challenges for autonomous vehicles.

Clemson University is strengthening its ability to conduct research and offer courses in artificial intelligence, a fast-rising technology that is beginning to revolutionize industries ranging from advanced manufacturing to healthcare.
About 80 faculty members are banding together to launch the new Clemson Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for Science and Engineering, or AIRISE.
Clemson researchers have been developing and using artificial intelligence for years, and the institute will build on projects already underway. 
Feng Luo meets (center) is the director and founder of the new Clemson Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for Science and Engineering.
Artificial intelligence is widely regarded as crucial to enhancing economic and national security.  A presidential executive order last year called for more training on AI technologies, and several major companies have established AI labs, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon.
Mitch Shue, executive director of AIRISE and a professor of practice, said the institute will serve as the umbrella for AI research, education and STEM workforce development at Clemson.
“AI is pervasive now, and we have to prepare our students for a different world,” said Shue, who formerly served as chief technology officer for Morningstar. “Combining all of Clemson’s resources in one institute will help us recruit top students and faculty and better compete for federal grants that fund cutting-edge research.”
Feng Luo, the institute’s director and founder, said that AIRISE will help Clemson meet industry demand for AI-related research and talent.
“I think we have some big opportunities,” said Luo, who is also a computer science professor. “The requirement for AI from industry has dramatically increased. When a company has data, it wants to make sense of the data, and AI is one of the ways to help them.”
Luo is among the Clemson researchers who have deep experience in artificial intelligence. He and his team started a project in 2017 with a $4.3-million federal grant aimed at using artificial intelligence to combat citrus-greening disease, which poses a serious threat to Florida’s citrus industry.
Other Clemson researchers have deployed artificial intelligence to protect self-driving vehicles from cyberattack, inspect vehicles for defects as they travel an assembly line, safeguard reputations on social media, detect cyberbullying, and diagnose Alzheimer’s disease earlier than currently possible, just to name a few examples. (Read more about those projects here.)
Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing, said that advances in computing power, new algorithms and an explosion of data are opening new possibilities in artificial intelligence.
“With AIRISE, Clemson will be well-positioned to play a key role in conducting cutting-edge research and creating the STEM workforce of the future,” she said. “We have a real opportunity to help enhance economic development and U.S. competitiveness.”
A top goal of the institute will be to position Clemson as a leader in advanced manufacturing, materials sciences, bio- and medical-informatics, cyberinfrastructure and intelligent transportation.
“Those are all core to Clemson, and applying this AI umbrella over those specific areas is going to be a big differentiator for Clemson and for the effects on society in general,” Shue said.
Shue will lead the effort to build industry collaborations for AI research and education in AIRISE. 
“Industry is sitting on tons of data, some underutilized or not used at all,” he said. “We can help with that.” 
AIRISE is Clemson’s latest effort to work across disciplines and institutions to expand research and education in artificial intelligence. About 150 officials from Clemson University, the Medical University of South Carolina and Siemens Healthineers joined together in November for a summit aimed at finding new ways to improve healthcare with artificial intelligence.
Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences, said the new institute will further position Clemson for success in one of the globe’s most transformative fields.
“AIRISE will enhance the ability of Clemson’s engineers and scientists to work collaboratively across disciplines and institutions, including industry, to strategically enhance artificial intelligence and prepare the leaders of tomorrow,” he said. “I congratulate Mitch and Feng on the launch of AIRISE and look forward to working with them on this important initiative.”

AI has already become a crucial part of recruiting and hiring processes, emerging as a significant HR technology aimed at reducing and even removing time-consuming activities like screening resumes manually. Organizations increasingly use this tech to confiscate unconscious bias from hiring decisions as well as to attract applicants, and envisage whether a candidate fit for the position and company..As AI is trained on data collected about previous or similar applicants, it has the potential to expurgate the effort recruiters need to spend to make a hire. A 2018 LinkedIn report highlights that 67 percent of hiring managers and recruiters surveyed reported AI was saving them time..Looking and hiring new employees that can fit an organization's requirements is an expensive endeavor. In this way leveraging AI and machine learning can be an effective approach, helping in making valuable long-term employees for a good return on businesses' recruitment investment. HireVue that assists global enterprises to gain a competitive advantage in the modern talent marketplace, for instance, allows companies to screen candidates via automated video interviews. By integrating video interviews with predictive, validated IO science and AI, the company gives the ability to hiring managers to make productive decisions by scaling cognitive capabilities, determining language structure, and distinguishing emotions. This will help them find the most suitable potential candidates..Today, there are a different number of online applications that assist aspirants to improve resumes and apply for jobs that fit them. In addition to this, the availability of the underlying technology that makes modern job boards possible is also helping in improving a candidate's job search. For example, the AWS cloud infrastructure, which has developed from an internal network into an operating system for the internet. The use of AI by Amazon Web Services to predict server usage enables job boards to quickly display job seekers geotargeted openings that align with their profession, skills, interests and career goals..Using AI for Recruiters.Reports show that a majority of talent acquisition leaders or hiring managers' biggest challenge is screening resumes efficiently. Implementing artificial intelligence in recruiting processes helps them streamline or automate some part of the recruiting workflow, particularly repetitive, high-volume tasks. While manually screening resumes is still the most time-consuming part of recruiting, most of the resumes received for a role are unqualified..On the other side, AI holds much promise for improving the quality of hire as it uses data to standardize the matching between candidates' experience, knowledge, and skills and the job requirements. AI and machine learning can also enable thousands of applications to be processed in a short period of time compared to humans that do so manually..The arrival of robots in recruiting workflow is making this process even easier for HR teams. For instance, in Sweden, a robot named Tengai, the brainchild of Furhat Robotics, is making waves by conducting job interviews. This robot is designed to conduct unbiased interviews in an effective manner as possible..Briefly, the promises AI brings to the recruiting and hiring process can drastically improve and enhance both individuals' job hunting and companies' effort to hire. The technology will not only become more creative and effective over time, but also frees up hiring managers to focus more on agile work and on getting to know their top applicants and make decisions based on that..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

This includes advanced tech skills such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and wireless technologies among others. Merely 2.5% of engineers in India possess skills in artificial intelligence while only a handful of engineers (5.5%) are qualified with basic programming, the report assessed.This means, overall, only 1.5% of engineers in India have the required skills for new-age jobs. The findings match other reports about the shortage of digital skills in India. The emerging sector has nearly 4,000 vacant jobs in India due to lack of qualified talent.This may be because of the education system imparting theory-based knowledge. The data collected has revealed that only 40% of the total graduate engineers opt for internships for hands on experience with 36% taking up projects other than their coursework. While 47% of students attend industry talks to boost their knowledge.""We find that a low proportion of engineers take up projects beyond curriculum and do internships. Also, there is a lack of faculty talking about industry application of concepts in class or students getting exposure through industry talks,"" Varun Aggarwal, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Aspiring Minds told PTI.The report analysed engineers across India, China and the US. As per the conclusions drawn, US job applicants were found to be ahead of Indians in terms of good coding skills, while China and India compete almost at the same levels.See also:Google will groom these 10 Indian startups that use AI and machine learningThese core subjects are the biggest winners in IIT-Delhi's record campus placement seasonThese 5 sectors are the only ones projected to see double digit salary hikes this year",,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '600', 'height': '60', 'url': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-60085318,width-1000,height-750/default-thumb.jpg'}","['https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderIndia', 'https://twitter.com/BiIndia']"
