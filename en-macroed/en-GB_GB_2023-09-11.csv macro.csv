The LLM is underpinned by a scientific development known as the transformer model, made by Google researchers in 2017.“While we’ve always understood the breakthrough nature of our transformer work, several years later, we’re energised by its enduring potential across new fields, from healthcare to robotics and security, enhancing human creativity, and more,” says Slav Petrov, a senior researcher at Google, who works on building AI models, including LLMs.LLMs’ touted benefits — the ability to increase productivity by writing and analysing text — are also why it poses a threat to humans. According to Goldman Sachs, it could expose the equivalent of 300mn full-time workers across big economies to automation, leading to widespread unemployment.As the technology is rapidly woven into our lives, understanding how LLMs generate text means understanding why these models are such versatile cognitive engines — and what else they can help create.To write text, LLMs must first translate words into a language they understand.First a block of words is broken into tokens — basic units that can be encoded. Tokens often represent fractions of words, but we’ll turn each full word into a token.In order to grasp a word’s meaning, work in our example, LLMs first observe it in context using enormous sets of training data, taking note of nearby words. These datasets are based on collating text published on the internet, with new LLMs trained using billions of words.Eventually, we end up with a huge set of the words found alongside work in the training data, as well as those that weren’t found near it.As the model processes this set of words, it produces a vector — or list of values — and adjusts it based on each word’s proximity to work in the training data. This vector is known as a word embedding.A word embedding can have hundreds of values, each representing a different aspect of a word’s meaning. Just as you might describe a house by its characteristics — type, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, storeys — the values in an embedding quantify a word’s linguistic features.The way these characteristics are derived means we don’t know exactly what each value represents, but words we expect to be used in comparable ways often have similar-looking embeddings.A pair of words like sea and ocean, for example, may not be used in identical contexts (‘all at ocean’ isn't a direct substitute for ‘all at sea’), but their meanings are close to each other, and embeddings allow us to quantify that closeness.By reducing the hundreds of values each embedding represents to just two, we can see the distances between these words more clearly.We might spot clusters of pronouns, or modes of transportation, and being able to quantify words in this way is the first step in a model generating text.seaoceanfootballsoccerIwewegogototoworkworkbybytraintraintheofficetheyswimrunwalkwithoninbuildingshopcarbuscollegeschoolworkpolkapolkaworklikelikeworkyesterdayyesterdayworkwentwentworkherherworkaaworknoisynoisyworkdovedoveworkononworkmorningmorningworkininworkatmosphereatmosphereworkquantumquantumworkzebrazebraworkenvironmentenvironmentworkintointoBut this alone is not what makes LLMs so clever. What unlocked their abilities to parse and write as fluently as they do today is a tool called the transformer, which radically sped up and augmented how computers understood language.Transformers process an entire sequence at once — be that a sentence, paragraph or an entire article — analysing all its parts and not just individual words.This allows the software to capture context and patterns better, and to translate — or generate — text more accurately. This simultaneous processing also makes LLMs much faster to train, in turn improving their efficiency and ability to scale.Research outlining the transformer model was first published by a group of eight AI researchers at Google in June 2017. Their 11-page research paper marked the start of the generative AI era.A key concept of the transformer architecture is self-attention. This is what allows LLMs to understand relationships between words.Self-attention looks at each token in a body of text and decides which others are most important to understanding its meaning.Before transformers, the state of the art AI translation methods were recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which scanned each word in a sentence and processed it sequentially.With self-attention, the transformer computes all the words in a sentence at the same time. Capturing this context gives LLMs far more sophisticated capabilities to parse language.In this example, assessing the whole sentence at once means the transformer is able to understand that interest is being used as a noun to explain an individual’s take on politics.If we tweak the sentence . . .. . . the model understands interest is now being used in a financial sense.And when we combine the sentences, the model is still able to recognise the correct meaning of each word thanks to the attention it gives the accompanying text.For the first use of interest, it is no and in that are most attended.For the second, it is rate and bank.This functionality is crucial for advanced text generation. Without it, words that can be interchangeable in some contexts but not others can be used incorrectly.Effectively, self-attention means that if a summary of this sentence was produced, you wouldn’t have enthusiasm used when you were writing about interest rates.This capability goes beyond words, like interest, that have multiple meanings.In the following sentence, self-attention is able to calculate that it is most likely to be referring to dog.And if we alter the sentence, swapping hungry for delicious, the model is able to recalculate, with it now most likely to refer to bone.The benefits of self-attention for language processing increase the more you scale things up. It allows LLMs to take context from beyond sentence boundaries, giving the model a greater understanding of how and when a word is used.IIhavehavenonointerestinterestininpoliticspoliticsOne of the world’s largest and most advanced LLMs is GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence model which the company says exhibits “human-level performance” on several academic and professional benchmarks such as the US bar exam, advanced placement tests and the SAT school exams.GPT-4 can generate and ingest large volumes of text: users can feed in up to 25,000 English words, which means it could handle detailed financial documentation, literary works or technical manuals.The product has reshaped the tech industry, with the world’s biggest technology companies — including Google, Meta and Microsoft, who have backed OpenAI — racing to dominate the space, alongside smaller start-ups.The LLMs they have released include Google’s PaLM model, which powers its chatbot Bard, Anthropic’s Claude model, Meta’s LLaMA and Cohere’s Command, among others.While these models are already being adopted by an array of businesses, some of the companies behind them are facing legal battles around their use of copyrighted text, images and audio scraped from the web.The reason for this is that current LLMs are trained on most of the English-language internet — a volume of information that makes them far more powerful than previous generations. From this enormous corpus of words and images, the models learn how to recognise patterns and eventually predict the next best word. After tokenising and encoding a prompt, we’re left with a block of data representing our input as the machine understands it, including meanings, positions and relationships between words.At its simplest, the model’s aim is now to predict the next word in a sequence and do this repeatedly until the output is complete.To do this, the model gives a probability score to each token, which represents the likelihood of it being the next word in the sequence.And it continues to do this until it is happy with the text it has produced.But this method of predicting the following word in isolation — known as “greedy search” — can introduce problems. Sometimes, while each individual token might be the next best fit, the full phrase can be less relevant.Not necessarily always wrong, but perhaps not what you’d expect either.Transformers use a number of approaches to address this problem and enhance the quality of their output. One example is called beam search.Rather than focusing only on the next word in a sequence, it looks at the probability of a larger set of tokens as a whole.With beam search, the model is able to consider multiple routes and find the best option.This produces better results, ultimately leading to more coherent, human-like text.Probability-+TheFinancialTimesis...abouteconomicsandpodcastsmorethanjustaprintproductanewspaperfoundedin1888basedinBritainBut things don’t always go to plan. While the text may seem plausible and coherent, it isn’t always factually correct. LLMs are not search engines looking up facts; they are pattern-spotting engines that guess the next best option in a sequence.Because of this inherent predictive nature, LLMs can also fabricate information in a process that researchers call “hallucination”. They can generate made-up numbers, names, dates, quotes — even web links or entire articles.Users of LLMs have shared examples of links to non-existent news articles on the FT and Bloomberg, made-up references to research papers, the wrong authors for published books and biographies riddled with factual mistakes.In one high-profile incident in New York, a lawyer used ChatGPT to create a brief for a case. When the defence interrogated the report, they discovered it was littered with made-up judicial opinions and legal citations. “I did not comprehend that ChatGPT could fabricate cases,” the lawyer later told a judge during his own court hearing.Although researchers say hallucinations will never be completely erased, Google, OpenAI and others are working on limiting them through a process known as “grounding”. This involves cross-checking an LLM’s outputs against web search results and providing citations to users so they can verify.Humans are also used to provide feedback and fill gaps in information — a process known as reinforcement learning by human feedback (RLHF) — which further improves the quality of the output. But it is still a big research challenge to understand which queries might trigger these hallucinations, as well as how they can be predicted and reduced.Despite these limitations, the transformer has resulted in a host of cutting-edge AI applications. Apart from powering chatbots such as Bard and ChatGPT, it drives autocomplete on our mobile keyboards and speech recognition in our smart speakers.Its real power, however, lies beyond language. Its inventors discovered that transformer models could recognise and predict any repeating motifs or patterns. From pixels in an image, using tools such as Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, to computer code using generators like GitHub CoPilot. It could even predict notes in music and DNA in proteins to help design drug molecules.For decades, researchers built specialised models to summarise, translate, search and retrieve. The transformer unified all those actions into a single structure capable of performing a huge variety of tasks.“Take this simple model that predicts the next word and it . . . can do anything,” says Aidan Gomez, chief executive of AI start-up Cohere, and a co-author of the transformer paper.Now they have one type of model that is “trained on the entire internet and what falls out the other side does all of that and better than anything that came before”, he says.“That is the magical part of the story.”This story is free to read so you can share it with family and friends who don’t yet have an FT subscription.Madhumita Murgia is the FT’s artificial intelligence editor.Visual storytelling team: Dan Clark, Sam Learner, Irene de la Torre Arenas, Sam Joiner, Eade Hemingway and Oliver Hawkins.With thanks to Slav Petrov, Jakob Uszkoreit, Aidan Gomez and Ashish Vaswani.To generate the 50D word embeddings we used the GloVe 6B 50D pre-trained model and converted to Word2Vec format.

IntroductionTechnological innovation has revolutionized work across the first through fourth industrial revolutions. The fourth industrial revolution introduced disruptive technologies like big data and artificial intelligence (Zhang and Chen, 2023). The advancement of data processing and big data analytics, along with developments in artificial intelligence, has improved information processing capabilities, including problem-solving and decision-making (Raveendra et al., 2020). With the increasing normalization and timely usage of digital technologies, there is a potential for future higher-level implementation of AI systems (Beneduce, 2020).AI can provide faster and more extensive data analysis than humans, achieving remarkable accuracy and establishing itself as a reliable tool (Chen, 2022). It can collect and evaluate large amounts of data that may exceed human analytical capacities, enabling AI to provide decision recommendations (Shaw, 2019).Modern technologies, including artificial intelligence solutions, have revolutionized work and contributed to developing human resources management (HRM) for improved outcomes (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019). One significant area where their impact is felt is in the recruitment process, where AI implementation can potentially provide a competitive advantage by enabling a better understanding of talent compared to competitors, thereby enhancing the company’s competitiveness (Johansson and Herranen, 2019).AI receives commands and data input through algorithms. While AI developers believe their algorithmic procedures simplify hiring and mitigate bias, Miasato and Silva (2019) argue that algorithms cannot eliminate discrimination alone. The decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. If the underlying data is unfair, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, incompleteness, or discrimination, creating potential for widespread inequality (Bornstein, 2018). Many professionals assert that AI and algorithms reinforce socioeconomic divisions and expose disparities. To quote Immanuel Kant, “In the bentwood of these data sets, none of them is straight” (Raub, 2018). This undermines the principle of social justice, causing moral and economic harm to those affected by discrimination and reducing overall economic efficiency, leading to decreased production of goods and services.AI recruitment tools have a concerning aspect that cannot be overlooked, highlighting the need to address these challenges through technical or managerial means (Raub, 2018). Increasing evidence suggests that AI is more impartial than commonly believed; however, algorithms and AI can result in unfair employment opportunities and the potential for discrimination without accountability. To harness the benefits of AI in recruiting, organizations should exercise careful selection of their programs, promote the adoption of accountable algorithms, and advocate for improvements in racial and gender diversity within high-tech companies.The general construct of this study is, first, an extension of statistical discrimination theory in the context of the algorithmic economy; second, a synthesis of the current literature on the benefits of algorithmic hiring, the roots and classification of algorithmic discrimination; and third, initiatives to eliminate the existence of algorithmic hiring discrimination; fourth, based on the Grounded Theory, we conduct surveys with respondents and analyze primary data to support the study.The contributions of this study are as follows:First, discuss job market discrimination theories in the digital age context. When considering statistical discrimination theories, we should consider the current circumstances. It is necessary to apply these discrimination theories to evaluate the issues that arise from the use of technology in the digital age, particularly with the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain across various industries.Secondly, a literature review approach was employed to examine the factors contributing to discrimination in algorithmic hiring. Our goal with this analysis is to help managers and researchers better understand the limitations of AI algorithms in the hiring process. We conducted a thorough review of 49 papers published between 2007 and 2023 and found that there is currently a fragmented understanding of discrimination in algorithmic hiring. Building on this literature review, our study aims to offer a comprehensive and systematic examination of the sources, categorization, and possible solutions for discriminatory practices in algorithmic recruitment.Thirdly, we take a comprehensive approach that considers technical and managerial aspects to tackle discrimination in algorithmic hiring. This study contends that resolving algorithmic discrimination in recruitment requires technical solutions and the implementation of internal ethical governance and external regulations.The subsequent study is structured into five parts. The first section provides the theoretical background for this research. The following section outlines the research methodology employed in the literature review and identifies four key themes. The third section delves into a detailed discussion of these four themes: applications and benefits of AI-based recruitment, factors contributing to algorithmic recruitment discrimination, types of discrimination in algorithmic recruitment, and measures to mitigate algorithmic hiring discrimination. The fourth section involves conducting a survey among respondents and analyzing the primary data collected to support our study. The final section concludes by suggesting future directions for research.Theory backgroundDiscrimination theoryDiscrimination in the labor market is defined by the ILO’s Convention 111, which encompasses any unfavorable treatment based on race, ethnicity, color, and gender that undermines employment equality (Ruwanpura, 2008). Economist Samuelson (1952) offers a similar definition, indicating that discrimination involves differential treatment based on personal characteristics, such as ethnic origin, gender, skin color, and age.Various perspectives on the causes and manifestations of discrimination can be broadly categorized into four theoretical groups. The first is the competitive market theory, which explains discriminatory practices within an equilibrium of perfect competition (Lundberg and Startz, 1983). This view attributes discrimination primarily to personal prejudice. The second is the monopoly model of discrimination, which posits that monopolistic power leads to discriminatory behavior (Cain, 1986). The third is the statistical theory of discrimination, which suggests that nonobjective variables, such as inadequate information, contribute to biased outcomes (Dickinson and Oaxaca, 2009). Lastly, we have the antecedent market discrimination hypothesis as the fourth category.Statistical discrimination theoryStatistical discrimination refers to prejudice from assessment criteria that generalize group characteristics to individuals (Tilcsik, 2021). It arises due to limitations in employers’ research techniques or the cost constraint of obtaining information in the asymmetry between employers and job seekers. Even without monopolistic power, statistical discrimination can occur in the labor market due to information-gathering methods. Employers are primarily interested in assessing candidates’ competitiveness when making recruitment decisions. However, obtaining this information directly is challenging, so employers rely on various indirect techniques.Discrimination carries both individual and societal economic costs. The social cost arises from the decrease in overall economic output caused by discrimination. However, this is still deemed efficient under imperfect information and aligns with the employer’s profit maximization goal. Therefore, it is likely that statistical discrimination in employment will persist.Extension of statistical discrimination theory in the digital ageThe digital economy has witnessed the application of various artificial intelligence technologies in the job market. Consequently, the issue of algorithmic hiring discrimination has emerged, shifting the focus of statistical discrimination theory from traditional hiring to intelligent hiring. The mechanisms that give rise to hiring discrimination problems remain similar, as both rely on historical data of specific populations to predict future hiring outcomes.While AI recruiting offers numerous benefits, it is also susceptible to algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic and replicable errors in computer systems that lead to unequally and discrimination based on legally protected characteristics, such as race and gender (Jackson, 2021). When assessments consistently overestimate or underestimate a particular group’s scores, they produce “predictive bias” (Raghavan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, these discriminatory results are often overlooked or disregarded due to the misconception that AI processes are inherently “objective” and “neutral.”Despite algorithms aiming for objectivity and clarity in their procedures, they can become biased when they receive partial input data from humans. Modern algorithms may appear neutral but can disproportionately harm protected class members, posing the risk of “agentic discrimination” (Prince and Schwarcz, 2019). If mishandled, algorithms can exacerbate inequalities and perpetuate discrimination against minority groups (Lloyd, 2018).Within the recruitment process, algorithmic bias can manifest concerning gender, race, color, and personality.Research methodologyThe primary research strategy was a literature review approach. This review aimed to assess current research on recruitment supported by artificial intelligence algorithms. The systematic review process included gathering and evaluating the selected studies’ literature and topics. Driven by the direction of the research, studies focusing on algorithmic discrimination in recruitment over the past 10 years were included unless past literature was worth reviewing. This is because this is a relatively new phenomenon that has become prominent over the past 10 years. In defining the “algorithmic and hiring discrimination” literature, a fairly broad approach was taken based on article keywords rather than publication sources. Depending on the focus, keywords related to algorithms and hiring discrimination were included in the search string. The keyword search algorithm for this review is as follows. (“artificial intelligence” and “hiring discrimination”), (“algorithms” and “recruitment discrimination”), (artificial intelligence” and “recruitment discrimination”), and (“algorithms” and “hiring discrimination”). SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science are three well-known search engines frequently used by the academic community and meet the criteria for technology-related topics in this review. WOS is used as a starting point for high-quality peer-reviewed scholarly articles. The study selected these three databases, used search engines, and maintained ten years. After applying an initial screening related to titles, keywords, or abstracts, the literature was selected based on its relevance to the research topic.The obtained literature was studied in depth to reveal the surfaced themes. Several systematic research themes were identified, including AI-based recruitment applications and benefits, causes of algorithmic discrimination, which algorithmic recruitment discrimination exists, and algorithmic recruitment discrimination resolution.The process applied for the reviews depicted in Fig. 1. After excluding duplicates and less relevant and outdated literature, only 45 articles could be used as references for this study (referred to Table 1). The literature review shows that most of the research on algorithmic hiring discrimination has occurred in recent years. The research trend indicates that algorithmic hiring discrimination will be a hot research topic in the coming period.

1.
The first theme is the application of various aspects of recruitment based on artificial intelligence support and its benefits. Bogen and Rieke (2018), Ahmed (2018), Hmoud and Laszlo (2019), Albert (2019), van Esch et al. (2019), Köchling et al. (2022), and Chen (2023) consider the recruitment process as a set of tasks that may be divided into four steps sourcing, screening, interviewing, and selection. Each step includes different activities, and AI algorithms can change how each stage is executed. Some studies point out that AI-supported recruitment has benefits. Beattie et al. (2012), Newell (2015), Raub (2018), Miasato and Silva (2019), Beneduce (2020), and Johnson et al. (2020) state that it can reduce costs; Hmoud and Laszlo (2019), Johansson and Herranen (2019), Raveendra et al. (2020), Black and van Esch (2020), and Allal-Chérif et al. (2021) suggest it saves time; Upadhyay and Khandelwal (2018) and Johansson and Herranen (2019) present it reducing transactional workload.


2.
The second theme is the causes of algorithmic discrimination. McFarland and McFarland (2015), Mayson (2018), Raso et al. (2018), Raub (2018), Raghavan et al. (2020), Njoto (2020), Zixun (2020), and Jackson (2021) suggest that the reason for algorithmic discrimination is related to data selection. Data collection tends to prefer accessible, “mainstream” organizations unequally dispersed by race and gender. Inadequate data will screen out groups that have been historically underrepresented in the recruitment process. Predicting future hiring outcomes by observing historical data can amplify future hiring inequalities. Yarger et al. (2019), Miasato and Silva (2019), and Njoto (2020) propose that discrimination is due to the designer-induced selection of data features.

The third theme is which algorithmic recruitment discrimination exists. According to Correll et al. (2007), Kay et al. (2015), O’neil (2016), Raso et al. (2018), Miasato and Silva (2019), Langenkamp et al. (2019), Faragher (2019), Ong (2019), Fernández and Fernández (2019), Beneduce (2020), Jackson (2021), Yarger et al. (2023), and Avery et al. (2023), when partial human data is provided to a machine, so the algorithm is biased, it will eventually lead to the risk of “agent discrimination.” In recruitment, algorithmic bias can manifest in gender, race, skin color, and personality.


4.
The fourth theme is algorithmic recruitment discrimination resolution. Kitchin and Lauriault (2015), Bornstein (2018), Raso et al. (2018), Xie et al. (2018), Raub (2018), Bornstein (2018), Grabovskyi and Martynovych (2019), Amini et al. (2019), Shin and Park (2019), Yarger et al. (2019), Gulzar et al. (2019), Kessing (2021) Jackson (2021), and Mishra (2022) argue that fair data sets need to be constructed and algorithmic transparency needs to be improved. Moreover, Smith and Shum (2018), Mitchell et al. (2019), Ong (2019), Zuiderveen Borgesius (2020), Peña et al. (2020), Kim et al. (2021), Yang et al. (2021), and Jackson (2021) propose that from a management perspective, data governance need be strengthened, including internal ethical governance and external ethical oversight.

AI-based recruitment applications and benefitsArtificial Intelligence and algorithmThe idea of machine intelligence dates back to 1950, when Turing, the father of computer science, asked, “Can machines think?” (Ong, 2019). The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy. Although early scientists made outstanding contributions, artificial intelligence became an industry after the 1980s with hardware development. Initial applications of artificial intelligence were seen in the automation of repeated and complicated work assignments, like industrial robot production, that displaced human work in some plants. After the mid-1990s, artificial intelligence software saw significant advances. Until today’s digital economy, AI has been commonly used in various industries (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019).Artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of something like a machine to understand, learn, and interpret on its own in a human-like manner (Johansson and Herranen, 2019). Artificial intelligence aims “to understand and simulate human thought processes and to design machines that mimic this behavior.” It is designed to be a thinking machine with a level of human intelligence (Jackson, 2021). However, large amounts of data must be combined with fast and iterative intelligent algorithms to handle this process, allowing ML systems to learn from patterns or features in the data automatically.A set of instructions or commands used to carry out a particular operation is known as an algorithm. This digital process makes decisions automatically depending on the data entered into the program (Miasato and Silva, 2019). The algorithm analyzes massive data patterns through data mining, searching, and using ways to predict, like our point of view encoded in the code. It explores the dataset using agents representing various traits, such as race, sexual orientation, and political opinions (Njoto, 2020). The algorithms frequently contain these biases due to the lengthy history of racial and gender prejudices, both intentional and unconscious. When biases exist in algorithmic data, AI may replicate these prejudices in its decision-making, a mistake known as algorithmic bias (Jackson, 2021).AI-based recruitment stageThe recruitment procedure is a series of events that may be divided into four significant steps: searching, screening, interviewing, and selection (Bogen and Rieke, 2018). Each phase includes various activities, and artificial intelligence technology can influence the execution of each stage.The searching phase aims at a system for searching web content. It screens passive job applicants online through social media and recruitment platforms, analyzing their profiles according to predefined job descriptions. The search engine recognizes the meaning of the searched content and performs a web-based search to match candidates’ profiles based on semantic annotations of job postings and profiles (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019).The screening phase includes evaluating and assessing the qualifications of candidates, where AI technology assists recruiters in scoring candidates and evaluating their competencies (Bogen and Rieke, 2018). The resumes are screened to match the job description better. The system can rank candidates according to the relevance of the qualification metrics.The following phase is the interview. It is probably the most individual stage of the selection process and, thus, unlikely to be fully automated by artificial intelligence. However, some AI tools enable recruiters to conduct video interviews and research candidates’ reactions, voice tones, and facial expressions (Ahmed, 2018).The final stage is the selection stage, which is the stage where the employer makes the final employment decision. In this stage, AI systems can calculate remuneration and benefits for companies and anticipate the risk that candidates would violate workplace rules. (Bogen and Rieke, 2018).AI-based recruitment benefitsRecruitment qualityBeattie et al. (2012) found that some large companies believe unconscious bias affects recruitment quality. Organizations may need to hire more qualified people to avoid financial losses (Newell, 2015). Artificial intelligence has become a part of the recruitment industry to automate the recruiting and selecting process, which can remove unconscious human bias that affects the hiring process (Raub, 2018). One of the ideas behind the development of AI in the selection of candidates is to bring higher standards to the selection process independent of the thoughts and beliefs of the interviewer (Miasato and Silva, 2019). Artificial intelligence tools can start with accurate job descriptions and targeted advertisements that match a candidate’s skills and abilities to job performance and create a profile of every candidate that indicates which candidate is best suited for the job (Johnson et al. 2020). In addition, automated resume screening systems allow recruiters to consider more candidates that would be overlooked (Beneduce, 2020). With advances in AI technology, candidate selection becomes impersonal based on data shared with the company and available on the Internet.Recruitment efficiencyHR departments may receive many candidates for every position. Traditional screening and selection that depends on human intervention to evaluate candidate information is the most expensive and discouraging hiring process (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019). Artificial intelligence can accelerate the hiring procedure, produce an outstanding candidate experience, and reduce costs (Johansson and Herranen, 2019). It can bring job information to applicants faster, allowing them to make informed decisions about their interests early in the hiring process. Artificial intelligence can also screen out many uninterested applicants and remove them from the applicant pool, thus reducing the number of applicants recruiters need to select later. It is even possible to source reticent candidates with the help of artificial intelligence and have more time to concentrate on the best match. Artificial intelligence can not only automate the evaluation of hundreds of resumes on a large scale in a short period, but it can also automatically classify candidates based on the job description provided. Moreover, The final results after the hiring decision can be more easily fed back to the candidate (Raveendra et al., 2020).Transactional workloadThe application of AI in recruitment can be described as a “new era in human resources” because artificial intelligence replaces the routine tasks performed by human recruiters, thus changing the traditional practices of the recruitment industry (Upadhyay and Khandelwal, 2018). Most professionals believe that AI is beneficial to recruiters in terms of reducing routine and administrative tasks (Johansson and Herranen, 2019). Recruiters will hand over time-consuming administrative tasks like recruiting, screening, and interviewing to AI, allowing more scope for recruiters to concentrate on strategic affairs (Upadhyay and Khandelwal, 2018).Theme II. Why is there algorithmic recruitment discriminationAlgorithms are not inherently discriminatory, and engineers rarely intentionally introduce bias into algorithms. However, bias can still arise in algorithmic recruitment. This issue is closely linked to the fundamental technology behind AI and ML. The ML process can be simplified into several stages, each involving three key components contributing to algorithmic bias: dataset construction, the engineer’s target formulation, and feature selection (36KE, 2020). When the dataset lacks diverse representation from different companies, bias may be introduced during the development of algorithmic rules by engineers and when annotators handle unstructured data (Zixun, 2020).Datasets: bias soilDatasets serve as the foundation of machine learning (ML). If an algorithm’s data collection lacks quantity and quality, it will fail to represent reality objectively, leading to inevitable bias in algorithmic decisions. Researchers commonly use a 95% confidence level, which provides 95% certainty but still leaves a one in twenty chance of bias (Raub, 2018). Nearly every ML algorithm relies on biased databases.One issue arises when datasets are skewed towards accessible and more “mainstream” groups due to the ease of data collection. Consequently, there is an imbalance in the distribution concerning gender and race dimensions (36KE, 2020). If the collected data inadequately represent a particular race or gender, the resulting system will inevitably overlook or mistreat them in its performance. In the hiring process, insufficient data may exclude historically underrepresented groups (Jackson, 2021). Assessing the success of potential employees based on existing employees perpetuates a bias toward candidates who resemble those already employed (Raghavan et al., 2020).Without careful planning, most datasets consist of unstructured data acquired through observational measures, lacking rigorous methods in controlled environments (McFarland and McFarland, 2015). This can lead to significant issues with misreporting. When algorithms play a role in decision-making, underrepresented individuals are unequally positioned. Furthermore, as AI improves the algorithm, the model accommodates the lack of representation, reducing sensitivity to the underrepresented groups. The algorithm favors the represented group, operating less effectively for other groups (Njoto, 2020).Existing social biases are introduced into the dataset. The raw data already reflects social prejudices, and the algorithm also incorporates biased relationships, leading to the “bias in and bias out” phenomenon (36KE, 2020). This phenomenon means that discrimination and disparities exist, just like in forecasting, where historical inequalities are projected into the future and may even be amplified (Mayson, 2018).A research team at Princeton University discovered that algorithms lack access to the absolute truth. The machine corpus contains biases that closely resemble the implicit biases observed in the human brain. Artificial intelligence has the potential to perpetuate existing patterns of bias and discrimination because these systems are typically trained to replicate the outcomes achieved by human decision-makers (Raso et al. 2018). What is worse, the perception of objectivity surrounding high-tech systems obscures this fact.In summary, if an algorithmic system is trained on biased and unrepresentative data, it runs the risk of replicating that bias.Data feature selection: designer biasThe introduction of bias is sometimes not immediately apparent in model construction because computer scientists are often not trained to consider social issues in context. It is crucial to make them aware of attribute selection’s impact on the algorithm (Yarger et al., 2019).The algorithm engineer plays a crucial role in the entire system, from setting goals for machine learning to selecting the appropriate model and determining data characteristics such as labels. If inappropriate goals are set, bias may be introduced from the outset (36KE, 2020).An engineer is responsible for developing the algorithmic model. If they hold certain beliefs and preconceptions, those personal biases can be transmitted to the machine (Njoto, 2020). Although the device is responsible for selecting employee resumes, it operates based on underlying programming. The programmer guides the AI in making decisions about the best candidate, which can still result in discrimination (Miasato and Silva, 2019).Furthermore, personal biases can manifest in the selection of data characteristics. For example, engineers may prioritize specific features or variables based on how they want the machine to behave (Miasato and Silva, 2019)). The Amazon hiring case illustrates this, where engineers considered education, occupation, and gender when assigning labels to the algorithm. When gender is considered the crucial criterion, it influences how the algorithm responds to the data.Theme III. Which algorithmic recruitment discrimination existsIn the recruitment process, algorithmic bias can be manifested in terms of gender, race, color, and personality.GenderGender stereotypes have infiltrated the “lexical embedding framework” utilized in natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML). Munson’s research indicates that “occupational picture search outcomes slightly exaggerate gender stereotypes, portraying minority-gender occupations as less professional” ((Avery et al., 2023; Kay et al., 2015).The impact of gender stereotypes on AI hiring poses genuine risks (Beneduce, 2020). In 2014, Amazon developed an ML-based hiring tool, but it exhibited gender bias. The system did not classify candidates neutrally for gender (Miasato and Silva, 2019). The bias stemmed from training the AI system on predominantly male employees’ CVs (Beneduce, 2020). Accordingly, the recruitment algorithm perceived this biased model as indicative of success, resulting in discrimination against female applicants (Langenkamp et al. 2019). The algorithm even downgraded applicants with keywords such as “female” (Faragher, 2019). These findings compelled Amazon to withdraw the tool and develop a new unbiased algorithm. However, this discrimination was inadvertent, revealing the flaws inherent in algorithmic bias that perpetuates existing gender inequalities and social biases (O’neil, 2016).RaceMicrosoft’s chatbot Tay learned to produce sexist and racist remarks on Twitter. By interacting with users on the platform, Tay absorbed the natural form of human language, using human tweets as its training data. Unfortunately, the innocent chatbot quickly adopted hate speech targeting women and black individuals. As a result, Microsoft shut down Tay within hours of its release. Research has indicated that when machines passively absorb human biases, they can reflect subconscious biases (Fernández and Fernández, 2019; Ong, 2019). For instance, searches for names associated with Black individuals were more likely to be accompanied by advertisements featuring arrest records, even when no actual records existed. Conversely, searches for names associated with white individuals did not prompt such advertisements (Correll et al., 2007). A study on racial discrimination revealed that candidates with white names received 50% more interview offers than those with African-American names.Skin colorIn 2015, Google’s photo application algorithm erroneously labeled a photo of two black people as gorillas (Jackson, 2021). The algorithm was insufficiently trained to recognize images with dark skin tones (Yarger et al., 2023). The company publicly apologized and committed to immediately preventing such errors. However, three years later, Google discontinued its facial identification service, citing the need to address significant technical and policy issues before resuming this service. Similarly, in 2017, an algorithm used for a contactless soap dispenser failed to correctly identify shades of skin color, resulting in the dispenser only responding to white hands and not detecting black and brown ones. These cases serve as examples of algorithmic bias (Jackson, 2021).PersonalityThe algorithm assesses word choice, tone shifts, and facial expressions (using facial recognition) to determine the candidate’s “personality” and alignment with the company culture (Raso et al., 2018). Notable examples include correlating longer tenure in a specific job with “high creativity” and linking a stronger inclination towards curiosity to a higher likelihood of seeking other opportunities (O’neil, 2016). Additionally, sentiment analysis models are employed to gauge the level of positive or negative emotions conveyed in sentences.Theme IV. How decreasing algorithmic recruitment discriminationChanges should be made at the technical and regulatory levels to ensure that AI algorithms do not replicate existing biases or introduce new ones based on the provided data (Raub, 2018).Building fair algorithms from a technical perspectiveConstructing a more unbiased datasetUnfair datasets are the root cause of bias. Therefore, a direct approach to addressing algorithmic bias is reconfiguring unbalanced datasets. Using multiple data points can yield more accurate results while carefully eliminating data points that reflect past biases. However, this approach incurs significant costs (Bornstein, 2018).Another method is to correct data imbalances by using more equitable data sources to ensure fair decision-making (36KE, 2020). Understanding the underlying structure of training data and adjusting the significance of specific data points during training based on known latent distributions makes it possible to uncover hidden biases and remove them automatically. For example, Microsoft revised their dataset for training the Face API, resulting in a 20-fold reduction in the recognition error ratio between men and women with darker skin tones and a 9-fold reduction for women by balancing factors such as skin color, age, and gender (Grabovskyi and Martynovych, 2019).Integrating “small data” and “big data” can enhance accuracy (36KE, 2020). Data should not solely rely on extensive collections but also focus on precision. While big data analysis tends to emphasize correlations, which can lead to errors when inferring causation, small data, which is more user-specific, offers detailed information and helps avoid such mistakes. Combining the vastness of big data with the precision of small data can help somewhat mitigate hiring errors (Kitchin and Lauriault, 2015).Biases in datasets can be identified through autonomous testing. The inaccuracies stemming from incomplete past data can be addressed through “oversampling” (Bornstein, 2018). Researchers from MIT demonstrated how an AI system called DB-VEA (unsupervised learning) can automatically reduce bias by re-sampling data. This approach allows the model to learn facial features such as skin color and gender while significantly reducing categorization biases related to race and gender (Amini et al., 2019).Therefore, constructing a more unbiased dataset is one of the methods that can be employed to tackle algorithmic bias.Enhancing algorithmic transparencyEngineers write algorithmic models, but they often need help understanding the processes that AI undergoes to produce a specific outcome. Many algorithmic biases are difficult to fully understand because their techniques and methods are not easily visible. This leaves many people unaware of why or how they are discriminated against and lacks public accountability (Jackson, 2021). There is an issue of “algorithmic black box” in ML. Therefore, transparency would facilitate remediation when deviant algorithms are discovered and solve the current “black box” dilemma (Shin and Park, 2019).Technological tools against biasData blending process. Blendoor is inclusive recruiting and staffing analytics software that mitigates unconscious bias. It takes candidate profiles from existing online job boards and applicant tracking systems to reduce unconscious bias. Blendoor “blends” candidate profiles by removing names, photos, and dates (Yarger et al., 2019). Thus, Blendoor promotes design fairness by assisting underrepresented job seekers and encoding equal opportunity in the algorithm.Decoupling technique. In resume screening, this technique allows the algorithm to identify the best candidates by considering variables optimized for other applicants based on specific categories like gender or race rather than the entire applicant pool (Raso et al., 2018). It means that the characteristics selected for minority or female applicants will be determined according to the trends of other minority or female applicants, which may differ from the features identified as successful representatives.Word embedding. Microsoft researchers found that words exhibit distinct associations in news and web data. For instance, words like “fashion” and “knitting” are more closely related to females, while “hero” and “genius” are more closely related to males (36KE, 2020). Microsoft suggests a simple solution by removing the gender-specific measures in word embedding to reduce “presentation bias.”Differential testing. Scientists at Columbia University developed Deep Xplore, a software that highlights vulnerabilities in algorithmic neural networks via “coaxing” the system to make mistakes (Xie et al., 2018). Deep Xplore utilizes discrepancy testing, which involves comparing several systems and observing their outputs’ differences. A model is considered vulnerable if all other models consistently predict a particular input while only one model predicts it differently (Gulzar et al., 2019).Bias detection tool. In September 2018, Google introduced the innovative What-If tool for detecting bias (Mishra, 2022). It assists designers in identifying the causes of misclassification, determining decision boundaries, and detecting algorithmic fairness through interactive visual interfaces. Additionally, Facebook has developed Fairness Flow, an emerging tool for correcting algorithmic bias. Fairness Flow automatically notifies developers if an algorithm makes unfair judgments based on race, gender, or age (Kessing, 2021).Improving the algorithm’s ethics from a management perspectiveInternal ethics governanceSeveral major technology companies have published AI principles addressing bias governance, signaling the start of self-regulation (36KE, 2020). Microsoft has formed an AI and ethical standards committee to enforce these principles, subjecting all future AI products to ethics scrutiny (Smith and Shum, 2018). Google has responded by introducing a Model Card function, similar to an algorithm manual, that explains the employed algorithm, highlights strengths and weaknesses, and even shares operational results from various datasets (Mitchell et al., 2019).Algorithmic systems undergo audits to prevent unintended discrimination and make necessary adjustments to ensure fairness (Kim et al., 2021). Regular internal audits allow companies to monitor, identify, and correct biased algorithms. Increased involvement from multiple parties in the data collection process and continuous algorithm monitoring are essential to reduce or eliminate bias (Jackson, 2021). Some companies have introduced AI-HR audits, similar to traditional HR audits, to review employee selection and assess the reliability of AI algorithms and ML data (Yang et al., 2021). Companies should also stay updated on recruitment laws and regulations and ensure compliance with legal requirements.Considering the programmers behind these algorithms, diversity in the high-tech industry is crucial. Algorithms often reflect the opinions of those who create them. The persistent underrepresentation of women, African-Americans, and Latino professionals in the IT workforce leads to biased algorithms. For instance, a study in 2019 found that only 2.5% of Google’s employees were black, while Microsoft and Facebook had only 4% representation. Another study revealed that 80% of AI professors in 2018 were male. Involving diverse individuals in data collection and training can regulate and eliminate human bias rooted in algorithms (Jackson, 2021).Although self-regulation can help reduce discrimination and influence lawmakers, it has potential drawbacks. Self-regulation lacks binding power, necessitating external oversight through third-party testing and the development of AI principles, laws, and regulations by external agencies.External supervisionTo ensure transparency and accountability in recruitment, third-party certification and testing of AI products can help mitigate the negative impacts of unreliability. At the “Ethics and Artificial Intelligence” technical conference held at Carnegie Mellon University, the director of Microsoft Research Institute proposed a solution to ensure consistent standards and transparency in AI. Microsoft’s proposal, “Allowing third-party testing and comparison,” aims to uphold the integrity of AI technology in the market (Ong, 2019).Various organizations have issued principles promoting equity, ethics, and responsibility in AI (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2020). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has provided recommendations on AI, while the European Commission has drafted proposals regarding the influence of algorithmic systems on human rights. In 2019, the European Commission established a high-level expert group on AI, which proposed ethical guidelines and self-regulatory measures regarding AI and ethics.Public organizations have played a role in establishing mechanisms to safeguard algorithmic fairness. The Algorithm Justice League (AJL) has outlined vital behaviors companies should follow in a signable agreement. Holding accountable those who design and deploy algorithms improves existing algorithms in practice (36KE, 2020). After evaluating IBM’s algorithm, AJL provided feedback, and IBM responded promptly, stating that they would address the identified issue. As a result, IBM significantly improved the accuracy of its algorithm in minority facial identification.Data protection and non-discrimination laws safeguard against discriminatory practices in algorithmic decision-making. In the EU region, Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees the rights and freedoms outlined in the Convention, prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2020). Non-discrimination laws, particularly those about indirect discrimination, serve as a means to prevent various forms of algorithmic discrimination. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in May 2018, addresses the impact of ML algorithms and offers a “right to explanation” (e.g., Articles 13–15) (Peña et al., 2020), enabling individuals to request explanations for algorithmic decisions and demand measures to avoid discriminatory influences when handling sensitive data. The GDPR mandates organizations to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), with each EU member state must maintain an independent data protection authority vested with investigative powers. Under the GDPR, a data protection authority can access an organization’s premises and computers using personal data (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2020).Investigation and analysisBased on Grounded Theory, this section uses a qualitative research approach to explore AI-supported recruitment applications and discrimination.Sources and methodsResearch methodologyThe study is based on Grounded Theory and qualitative analysis of interview data. Glaser and Strauss (1965,1968) proposed this theory. The basic idea is constructing a theory based on empirical data (Charmaz and Thornberg, 2021). Researchers generally do not make any theoretical assumptions before starting scientific research but start directly from a realistic point of view and summarize several empirical concepts in primary data, which are then raised to systematic theoretical knowledge. Grounded Theory must be supported by empirical evidence, but its most significant characteristic is not its practical nature but the extraction of new ideas from existing facts.Grounded Theory is a qualitative approach to research that focuses on the importance of “primary sources” (Timmermans and Tavory, 2012). In the study of AI-driven hiring discrimination, the systematic collection and analysis of data are used to uncover intrinsic patterns, construct relevant concepts, and refine relevant theoretical models instead of adopting theoretical assumptions. The current research on the influence factors and measures of AI-driven recruitment discrimination is not intensive enough and lacks corresponding theoretical support. At the same time, Grounded Theory extracts from “primary data” and constructs a theoretical model to study AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination.Interviewees and content
Participants in the interview
The interview period was June 2023, and the interview form was a face-to-face live/video/telephone interview. The interviewees were selected considering representativeness, authority, and operability, and ten people with experience in recruiting or interviewing with the help of intelligent tools were finally selected for the study. The basic information of the interviewees is shown in Table 2. The study was conducted with the interviewees’ consent. Each interview lasted about 30 min, and notes were taken during the interview. The number of interviewees was determined based on the principle of information saturation.Table 2 Basic information of formal interviewees.Full size table
Before conducting interviews, a large amount of data is collected to understand AI-driven hiring discrimination and propose appropriate improvement strategies. A study of AI-driven hiring discrimination was conducted using “dynamic sampling” and “information saturation” methods.
Interview outline
The interview outline was set in advance around the core objectives of this study, including the following six questions: “Do you know about AI-driven recruitment,” “How do you think about AI-driven recruitment discrimination,” “What do you think is the cause of AI-driven recruitment discrimination,” “Types of AI-driven hiring discrimination,” “Strategies to solve AI-driven hiring discrimination,” and “What other suggestions do you have.” Based on the predefined interview outline, appropriate adjustments were made as the interview progressed.
Interview ethics
The interview process is based on three main principles—the right-to-know principle. The interviewer fully understands the purpose, content, and use of the interview before being interviewed, the principle of objectivity. The researcher will guide the respondent to ask questions and answer what they cannot understand. Respondents make objective statements of their willingness that are not influenced by external factors, the principle of confidentiality. Interviews will be conducted anonymously, and the personal information of the interviewees will not be disclosed. The interviewee’s privacy is fully respected, and the original data is replaced by figures, which will be used only for the interviewer’s reference and analysis, appropriately kept by the interviewer, and used only for this study and no other purpose.
Interview tools
Nvivo 12.0 Plus qualitative analysis software was used as an auxiliary tool to clarify ideas and improve work efficiency.
Data organization after the interview
Within two working days after the completion of the interview, the analysis and organization of the interview data was completed. The Nvivo 12 plus software coded the interview data in three layers from the bottom up, with the content as the center.
The first layer was open coding. The interview data of 10 interviewees were imported and, using the software, parsed word by word to clarify the meaning of words and sentences, give an interpretation of the data, and obtain free nodes. The data from each section was summarized and inferred to organize the interviewees’ perceptions of AI-driven recruitment, and each node was given a name to derive the first-level nodes.
Next, the second-level spindles were coded. The researchers unfolded the induction of interrelated classes for the nodes formed by the open coding, constructed the relationship between concepts and classes, and coded a spindle concept, which, after the spindle coding, would form a second-level node.
The third part is the three-level core coding. Another coding core class genus is selected based on the secondary spindle, and a tertiary code is developed.
Interview quality control
In order to ensure the credibility of the interview results, the method adopted in this study is to use a uniform way of asking questions to different interviewees. Each round of interviews should be kept between 20 and 30 min. Too long an interval will reduce the effectiveness of feedback on the questions. Also, interviews should not span more than one month to ensure the timeliness of the information obtained.
ResultsApplying the Nvivo12 Plus qualitative analysis method, 182 free nodes were obtained by three-level coding, 31 primary nodes were formed after analogy, and 11 secondary nodes were deduced inductively. Finally, five core genera of tertiary nodes were identified (see Table 3).Table 3 Summary of nodes and reference points at all levels after coding of interview data.Full size tableOpen level 1 codingThe interviews with 10 respondents resulted in 182 words and sentences related to AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination, which were conceptualized and merged to form 31 open-ended Level 1 codes.Main-axis second-level codingThe spindle codes were analyzed through cluster analysis to analyze the correlation and logical order among the primary open codes, forming more generalized categories. Eleven spindle codes were extracted and summarized.Core-type tertiary codingThe Grounded Theory steps resulted in 31 open primary and 11 secondary spindle codes. Further categorization and analysis revealed that when “AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination” is used as the core category, the five main categories are AI-driven recruitment applications, AI-driven recruitment effects, causes of AI-driven recruitment discrimination, types of AI-driven recruitment discrimination, and AI-driven recruitment discrimination measures.The coding process described above was exemplified by an interview with a researcher, F2, who had taught information science at a university for 2 years and was now employed at an intelligent technology R&D company. After the interview, F1’s information was analyzed and explored in a three-level coding process.Under the three-level node AI-driven recruitment application, F2 suggested that the AI tools currently developed could assist companies with simple recruitment tasks, including online profile retrieval, analysis, and evaluation. However, this technical engineer suggested that candidate assessment for high-level positions suits human-machine collaboration, although machines have an advantage in candidate profile searches.Supported by three-level nodes of AI-driven recruiting effectiveness, F2 suggests that machine applications in recruiting can relieve human transactional workload, and chatbot Q&A services improve recruiting efficiency.In the context of the causes of AI-driven hiring discrimination at the third level, F2 suggests that some job seekers are unfamiliar with the hiring interface and how to use it, leading to unfair interviews. She suggested the need for organizers to prepare usage guidelines or mock interview exercises. She argues that much of the data needed for intelligent machine learning comes from internal companies or external market supplies and that this data lacks fair scrutiny. It is even possible that the source data fed into the machines is compromised.Under the tertiary node AI-driven hiring discrimination, F2 is concerned that the machines may misevaluate candidates due to individual differences, such as intelligence, or external characteristics, such as skin color. Moreover, some discriminatory judgments are difficult to resolve under current technology.Under the tertiary node AI-driven hiring discrimination measures, F2 proposes utilizing technical tools, such as learning impartial historical data, or non-technical tools, such as anti-AI discrimination laws. She argues that in the future, humans use AI tools to solve more complex decisions, not just limited to hiring. Instead, humans need to embrace and accept the widespread use of machines.Synthesizing the above analysis, the final overview of the AI-driven recruitment application and discrimination framework is obtained (see Fig. 3). After the conceptual model was constructed, the remaining original information was coded and comparatively analyzed, and no new codes were generated, indicating that this study was saturated.Fig. 3: AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination.The comprehensive analysis produces an overview of AI-driven recruitment applications and recognition frameworks.Full size imageDiscussionAn analysis of interview results conducted using Grounded Theory indicates that AI-supported hiring discrimination should be approached from five perspectives. These perspectives align with the thematic directions identified through our literature review.Firstly, AI-driven hiring applications impact various aspects, such as reviewing applicant profiles online, analyzing applicant information, scoring assessments based on hiring criteria, and generating preliminary rankings automatically.Secondly, interviewers perceive benefits in AI-driven recruitment for job seekers. It eliminates subjective human bias, facilitates automated matchmaking between individuals and positions, and provides automated response services. Moreover, AI reduces the workload on humans and enhances efficiency.Thirdly, concerns are raised regarding potential hiring discrimination perpetrated by machines. This can arise from AI tools, such as partial source data, or users unfamiliar with user interfaces and operations.Fourthly, intrinsic factors like personality and IQ, as well as extrinsic factors like gender and nationality, have been observed to influence the accurate identification and judgment of AI systems concerning hiring discrimination.Fifthly, respondents offer recommendations for combating discrimination by machines, including technical and non-technical approaches.Recommendations for future studiesThis study conducted a literature review to analyze algorithmic recruitment discrimination’s causes, types, and solutions. Future research on algorithmic recruitment discrimination could explore quantitative analysis or experimental methods across different countries and cultures. Additionally, future studies could examine the mechanics of algorithmic recruitment and the technical rules that impact the hiring process. It would be interesting to analyze the psychological effects of applying this algorithmic recruitment technique on various populations (gender, age, education level) from an organizational behavior perspective. While recent studies have primarily discussed discrimination theory in the traditional economy’s hiring market, future theoretical research should consider how advanced technology affects equity in hiring within the digital economy.ConclusionThe study concludes that the fourth industrial revolution introduced technological innovations significantly affecting the recruitment industry. It extends the analysis of statistical discrimination theory in the digital age and adopts a literature review approach to explore four themes related to AI-based recruitment. The study argues that algorithmic bias remains an issue while AI recruitment tools offer benefits such as improved recruitment quality, cost reduction, and increased efficiency. Recruitment algorithms’ bias is evident in gender, race, color, and personality. The primary source of algorithmic bias lies in partial historical data. The personal preferences of algorithm engineers also contribute to algorithmic bias. Technical measures like constructing unbiased datasets and enhancing algorithm transparency can be implemented to tackle algorithmic hiring discrimination. However, strengthening management measures, such as corporate ethics and external oversight, is equally important.

The primary research approach used is a literature review. The findings suggest that AI-enabled recruitment has the potential to enhance recruitment quality, increase efficiency, and reduce transactional work. However, algorithmic bias results in discriminatory hiring practices based on gender, race, color, and personality traits. The study indicates that algorithmic bias stems from limited raw data sets and biased algorithm designers. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement technical measures, such as unbiased dataset frameworks and improved algorithmic transparency, as well as management measures like internal corporate ethical governance and external oversight.

GovInsider speaks to experts from IBM to learn more about how governments can put foundation models to work at the service of the public sector.Foundation models are set to accelerate digital government endeavours in the coming years.

The Singapore Government is moving decisively to tap on generative AI – the country currently plans to build 100 generative AI solutions in 100 days and has already developed plans to move all public sector chatbots onto large language models (LLMs).
 

LLMs are just one of many foundation models – machine learning models that are trained on large unlabelled datasets, which can then be adapted to perform more specific tasks – that promise to make AI capabilities easily available to governments and enterprises. Right now, tech companies like IBM are training foundation models on a wide array of data, including code, geospatial data and IT events data, according to a new IBM report. 
 

GovInsider speaks to Cristina Caballe Fuguet, Senior Partner & Vice President, Global Government Leader, and Florian Breger, Vice President Civilian Government, Global Industries, IBM Technology, to understand the three key ways that foundation models can put AI to work for governments.
1. Improving citizen experiences
 

First and foremost, government leaders should prioritize the consideration of AI and generative AI use cases that improve citizen experiences. When finetuned with relevant domain knowledge, agencies can use generative AI to build applications that can support agencies in providing better, faster information and services to its citizens, Caballe and Breger said.
 

Take for example conversational AI chatbots powered by generative AI. These tools have the potential to manage large volume of citizen inquiries and interactions, allowing public sector agencies, and its limited resources, to focus on more value-added tasks, says Caballe. 
 

These interactions can then be used to further train the conversational models and continuously improve customer service, bringing more relevant and personalized information to each citizen based on previous interactions.
 

How does AI and foundational models work on a public facing solution? 
 

Recently, IBM partnered with Wimbledon to develop an AI solution that could:
 


Automatically identify key moments and produce highlight reels from thousands of hours of video
Add AI-generated spoken commentary to highlight reels
Provide data-driven predictions for players’ performance to fans

 

This AI platform was built on IBM’s enterprise-grade AI platform, watsonx. First, developers tapped on watsonx.data, a data store which enabled them to pool together a wide range of data sources to inform their machine learning models, while filtering out personally identifiable information, profanity, and hate speech. 
 

Next, the team selected a large language model from watsonx.ai, IBM’s studio for building, training and deploying generative AI models. Then, they finetuned the AI model with Wimbledon’s domain expertise, including tennis-specific terms and concepts.
 

Similarly, agencies can tap on foundation models from watsonx.ai to serve their unique citizen communication needs, from chatbots to parliamentary highlight reels.
2. Raising productivity, transforming operations
 

Second, foundation models can support government organisations in improving productivity and transforming operations in the back end. This generates a tremendous opportunity to exploit the vast amount of data for public use or to improve the internal decision-making process, resulting in increased productivity. 
 

As a matter of fact, according to recent studies, governments that embed generative AI solutions within their everyday operations can expect to see up to a 40 per cent increase in productivity, Caballe points out.
 

In the United States, IBM has partnered with NASA to build an open source geospatial foundation model that can pore through petabytes of satellite data to track deforestation, predict crop yields, and monitor greenhouse gas emissions, says Breger.
 

In the public sector, similar generative AI can support agencies in sifting through and summarising vast amounts of documents, applications and files, he explains. Even civil servants with extensive experience in programming can embrace these benefits. With a simple language request watsonx.ai can point them to concrete sources within the documents, helping the AI to remain explainable and trustworthy.
 

Watsonx.governance, one of the tools available later this year in the IBM watsonx studio, is a tool that will help organisations create responsible and transparent AI workflows with security and control throughout the entire AI lifecycle.
 

“You don't want government services powered by AI to have ‘hallucinated’ responses, or to get different answers for the same question,” he notes, highlighting the importance of having trusted and explainable AI for highly regulated industries like governments. In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore worked with IBM on a responsible AI toolkit to help financial institutions assess fairness and transparency when using AI.
 

Caballe adds that IBM offers a consulting practice that can support organisations in developing and deploying AI tools responsibly, and establishing a culture around the safe handling of AI, with full consideration of the potential risks and unintended effects. This practice can also help leaders identify the best use cases for AI within their teams.
3. Modernising applications
 

Finally, generative AI can support government agencies in modernising their technology applications, such as upgrading legacy applications to run in a cloud-native way. This is a key goal that Singapore’s GovTech has set for itself this year, as GovInsider previously reported.
 

“In government, there is currently a high priority to run large digital transformation programmes. AI can offer productivity gains of around 30 per cent when it comes to application modernisation,” says Caballe. 
 

This can range from helping organisations automatically generate code when migrating legacy applications to the cloud or building playbooks for automation code.  For example, the Watson Code Assistant can help developers generate secure and workable automation code for the Red Hat Ansible Automation platform, as GovInsider reported previously.
 

Once such code is generated, developers can review and modify the code if necessary. This can radically simplify the workload of government IT teams that oversee complex multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
 

This year, Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency announced a partnership with IBM to drive the modernisation of government services with IBM’s tech offerings, including generative AI.
 

But how can agencies begin to embrace the full benefits of foundation models? Caballe and Breger suggest that government leaders start leading their organizations in identifying initial use cases and pilots that can provide tangible value and go into production quickly as soon as possible.
 

Once such quick gains have been made, agencies can learn from the process to scale their AI strategy across their organisation with trusted tools like watsonx. 
 

In addition, IBM is currently conducting workshops with government agencies around the globe to help them discover next steps and potential pathways forward in implementing generative AI. It also offers pilots of its products, including watsonx.governance, for these organizations to experiment with the benefits of IBM’s open, trusted, targeted and empowering approach to generative AI.

AI is a large umbrella with various applications underneath. Two prominent branches have emerged under this umbrella: conversational AI and generative AI.







While conversational AI and generative AI may work together, they have distinct differences and capabilities. Artificial intelligence (AI) changed the way humans interact with machines by offering benefits such as automating mundane tasks and generating content. AI has ushered in a new era of human-computer collaboration as businesses embrace this technology to improve processes and efficiency.
Learn the differences between conversational AI and generative AI, and how they work together.

What is conversational AI and how does it work?
Conversational AI is a technology that helps machines interact and engage with humans in a more natural way. The interactions are like a conversation with back-and-forth communication. This technology is used in applications such as chatbots, messaging apps and virtual assistants. Examples of popular conversational AI applications include Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri.
Conversational AI models are trained on data sets with human dialogue to help understand language patterns. They use natural language processing and machine learning technology to create appropriate responses to inquiries by translating human conversations into languages machines understand.

The knowledge bases where conversational AI applications draw their responses are unique to each company. Business AI software learns from interactions and adds new information to the knowledge database as it consistently trains with each interaction. Humans also update these knowledge bases.
Conversational AI may also use predefined responses -- or rule-based systems -- for initial responses.


What is generative AI and how does it work?
Generative AI lets users create new content -- such as animation, text, images and sounds -- using machine learning algorithms and the data the technology is trained on. Generative AI uses deep learning and neural networks to create outputs. Examples of popular generative AI applications include ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Jasper AI.
Generative AI uses neural networks to identify patterns and other structures in its training data. It then generates new content based on predictions from these learned patterns. There are various learning approaches to train generative AI such as supervised learning, which uses human response and feedback to help generate more accurate content.
Organizations can create foundation models as a base for the AI systems to perform multiple tasks. Foundation models are AI neural networks or machine learning models that have been trained on large quantities of data. They can perform many tasks, such as text translation, content creation and image analysis because of their generality and adaptability. Examples of foundation models include GPT-4 and PaLM 2.





Main differences between conversational AI and generative AI functionality
Conversational AI and generative AI have different goals, applications, use cases, training and outputs. Both technologies have unique capabilities and features and play a big role in the future of AI.
Here is a breakdown of the differences between the two:

Objectives and goals. Conversational AI focuses on human conversations while generative AI focuses on creating content in various forms.
Use cases and applications. Conversational AI is used for applications such as customer service, virtual assistants and chatbots. Generative AI can be used to write works of fiction, marketing content and meta descriptions.
Learning and training data. Conversational AI is trained on large data sets with human input, conversations, user queries and responses. Generative AI is trained on different sets of data to learn patterns to create content with predictive patterns.
Input and output. Users input information in a conversation when using conversational AI. Conversational AI uses this interaction to create responses. Generative AI uses input and data to generate new content by using learned patterns.



Are conversational AI and generative AI mutually exclusive?
While each technology has its own application and function, they are not mutually exclusive. Consider an application such as ChatGPT -- it's conversational AI because it is a chatbot and also generative AI due to its content creation. While conversational AI is a specific application of generative AI, generative AI encompasses a broader set of tasks beyond conversations such as writing code, drafting articles or creating images.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Generative AI is undoubtedly redefining the future of work in all sectors and on a global scale. The technology could either cause replacements in easy-to-automate roles, or be an assistant in roles that still require a human touch.. Companies may need to plan accordingly and if they are to benefit from generative AI and not be caught unaware by its advancements.




The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, transforming every sector in which it has been applied. Having become mainstream through ChatGPT, the technology has been massively accepted and adopted, spreading like wildfire, much as the internet’s adoption in the 90s.
It took the World Wide Web seven years to reach 100m users — it took ChatGPT less than two months.
From accelerating tasks to automating others, generative AI has massively impacted both work and workers. While impressing companies and employers by how fast it operates and how diligently it can accomplish tasks, generative AI has also been a source of anxiety for employees who fear that the technology might rob them of their jobs.
In other words, “AI injects both magic and mayhem into the future of work,” according to Forrester Research in a recent report on the impact of generative AI in jobs. While generative AI will cause an evolution in work and what we know it to be, it is yet to be seen whether it will replace human workers or empower them in their roles.
The Impact of AI on Work: Replacement
According to the report, Forrester Research has monitored AI’s impact on jobs globally for nearly ten years. The company has gathered from this research that 36% of global workers employed full or part-time fear losing their jobs to automation in the next ten years.
However, the company reports that generative AI has most certainly been more disruptive than the rest of AI in this period due to how instantly it produces results. The intensity of the disruption is already causing job disruption in areas such as writing and graphic design, which have begun seeing changes.Advertisements




The rise has also been accompanied by many predictions, including one by Goldman Sachs, concluding that generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs to automation.
Another academic research by the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI found that “around 80% of the US workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted.”
In its research, however, Forrester predicts that automation and AI will replace 4.9% of US jobs by 2030. This means that 0.6% of workers in the US might lose their jobs annually. Of this percentage of jobs lost to automation, generative AI specifically will account for 30% of the losses.
In terms of the number of jobs, Forrester Research forecasts that generative AI will replace 90,000 jobs in 2023, growing to 2.4 million by 2030. These jobs will mainly consist of roles that are easy to automate and have high generative AI influence. These include technical writers, social science research assistants, proofreaders, and copywriters.
Source Forrester Research
The Impact of AI on Work: Influence
On the other hand, the research company found that generative AI will influence more jobs than it will replace. More precisely, Forrester predicts that by 2030, generative AI will influence more than 11 million jobs in the US, 4.5 times the number of jobs it replaces in the same period.
By influence, Forrester means that generative AI will play a part in “reshaping, retraining, and upskilling existing workers to incorporate generative AI tools into the daily workflow.” Jobs influenced by this technology will be those that are harder to automate, including editors, writers, authors, poets, lyricists, and creative writers, says Forrester.
Regarding the influence level, education is said to play a significant part. Based on the report, generative AI is predicted to influence workers with bachelor’s degrees and higher qualifications more than those with high school diplomas.
Workers with only a high school diploma, about 36 million, will see a 2.7% influence level on their jobs, whereas about 64 million workers with degrees will experience a 16% to 21% influence.
Occupations with lower educational requirements, like transportation and warehousing, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing, are expected to see very little influence on their work from generative AI.
Generative AI’s influence is predicted to increase with income, where jobs with annual salaries of less than $60,000 will see half the levels of generative AI influence than jobs paid $90,000 or more.
However, higher-earning professions, including many high-income managerial jobs, fall on the other side of the inverted U-shaped curve in that they see waning influence from generative AI. This is mainly because their jobs depend on AI-proof skills like human judgment, empathy, and leadership.
Source Forrester Research
New Opportunities
To cope with the replacements, a report by the McKinsey Global Institute shows that 12 million workers will have to transition to new roles by 2030. Many workers are expected to shift from customer service, office support, and food services to more healthcare, STEM, and managerial positions.
As a result of this shift, the economy is expected to re-weight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men.
In addition to replacing automatable roles and complimenting others, AI has also been predicted to cause the rise of new roles. According to a report on the Future of Work by the World Economic Forum (WEF), AI will cause the emergence of 69 million new roles globally.
The emerging roles that the WEF has highlighted since 2014 include Data Analysts/ Scientists, AI and Machine Learning Specialists, and Digital Transformation Specialists. Aside from these, the tech industry has witnessed the rise of prompt engineers, AI auditors, human-machine interaction designers, and AI ethicists, among others.
Building a Future With AI
Given the unpredictability of generative AI, seeing as it functions almost like a black box — it provides output given an input (although explainable AI is looking to change this), in addition to how young the technology still is, it is difficult to plan for every eventuality.
However, it is possible to build a strategic plan that better prepares a company for the future landscape. This not only helps the company keep up-to-date with the technology while leveraging it for better results, but it also helps employees work with the technology to be more productive and efficient.
According to Forrester Research, to survive and thrive in the generative AI era, a company needs to:
Invest in The Robotics Quotient (RQ)
The RQ is a metric that gauges how well people and organizations can adapt to, believe in, and use automation and AI to produce commercial success. This requires training staff, establishing new standards, fostering optimistic attitudes, and being open about AI’s role in an organization’s ambitions for the future of work.
Forrester believes that high RQ organizations will most successfully integrate generative AI to drive value. This will help the companies and employees not be phased out by AI but empowered by it instead.
Build Around Augmentation
Based on the reports, generative AI is predicted to influence more jobs than it will replace over the next decade. As such, companies should structure their strategy around integrating generative AI into the daily workflow.
Instead of restricting access to generative AI tools, companies should encourage them and prioritize more human-proof tasks like interacting with clients. For instance, asking Microsoft Excel’s Copilot to create a pivot table or calculate a correlation removes an arduous task, but it doesn’t replace the employee.
Instead, it augments their skill set and reduces the time to complete a specific task, creating more room for more vital tasks.
Identify High-Influence Roles
One way of getting ahead of the curve in integrating generative AI into the company is by identifying roles predicted to be highly impacted by AI and incorporating AI early. Forrester recommends equipping workers in jobs with high generative AI influence with early pilot tools.
By doing so, the company will have an early start to the technology, possibly gaining a competitive edge. This will also give the company enough time to test the technology and determine where it best applies in its use cases.
The Bottom Line
Considering the rate of advancement of technology, hiring the right skills for generative AI will be an evolving proposition. For example, prompt engineering is currently a hot skill. It endeavors to elicit the best possible answers from a generative AI system.
However, prompt engineering might decline in importance in favor of “problem formulation” as generative AI systems become more adept at understanding human intent or even begin to create their prompts.
Therefore, companies and recruitment managers should be forward-thinking about generative AI and hire people with broader qualifications in the area to avoid being phased out by the developments.

And the in-house counsel they serve want to see law firms using technology in legal service delivery. A Thompson Hine survey found that 96% of law department leaders and legal operations staff wish their law firms would use innovation (like trusted generative AI) to save them money. So legal professionals see the potential of generative AI and other advanced technologies. How do you get from an interest in the possibilities to seeing the impact of new tools? A new report from Thomson Reuters helps legal professionals see the path forward. Here are three key takeaways from “How generative AI will help lawyers improve legal service delivery.” Improving client outcomes is more important than simple automation Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates content from scratch. This could be text, music, images, or video. Some knowledge workers have expressed fears that generative AI will eventually put them out of a job because their businesses or clients will be able to do their work without them.  On the contrary. Yes, generative AI can help professionals reduce busy work. But more importantly, it helps them deliver better client outcomes. According to the report, “Some tasks will be automated, but the fundamental transformation will be how legal work is reimagined and improved. AI presents an enormous opportunity for legal because so much of what lawyers do today can be further enhanced with AI, and client outcomes can be improved.” Rather than replacing legal professionals, generative AI will help them spend time applying their considerable wisdom to legal matters – creating even more value for clients and businesses.   ChatGPT caught our imagination – trusted sources make it real The generative AI tools we choose make a big difference. Who trained the system? What data is it drawing from?  The answers to these questions determine the likelihood the system will offer up “hallucinations”: perfectly plausible-sounding answers that aren’t based on fact. For lawyers, relying on a hallucination could mean relying on inappropriate or made-up case law, or using model contract clauses that aren’t on market. “While ChatGPT can deliver answers that sound coherent and accurate, this type of AI is really just a sentence-completion engine,” according to the Thomson Reuters report. “ChatGPT has little intelligence but is very good at drafting language that sounds like plausible responses to a user’s prompt. But it’s not always accurate.” Legal professionals can use generative AI to improve client outcomes and streamline their workload if the AI is drawn from trusted data sources and overseen by experts in the data and legal tasks. Generative AI is not technology alone. It is a combination of domain expertise, quality data, and AI expertise. The quality of these three elements determines the tools suitability and reliability for a particular field, like legal practice.  Indeed, effective, trustworthy generative AI is comprised of three key elements: the data on which AI operates, the technology that makes it work for specific applications, and the human expertise that directs the technology to practical applications and solutions and informs training and error analysis.  Making sense of the intersection between AI and legal professionalsDiscover the clear connections between generative AI and legal work.  Watch on-demand today Corporate legal departments are leading the way While the Thompson Hine report showed that 96% of corporate law departments want their outside law firms to use innovation to save them money, only 12% say their primary outside law firms have done so.  Corporate legal departments are keen to use technologies themselves to improve processes and drive efficiency. Over time, they will continue to put pressure on outside counsel to match their pace. According to Thomson Reuters, “The most significant opportunity for law firms to leverage AI [is in] using data and technology to improve the quality and efficiency of the legal services delivered to clients. Leveraging technology has the biggest impact in areas where the capacity of humans to perform legal work has not kept pace with the explosion of data.” It seems that clients see the greatest possibilities for innovation and efficiency in data-rich practice areas and legal tasks like e-discovery, document drafting, due diligence, transaction management, and legal research. The report, “How generative AI will help lawyers improve legal service delivery” explores each of these dynamics in depth and explores specific uses of generative AI in legal practice.  Generative AI promises to profoundly change the way legal professionals deliver services. But not every lawyer will benefit equally. According to the report, “The winners among lawyers will not be the ones who passively wait for generative AI tools to come their way. Successful lawyers will understand that their domain knowledge is a competitive advantage as they help deploy AI systems that embody and amplify that knowledge.” That is, the ones who find the opportunities, rely on trusted tools, and innovate early will reap the greatest benefit.   Ready to learn more about how generative AI can help you elevate the way you deliver legal services?

At a Glance




Video game industry executives believe that within 5 to 10 years, AI could manage more than half of game development.
Most believe that AI will improve the quality of games and deliver them more quickly; fewer believe that AI will reduce costs.
AI is already being used in preproduction stages, planning out game content, and industry executives expect that within a few years, it will play a larger role in production, developing characters, dialogue, and environments.
Few expect AI to solve the industry's talent shortage, and many said that although the technology may free developers from mundane work, it won't replace the creative spark.






Generative AI is just beginning to have an effect on video games, but gaming industry executives believe that over the next 5 to 10 years, it will contribute to more than half of the video game development process.
Bain spoke with gaming industry executives about the potential and the challenges of generative AI for their industry. Most have high expectations for generative AI and the machine learning it’s based on, and they expect it to have a greater effect on their business than other transformative technologies, such as virtual reality or augmented reality and cloud gaming.



Most of these executives see generative AI improving quality and bringing games to market faster. Generative AI will also help make bigger, more immersive, and more personalized experiences a reality. Interestingly, only 20% of executives believe that generative AI will reduce costs, which might be a disappointment to some, given that top-tier games may cost as much as $1 billion to develop. As with any form of automation, there may be concerns about generative AI taking jobs. But most of the executives we spoke with (60%) don’t expect generative AI to have a significant effect on their talent model or alleviate the industry’s critical talent shortage.
Of the four steps in the video game life cycle—namely, preproduction concept development and planning, building the game (production), testing and launch, and ongoing live operations (postlaunch)—executives say they are deploying generative AI mostly in preproduction. For example, Blizzard Entertainment created Blizzard Diffusion, an image generator trained on its own hit titles, including World of Warcraft, to produce concept art for new ideas.
How will the use of generative AI evolve?
Over time, most executives expect generative AI to show more potential in production and later phases, particularly in several key areas (see Figure 1).

Story generation and nonplayable characters (NPCs): Generative AI could enable limitless interactive stories personalized for each player. NetEase, a Chinese game publisher, has already announced that it will use generative AI to create an NPC chat function in the upcoming mobile version of its massively multiplayer online game Justice Online.
Game assets: As confidence in the tools grows, generative AI could be used beyond concept art—for example, to fill in or even generate drafts of whole maps.
Live ops: While executives we spoke with focused mostly on the ability to rapidly generate new in-game assets, such as personalized skins, we see a significant opportunity ahead for generative AI to improve community management and player support.
User-generated content: Giving players access to generative AI tools could allow them to play a more central role in the story, increasing engagement and inviting players to support the never-ending demand for content.

Challenges to realizing generative AI’s potential
Although many executives expect IP concerns to be resolved within a few years, the complexities around rights and ownership of created content are significant, and the video game industry will likely face the same challenges as the broader media and entertainment industry.
And there are longer-term challenges as well.

Generative AI strategy: Gaming companies don’t yet have clear, well-developed strategies for making the most of generative AI. That’s common when a new technology arrives. But those that develop a thoughtful ambition and approach will see the earliest success and mitigate potential risks from improper use of the technology. Failing to deploy a disciplined approach to generative AI in the production process could create challenges around prioritization, resource allocation, and integration with existing processes.
Navigating a complex, nascent generative AI landscape: There are many companies entering this space, from scale leaders to niche players focusing on specific applications. The landscape changes from week to week, no single player offers everything, and it’s not clear yet which company’s products are the best.
Technology implementation: Executives see technical challenges as a major hurdle, including integrating generative AI into game engines and other development tools, as well as training the model for specific applications, developer styles, and franchises (see Figure 2).
Talent implications: Generative AI is a contentious subject, and any implementation should be treated with care. Most executives we spoke with agreed that the talent model will benefit by freeing up creatives from labor-intensive tasks, such as coding content for games. Content may be created quicker, but human creativity will remain the source of what makes a video game fun (game design, mechanics). Few expect generative AI to complete tasks all on its own, and many emphasized the importance of human oversight, guidance, and iteration. Only 10% are moderately or extremely concerned about the rise of generative AI. In general, they see generative AI as another tool on the bench of their designers and developers, one that may create new roles and require new training.

What should video game developers do?
Generative AI has risen in prominence so quickly that it caught many off guard. Four key steps can help gaming companies ensure that they’re on solid ground.

Take a disciplined and proactive approach to generative AI. As the hype around generative AI grows, many companies are jumping in without a clear strategy. Executives taking the time to agree on an ambition and approach alongside appropriate guardrails and governance will improve return on investment and limit risk.
Base decisions on what will benefit the player. The core goal is still creating fun, engaging games. Generative AI can help in many ways, but overreliance could also make it a hindrance. More content and engagement in a game does not guarantee a better player experience. This was the case earlier this year when developers of Forspoken adjusted the game to reduce the chattiness of main characters after players expressed frustration at the quantity of dialogue.
Strategically assess building vs. buying vs. partnering opportunities. A huge ecosystem of applications is evolving rapidly, providing a wide range of services. Developer-publishers should carefully assess when to build in-house, when to partner with scale players within the ecosystem, and when to partner with smaller, niche players.
Recognize this is more than a technological transformation. To achieve generative AI’s full potential, companies will need to stand up a new operating model by redesigning existing work processes, creating new processes, addressing downstream implications (including the impact on talent), and developing AI enterprise architecture strategy.

It’s an exciting time for the video game industry. Games are getting bigger, development costs are ballooning, and it remains as hard as ever to retain top talent. At the same time, players’ expectations are rising, as they’re demanding more immersive experiences and a bigger role in creating those experiences. Now, generative AI enters the game. There’s plenty of hype, but there’s also incredible potential, which, if harnessed properly, can deliver massive benefits to players, creators, and publishers.

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has the potential to alter nearly all aspects of society with large but uncertain impacts on the economy and labor market. Generative AI has progressed quickly in the last few years, in particular with the release of ChatGPT, prompting governments to grapple with ways to encourage AI development within the bounds of ethical and national security concerns. AI tools may disrupt several industries from the music industry and copywriting to manufacturing and human resources. Many questions remain around AI, including inaccurate decision-making and algorithmic bias (e.g., facial recognition doing a worse job of identifying black female faces); lack of interpretability; information provenance (e.g., privacy concerns, deep fakes, and misinformation); and supply chain issues. AI may also increase inequality as AI tools consolidate the wealth and dominance of particular companies and individuals.
To maintain American leadership in AI and ensure a just integration of technology, the federal government, including the national labs, should work with technologists and other stakeholders to establish a safe and ethical structure for AI development. While there are a range of plausible scenarios of how this new technology transforms the economy and our workforce, substantial American leadership and public investment are needed to secure our competitiveness and national security while also ensuring that all U.S. citizens are uplifted by these changes and safeguarded against risks.
AI could fundamentally alter the U.S. labor market and may affect the demand for different jobs.
AI technologies may lead to fundamental changes in the U.S. labor market through their potential to reduce labor costs and increase productivity in ways that could increase global GDP by 7% each year. In doing so, these technologies would both expand economic opportunities in some sectors and reduce employment and activity in others. For example, one issue in the current Hollywood strike is the future of generative AI in the entertainment industry and its potential to disrupt writers’ and actors’ livelihoods.
Jobs across pay, skill, and experience spectrums could be affected by AI given that references to AI skills are increasingly common in job postings across virtually every sector (Figure 1). However, the precise impacts on each sector remain uncertain given the novelty of these technologies. AI may lead to job polarization where jobs become more concentrated in high- and low-paying occupations because routine tasks that are most susceptible to AI are predominantly in jobs that pay in the middle of the income ladder. However, other recent research suggests that tools like ChatGPT can boost productivity with certain writing tasks and narrow the productivity gap between more and less experienced customer service workers, indicating that AI may provide skills to grow the middle class. Some more complex occupations are also exposed to AI tasks that involve detecting patterns, making judgments, and optimizing processes, such as clinical lab technicians, chemical engineers, optometrists, and power plant operators. Together this suggests that technological advances in AI will impact the labor market in complicated and uncertain ways.

AI job opportunities are not equally available, and AI threatens jobs held by women more.
The history of technological change, from the advent of the dishwasher to the introduction of the internet, shows that technological developments do not destroy overall employment; but they can render some roles obsolete while providing others with opportunities. A study by the International Monetary Fund done prior to the recent rapid improvements in AI technology found that 11% of jobs held by women were at risk of being automated by tools like artificial intelligence compared to 9% of jobs held by men. The most at-risk group is women with lower secondary education, 50% of whom are at risk for automation relative to less than 40% of men in this group. Broadly, less educated workers and those in small- and medium-size firms are most at risk for automation, underscoring the need for more learning and retraining. This analysis also found that accommodation and food services, retail trade, and transportation sectors are most exposed to risks of automation. The retail trade, accommodation, and food services sectors employ similar proportions of men and women, while men are overrepresented in the transportation sector. These high-level sectoral numbers cannot fully explain differences in male versus female risk to automation though because the job composition within a sector also matters. For example, women are more represented in education, and their roles within the education sector are also more at risk for automation.
Long-running disparities in the STEM training and education pipeline also mean that job opportunities in fast-growing AI occupations are not equally available. Less than 19% of all AI and computer science PhD graduates in North America over the last decade were women. Furthermore. only 2.4% and 3.2% of U.S.-resident AI PhD graduates in 2019 were African American and Hispanic, respectively. In 2020, Queer in AI showed that almost half of its survey respondents view the lack of inclusion in the field as a barrier, and more than 40% of members surveyed reported experiencing discrimination or harassment at school or work. These disparities justify the need for efforts to ensure that historically underrepresented groups in STEM are not left behind during this AI revolution.
AI tools can both overcome and, in some cases, magnify biases.
There have also been reports that AI algorithms in hiring processes are biased against women. This is because of the years of bias and discrimination that is present in the data that is perpetuated by the model. We must also account for contextual and cultural complexity because AI will impact the working lives of women differently in different cultures and labor markets. Many AI facial recognition systems demonstrate racial disparities, with early work illustrating this for black women.
Paralleling these concerns, AI tools also have the potential to address certain systematic biases. For example, they can mitigate the corporate gender gaps, particularly in leadership roles, that broadly mirror the STEM gap by removing bias in recruiting, reviews, and promotion decisions and improving retention of female employees. One study found that a machine learning algorithm could help judges make bail decisions, lowering both crime and jail rates, but many other studies have shown that AI may perpetuate racial bias in bail decisions.
AI tools can be misused to harm consumers and the American public.
Another risk is that malicious actors may use AI tools to defraud the public before adequate protections can be put in place. It is imperative that the U.S. works to ward off threats to democracy posed by data and election manipulation, including campaign deepfakes. The U.S. government should and indeed already has begun to address the important privacy concerns surrounding the use of Americans’ personal data and AI. . A recent uptick in financial scams using AI voice cloning technology to trick consumers prompted several U.S. Senators to send a letter  to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau urging action, and the Bureau has increased its focus on how AI technologies affect the financial marketplace. Recent proposed bipartisan legislation also aims to protect Americans’ data from unfriendly foreign nations. The bill would build upon federal government priorities to protect American health care records, geolocations, web browsing activity, and other information that malicious actors could use to harm American people and interests.
Public investment in American AI research and development infrastructure can improve the technology’s safety and development.
To bolster the United States’ role in the development of AI tools, the administration is making large investments in AI research and development (R&D). Because of the 2020 National AI Initiative Act championed by Senator Martin Heinrich and then Senator Rob Portman, in May 2023 the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced $140 million in funding for seven new National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes as part of a cohesive cross-government approach to address AI related opportunities and risks. The new AI Institutes will advance foundational AI research on ethical and trustworthy technologies and on innovations in cybersecurity, climate change, understanding the human brain, and enhancing education and public health – all while supporting the development of a diverse AI workforce. Public investments have continued to increase over the last several years to $3.2 billion in 2022 (see below), underscoring the continued growth in public sector involvement in AI.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has the capabilities and experience to provide leadership in developing responsible AI R&D frameworks and quantifying the risks from AI. DOE has proposed a new initiative to lead the nation and the world on trustworthy AI development: FASST, or Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology for the Nation. In consultation with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), NSF has created a complementary roadmap for a National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) to enable the academic community to better utilize and expand AI within their own research. The recently introduced bipartisan CREATE AI Act of 2023 co-led by Senator Heinrich would authorize the NAIRR and help make this vital resource a reality. In addition to the academically-focused NAIRR, the federal government should explore ways to enable small and medium size firms to access, use, and interpret AI tools to prevent substantial consolidation among just a few technology firms.
The U.S. government should dramatically increase investments in AI education, reskilling, and training to prepare our workforce and shore up national security.
While the U.S. government has already made substantial investments in AI R&D and has outlined future goals, far less has been done to ensure that our workforce is ready to continue to support these efforts. For decades, the United States has been a magnet for AI talent – for example, the estimated hiring rate for AI workers in the US in 2020 was roughly double that in 2016. China’s growth rate over the same period was only 30%. However, other research points out that the United States is ahead in technology development but falling behind in people (STEM graduates and technology skill penetration), without which AI implementation will not be nearly as effective. The United States is particularly behind in the number of STEM graduates overall and in those that stay in the United States after graduating. For example, the limited number of skilled worker visas (H1B) makes it challenging both for highly educated workers to stay in the United States and for companies to focus operations here – with Canada and other countries capitalizing on this disincentive.
Educating, training, and reskilling to meet the new challenges of an AI-informed and augmented labor market will also become increasingly important to avoid job loss, especially for women and historically disadvantaged groups. Educating the future workforce to prepare people early on will be important – in particular, increased gender and racial equity efforts in STEM fields could help prevent certain groups from being left behind. Research conducted by the World Economic Forum and BCG showed that 95% of at-risk U.S. workers can be retrained for jobs that pay at or above what they make now and offer growth potential. Reskilling would be costly, but companies could profitably reskill 25% of their workforce – and 77% of workers could be retrained through government programs or incentives with a net cost benefit. Congress could aid these efforts by adopting tax policies that encourage companies to save costs by helping workers integrate technology into their jobs instead of replacing workers with technology.
Several policies options exist to propel our AI workforce forward to match our dominance on the technological side of the equation. The United States could leverage lessons learned from the space race during the Cold War. After the Soviet Union (USSR) launched the first crewed space flight, the United States government realized it needed to make substantial public investments in scientific education to close the gap with the USSR and promote national security. The National Science Foundation invested the equivalent of over $5 billion in teacher and classroom development, and Congress passed the National Defense Education Act to provide the equivalent of more than $10 billion for science education. Similarly, China’s emergence as a leader in AI should encourage the same “all hands on deck” national scale effort to maintain American leadership in AI through dramatically reinvigorated STEM education and workforce training efforts.
A multinational consortium approach could position the United States as an AI leader while providing the option to pool financial and human resources and share benefits across trusted allied countries. The United States has historically favored consortium approaches in dealing with cross-national issues like national security, such as with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The United States could lead such a group given the size of our economy, but working with others with AI expertise like Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada would complement and accelerate action.
Educating the U.S. population broadly on the future of AI in addition to growing the AI-specific workforce is essential for broader AI usage, understanding, and public support. While public awareness of AI surged with the advent of tools like ChatGPT, many misunderstandings still exist, and a public education campaign could provide a more balanced view. This educational campaign could lay the groundwork for a sense of urgency to support efforts to maintain American leadership in AI, much like what was done during the space race. On July 25, 2023, a tech trade group and lobbying network, TechNet, kicked off a $25 million education campaign to do just that and focus on the positive aspects of AI. Raising the profile of STEM work and education will help the United States maintain technical dominance in AI and provide well-paying jobs. Finally, closely evaluating possible international partners will enable the United States to build on others’ advances, quickly partner with allies for mutual benefit, and maintain our leadership in this space.
To maintain American leadership in AI, the federal government should work with technologists to establish a safe and ethical structure for AI development.
Given the immense role that AI technologies could play in the global economy, and the rapid recent developments, both the Administration and Congress have begun working through what role the federal government can and should play in this space. Technologists are also looking for structure and guidance from the government on safe and ethical AI development while maintaining their own competitiveness. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, went so far as to ask for government regulation of AI in a Senate hearing in May. A multi-stakeholder approach is thus necessary to engage with the government, private sector, technologists, and academia around key issues like data privacy, AI’s use in healthcare, and the need to foster skill-equalizing work environments for historically marginalized groups. The U.S. federal government should be at the forefront of coordinating a safe and ethical deployment of AI within the labor force and economy.
Governments themselves can leverage AI tools and their unique access to large datasets to make better policy decisions, especially during times of uncertainty. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has used AI tools to reduce taxpayer wait times, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have created AI competitions to predict health outcomes using Medicare data.
Training of AI systems and data storage needs can have substantial environmental impacts given the growing amount of energy, and resulting CO2-equivalent emissions, needed to power these tools. The U.S. government should encourage or incentivize developers and deployers to limit their climate impact. AI tools can also be used to optimize energy consumption across a range of sectors, which could prove essential to our energy and security missions. AI tools also fuel climate misinformation online, and government action to combat this is necessary.
Other vital and necessary work is also underway in the Administration and Congress to root out bias and promote equity and mitigate threats posed by AI to further solidify American leadership in safe AI deployment. On July 21, 2023, following pressure from the Biden Administration, seven leading AI companies agreed to voluntary safeguards on AI development – a first step in a regulatory and legal framework for this rapidly growing technology. These safeguards include testing products for security risks and marking products so that consumers can spot AI-generated material. In line with these efforts, the Administration has also put out a blueprint for an AI bill of rights focused on five principles: safe and effective systems, algorithmic discrimination protections, data privacy, notice and explanation, and human alternatives, consideration, and fallback. In February of this year, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to root out bias and promote equity in the design and use of new technologies including AI.
Simultaneously, Congress has been ramping up efforts to understand AI and lay the groundwork for regulation. Senate and House bipartisan caucuses complement work done in the Administration and have taken leadership roles on organizing member and staff level briefings to increase AI literacy on Capitol Hill. Initial legislative proposals are currently underway.

How AI Is Expected to Impact Future Employment Trends

There has never been a period in history during which artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the world’s imagination as much as it has today. But with the sophistication of generative AI (GenAI) applications such as ChatGPT now expanding at a breathless pace, the fear that automated technology might soon take over large swathes of jobs has also become more palpable than ever. And while it might have been believed once upon a time that it was the lower-skilled, more repetitive work that was most at risk of being consigned to the dustbin of history by the AI revolution, the enormous advances in brainpower and human-like abilities of the latest AI applications mean that so-called “white collar” work is also looking increasingly vulnerable amidst a thorough disruption of the entire global labour market.
As this revolution gets into full swing, frequent analyses of just how impactful AI will be for the world of work are now coming to the fore. From an economic perspective, for example, Goldman Sachs expects AI to deliver 7 percent more (or almost $7 trillion) in global gross domestic product (GDP) and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period, whilst ushering in “sweeping changes” to the global economy. “Despite significant uncertainty around the potential for generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani wrote in a report published on April 5.
The report also projects that this new wave of AI systems could have sizeable effects on global employment trends, with shifts in workflows triggered by these advances potentially exposing the equivalent of a staggering 300 million full-time jobs to automation. That said, not all of that automated work will translate into layoffs. “Although the impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,” the authors noted. In the United States, for instance, the Goldman Sachs economists estimated that around two-thirds of occupations are exposed to at least some degree of AI automation, and that of those occupations, between one-quarter and one-half of their workloads could be replaced.
These are not concerns that can be filed away for the future. Rather, there is plenty of evidence that AI is already replacing jobs. On May 1, for example, IBM announced that it would pause its hiring for non-customer-facing roles that the tech giant believes could be replaced by AI over the coming years, which Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said could amount to some 7,800 jobs. “There is no blanket hiring ‘pause’ in place. IBM is being deliberate and thoughtful in our hiring with a focus on revenue-generating roles, and we’re being very selective when filling jobs that don’t directly touch our clients or technology,” an IBM spokesperson told Business Insider. “We are actively hiring for thousands of positions right now.”
According to the non-partisan think tank Pew Research Center, 19 percent of American workers in 2022 were in the jobs most exposed to AI, in which the most important activities could be either replaced or assisted by AI; 23 percent of workers had jobs that were the least exposed to AI, in which the most important activities were farther from the reach of AI; and jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tended to be in higher-paying fields, in which college educations and analytical skills could be pluses. “AI is distinguished from past technologies that have come over the last 100-plus years,” Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at Pew, said of the results. “It is reaching up from the factory floors into the office spaces where white-collar, higher-paid workers tend to be. Will it be a slow-moving force or a tsunami? That’s unknown.”
Ultimately, this trend may be determined by how quickly the latest generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, evolve. “It is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own,” noted McKinsey & Company’s latest research published in June, which estimated that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy across the 63 use cases the consulting firm analysed. “As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.”
Such trends also raise deep philosophical questions over the nature, utility and value of human input versus machine input for delivering superior results. While this generation of generative AI has demonstrated impressive knowledge, it has also frequently delivered misleading or outright incorrect information, which underscores not only the imperfect nature of the current technology but also the vital importance of such human qualities as cognition, judgement and emotional intelligence that are required in many jobs to deliver not only the highest but also the most nuanced performances. “We have to think about these things as productivity-enhancing tools, as opposed to complete replacements,” Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, told Business Insider in June, adding that human judgement must be applied to these technologies to avoid error and bias.
Indeed, that “enhancing, not replacing” idea has significant implications for the nature of the labour market of the future, such that while millions of jobs may be lost due to AI, many millions more will be created in their places to support and complement the technologies of tomorrow. “The creation of new jobs resulting from the ability to create and deliver…new types of goods and services…ha[s] far outpaced the number of jobs displaced,” Steven Miller, professor emeritus of information systems at Singapore Management University (SMU), told CNBC in February. Dimitris Papanikolaou, a professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, also noted that, as of now, people working alongside AI rather than being replaced by it is the likelier scenario. “There are far more opportunities for using AI for augmenting the work of human employees than for fully automating the work of humans,” Papanikolaou noted.
But such predictions are, understandably, doing little to allay ordinary workers’ fears over their future employment prospects. Perhaps most glaringly in the spotlight at present is the strike of Hollywood screenwriters and actors from the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Many in the industry are concerned that stringent regulations are needed to prevent AI tools from replicating and diluting their control over their work, thus reducing their chances of earning a living.
“Artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions, and all actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without consent and pay,” SAG-AFTRA’s president, Fran Drescher, announced on July 15. Meanwhile, the WGA’s demands, issued on May 1, read: “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material; can’t be used as source material; and [works covered by union contracts] can’t be used to train AI.” In response, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP), which represents employers, said that its offers included an “AI proposal which protects performers’ digital likenesses, including a requirement for performers’ consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance”.
This strike provides a glimpse of what will likely come as AI makes inroads into virtually all industries. It also demonstrates workers’ anxieties over AI’s replicative nature and its possible impacts on hundreds of millions of lives in the future. Indeed, a July 28-30 survey of US consumers conducted by Canada-based polling firm Leger sought to understand their perspectives on the SAG-AFTRA strike and their broader concerns over AI related to their jobs. “63 percent of U.S. consumers think governments need to regulate AI to reduce the risk of it replacing human jobs, while 37 percent think AI will inevitably replace some human jobs, the market will adjust, and people will find new opportunities,” the survey found. “45 percent of U.S. consumers are concerned about AI replacing human workers in their line of work, while 29 percent are unconcerned. 19 percent are not looking for work/currently working, and 6 percent don’t know.” Seventy-three percent of US consumers also support including a disclaimer with all AI-generated content so that it is clearly identified.

Suumit Shah, the founder and CEO of Indian startup Dukaan, recently announced on Twitter (now X) that the company laid off 90% of its support staff due to implementing an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer interactions. Similarly, in April, Dropbox, an industry leader in cloud-based solutions, declared a reduction in workforce by around 16%, laying off 500 employees. Co-founder and CEO Drew Houston attributed this decision to the impact of AI in a statement shared on the Dropbox blog.The new technology has prompted several businesses, from industry giants like Dropbox to startups like Dukaan, to rethink their workforce needs. But what impact will these moves have on the future of customer service talent and the adoption of AI and chatbots?The evolving landscape of customer serviceGartner analyst Uma Challa explains the dynamics of what we are witnessing in the customer service sector: “Companies are experimenting with virtual agent applications using the evolving GenAI technology in customer service and support. This is creating an incorrect perception that GenAI technology is capable of replacing all human agents,” he says.Challa argues that the impact on the human workforce might be slower than some fear. To MyCustomer, he says: “There are a lot of factors that will need to be considered for adopting the GenAI technology, such as what type of approach to take: public models, vendor products or custom models? Consider the cost, risk and complexity aspects of each approach.“What applications of GenAI technology will you prioritise? How are you going to manage the risks of using this technology, such as bias that can have a potential impact on the brand? How mature is your organisation’s data management that can be used to fine-tune the adopted GenAI models and products? What roles do you need to successfully adopt GenAI?“The organisations that have a good digital transformation strategy and can confidently answer the above questions are better suited to adopt and scale GenAI technology.”Adapting to the AI revolutionAs new technologies are integrated, there is a gradual shift in job responsibilities, and changes are introduced. “Some organisations will double down on the mantra of ‘do more with less’ where agents are augmented with GenAI technology to improve productivity,” Challa predicts. This change in strategy means that there will be fewer new agents hired while more investments will be made in technology.“Customer service agents should continue to learn how to work with the technology, as technology-driven work reconfiguration leads to agents requiring new or changed skills,” he continues.Young people fear AI will take their jobs



Strategic skills provider Corndel recently published research revealing the extent to which employees fear AI will take all or part of their jobs, with younger workers particularly worried.According to the report, 61% believe AI will take at least 25% of their role by 2033, with 38% of 18-34 year-olds fearing that AI will take at least 50% of their job in the next decade.The report highlights that workplace training and development ensures the data skills gap is closed, and organisations can make data-driven decisions to foster growth and competitiveness.Key statistics include:
92% of employees working with data think there is a skills gap in their workplace.
82% of employees have had no training in AI use.
Nearly half of senior decision-makers believe a lack of data skills is holding back their business transformation.
Younger employees are already acknowledging the risks of being left behind by technology.James Kelly, CEO and co-founder of Corndel, said: “Younger employees are already acknowledging the risks of being left behind by technology, which is shown in the large number of 18-34-year-olds who think their jobs are at risk from AI.“Only by implementing continuous skills development programs to support lifetime learning among employees, as well as investing in technology and data infrastructure, can organisations empower their employees to leverage tech and data knowledgeably, confidently and effectively, to fuel transformative change and drive successful performance.”Strategies for embracing AI in customer serviceUma Challa emphasises the need for a comprehensive strategy, advising service and support leaders to collaborate with other leaders in their organisation: “Especially with IT and control groups such as legal, compliance, risk, information security departments”.In the face of workforce reductions and the AI revolution, Challa’s advice for organisations revolves around talent management. “For successful digital transformation, talent is a critical requirement,” he says, highlighting the centrality of upskilling and reskilling. Embracing agile learning principles ensures employees remain adaptable and equipped for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. “Agile learning future-proofs employees, which, in turn, future-proofs the enterprise.”

Three in Four Americans Believe AI Will Reduce Jobs
by Stephanie Marken and Tara Nicola






Most Americans think artificial intelligence (AI) will negatively affect the U.S. job market, with 75% saying it will decrease the total number of jobs over the next 10 years. About one in five (19%) believe AI will not affect the number of jobs, while 6% say it will result in an increase in jobs.
U.S. adults with less than a bachelor’s degree are more likely than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher to say AI will decrease the number of jobs (80% vs. 68%, respectively). Younger Americans are less pessimistic than their older counterparts about AI, with two-thirds of adults aged 18 to 29 saying it will decrease the total number of jobs, compared with 72% of 30- to 44-year-olds, 79% of 45- to 59-year-olds, and 80% of those aged 60 and older.




Results for the Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study are based on web survey responses collected May 8-15, 2023, from 5,458 U.S. adults in Gallup’s nationally representative panel.

Majorities Say AI Performs Certain Tasks as Well as or Better Than Humans
While Americans are pessimistic about AI’s potential impact on the job market, they recognize the benefits AI could bring in some areas. In particular, majorities believe AI performs as well as or better than humans at customizing the content users see online (68%), recommending products or services to them (65%) and assisting students with coursework (60%).
Across all nine tasks included in the study, Americans are the least positive about AI’s ability to recommend which employees a company should hire, its self-driving capabilities and its ability to recommend medical advice. About two-thirds of Americans believe AI performs worse than humans on each of these tasks.




Most Americans Lack Trust That Businesses Will Use AI Responsibly
When asked how much they trust businesses to use AI responsibly, a majority of Americans, 79%, say “not much” or “not at all.” Another 21% report they trust businesses “a lot” or “some.”




Trust is consistently low across subgroups of the U.S. adult population, including by age, gender and race/ethnicity.
Few Think AI Does More Good Than Harm
Although many Americans think AI can perform as well as or better than humans in completing particular tasks, they are generally negative about the amount of harm it can cause. Forty percent of U.S. adults think AI does more harm than good, and half say it does equal amounts of harm and good. Just 10% of U.S. adults believe it contributes more good than harm.
Notably, Black and Asian Americans have a more positive view of AI's impact on society: 71% of Asian and 67% of Black adults say AI does more good than harm or equal amounts of harm and good, compared with 60% of Hispanic and 59% of White adults.




Implications
AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for businesses as they seek to evolve, become more efficient, and innovate in the products and services they offer customers. And yet, most Americans are wary about the overall impact of AI on the job market. Still, there are select tasks that U.S. adults believe AI can do as well as, if not better than, humans who have traditionally performed these tasks, suggesting consumers see a place for AI. This optimism is higher among younger people, who are more likely than their peers to believe in the future of AI.
Still, businesses have work to do to affirm their commitment to using this tool as a force for good in their internal processes and in connecting with their customers. It is important to keep in mind that artificial intelligence is still unknown to or misunderstood by many Americans. This knowledge deficit may explain the lack of confidence people have in using it for certain tasks and their lack of trust in businesses to use it responsibly.

Survey Methods


The Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Report is based on a Gallup Panel web survey completed by 5,458 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older, conducted May 8-15, 2023. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based longitudinal panel of U.S. adults whom Gallup selects using random-digit-dial phone interviews that cover landlines and cellphones. Gallup also uses address-based sampling methods to recruit Panel members. The Gallup Panel is not an opt-in panel. The sample for this study was weighted to be demographically representative of the U.S. adult population, using the most recent Current Population Survey figures. 
For results based on this sample, one can say that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for response percentages around 50% and ±1.1 percentage points for response percentages around 10% or 90%, design effect included. Margins of error are higher for subsamples. 
In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

At its Fal.Con customer conference, which runs Sept. 18-21, analysts expect CrowdStrike to unveil its ""Charlotte"" generative AI upgrade to its security operations center (SOC) services. Among the changes, customers will use a conversational user interface rather than a computer dashboard.
Also, CrowdStrike is expected to disclose its pricing strategy for the Charlotte tools.
At a Goldman Sachs conference on Sept. 5, CrowdStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz said generative AI will shake up the security industry.
""So I think when that's applied to security, people are going to be really excited and hooked on it and use it in ways that we hadn't even thought about,"" he said.
""When we think about Charlotte and why we're so excited about it — it's not like a side chatbot feature. It's actually a foundational platform service. What I mean by that is everything on the platform is consumed as a service, the way it runs technologically.""
He added: ""Where we see this going is to create what we call generative workflows, which is more of a conversation with Charlotte. So, in the morning you would come in and you'd say, OK, well, Charlotte, what are the latest threats that CrowdStrike knows about in the last 24 hours? What are the adversaries doing in my particular industry?""
Cybersecurity firms have used AI's pattern recognition capabilities for real-time analysis of data for over a decade. Founded by two former McAfee executives in 2011, CrowdStrike started out monitoring laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.
CRWD Stock: Predictive AI
In the endpoint market, older antivirus software looks for ""signatures"" of known malicious software. However, CrowdStrike's more advanced tools learn to identify malware traits rather than specific signatures. That enables them to detect new types of malware.
CrowdStrike utilizes a specialized database to analyze and correlate billions of events collected from customers in real time. CrowdStrike uses machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, in its products.
Just like machine learning can detect new types of malware using predictive models that classify data, ML algorithms have been used for making recommendations, pricing ads and services, detecting spam and fraud and many other applications.
Generative AI models, on the other hand, process ""prompts,"" such as internet search queries, that describe what a user wants to get. Generative AI technologies create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own. Industry-specific versions of generative AI are expected to use company data to train AI models.
In cybersecurity, companies expect generative AI tools to help reduce the time to detect and respond to many forms of computer hacking. Also, they see generative AI automating more functions in security operations centers to help companies deal with a shortage of software engineers.
Expanding From Endpoint Market
For CrowdStrike, serendipity may be at work. The arrival of generative AI comes as the company expands from roots in endpoint into cloud-based network monitoring tools and security vulnerability management services.
Further, CrowdStrike is building a broad, threat-detection cybersecurity platform. It's called XDR, or extended detection and response. It monitors endpoints as well as web/email gateways, web application firewalls and cloud business workloads.
CrowdStrike has been a share gainer in the identity security market. But it faces intensified competition from Microsoft (MSFT). Meanwhile, Microsoft sells multiple cybersecurity products to companies in discounted deals.
Also, Microsoft is leveraging generative AI with the launch of the Microsoft Security Copilot. Analysts say a marketing alliance with Dell Technologies (DELL) could help CrowdStrike compete versus Microsoft.
In addition, CrowdStrike competes with SentinelOne (S)and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). CrowdStrike is among many AI stocks to watch.
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike's IPO in June 2019 raised $659 million.
CRWD Stock: July Quarter Results Beat
CrowdStrike earnings for its July quarter jumped 105% to 74 cents a share on an adjusted basis. Revenue, including acquisitions, climbed 37% to $731.6 million.
Analysts polled by FactSet had projected earnings of 56 cents a share on revenue of $724 million for the fiscal Q2 2024 period ended July 31.
A year earlier, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based firm earned 36 cents a share on revenue of $535 million.
With CrowdStrike, Wall Street focuses on annual recurring revenue, or ARR, a key financial metric tied to subscription services growth. During the July quarter, ARR increased 37% to $2.93 billion. Analysts had predicted ARR of $2.92 billion.
For the current quarter ending in October, CrowdStrike predicted revenue of just under $777 million at the midpoint of its outlook. That edged by estimates of $774 million.
CRWD stock broke out of a consolidation in the wake of its Q2 earnings report. Shares are trading at 11-month highs.

A Bot Isn’t Going to Take Your Place, But AI Will Make Your Job Harder

by Jennifer L. Gaskin March 8, 2023

OpenAI’s splashy ChatGPT rollout has generated untold amounts of text, both directly and indirectly. While much of what’s been written so far has been about creative work, which some fear will be completely upended by ChatGPT, CCI’s copy chief, Jennifer L. Gaskin, looks at how generative AI tools will change the corporate integrity landscape.

<em>More than half of American employees are using generative <strong><a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AI</a></strong> tools at least occasionally to accomplish work-related tasks, according to a new survey by The Conference Board that found while a majority of workers are using these tools, few of their employers have mature organizational AI policies.</em>

</div>
The Conference Board <strong><a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/press/us-workers-and-generative-ai"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">survey</a></strong> of nearly 1,100 U.S. workers, predominantly office workers, found that while 56% of people are using these tools, only 26% say their employer has a policy related to the use of generative AI. Another 23% said such policy-making is in the works, though.

Here’s a closer look at the survey’s findings:
<h2>AI adoption &amp; supervision</h2>
In all, 56% of respondents are using generative <strong><a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/ai-revolution-fraud-investigations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AI tools</a></strong> for work tasks.
<ul>
 	<li>31% report using generative AI on a frequent, regular basis — including daily (9%), weekly (17%) or monthly (5%).</li>
 	<li>25% say they are using generative AI occasionally.</li>
 	<li>44% have never used generative AI.</li>
</ul>
Among workers who’ve adopted generative AI, a large majority (71%) say their managers or organizations are aware of their usage.
<div class=""cci-promo""><center>[jnews_block_12 number_post=""1"" include_post=""44168"" included_only=""true"" excerpt_length=""54"" excerpt_ellipsis=""""]</center></div>
<h2>Use cases &amp; work quality</h2>
Workers are primarily using generative AI tools for basic, foundational <strong><a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/business-using-ai-2023/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tasks</a></strong> involving text.
<ul>
 	<li>Drafting written content (68%), brainstorming ideas (60%) and conducting background research (50%) are the most common use cases.</li>
 	<li>Far fewer respondents are using generative AI for quantitative and technical tasks, such as analyzing data and making forecasts (19%), generating/checking computer code (11%) or image recognition and generation (7%).</li>
</ul>
Most respondents believe the quality of AI output matches that of a seasoned human worker:
<ul>
 	<li>45% say quality is equal to an experienced worker.</li>
 	<li>31% say quality is equal to a novice worker.</li>
 	<li>10% say quality is equal to an expert worker.</li>
</ul>
“Generative Al is already delivering work product that meets or exceeds the quality of employees with years of experience — at least on specific tasks,” said Diana Scott, leader of The Conference Board’s human capital center. “At the same time, few people we surveyed foresee AI technology as a threat to replace their jobs entirely. Rather, they appear to be embracing AI as a solution for repetitive or tedious parts of their work, freeing up bandwidth for more productive and valuable uses of their time.”
<h2>Productivity &amp; job impact</h2>
Most respondents (63%) say generative AI tools have positively affected their productivity, but only a small fraction say AI has significantly improved their productivity.
<ul>
 	<li>7% report a significant increase in productivity.</li>
 	<li>56% report an increase.</li>
 	<li>36% report no impact.</li>
</ul>
Many workers foresee generative AI replacing elements of their job functions, but they largely see the impact as positive.
<ul>
 	<li>33% say AI will replace elements of their job in a positive way, such as by freeing up time for more valuable or creative tasks.</li>
 	<li>Just 4% foresee AI replacing parts of their work in a negative way, such as by threatening their job altogether.</li>
 	<li>24% do not expect AI to replace any element of their job.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI policies</h2>
Most workers report that their organizations either don’t have a general policy related to the use of generative AI at work or are still developing one.
<ul>
 	<li>34% say their organization does not have an AI policy.</li>
 	<li>26% say their organization does have an AI policy.</li>
 	<li>23% say a policy is under development.</li>
 	<li>17% don’t know.</li>

Will AI take my job? Will it slash my earnings potential? Will AI affect my future career prospects as a lawyer? Will it reduce advancement opportunities for junior lawyers? What will my industry even look like a decade from now? The latter question was posed in a survey to participants in a new Thomson Reuters report, Future of Professionals Report: How AI is the Catalyst for Transforming Every Aspect of Work. Respondents were asked how they would feel if a time traveler from 2033 appeared to tell them that AI had become ubiquitous within their profession. Naturally, there was concern: one in ten compared the scenario to a “zombie apocalypse.” But interestingly, more respondents said that the scenario was akin to winning the lottery. The most common position was “cautiously positive.” Being cautiously positive is a good attitude for lawyers to take when assessing AI’s future impact. More than two-thirds of professionals surveyed (67%) by Thomson Reuters predicted that the emergence of generative AI will either be a transformational or a high-impact change to their industries over the next five years. With such transformation comes opportunity—potentially great opportunity. Consider AI as a means to better employ your skills and talents as a lawyer, and to improve your prospects at your law firm. If AI eliminates much time-consuming work that’s been an inescapable part of the legal industry, lawyers can shine brighter than ever before.  Future of Professionals Report1,200 professionals were surveyed across North America, South America and the UK. Read what they predict will be the biggest impacts on their businesses in the next five years.Read report What does the growth or job outlook for lawyers look like?There are many positive scenarios following the mass adoption of AI in the legal industry, including: Honing your skills Instead of regarding AI as a threat, lawyers should consider its potential as a liberator. With AI able to quickly conduct large-scale data analysis, perform legal administrative duties, and analyze and summarize documents used in due diligence, a lawyer is freed from time-consuming and nonremunerative (indeed, often non-billable) work. Lawyers instead can turn their focus to expanding their billable workload. Many law firms lose revenue in write-offs due to inefficiencies within their practice. A savvy lawyer could use AI to recapture revenue for their firm, helping to reduce a firm’s cost centers, and finding ways to add value to existing client relationships. The latter could be as simple as upgrading client/lawyer communications, for example. After all, many lawyers find it much easier to revise a document than to write one from scratch. Now they don’t have to. Using AI to generate a host of templates and standardized documents, a lawyer quickly chooses one (selecting a level of readability, whether layman or professional), then revises and personalizes it. This eliminates the “first draft” phase and quickly gets the document into a client’s hands.   New paths for legal careers AI will open up new career horizons in the legal industry and alter current career trajectories. The implications for junior lawyers are immense. Mass AI usage may shift the bulk of more remedial tasks from professionals who have education/professional credentials (JDs, CPAs, etc.) to employees who don’t have professional licensure.  As the Thomson Reuters report notes, “As automation and AI solutions make completing traditional legal tasks easier, it could become more appropriate for such tasks to be completed by a paralegal or more junior professional. Using this tactic at scale could potentially increase the profit margin, enabling alternative and cheaper ways of becoming a fee-generator in the firm.” This opens opportunities for entry-level legal professionals to find niches within their law firm, whether as a legal tech consultant or a junior lawyer charged with supervising AI systems conducting billing, for example. It also means that advancing within a law firm may be less of a step-by-step trudge upward, with many repetitive workloads. Instead, advancement may become a flexible, client-centered process, one that better rewards initiative by junior lawyers.  The birth of new jobs AI is likely to create a host of new legal jobs, as firms will need lawyers to specialize in AI in numerous ways. These include training, consultation, and keeping AI in compliance with state, federal, and global regulations, all of which may be in flux for years to come. AI intermediaries: One area with growth potential is a freelance model in which professionals with specialized expertise (such as in fintech) advise both in-house and private practice clients on AI issues.  Cross-border regulatory advisors: Many new roles will be needed at the multinational or international organizational level. Firms will need lawyers responsible for harmonizing the AI regulatory landscape across various jurisdictions.Next-generation staff managers: As AI evolves within law firms, the nature of management will change. There could be even more remote employees and the growth of subgroups within a law firm (the “firm within a firm” model) that specialize in particular client types. Having skilled, flexible supervisors who are able to keep track of all these moving parts will be essential.  Training and development advisory: A large area of consensus in the Thomson Reuters report is the importance of AI training. Almost 90% of professionals surveyed said they expected to see mandatory AI training for all employees over the next five years. And over two-thirds surveyed said they expect changes in how junior professionals are trained to incorporate AI, starting at the university level. Such transformation will require a large pool of advisors and instructors. AI: Changing the outlook So, how will AI affect your prospects as a lawyer? You will need to come up with your own action plans for the next few years. Look to capitalize on growth opportunities and try to minimize any professional limitations. Let’s safely predict that the 2030s won’t be a zombie apocalypse. But the world will be different. If you believe that legal work won’t be greatly transformed, your prospects in the industry will dim. As the report notes, “generative AI will not replace highly trained lawyers and accountants, but a lawyer or accountant using generative AI will certainly replace one who isn’t using the technology.” It’s simple enough advice: don’t be among the latter. Read the full report, “Future of Professionals: How AI is the catalyst for transforming every aspect of work.”  Chris O’Leary is a freelance writer and editor based in western Massachusetts.

BOSTON -- Generative AI may be the buzzword of 2023, but the excitement about the technology may also have some fearing that their jobs are in jeopardy.







Tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Dalle-E 2 can write code, take exams, write essays and create dramatic images. Their existence seems to some like a science fiction movie portraying a future that is doomed for employees in certain industries, especially creatives.

AI anxiety
This form of dread is problematic for some enterprises that find it challenging to convince their employees to use generative AI tools and large language models.
Some AI users raised this question on Wednesday at the Generative AI World conference here.
During a presentation about a new generative AI tool called Writable -- based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 generative AI system -- that helps teachers grade essays, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt executive Steven Chambers said that while the tool helps teachers save time, there's still a lot of anxiety about it.
Some teachers may worry that the tool will reduce the need for their input and eliminate some parts of their jobs.
""There's a very specific AI anxiety,"" said Chambers, who is the strategic advisor to the publishing company's CEO. ""It's a real state of confusion. We have encountered a lot of fear.""
The fear teachers encounter is akin to the anxiety some in customer service and marketing may also experience. They may feel the technology could push them out of their jobs.
""People are a little paralyzed in terms of how to educate themselves around it,"" said Katrina Klier, senior strategy manager at Sage Strategy Group, a business consultancy, in an interview.
Stories in the media about workforce disruptions due to generative AI also contribute to employees' wariness about the technology, she added.

A presentation on an AI essay grading tool shows the fear that some may have around generative AI.







Calming the fear
Therefore, it is up to senior managers and others in charge to combat the fears.
""Managers have a responsibility to give their employees kind of some space and grace,"" Klier said, adding that managers might have to coach or guide their employees so they want to use the tools.

For Chambers' team, fear about generative AI tools such as Writable led to professional development training for teachers.
""That's not new to teachers -- getting professional development on how to work with a new pedagogy, a new set of curricular resources,"" Chambers said in an interview.
""You lead with the specific relevance of the product,"" he continued. ""It all boils down to making it relevant to solve a problem they have and demystify AI as a result.""
Sometimes, the key to countering skepticism is for members of senior management to immerse themselves in the technology.
""It starts with leadership,"" said Paul Baier, CEO of AI analyst and advisory firm GAI Insights, in an interview with TechTarget Editorial. ""This is not a side project. It's got to come from top down. ""
Also, employees must be given a clear policy on how to use the technology. Finally, he added that organizations should listen to employees' ideas.
For Klier, employees skeptical about generative AI tools should know the technology is aimed at being successful, not eliminating jobs.
""Success will favor the curious, success favors the open-minded and success favor the prudent risk takers,"" she said.

A variety of generative AI training courses have been fueled by the success of ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and Google Gemini. They run the gamut from understanding technologies such as large language models and generative adversarial networks to prompt engineering and solving business problems. Many of these generative AI (GenAI) courses are aimed at helping developers create AI applications. Others focus more on business users looking to apply the new technology across the enterprise.







""The best training resources drive adoption and understanding,"" said Dwarak Sri, global head of AI at BlueCloud, an AI and cloud consultancy. One option is to look for generative AI training resources that provide concrete examples, including practical situations where AI has made a real impact in solving business problems. These resources might also showcase success stories directly related to different industries, as real-world scenarios can help drive home the benefits of adopting AI.
It's also helpful to investigate resources with a problem-solving angle. These might present AI as a solution to specific challenges that business users often face. Sri finds that visuals are critical, and the best programs use diagrams and interactive demos to help business professionals see how AI operates and its value.
Enterprises might also want to provide training and support to employees through workshops that help them get the hang of using AI tools and platforms. ""Interactive lectures presented by industry experts can lead to insightful group discussions and learning materials that users can explore at their own pace,"" Sri said.

Various methods of generative AI training
It's important to consider the various modalities of generative AI training resources. Sri said the most common training methods include in-person workshops and seminars, which are highly interactive and provide immediate feedback and networking opportunities. Online courses let users choose when and where to study, but they require self-discipline and might lack personal interaction.
In addition, video tutorials and webinars let users pause, rewind and review material as often as needed. ""However, video tutorials are only sometimes up to date and lack real-time feedback,"" Sri said. He recommends a blended learning approach that combines various techniques to achieve a well-rounded experience, such as an online course paired with an in-person workshop.
AArete, a global management and technology consulting firm, uses the acronym FOCUS to balance all aspects of learning about generative AI, according to Priya Iragavarapu, vice president of data science and analytics. The FOCUS acronym stands for the following:

Fundamentals. Users need to understand basic AI concepts, terminologies and types, and where those technologies can be used.
Operational integration. Business users must learn how to incorporate AI into existing workflows, processes and decision-making structures within the business.
Compliance and ethics. Business users don't need to be AI experts, but they do need enough information on data privacy, ethical considerations and responsible AI use to operate within best practice guidelines.
User-centric applications. Business users must consider how AI can improve customer experience, enhance employee productivity and solve specific business challenges. They need to have enough context to pursue AI opportunities while keeping users in mind.
Sustained development. AI training is a continuous need. Look for bite-sized training snippets to learn the same concept in multiple ways to boost understanding.



GenAI course recommendations from AI leaders
While it's helpful to learn what the new technology can do, it's equally important to learn about AI's challenges and limitations, such as bias, AI hallucinations, data leakage and new security vulnerabilities. ""The key is helping business users understand what AI can and cannot do so they can avoid being oversold or starting projects with a low likelihood of success,"" said Josh Koenig, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Pantheon.
Here are 10 of the top generative AI courses and training resources recommended by AI leaders.
1. Class Central
Class Central is a learning content aggregation directory with courses from numerous universities and institutions, as well as more than 80 providers. It currently includes more than 2,700 free courses on generative AI and another 1,900 paid courses that come with a certificate upon completion. It's a good place to start when seeking guidance on tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. There are also longer programs that let users develop a broader understanding of GenAI capabilities, opportunities, use cases and responsible use within the enterprise.
2. Coursera
The Coursera platform provides hundreds of generative AI training courses for free or a small fee. Some courses even provide a shareable certificate that can be added to a LinkedIn profile. Some popular courses include Generative AI with Large Language Models, Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT, ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis and Generative AI for Everyone.
3. EdX
The EdX platform is Iragavarapu's personal favorite and has plenty of free resources. It provides numerous GenAI options at every level of technical familiarity. Lessons cover generative AI for business leaders, prompt engineering, ethics and industry use cases. Many classes have a free audit option, but they can provide professional certification for a nominal fee.
4. Google Cloud Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path
This is a free introductory course about generative AI and how it is used. Modules cover GenAI fundamentals, LLMs and responsible AI. A subscription option lets users take courses with live training and also work in conjunction with a lab to put new concepts into practice.
5. Generative AI for Business Leaders
This short course by LinkedIn Chief Product Officer Tomer Cohen covers the basics of getting started with GenAI, business implications, pitfalls and future trends. There's a free one-month trial; a LinkedIn Learning services subscription starts at $29.99 per month annually for users who want a certificate of completion and ongoing access to other resources on the platform.
6. Learn Prompting
The curriculum explains how to use ChatGPT and other tools to accomplish your goals. It has more than 60 content modules to support skill levels ranging from business user to developer, analyst and data scientist. Modules cover prompt engineering basics, applied prompting, reliability, image prompting, prompt hacking, tooling and prompt tuning. Learn Prompting also sponsors a prompt hacking competition to enhance AI safety and education.
7. Towards AI
This AI community and content platform -- with more than 2,000 contributing writers and 270,000 followers -- focuses on making AI accessible to everyone. Sri considers it a useful resource to find news and opinions, discover tutorials, and explore the latest newsletters and articles on trending topics. Access to the service is free, although some content exists behind a Medium paywall.
8. Udemy
Udemy is another great starting point to learn about generative AI. It has more than 80 courses that offer learning tutorials for users with no programming experience. Some of the most popular courses cover ChatGPT basics, automating content generation, AI in marketing, time management, code completion and cybersecurity.
9. Visually AI
This site, curated by Heather Cooper, has a strong focus on AI image-generation tools and techniques. Sri said this is a great resource for interesting tips on how to find the right tool by product category, type of tool or the most popular app. There are also suggestions on how to improve prompts and recommendations for plugins. Much of the content is free, although several premium courses are available.
10. YouTube
Iragavarapu said YouTube is another great resource for learning GenAI basics and keeping up with trends. There are many short-form videos for a quick summary of the field, such as TechTarget's ""Ultimate Guide to Generative AI for Businesses."" There are also thousands of deeper dives into select topics, including the practical aspects of using generative AI for data science, mastering new tools and discovering new business use cases.





The future of training resources
The technologies and uses of generative AI are rapidly evolving. Sri expects that different training modes, interactivity and content will evolve as the technology becomes more accessible. Tutorials will become more interactive and provide step-by-step guidance and feedback in real time. Businesses will increasingly create virtual environments, known as sandboxes, where users can experiment with generative AI models without the risk of affecting real-world systems. This will provide a safe space where users can refine their skills and test various scenarios.
Sri believes that training content will incorporate more real-world use cases relevant to various industries as GenAI evolves. Ethics and bias education will also be more significant. Businesses will need to focus on educating users about responsible AI usage, data privacy and ways to mitigate unintended consequences. Generative AI will also lead to more dynamic content generation of personalized examples, exercises and scenarios that align with users' learning objectives and skill levels.

As we move further into the age of disruption, the advancing field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing industries across the world. Many discussions are centered around the widespread fear of job loss; but, as seen with previous revolutions, some of these concerns may be exaggerated. To keep pace with the changing landscape, the responsibility falls on the government and companies to aid the workforce with skill training that can better prepare them for the coming advancements. According to McKinsey, robots could potentially replace 800 million jobs by 2020. However, with the right training, the workforce can embrace this advancement rather than fear it.
Currently, most companies have already integrated a digital component to various roles and, if they have not, they are preparing to. Therefore, the future of work has changed dramatically over the past 50 years.  Automation and AI are the key components of change as they begin to permeate diverse industries from healthcare to transportation. Rather than just affecting one type of position, both traditional blue and white-collar jobs are affected by this transition and thus, the need for a systemic shift in education and regulatory policies are required to continue to support the workforce.
Indian Initiatives Driving Change
In India, due to the unique nature of the tech-dominated workforce, the issue of upskilling workers for an AI-driven world is of paramount importance. The United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) India Skills Report 2018 demonstrates that 46 percent of college graduates place AI as a crucial next-generation technology where they should have considerable focus. In line with these findings, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has also revised the curriculum for four-year undergraduate programs. AICTE is now recommending mandatory inductions for AI, robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) for the 2018-19 academic year to make future engineers more employable.
The National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) has also launched a comprehensive platform called Futureskills to draw attention to eight key technologies poised for tremendous growth in the coming decade. These technologies are primed to deliver 55 different job roles and corresponding skills including AI, Virtual Reality, RPA, IoT, Big Data Analytics, 3D Printing, Cloud Computing and Social and Mobile.

To contend with the advancements in technology, the new key objective must be to revamp institutions and prepare the workforce for the AI revolution. As seen throughout history, several inventions have transformed the workforce and AI is just another building block in our continued path to enlightenment. The workforce is still determining how to respond to the contemporary skill upgrade that AI is driving. Instead of the common fear that AI will replace jobs, it is clear that this advancement will not only transform the workforce but, in turn, create new job opportunities. This survey by Capgemini states that four out of five companies have created new positions in relation to deploying AI-based systems.
Obtaining the right kind of training is critical for those in and preparing to enter the workforce. Companies who currently employ AI have transitioned from traditional hiring methods to skill-based recruitment techniques, and as more organizations adopt AI, this expansion will only continue. Traditional qualifiers such as experience may take a secondary role to the skills possessed by potential candidates as organizations hire for these new fields. Preparing the workforce with relevant skills is no longer an optional endeavor but the standard.
To stay ahead of AI in an automated world, the workforce needs to focus on some core skills that machines may never replicate. While AI can run through databanks and generate new insights, humanity is innately driven to explore, find new ways to solve problems and imagine new opportunities. Abilities like creativity, imagination, empathy, critical thinking, ethics and more are the qualities we should be increasingly attentive to. Commonly known as “soft skills,” these skills are now more essential than ever and are only dubbed such because they cannot be quantitatively measured. In a machine-driven world, these qualities will become even more important because any activity that AI undertakes must somehow fit inside the value systems driven by humans. We cannot and should not prevent AI from becoming more powerful, but at the same time, we must focus further on the skills that separate us from it.
This report by MIT Review says that five key skills will become increasingly important:  

Judgment and decision-making
Fluency of ideas
Active learning
Learning strategies
Originality

It is now more obvious than ever that organizations must look at AI and similar technologies to stay competitive and generate additional value. Mapping this goal with specific scenarios of skills and workers is a journey that every organization needs to invest in and continually advance. Identifying skills and adaptations of skills-forecasting models are essential for this process and will greatly help maintain the supply and demand of the 21st century workforce.
Drawing Inspiration From the Brightest
There is much that India can learn from the insights of other countries by drawing upon that inspiration and making it our own. We must realize that preparing future generations for the jobs of the future is essential and deserves all the resources and attention we can afford. Driving collaborative problem solving should be a key focus area at all education levels. According to the World Economic Forum, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea are currently the most advanced in this area and we should be learning all we can from their successful models. As AI turns to more cognitive tasks, workers with the best non-cognitive skills will have increasingly important roles to play and we should encourage and invest in those qualities.
This World Economic Forum Future of Jobs report 2016 argues that by 2020, “Creativity will become one of the top three skills workers will need. With the avalanche of new products, new technologies and new ways of working, employees are going to have to become more creative in order to benefit from these changes.” In addition, the report goes on to state that 35 percent of core skills will change between 2015 and 2020: We should be doing all we can to prepare our workforce in these changing times. We have a challenge ahead of us with the advancement of AI and we can either skill up and advance alongside it or scramble to keep up afterward - the choice is in our hands.

Best Practices to Guide Employee Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

By Lin Grensing-Pophal, Contributing Editor

Updated: Sep 14, 2023




Artificial intelligence (AI) has captured our imaginations for decades. Blockbuster hits like The Terminator and The Matrix series have driven home fears of computers becoming sentient and seeking to eradicate or enslave the human race.




Beyond Science Fiction: AI Impacts Become Reality
More recently, however, concerns over AI have been more mundane and practical, and those concerns are typically focused on AI’s impact on human labor. There have long been concerns over whether and to what extent AI will render humans obsolete in different industries, for example.



But AI has the potential not only to replace human labor but also to complement human labor, resulting in significant productivity boosts. AI, including tools like generative AI chatbots, has the ability to answer a wide range of employee questions, create high-quality written and visual content, and even engage with customers.

	



This has many employees asking themselves: “If my employer can benefit from replacing me with AI, why shouldn’t I use AI to perform my work myself?” In other words, what’s wrong with employees using AI to perform their work for them?



In many, if not most, cases, there shouldn’t be any ethical concern with such an approach. However, it’s important to put certain ground rules in place to protect business interests and ensure appropriate use of these rapidly emerging tools.



Transparency
One of the most prominent concerns over the use of AI is transparency around the authenticity and source of AI-generated content. Was this content created by a human employee over several hours, or was it created by an AI chatbot in 15 seconds? How should that impact how that work is paid for and how much?



Similarly, businesses also need to be transparent with their employees when it comes to how the use of AI may impact their work and, ultimately, their careers.



“HR should strive for transparency and create a culture of openness in how AI algorithms and decision-making processes work,” advises Young Pham, the Cofounder and Senior HR Manager at BizReport. “Employees should be informed as early as possible about the decision to use AI in HR and given a clear explanation of how it affects their current employment and future decisions about their work.”



Protection of IP and Confidentiality
Many AI chatbots involve creating prompts. This might mean a user entering a one-sentence question or entering a lengthy report and asking the chatbot to summarize its content.



But what happens to the information entered into the prompt?



It’s important that users understand the implications of entering customer data, company financial information, or other sensitive material into a third-party AI chatbot.



Certain laws, regulations, or contractual obligations with customers may have rules around how that information is used and whether and how it can be shared with third parties, including providers of AI chatbots.



Ownership
Another key issue in the use of AI chatbots at work has to do with the concept of ownership. We’re not talking about ownership in the sense of legal ownership of intellectual property created by or entered into an AI tool; we’re talking about the concept of taking responsibility for the product of AI-assisted work.



This means that even if AI is a key contributor to a given work product (or even the sole creator), the employee or team using that work product is still responsible for it.



A great example to illustrate this point comes in the legal context. A New York attorney recently found himself in hot water for submitting court filings that cited bogus legal authorities. The source of this infraction was apparently the lawyer’s use of an AI chatbot to create the filing.



When AI is used to help create work products for human employees, those human employees are still responsible for ensuring the end result is accurate and doesn’t plagiarize work from others. The lawyer in the example above could have easily looked up the case references created by his AI tool and discover they didn’t exist. Similarly, there are a number of free plagiarism tools available online.



Those who choose to leverage AI in their work have no excuse for bad output.



The Role of HR
AI and AI chatbots are obviously very tech-focused tools, but it’s not just the IT team that needs to be well-versed in their operation and use. The HR function also has a critical role when it comes to the use of AI by employees and by the employer.



“When new AI technology is introduced, it is important for HR to communicate guidelines around its use in a timely, clear, and consistent manner—managing the people side of the implementation,” says Amani Gharib, PhD, Director of HR Research and Advisory Services at McLean & Company.



“HR can also support through feedback and output review, as well as ensure that policies are relevant and in compliance with local and global laws and regulations,” Gharib adds. “By conducting risk assessments and creating policies around AI technology, HR will be able to manage ethical risks and considerations accordingly. It is also just as important for organizations to build resilience and manage the disruption of AI through effective change management and transformational leadership.”



Early concerns over AI in the workplace focused on AI taking jobs from human workers. While AI can replace a human worker entirely, in practice, there are perhaps more situations in which AI—in its various forms—will augment the work human employees are doing. While this collaboration can create tremendous productivity gains, it also raises a variety of ethical concerns for both employers and employees.



It’s therefore essential for the HR team to have a central role in managing the rules and processes around the use of AI in the workplace and for HR leaders to stay on top of rapidly changing trends related to the use of generative AI and other tools.

Generative AI is changing how people work, complete assignments, date, and create.
But the massive computer systems powering AI consume vast amounts of water and emit tons of carbon.
Even with green initiatives by big companies, the scale of the impact is expected to increase.

The information and communication technology industry, once lauded as a green example compared to significant sectors like agriculture and construction, uses up to 10% of the world's electricity and emits between 2 and 5% of the world's global carbon, according to statistics shared by the European Parliament.That amount is expected to rise to 14% of global emissions by 2040, according to research published in the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts have calculated that the amount of energy used to train large AI models equates to roughly 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide — the equivalent of approximately 300 round-trip flights between San Francisco and New York and almost five times the total emissions of the average car in its lifetime.Though AI has been lauded as a possible solution to climate concerns, with the UN's 2023 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claiming the tech will ""increase energy efficiency"" and ""promote the adoption"" of renewable energy, the industry has yet to contend with its actual impact to the environment.

Insider previously reported ChatGPT consumes a water bottle's worth of fresh water for every 20 to 50 prompts it is given because cooling water is flushed over hard-working servers to keep them at temperatures low enough to function.When Insider asked ChatGPT about its own carbon footprint, the chatbot was indirect, replying that its impact ""would be limited to the energy consumption of the computers and servers used to run me and process requests. The exact carbon footprint would depend on factors such as the energy sources used to power the computers and the efficiency of the data centers.""

Though some major tech companies have rolled out green initiatives to combat their impact on the environment – such as Google's goal to replenish 120% of the water it consumes and Microsoft's aim to be carbon neutral by 2030 – critics argue their actions amount to creative marketing and aren't enough to combat the real impact on the climate and environment.""There has been this long and concerted effort by the tech industry to make digital innovation seem compatible with sustainability,"" Adrienne Russell, co-director of the Center for Journalism, Media, and Democracy at the University of Washington, previously told Insider.

OpenAI and ChatGPT logos are seen in this illustration taken, February 3, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION)In stark contrast, non-users displayed a distinct lack of engagement and skepticism towards generative AI. The majority of non-users, comprising 68%, belong to the Gen X or Baby Boomer generations. A striking 88% of non-users admitted to being unclear about how generative AI would impact their lives. Furthermore, 40% of non-users cited a lack of familiarity with the technology, while 32% deemed it as not useful for their needs, reflecting their hesitancy to embrace this emerging technology.It&amp;rsquo;s like ketchup, use it on anythingLooking ahead, generative AI users are actively exploring various use cases, with a strong emphasis on integrating the technology into their work environments. An impressive 75% of users expressed their desire to automate tasks at work and use generative AI for work-related communications.Additionally, 38% of users utilize generative AI for leisure purposes, while 34% employ it for self-guided learning on topics of personal interest. The importance of enhanced safety and security in generative AI technology was emphasized by 62% of users, highlighting a growing concern in this aspect.Conversely, non-users are seeking improvements and education before fully embracing generative AI. A substantial 70% of non-users expressed their willingness to engage more with generative AI if they had a better understanding of the technology. Safety and security remain paramount, with 64% of non-users stressing the need for enhanced measures in generative AI. AdvertisementMoreover, 45% of non-users would consider increased adoption if generative AI seamlessly integrated with the technology they already use, underlining the importance of a smooth transition into this technology-driven future.Blazing fast adoptionThe outcome of Salesforce&amp;rsquo;s survey underscores the remarkable growth in generative AI adoption while highlighting the clear divide that still exists among potential users.

In 2017, the UAE launched its National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031, which aims to put the nation at the forefront of AI innovation in different sectors, an initiative considered the first of its kind regionally and globally.We see this enthusiasm about AI reflected in the UAE&rsquo;s workforce as a little over half (54%) are already using AI in their job, with 41% trying out AI tools like ChatGPT. The possibilities of AI at work are endlessThe lack of knowledge about AI is not stopping UAE professionals from wanting to experiment with it. Although 30% of them say they have not been provided with any formal AI training from their employer, over half (59%) want to learn more, even if they don&rsquo;t know where to start. It is clear that UAE professionals are optimistic about the potential AI can bring to their careers, with an overwhelming majority (98%) saying they are excited to use AI in their work, and a similar percentage (97%) who believe it will help their career progression in some way. Most are already thinking of ways AI can help them be more productive with 82% envisioning AI to improve their work-life balance. Over a third (67%) plan to use AI to say goodbye to boring work tasks and assist in answering questions they&rsquo;re too embarrassed to ask their colleagues, and 63% have progression on their mind as they plan to use it for career advice. We also know that more needs to be done to educate professionals on how to use AI as 45% of them feel their colleagues know more about AI than they do, 48% have even admitted to pretending they know more about AI to look &lsquo;in the know&rsquo; in front of teammates.Pairing soft skills with AI skills essential for the future Overall, the mood of the nation is one of embracing AI and people are focusing on the skills they believe will complement AI the most, which comes as no surprise as the UAE was one of the first countries to adopt AI.Professionals in the UAE believe interpersonal skills such as problem-solving (66%), time-management (69%), resilience and strategic thinking (67%) will become even more important as AI grows in prominence.With LinkedIn's data showing a significant 21-fold increase in global, English-language job listings mentioning AI technologies, including Chat GPT, since November 2022, embracing AI could be a pivotal move for those seeking career development.Ali Matar, EMEA Growth Markets Leader and Head of LinkedIn MENA, says: &ldquo;Just as we&rsquo;ve moved past the pandemic, once again professionals are adapting to another wave of change as generative AI becomes more prominent in the workplace. In a country as technologically progressive as the UAE, where a move towards innovation and integrating new technologies has long been apparent, it is encouraging to see that also its people are embracing the shift. Even more so, our data clearly shows that workers in the UAE are focusing on the many benefits AI can bring to their working lives, including more time to focus on the work they care about and helping with career progression.It&rsquo;s also clear that people are eager to learn more about AI and we&rsquo;re seeing a significant increase in conversations on LinkedIn with members already adding AI skills to their profiles, but our data also highlights the enormous value of soft skills as humans learn to partner with AI&ndash; and this is what is now shaping the future of work.&rdquo;Top tipsWhether you&rsquo;re AI-advanced or eager to learn, taking the plunge can help you in your career and job, and LinkedIn&rsquo;s Career Expert Najat Abdelhadi shares some advice to get you started: Learn the lingo: Having the language to talk about and understand AI will put you ahead of the curve. Study up on popular AI skills with resources like LinkedIn Learning where you can find the most popular AI courses unlocked for free until the end of the year. A good place to start is with How to Research and Write using generative AI, and What is generative AI and you can find the full list here.Embrace the experts and tap into your network: Reach out to your network to share learnings and stay up to speed on AI by following thought leaders and subject matter experts on LinkedIn, including Allie Miller and Greg Coquillo.Sharpen up your soft skills: Don&rsquo;t underestimate the value of highlighting your soft skills in a world being reshaped by AI. LinkedIn&rsquo;s AI at Work report shows a staggering 25% shift in the skills demanded by various global jobs since 2015. And with AI accelerating these shifts, people can expect a swifter transformation, with the skills required for many jobs to evolve by at least 65% by 2030. The top skills anticipated to be most in demand: problem solving, strategic thinking and time management.Take advantage of existing tools: Use AI tools already available to you on LinkedIn including collaborative articles &mdash; knowledge topics published by LinkedIn with insights and perspectives added by the LinkedIn community. These articles begin as AI-powered conversation starters, developed with our editorial team. Next, with the help of LinkedIn's Skills Graph, the team connects each article with subject experts who contribute with their advice and insights. Microsoft&rsquo;s WorkLab Guides also give helpful tips from how to use AI to dominate your task list to how to make in-person time count for your team.Acknowledge your AI worries: It&rsquo;s okay to feel a little nervous or overwhelmed with new technology! People felt similarly when the internet was introduced and it&rsquo;s important to remember that these changes don&rsquo;t happen overnight. These are long-term changes and you can do the work to be part of the change, not just be impacted by the change of AI.Source: Zawya(Press Release) ",Industry,,,,,,,,,emea@ethrworld.com

Hearing Wrap Up: Federal Government Use of Artificial Intelligence Poses Promise, Peril









Share via Email



WASHINGTON—The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation held a hearing titled, “How are Federal Agencies Harnessing Artificial Intelligence?” Members asked witnesses about the federal government’s current and planned use of artificial intelligence (AI), and discussed risks associated with the widespread integration of AI into various operations of the federal government. Members inquired as to how the government is preparing to safeguard against those risks, including potential violations of the civil liberties and privacy rights of citizens.
Key Takeaways:
Artificial Intelligence, if harnessed correctly, creates an opportunity for federal agencies to better achieve their mission.

Dr. Arati Prabhakar—Director of White House Office of Science and Technology Policy—spoke on the importance of the work being done within federal agencies to harness the capabilities of AI: “Our work is only becoming more important as AI’s capabilities advance, especially as AI is increasingly integrated into society. This is the moment for our government to take bold and decisive action, so that America can continue to lead the world in harnessing AI to do big things in ways that strengthen our values. I look forward to working with you to realize this tremendous opportunity.”

The federal government must responsibly govern its use of AI systems, and it must do so with appropriate oversight and accountability.

Dr. Craig Martell— Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer at the Department of Defense— discussed the need for proper oversight tools to be in place to safeguard national security interests from AI and to use AI to our nation’s advantage over adversaries: “AI-based technologies can help take advantage of opportunities and improve our capabilities and effectiveness. However, they also pose significant challenges and risks that require careful oversight, management, governance, and accountability. DoD is committed to developing and deploying AI technologies in a manner that upholds our Constitution, laws, policies, and values. We will lead in the global AI field thanks to our democratic principles, not in spite of them.”

The Biden Administration is delinquent in complying with laws and regulations intended to facilitate the appropriate use of AI by federal agencies. The Subcommittee has and will continue to lead and press for action on this issue.

Eric Hysen—Chief Information Officer at the Department of Homeland Security—emphasized the role of Congress – including this Committee — in establishing the authorities and responsibilities under which federal agencies will incorporate AI into their operations: “As the Chief Information Officer for DHS, I understand that this technological transformation requires growth and adaption within my role and the DHS IT community, as I apply authorities often authored or shaped from this Subcommittee and full Committee, such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. DHS looks to become a leader in the interagency as we confront this opportunity, but that will only be possible with continued support and leadership from Congress, especially this Subcommittee.

Member Highlights: Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation Chairwoman Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) pressed for answers why the Office of Management and Budget is two years late in issuing AI guidance to agencies after a White House witness insisted the guidance is an urgent priority.

Rep. Mace: “OMB is more than two years late in complying with a Congressional mandate to give federal agencies guidance on the acquisition and use of AI, the law requires OMB to coordinate with your office in drafting that guidance. Why is the process stalled? When can we expect to see some guidance?”
Dr. Prabhakar: “The Office of Management and Budget is working in a very focused manner on what they clearly understand is an important priority.”  
Rep. Mace: “Two years late?” 
Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.C.) spoke on the need for transparency as the federal government implements AI across federal agencies and concerns that criminals will be able to harness AI for nefarious purposes.

Rep. Langworthy: “Do you agree that the public has right to know for what purposes AI is being used by the federal agencies and that it’s important that these inventories are done consistently, completely and accurately, and will you pledge to work to continue to work to ensure that is the case?”
Dr. Prabhakar: “I share your focus on the value of those use cases for all the reasons that you mentioned, it’s important for the public to know, across government, for people to understand how AI is being used. There’s important progress that we are making and we will continue to make as a federal government on those AI use cases.”
Rep. Langworthy: “Mr. Hysen, are you concerned that as AI systems become more mature and complicated that criminals will have greater opportunity to commit heinous crimes…”
Mr. Hysen: “We absolutely are concerned there, however we are also looking to harness AI to combat those crimes.” Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) discussed the national security application of AI and how our national security apparatus perceives AI’s monolithic nature.
Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) discussed the national security application of AI and how our national security apparatus perceives AI’s monolithic nature. 

Rep. Timmons: “Can we talk about possible uses of AI within either DOD or our adversaries’ military capabilities?”
Mr. Martell: “AI is not monolithic, when we say AI what we really mean is a specific AI based technology, or a specific statistically based technology. It’s important to differentiate that because we may be doing really well for one use case and very poorly in another and that may be so for our adversaries as well. If we focus mostly on AI as a monolithic thing, if we have it we win, if they have it we lose, then we are actually missing where we should be aiming our attention at. Particular activities that we want to deliver and particular capabilities that we want to defend against.”
