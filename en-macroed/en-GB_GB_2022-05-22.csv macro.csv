As world leaders meet in Davos this week for the World Economic Forum, President Alice Gast writes on using AI in the race to meet the SDGs.
Writing for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Agenda, President Gast says artificial intelligence (AI) could help us achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) more rapidly.
President Gast writes: ""It is imperative that we put good processes and practices in place to ensure AI is developed in a positive and ethical way to see it adopted and used to its fullest by citizens and governments.
""We must now work together to ensure that artificial intelligence can accelerate progress of the Sustainable Development Goals and help us get back on track to reaching them by 2030.""

President Gast highlighted some of the projects at Imperial that are harnessing the potential of AI to reach the SDGs. 
Healthcare


AI is being used to spot breast cancer

Researchers from Google Health, DeepMind, the NHS, Northwestern University and colleagues at Imperial have designed and trained an AI model to spot breast cancer from X-ray images.


The computer algorithm, which was trained using mammography images from almost 29,000 women, was shown to be as effective as human radiologists in spotting cancer. At a time when health services around the world are stretched as they deal with long backlogs of patients following the pandemic, this sort of technology can help ease bottlenecks and improve treatment.
Malaria diagnosis in developing countries
For malaria, a handheld lab-on-a-chip molecular diagnostics systems developed with AI could revolutionize how the disease is detected in remote parts of Africa. The project, which is led by the Digital Diagnostics for Africa Network, brings together collaborators such as MinoHealth AI Labs in Ghana and Imperial’s Global Development Hub. This technology could help pave the way for universal health coverage and push us towards achieving SDG3.
Improving food production


AI is being used to improve crop production and fertilize more effectively

With an expanding global population, we face challenges around food demand and production – not only how to reduce malnourishment but the impact on the planet too, such as deforestation, emissions and biodiversity loss. To meet these needs, the use of artificial intelligence in agriculture is growing rapidly and is enabling farmers to enhance crop production, direct machinery to carry out tasks autonomously, and identify pest infestations before they occur.


Smart sensing technology is also helping farmers use fertilizer more effectively and reduce environmental damage. An exciting research project, funded by the EPSRC, Innovate UK and Cytiva, will help growers optimize timing and amount of fertilizer to use on their crops, taking into account factors like the weather and soil condition. This will reduce the expense and damaging effects of over-fertilizing soil.
Imperial at Davos
Imperial College Business School will be in Davos alongside the World Economic Forum from 22 - 26 May 2022. They will be holding a series of events on the theme of Transforming Organisations, Transforming Markets – an opportunity to explore some of the most pressing challenges and exciting opportunities facing business today.
One of the salons will focus on 'Delivering AI ethics' and another will focus on 'Decoding digital assets'.
Imperial academics will also be taking part in fringe panels on 'Integrating SDGs in the transition to Web3 technologies' and 'Rethinking Capitalism in the 4th industrial revolution'.

Could machines do better than humans at spotting events so far considered unpredictable, such as the COVID-19 pandemic? Jim Marshall and Stephan Mergenthaler have been using natural language-understanding technology to detect trends—and analyse them at depth. They write that this type of analysis is an important foundation for people to better anticipate the future and prepare for it.

 
Nassim Taleb’s best-selling 2007 book “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable” was meant to offer a blueprint for more resilient business strategies in a networked world. Instead, the title has become a shorthand for any event that caught us unprepared. But are these types of events quickly labelled as black swans really unpredictable, or is it our inability that keeps us from connecting the dots at scale to spot and prepare for them? Could machines do better than humans at spotting them, given their near infinite capacity to read, absorb, and assimilate? And could we help communities and stakeholders to “look around the corner” a little on the topics that have greatest potential to impact their organisations, to build the kind of resilience that Taleb called for?
As part of our work developing the World Economic Forum’s strategic intelligence capabilities, we have been aggregating and surfacing high-quality content on over two hundred global issues to over three quarters of a million users for nearly four years now. This gives us a tremendous data set from which we can extrapolate trends that are shaping the world around us. What’s more, our hand-picked network of content partners from around the world means that we automatically exclude much of the noisy clickbait, fake news, and poor quality content that plague the Internet at large. We work with hundreds of think tanks, universities, research institutions and independent publishers in all major regions of the world to provide a truly global perspective. As such, when examining trends, we can be reasonably confident that our data are well positioned when it comes to the intrinsic biases inherent to open text analysis on uncurated content from the Internet.
Our recent advancements in harnessing machine learning and natural language-understanding technology mean that we are able to understand these trends at depth. We can not only look at the technical factors, such as volume and velocity of discussions, but also the strategic and emotional aspects driving them as well. Based on these unique trend characteristics, we wondered whether we might be able to predict their direction of travel. Are they a “flash in the pan” that will quickly come to a conclusion, or are they part of a longer, slow-burning trend that will build momentum over a period of years? Could the trend present opportunity or risk, is it disruptive, and could it end with a crisis or breakthrough? Perhaps more importantly, should you act now, or wait?
To answer these questions, we decided to look back in time through our database of over one million high-quality articles. We wanted to know, in retrospect, if we had known what to pay attention to, if we could have better prepared ourselves for future events — for example, a pandemic.
Long before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, there were very visible warnings about our level of preparedness for such kind of pandemic. For example, in April 2018, academic articles such as “Bats, Coronaviruses, and Deforestation: Toward the Emergence of Novel Infectious Diseases?” and similar articles published by Frontiers featured clear warnings about what was about to unfold almost two years later. While it stated that “the exact time and nature of the emergence of a disease cannot be predicted,” it warned that “the increased probability [of such events] must be considered seriously”. Throughout 2019 we surfaced articles like this from Science Daily, highlighting that “not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic” and this one from Project Syndicate entitled “Preventing the next Pandemic”.
These are just some data points representing a plethora of warnings from the wider expert community in the years leading up to the pandemic. Why is it then that we often revert to the black swan theory to exonerate ourselves from any degree of preparedness? It’s a principle we see at play in many other areas as well: Global societal trends and emerging technologies interact and create effects that may be apparent and widely discussed within narrow expert communities, but often fail to gather broad-based visibility before a substantial disruption takes place. Their development is often characterised by exponentiality and complexity – dynamics that are hard to grasp for the human brain, but fundamental to the behaviour of networked societies.
In other words, the signals of disruption may be there, but for humans to pay attention to, and connect the dots between, possible interactions and repercussions across hundreds of different topic areas is overwhelming and easily leads to neglect or denial. Doing this kind of systemic horizon scanning is next to impossible without the filtering ability, throughput, and analytical powers of intelligent machines.
Figure 1. Automatically detecting and monitoring topics using machine learning and natural language understanding

Building on top of our previous work using natural language understanding technology to detect important signals in content, we built an ensemble of advanced neural networks to identify, name, monitor and forecast trends. You can see a selection of the COVID-19 related trends that our models have been tracking for us below. The height of the line corresponds to the relative volume of discussion about the topic and the colour of the line corresponds to the sentiment of the discussions (negative is red, neutral is yellow, positive is green). The shaded section on the right gives a glimpse of the future at the time of writing (mid-May 2022).
Figure 2. Trends detected by advanced neural networks

We are already piloting alerts based on the trends that our models predict will come to the fore in the next month. The beauty of this approach is that we can backtest our model over four years’ worth of knowledge to give a general indication of its accuracy. So far, we are at around 70% accuracy within one standard deviation of the mean on forecasts up to one month in advance. As we add more signals into the mix, we expect to not only improve the accuracy but also the foresight timeframe.
Figure 3. Retrospectively comparing predicted vs. actual volume of discussions
about the topic of stalkerware in April 2022

While much more work needs to be done to improve our ability to enact decisive collective actions when faced with signals of future disruption, we see this work as an important foundation for stakeholders to better anticipate and prepare for the future. In doing so, we will hopefully be in a better position to face the black swans of tomorrow.

You could enhance the tool nicely by somewhat simplifying it!  🙂  A physics approach to understanding the emergence of complex systems has successfully verified that an early sign of their bursting onto our scene is finding continuities of regular proportional change (CRPC). It’s relatively easy to train a computer to lool for those, then for someone familiar with the context to confirm what kind of emergence they represent.  What CRPC indicates is successive changing scales of organization in self-organizing systems. That progression also seems implied to be necessary to escape the barrier of energy conservation in finding bootstrap innovations for starting up new systems.
I’d be pleased to talk, FYI. Some links to my early and recent progress with it are below.

Building your organization’s digital acumen is a critical priority for CIOs today. You won’t be future-ready by simply hiring people with the most cutting-edge skills – you also need to create a culture where everyone is continually working on growing and evolving their skills together.
I often tell my IT organization that the half-life of an IT professional is about 18 months because technology is constantly changing; thus, it is critical we are all continual learners. That’s true not only at Johnson & Johnson; I’ve observed this across other companies and industries too.
To support building our IT organization’s digital acumen, we implemented a program that uses artificial intelligence to assess our skills. Not only has this given us tremendous transparency into the strengths and gaps in our organization, but it’s also enabled us to keep our team members marketable and empowered. When you have an empowered team, they are more likely to be motivated to bring their best to their work.
Using AI to assess skills
The methodology we applied uses a three-pronged approach, assessing about 40 technical and leadership skills across our IT organization.
[ Also read Artificial intelligence (AI): 7 roles to prioritize now. ]
The first element is an AI model, which uses both internal and external data to assess competencies against a core skill set we are seeking to assess and develop; e.g., a full-stack engineer.
It compares employees’ skill sets to someone in a similar role or title in the external marketplace on a scale of 1 to 5. We also pull in internal data sources, such as Jira and Workday, which contain information from their resumes, for example. That helps strengthen the accuracy and correlation of the model.
The second element used to assess skill sets is an employee self-assessment. Employees receive the results of the AI model, and they validate whether they believe their skills are in line with the AI assessment.
The final prong is the manager assessment, in which the manager rates the skills of that individual employee.
This approach to assessing skill sets has been valuable for several reasons. First, it ensures the use of objective information in the evaluation process, reducing the influence of subjective views that managers may have, based on limited interactions with employees. We can see if someone has much stronger skills in a particular area than we may have known, or if someone’s skills aren’t as robust in one area as we may have thought.
We don’t use this data punitively, however, and we’ve been very clear about that from the start. Rather, it gives us a baseline for how we can develop our team members for the future.
This data has also provided greater insight into skill areas that are important to our future state but where we’re less evolved. That’s enabled us to think about how to increase learning and experience opportunities so we can work on growing those desirable skill sets.
Having data-driven insights into our skill strengths and gaps has enabled us to focus on how we can double down and build upon them.
The data has also given us insight into employees with strong skills that we didn’t know about until we had the assessment results. Now we’re able to tap them for their expertise and for new opportunities, which allows them to develop and share those skill sets with others. The data has also uncovered development opportunities for managers to advance capabilities and continually improve.
[ Increasing digital acumen across the organization is a key priority for CIOs, according to a report from Harvard Business Review Analytic Services. Learn more. ] 
While we’ve learned a lot about the composition of skills in our organization, the data has enabled us to identify and prioritize skills for the future, too. To be future-ready, we know we must continue to focus on skills around intelligent automation, data engineering, data management, data science, full-stack development, architecture, AI, and product leadership. We’ve discovered that we have some really strong skills in areas like lab integration, scrum, and product team development.
Having data-driven insights into our skill strengths and gaps has enabled us to focus on how we can double down and build upon them. We’re encouraging everyone to create a learning development plan, and to support that, we’ve developed several learning modules that individuals can leverage for training.
Creating opportunities for applying skills
The feedback we’ve received from team members both inside and outside our organization has been phenomenal. They see that we’re investing in their future, and they have a clear picture of how they’re positioned in the organization. They want to develop their skills so they can be viable, valuable, and marketable.
While growing and learning new skills is important, the key is to create opportunities for them to apply and leverage these new skills. One way we’ve supported this is through what we call our gig marketplace – a forum where teams can advertise for specific skill sets and where individuals can apply to fulfill them.
For example, a team working on a technology solution supporting our cancer treatment therapy might need a full-stack developer. If you’re qualified for that project, you can apply for the opportunity to participate on the team and put those skills to work.
We’re also using the tool to put together high-performing teams from diverse backgrounds to solve a common problem. This is another way for individuals to amplify the type of work they want to do while interacting with different people with different skill sets.

Making this work for you
We’ve reaped tremendous value from this skills assessment, and it’s helped our broader organization understand the importance of growing our digital acumen. It’s important that CIOs don’t do this alone, however.
CIOs need to create partnerships across the C-suite for this to be effective throughout the organization – leading within the technology domain while HR leads the overall talent approach and business leaders apply their strategies.
With persistence, you can show progress along the digital talent journey over time. Tie it into the core of the company, into the mission, and bring everyone along the way. That’s how we’ve tackled improving our digital acumen so we can continue to drive outcomes and serve the patients and customers who are counting on us every day.

Jobs of the future are already hereHere are three ways humans and robots are already working together.1. Drones that deliver helpIn Africa, drones are being used to deliver medicines in Malawi. Drone academies in Benin and Sierra Leone in West Africa are training local people in drone piloting and addressing skills gaps in the technology.German aerospace company Wingcopter makes the drones for commercial and humanitarian work.“Transit is not possible through roads, so drones come in and help poorer and less advantaged people have access to medicine,” explains Nthambi Mpazanje, Chief Remote Pilot At Wingcopter.Automation is a scary word for many people because they feel machines will take away their job, says Andy Fisanich, Head of Humanitarian Programs at Wingcopter. But the reality is that technology will actually lead to “better standards, better skilled jobs and more opportunity,” says Fisanich. Traditional jobs will transition into “new and more exciting jobs of the future,” she says.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies2. Robots that help nursesIn hospitals, a robot called Moxi is helping clinical staff fetch and deliver things including lab samples, medicines, personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies. By handling mundane tasks, the robot frees up time for nurses and clinicians to focus on patient care.Moxi is built by Diligent Robotics, an artificial intelligence company based in Texas in the United States. The company’s co-founder, Andrea Thomaz, says it’s the “deep connection with their patients” that nurses and clinicians say they love most about their jobs.Patients may have more interactions with automation and technology in the jobs of the future, but Thomaz feels person-to-person caregiving will always be here.DiscoverWhat is the World Economic Forum doing about drones? Show moreThe World Economic Forum is partnering with governments and companies to create flexible regulations that allow drones to be manufactured and used in various ways to help society and the economy.Drones can do many wonderful things, but their upsides are often overshadowed by concerns about privacy, collisions and other potential dangers. To make matters worse, government regulations have not been able to keep up with the speed of technological innovation.In 2017 the World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution teamed up with the Government of Rwanda to draft the world’s first framework for governing drones at scale. Using a performance-based approach that set minimum safety requirements instead of equipment specifications, this innovative regulatory framework gave drone manufacturers the flexibility to design and test different types of drones. These drones have delivered life-saving vaccines, conducted agricultural land surveys, inspected infrastructure and had many other socially beneficial uses in Rwanda.Today, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is working with governments and companies in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America to co-design and pilot agile policies that bring all the social and economic benefits of drone technology while minimizing its risks.Read more here, and contact us if you're interested in getting involved with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution's pioneering work in the governance of emerging technologies.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies3. Coral restoration robotsWith the world’s coral reefs suffering the effects of climate change, technology is increasingly stepping in to help.To clean and maintain 10,000 coral fragments, three people would need to work full-time for a year, putting in 4,000 hours of work, research shows. Now a coral farming robot is using computer automation – AI – to cut costs and save time.A device called Charm – which stands for Coral Husbandry Automated Raceway Machine – has a robotic arm with soft brushes that clean algae from corals, and a camera that detects the corals. It can also feed coral when they’re hungry and identify pests.Massachusetts Institution of Technology graduate Stephen Rodan invented Charm. He says the technology can “grow thousands to hopefully millions of coral by the touch of a button” and views Charm as a useful tool in the race to “help restore coral reefs around the world”.List of technologies likely to be adopted by jobs of the future by 2025 (Future of Job Survey, World Economic Forum) Image: World Economic Forum How can we prepare for the new world of work?Employers expect to offer reskilling and upskilling to just over 70% of their employees by 2025, according to the Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020. An average of 66% of employers surveyed for the report also expect to get a return on their investment in upskilling and reskilling within one year.“Everything you want to learn is available on the internet,” says Chris Do, Chief Executive and Founder of online education platform The Futur. It’s also easier, quicker and cheaper to explore than, for example, a traditional university application.Workshops, courses, e-books, training and one-to-one mentorship are some of the resources available online, Do says.Data analysts, machine learning specialists and robotics engineers are among the roles that are growing in demand, the World Economic Forum finds. But softer skills are also needed. These include problem-solving, creativity, working with people and resilience.Have you read?These are the top 10 job skills of tomorrow – and how long it takes to learn themFrom robotic dogs to magnetic slime: 6 ways robots are helping humansThe rise in automation and what it means for the futureAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on DronesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesJobs and the Future of WorkShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

In a letter to the chair and vice-chair of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office (NAIIO), healthcare and technology stakeholders asked that healthcare be included in the scope of its work to advance US artificial intelligence (AI) by adding a healthcare subcommittee to the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC).







The NAIIO was established by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 to help coordinate the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative. Specifically, the NAIIO serves as the central point of contact for information exchange on activities related to the initiative and provides support to the Select Committee on AI, the senior interagency committee that oversees the initiative, and the NAIAC.
The NAIAC, launched in April, advises the president and the NAIIO on topics related to US AI competitiveness, progress in implementing the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative, and other information pertaining to AI. The NAIAC’s members consist of leaders from academia, civil society, non-profits, and the private sector with AI-relevant expertise. Currently, the NAIAC only has one subcommittee, which focuses on AI and law enforcement.
In the letter sent to the NAIIO, which was shared with HealthITAnalytics via email, stakeholders stated that AI development in healthcare has significant potential to positively impact US AI competitiveness:
“In no area is there greater potential for positive transformation domestically, and to advance U.S. competitiveness and international leadership, than healthcare,"" the letter states. ""Leveraging health data (including social determinants of health [SDOH] and PGHD [patient-generated health data]) with AI tools holds incredible promise for advancing value-based care in research, health administration and operations, population health, practice delivery improvement, and direct clinical care. To realize this potential, the U.S. system must continue to evolve to provide incentives for investments that will support U.S. leadership in health AI.”
The stakeholders recommended that the NAIAC include healthcare in its work by creating a standing healthcare subcommittee, similar to the one created for AI and law enforcement, made up of public and private sector experts on health AI.
“We recommend that this standing subcommittee address issues including research and development incentives, quality assurance and oversight, thoughtful design, access and affordability, ethics and data bias mitigation, linkages to data privacy and security, data interoperability, workforce issues, and education,"" the letter states. ""We write to recommend that you take additional steps to ensure that the NAIAC’s scope and work includes a focus on considerations specific to healthcare.”
The signatories of the letter include AdvaMed, the American Medical Association, Anthem, the Connected Health Initiative, the Consumer Technology Association, the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance, and Qi-Fense.

As our computer software and hardware constantly improve, employers find new ways to take advantage of these advancements. Instead of being relegated to increasing productivity, new technology, like artificial intelligence, is taking on additional roles in the workplace. Applications include monitoring employees and assisting in the hiring process.


But using new technology for decisions traditionally made by humans could have a few growing pains, including inadvertent discrimination. Luckily, workplace civil rights enforcement agencies like the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are anticipating this potential problem and have taken steps to tackle it.

How Employers Are Using New Technology in the Workplace

There are two major areas in which employers are using technology in ways that could lead to illegal discrimination. First, it’s with monitoring employees’ productivity levels and measuring their performance. Second, it’s when making hiring decisions.

PROMOTED
Using software, artificial intelligence and algorithms to increase the efficiency of the hiring process might be the single biggest example of how companies are trying to make the most of new technology. But in this quest to save time, money and effort, certain job applicants could find themselves at an unfair and illegal disadvantage.
How Advanced Technology Could Lead to Inadvertent Workplace Discrimination
In regards to employee monitoring (and ignoring the potential legal issues involved), there are situations where the goal of identifying who the most productive workers are could result in violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).

For instance, an employer might have software that monitors an employee’s keystrokes or completed computer tasks over a given time period. But what if an employee has an ADA-recognized disability that makes typing or using a traditional mouse cumbersome?

To deal with this challenge, they might have access to a reasonable accommodation, like voice recognition software or some other type of input device. Yet if the monitoring software doesn’t take these accommodations into account, the employee with a disability could be unfairly graded by the monitoring software. This flawed assessment might ignore the fact that the employee is perfectly capable of completing their job tasks with a reasonable accommodation. An employer aware of this scenario could avoid this situation by using a different way of testing or grading the employee’s productivity levels. But the trick is being aware that this type of scenario could arise.

As for technology leading to discrimination during the hiring process, there are many possible pitfalls for an unwary employer. Some examples include:


Software and algorithms that scan resumes from applicants for specific keywords.
Facial and voice-recognition technology that grades job applicants based on how they talk and their facial expressions.
Asking potential employees to take a self-assessment test to determine their personality and if they’ll be a good fit for a particular position.
Using chatbots or virtual assistants to ask job applicants basic questions about their qualifications.
Requiring prospective hires to take a pre-employment test on a computer.


These seem innocuous, and for the most part, they are. So how could they lead to discrimination? In example #1, whoever develops the algorithms and software might unknowingly program the technology to give special preferences to gender-biased words. This might give resumes from a particular sex or gender an advantage in the selection process.
In example #2, the software and algorithms could place a special emphasis on candidates that speak a certain way or use certain words. But those with accents, a unique manner of speaking or disabilities that affect speech could be penalized by the technology. This could lead to unlawful discrimination based on someone’s race, color, national origin or disability.
For example #3, a candidate with severe depression could be disqualified from a position due to their “personality” even though their answers are a consequence of a mental impairment that’s recognized by the ADA.
For example #4, imagine a chatbot that asks job applicants yes or no questions about their job history. And one of the questions is if they were ever fired from a job “for cause.” An applicant wants to answer truthfully and errs on the side of caution by answering “yes.” Yet this answer automatically results in their disqualification from the position. But the chatbot didn’t allow the job applicant to explain that the reason for their termination was later found to be illegal because it was due to the job applicant’s age.
In the fifth example, the test itself may not be discriminatory. But if it’s given in a way that places certain applicants at a disadvantage because of a protected trait, it could be illegal.
A hypothetical situation might be an aptitude test that has to be taken on a computer in the employer’s office and measures the job candidate’s typing skills. But the job candidate is visually impaired. And while they can type on a regular keyboard, their typing skills are nowhere near as good as when using a braille keyboard.
What Can Employers Do to Avoid Technology Discrimination?
The biggest thing employers can do is become educated about the potential problems new technology can have. And that despite the best intentions, discrimination can still take place.
In the majority of situations, employers making use of technology aren’t trying to discriminate. But they might be ignorant of how the use of their technology results in the dismissal of promising applicants and successful employees because of protected characteristics.
To help increase awareness among employers, various government agencies have released legal and technical guidance. These are intended to advise employers on what they need to look out for when implementing new software, algorithms and artificial technology in the workplace.
Two recent releases have come from the EEOC and DOJ with The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees and Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and Disability Discrimination in Hiring, respectively. These focus on disability discrimination, but are likely just the beginning.
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) will probably release its own legal guidance for employers. Then there’s probably going to be guidance handed down in regards to how an employer’s use of technology could lead to discrimination in violation of other federal laws, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).
Bottom Line
New technology can help provide new ways for employers to get work done. But if they’re not careful, it could result in inadvertent discrimination of employees and job applicants. Federal agencies responsible for enforcing workplace civil rights laws are already taking steps to help employers avoid these mistakes.

By 2025, the World Economic Forum estimates that 97 million new jobs may emerge as artificial intelligence (AI) changes the nature of work and influences the new division of labor between humans, machines and algorithms. Specifically in banking, a recent McKinsey survey found that AI technologies could deliver up to $1 trillion of additional value each year. AI is continuing its steady rise and starting to have a sweeping impact on the financial services industry, but its potential is still far from fully realized.
The transformative power of AI is already impacting a range of functions in financial services including risk management, personalization, fraud detection and ESG analytics. The problem is that advances in AI are slowed down by a global shortage of workers with the skills and experience in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing and robotic process automation. So with AI technology opening new opportunities, financial services workers are eager to gain the skills they need in order to leverage AI tools and advance their careers.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Today, 87% of employees consider retraining and upskilling options at workplaces very important, and at the same time, more companies ranked upskilling their workforce as a top-5 business priority now than pre-pandemic. Companies that don’t focus on powering AI training will fall behind in a tight hiring market. Below are some key takeaways for business leaders looking to prioritize reskilling efforts at their organization.
Build data literacy with customizable learning paths
Any digital transformation requires leaders to focus their investments on two modern sources of competitive advantage: data and people. First, boosting data literacy across the organization helps line of business and domain experts (Sales, HR, Marketing, Financial Analysts, etc.) collaborate with AI and machine learning experts, which is critical to move beyond proof of concepts and experimentation. 
For AI tools to be deployed at scale, those employees whose jobs involve interactions with AI systems need to understand how those systems work and what the constraints and limitations might be. Reskilling these individuals may include how to interpret the results of the AI/ML models or how to intervene with AI/ML experts when the results seem off.
A recent McKinsey study found that effective reskilling is 20% more cost-effective than a “hiring and firing” approach, and utilizing the right tools and technology can help companies accomplish their reskilling goals. 
Importantly, before taking on any AI reskilling efforts, banks and financial services organizations need to first understand what outcome they’re driving towards and what skills are required. An employee self-assessment survey that focuses on necessary skills can help companies determine a customized curriculum and plan based on the existing skills gaps.  advertisement
The notion of a one-size-fits-all training program or that employees need to take significant time away from the office to attend courses is no longer relevant. Utilizing digital learning platforms like Skillsoft, Udacity, or Udemy, or integrating content into mainstream work systems can make employees’ reskilling experiences more user-friendly. Platforms like WalkMe can help employees learn complex software systems quickly, and Axonify can deliver 5- to 10-minute microlearning sessions to employees within their daily workflow. For an even more customized approach, companies may opt to build their own programs with the help of industry consultants and professors who are experts in their field. 
Turn to in-house, existing tools and groups for AI reskilling
A Deloitte survey found that 94% of employees would stay at a company if it helped them develop and learn new skills, but only 15% can access learning opportunities directly related to their jobs. AI reskilling offers an immense opportunity for both financial services companies and their employees, but it can be daunting to consider monetary and time investments needed with reskilling efforts. The good news is that businesses can often utilize existing company tools instead of purchasing all new software. 
Here are three excellent sources to help accelerate AI/ML training and implementation:
Industry consortiums: You might also consider joining industry consortiums that support your team’s progress and encourage employee growth through collaborative groups. For example, FINOS (fintech open source consortium under Linux Foundation) helps facilitate the processing and exchange of financial data throughout the entire banking ecosystem. Cloud Service Providers (CSP) Training and Certification Programs: Many of the CSPs, such as AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft, offer ML training and certification programs for free or subsidized prices. These self-guided programs vary in topics and tracks from understanding conversational AI to machine learning for business and technical decision-makers and are designed for those looking to learn new skills or to build or switch careers.Technology Enablers’ AI-powered Solution Accelerators: Additionally, many companies like IBM, AWS, PwC and Databricks offer easily deployable tools and solutions accelerators for common data analytics and machine learning use cases that organizations can utilize. Instead of enduring the weeks of development time, technical practitioners like data scientists, solutions architects and developers (from novice to experts) can leverage these accelerators to enable faster time to modernization and help talent upskilling. At Databricks, our financial services solutions accelerators help companies capitalize on the open banking paradigm, providing free code and training that helps with front-to-back-end automation. This includes free SAS to Python training to help technical and non-technical teams combine AI and rules-based fraud algorithms. 
Recognize the cultural benefits of offering AI reskilling opportunitiesadvertisement
Investing in employees’ skills and knowledge can build a positive company culture and reduce turnover by boosting employees’ confidence and productivity, and it creates a more well-rounded workforce that increases teams’ effectiveness.
AI reskilling efforts can also help financial services organizations make better progress on their diversity, equity and inclusion methods by making learning more accessible to individuals who have faced barriers to higher education. To address this and the skills gap, banks including Bank of America, BBVA, Capital One, CIBC and JPMorgan Chase have invested in job training and reskilling efforts for their employees. 
Bank of America’s career tools and resources have helped more than 21,000 employees find new roles at the company. Consistent training of new technologies and certifications are an investment in shaping the workforce of the future and will help to ensure that employees stay ahead of current trends and industry demands. 
Look to data and employee metrics 
As a leader at an organization focused on data and AI, we always look to the data to show what we should prioritize internally – and this includes what we should focus on in our AI reskilling efforts. When measuring the success of reskilling programs and initiatives, a recent LinkedIn study found that today’s measures assessing the impact of training programs relied primarily on soft metrics, including completion rates, satisfaction scores and employee feedback. 
This is a missed opportunity as company leaders can – and should – consider utilizing harder metrics that measure business value including increases in employee retention, productivity or revenue, to gain the most helpful insights from their reskilling initiatives. If it’s not working well, companies can consider bringing in new technologies or tools, or adjusting their program and overall experience to make it successful in the future, and by doing so, continue to stay ahead in the competitive war for talent.  
Future-proofing starts now
In Jamie Dimon’s latest shareholder letter to JPMorgan investors, he points out: “Our most important asset — far more important than capital — is the quality of our people.” He continues, “technology always drives change, but now the waves of technological innovation come in faster and faster.” 
Since companies that reskill their employees are more productive, produce positive economic returns and see increased employee satisfaction, there’s no better time to start than now.

AI, machine learning, and deep learning all made it possible for computers to replicate human intelligence at a fast rate.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been drawing the attention of executives and researchers over the past decade with its value proposition of driving more impactful decisions by providing data-driven insights, increasing efficiencies, and reducing costs.An AI revolution is quietly occurring within the human capital management (HCM) space. This means AI solutions will find their way into the HR department in the coming years. Human capital professionals must adapt to this new technology to increase productivity and transform their roles at work.So how can you leverage AI as an HR manager? Let’s look at what AI offers your business and how it will impact Human Capital Management in 2022.What is HCM?What is HCM?SourceHCM stands for Human Capital Management. It is the umbrella term for the various processes and systems that organizations use to manage and maximize the value of their employees. It includes activities such as recruiting and hiring, onboarding and orientation, training and development, performance management, compensation and benefits, employee relations, and workplace planning.Essentially, HCM is all about managing people as assets to increase organizational productivity and competitiveness.Human Capital Management With AIHuman Capital Management With AISourceAI in HCM can process incoming data, assisting with natural language processing and deep learning to make completing tasks easier for humans. Virtual assistants allow employees to communicate more efficiently without bothering HR departments, thus increasing productivity.In the 1980s, Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) and Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) emerged. Over time, these technologies matured. There has been a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI), thus combining a diverse range of HR data from across the company into one centralized solution.It simplifies all the data, turning it into something much easier to understand. You can use this information to predict how well the company will do based on its employees’ performance.None of this would have been possible without data labeling. For example, because of well-labeled data, today, we can convert hardcopy content into digital files, also known as optical character recognition.How Can AI Improve HCM?How Can AI Improve HCM?SourceNow that we know how AI will affect human resources, let’s see how it benefits HR.1. Optimize Employee OnboardingAccording to a recent survey, nearly 90% of managers say a new hire’s first day is crucial for setting an employee up for success. A lot of that depends on how well employers have prepared their new hires ahead of time.To make onboarding as seamless as possible, you can use AI technology to give your employees everything they need before joining your office: training, webinars, FAQs, and more.That way, when someone walks into your office, you don’t have to waste time getting them up to speed — they’re already there.2. Improve Your Recruitment ProcessRecruitment is a major expense for many businesses. Most companies spend too much time and money on an inefficient process, often missing out on top talent while they’re at it. Fortunately, employers are using artificial intelligence in their hiring practices to help them improve efficiencies and save resources.By leveraging AI across multiple steps of your recruitment process — from candidate’s search to onboarding — you can cut down on costs, waste and errors while improving productivity across your HR department.First, artificial intelligence can help you shorten your candidate search. An automated candidate-sourcing tool can help find qualified people by searching available talent pools and facilitating their applications for your job openings. This saves time on manual searches and lets you focus on contacting promising candidates directly rather than sifting through résumés that don’t meet your criteria.Ensuring candidates with relevant experience apply to open positions also improves employer brand awareness and increases your chances of finding great hires early in the process.3. Reduce HR CostsArtificial intelligence is taking over many functions in business, including Human Capital Management (HCM). Learn how to make your HR department more efficient by implementing artificial intelligence systems. Artificial intelligence can analyze job descriptions and salaries, distribute employee files throughout your company, provide educational opportunities, etc.In addition to reducing human resource costs, artificial intelligence can also improve employee satisfaction. It is highly beneficial for both employees and employers.Try human capital management software today!4. Streamline Performance ManagementAutomated technologies have improved to enable real-time management that enhances employee satisfaction and makes employees more productive. With AI, managers can engage with their employees more productively. Machine learning algorithms can also help assess job performance more objectively and accurately than human managers.It’s not just about efficiency: Using artificial intelligence in human resources is about more than increasing efficiency. It gives you a competitive edge by empowering you to attract top talent through better recruitment processes and improve productivity by better managing your existing staff.5. Automate Your Benefits PackagesAutomating human capital management (HCM) tasks like benefits packages free up HR professionals’ time to focus on strategic HR issues. It also ensures your team always complies with laws, regulations, and industry trends — meaning that their management of human capital looks professional and is also sustainable. Finally, automation empowers employees to self-serve whenever possible.It not only makes it easy for them to stay abreast of recent developments and changes in your benefits packages, but it also helps foster a culture of empowerment throughout your organization.6. Provide Tools For Increasing Employee EngagementWhether you are working for a large organization or starting a business, implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into your human capital management (HCM) solution can make your workplace more efficient and help increase employee engagement. While some companies may worry about how AI will impact their workforce, adopting tools that boost productivity and engagement can help retain employees by showing them how valuable they are to your company.And with organizations moving away from traditional methods of recruiting, retaining, and managing staff members, HCM is becoming increasingly crucial to maintaining and growing an effective workforce.There are several ways organizations can implement artificial intelligence into their HCM solutions to increase engagement.Some examples include- Predictive analytics: Predictive analytics helps human resources departments make better decisions about employee retention, hiring, and management by predicting future outcomes based on historical data. More data will make your predictions more accurate — and predictive analytics tools use as much data as possible to create models that help you predict what will happen in your workforce over time.What Factors To Consider Before Investing In Any AI-Powered HCM Tool?SourceFor investing in an AI-powered HCM tool, there are several factors that you need to consider. Foremost, you need to consider the needs of your organization. What specific features and functions does your organization require? Once you understand what your organization needs, you can start looking at different HCM tools on the market and compare their features.It’s also essential to check the scalability of the HCM tool. Can it handle the growing needs of your organization? Is it easy to deploy and use?Furthermore, you need to think about how well the tool integrates with other systems within your organization. A smooth integration is crucial for ensuring a seamless user experience.Closing ThoughtsIn a world where technology is continuously evolving, it’s essential to ensure that your organization does everything possible to stay at the top of the competition. One way to do this is by implementing AI into your human capital management strategy and using advanced software, like consultant time tracking software, project budgeting software.By automating tedious and time-consuming tasks, AI can help improve nearly every aspect of HCM. While there are many benefits to implementing AI in your human capital management strategy, it is essential to note that not all businesses will see the same results.Your business can automate HR processes, boost employee productivity, and increase overall efficiency with the right tools. Ready to take the next step?It is essential to try software that can meet both your business and the specific needs of HR to get the most out of your investment.

What Is Deepfake and How Does it Work? 
A deepfake is defined as an artificial intelligence-powered form of media that depicts a person saying something they did not say, appearing in a manner different from authentic visuals, or diverging from reality somehow, with the purpose of fooling the media viewer or a technology system. 
How Does Deepfake Work
A deepfake is a human impersonation created with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. It can be a fake picture or clip of a person’s expression, an audible file or filter that imitates their speech, or anything else that resembles a person using machine learning (ML). 
Visual and audio alteration has been practiced for many years. For instance, graphic editing techniques were used in films to smooth over movie flaws, and individuals have been using image editing software to generate memes since the dawn of the internet. Deepfakes are an AI-enabled extension of this, which can be used to mislead users. 
They may also use newly emerging technology such as autoencoders and synthetic adversarial systems. Threat actors can use deep learning algorithms to target specific features of a person’s likeness, such as their face structure or body language. It provides incredibly convincing impersonations that hackers are trying to take advantage of.
The rising reliance of enterprises on video-based interactions is expected to encourage attackers to engage in deepfake assaults. According to Darren ThomsonOpens a new window , CyberCube’s Head of Cybersecurity Strategy, as sensitive data becomes more widely available online, fraudsters drive innovation to take advantage of this phenomenon. He has mentioned that new and developing social engineering approaches like deepfake audio and video have become technically and commercially viable for criminal organizations worldwide.

How does deepfake work?
Machine learning is a crucial component in the development of a deepfake. Convolutional neural networks are artificial Intelligent computer systems built partly on the human mind, meant to spot trends in information. Deepfakes depend on artificial neural networks. The process of making a deepfake starts here.
To make a deepfake video, the developer first feeds countless hours of actual video footage to a deep neural network, which is then “trained” to recognize detailed rhythms and traits of a person. This is performed to provide the algorithm with a realistic representation of how that individual appears from various perspectives. 
The next move is to combine the trained learning algorithm with computer graphics technologies to overlay real-time video of a person with AI-generated facial and vocal patterns obtained from neural network input. Although many people believe that constructing a deepfake needs complicated tools and specialist knowledge, this is not the case — they can also be created with only basic graphic design knowledge. 
While sophisticated approaches are required for hyperrealistic deepfakes, all a hacker need is access to somebody’s video or audio material. Given the vast amount of content currently available, this is particularly feasible, as original material is available in abundance to fuel the algorithm and build a convincing deepfake.
While the capacity to constantly swap faces to create genuine and realistic-looking artificial video has some intriguing innocuous applications (such as in movies and gaming), it is a powerful weapon with some worrying implications. Creating synthetic pornographic material was one of the earliest practical uses for deepfakes.

Types of Deepfake Frauds
Now that we have established what a deepfake is, let us consider its various types: 
Types of Deepfake Frauds
1. Textual deepfakes
Earlier, it was thought that a machine could not do a creative project like drawing or writing in the early stages of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Fast forward through 2021, when top-rated AI-generated writing can now compose human-looking pith and clarity, thanks to the robust language models and libraries developed over decades by the incremental labor of scholars and data science specialists.
2. Deepfake video
Deepfake criminals’ primary weapon is the creation of fake photographs and videos. Given that we live in the omnipresent social media world, where videos and photos elucidate incidents and stories better than the text format, it is the most widely used type of deepfake. 
Modern video-generating artificial intelligence is more competent than natural language AI and may be more hazardous. Hyperconnect, a Seoul-based software firm, released MarioNETte in 2020, a program that can create deepfake movies of historical people, celebrities, and leaders. This is accomplished by having another individual reenact the desired personality’s facial gestures, which are then placed on the intended personality’s deepfake.
3. Deepfake audio
Text, photos, and video are not the only things that neural networks and artificial intelligence can do. They also can clone a human voice. All that’s needed is a data repository containing an audiotape of a person whose voice must be imitated. Deepfake algorithms will be able to learn from this data collection and replicate the prosody of a specific person’s voice.
Commercial software such as Lyrebird and Deep Voice has been introduced. Still, you only have to say a few phrases before artificial intelligence becomes acclimated to your voice and accent. This program becomes strong enough to copy your voice as you send in more recordings of yourself. You may simply deliver a phrase or a sentence after loading in a collection of your voice recordings, and this deepfake program will describe the text in your tone.
4. Deepfakes on social media
One can use deepfake innovation in conjunction with creating stories or blogs to build a fake internet profile that would be difficult for a regular user to detect. A deepfake with the identity Maisy Kinsley on social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter, for instance, was convincingly a (non-existent) Bloomberg reporter. Her profile photo was unusual as if it had been made by software. Maisy Kinsley’s public profile regularly attempted to connect with Tesla stock short-sellers, indicating that the profile was most likely fabricated for financial gain.
5. Real-time or live deepfakes
Deepfake technology is astonishingly advanced, allowing firms to generate advertising clones, governments to imitate political adversaries, and hackers to recreate user voices to pass voice-based authentication. 
Youtubers are already changing their faces in real-time using a novel deepfake program. For example, DeepFaceLive is an open-source artificial intelligence software that can convert your visage into someone else’s via videoconference and streaming networks. Streamers already have started utilizing the feature on platforms like Twitch, and both broadcasters and developers of any other media output can use this program.

Deepfake Fraud Examples
Recent examples of fraudulent activities carried out using deepfakes include:
1. The Mandalorian Luke Skywalker deepfake
Star Wars fans were ecstatic when Luke Skywalker appeared in The Mandalorian’s season 2 finale. However, once the space dust had cleared, viewers were keen to point out problems in the digital reconstruction of a youthful Mark Hamill. YouTuber Shamook tried his hand at deepfaking a Luke Skywalker from the Return of the Jedi age, with stunning results.
Shamook had been recruited by no one other than Industrial Light and Magic, the renowned visual effects company responsible for bringing the Star Wars universe to life. We’re interested in watching how deepfake technology shapes the universe far, far away.
2. The Nancy Pelosi slowed-down video
It was not a deepfake in the traditional sense; instead, it illustrated why its possible misuse has become so dreaded in geopolitics. The 2019 clip was slowed down by 25% and video changed the pitch to make it appear as though Nancy Pelosi, the United States House of Representatives speaker, was gurning her words. 
The tape was shared worldwide, and after the video was fact-checked and found to be fraudulent, Facebook declined to remove it, saying it had decreased its circulation. The post was later taken down, although it’s unclear who was responsible and who took it down.
3. Obama’s message to the public
Most of the more convincing deepfakes have used imposters to impersonate the source’s speech and mannerisms, such as this video developed by BuzzFeed and actor Jordan Peele combining After Effects CC and FakeApp. Peele’s jaw was superimposed over Obama’s, with a jawline that matched Peele’s mouth motions replacing Obama’s. After that, FakeApp was used to improve the footage with almost 50 hours of automated processing.
4. Yang Mi travels in time
A video featuring Yang Mi, one of China’s renowned current performers, pasted into the 1983 Hong Kong tv series The Legend Of The Condor Heroes went viral a few years ago, clocking up 240 million views before being taken off by Chinese authorities. Its maker, a Yang Mi admirer, apologized on Weibo, saying he made the film as a caution to promote awareness of the innovation. 
While the film and television industries are likely to react negatively to deepfakes at first, it is also feasible to see how the sector could ultimately accept the innovation and profit from it by enabling viewers to perform director on home updates by tricking dialogue, inserting alternate scenes, or even playing characters themselves. There will also be a slew of celebrity cameos in video games.
5. Zuckerberg deepfake where he speaks frankly 
Artist Bill Posters uploaded this on Facebook-owned Instagram in June in reaction to Facebook’s failure to remove the clip of Nancy Pelosi, displaying Mark Zuckerberg bragging about how the site “owns” its followers. The video was created as part of Posters and Daniel Howe’s Spectre project, which was produced for Sheffield Doc Fest to highlight how one may use social media to deceive people. It was created using the VDR (video conversation substitution) software from Israeli `Firm Canny AI, which is being pushed with a deepfake singalong with several international leaders.
The posters used the hashtag #deepfake to call attention to it. While the video seems convincing in silent mode, the voice gives it away, demonstrating that a competent actor is still required to create realistic deepfake instances. However, with Lyrebird and Adobe VoCo proposing AI voice generation, it may not be much until one can simply add passable sounds to deepfakes.

Deepfake Fraud Prevention Best Practices for 2022
Given the sophistication of the danger, businesses would be wise to take some basic and preventive steps to reduce the chance of falling prey to deepfake-based frauds. These are a few examples:
Deepfake Fraud Prevention Best Practices
1. Use anti-fake technology
Finding a reliable means to identify deepfake attacks, especially using automated technologies, is one way for businesses to guard themselves against them. Such an opportunity is AI-powered detecting software. One may also use the same deep learning techniques to make deepfakes to detect evidence that a picture or video has been tampered with.
Deepfakes can be detected in a variety of ways, and this is only one of them. Watermarking information to detect manipulation is another technology-based technique. Amber Authenticate, for instance, is a cryptographic device that can produce hashes at predetermined intervals throughout a movie. If the video is changed, the hashes will shift, alerting the user that the material has been changed.
2. Espouse training and awareness
The uniqueness of the threat is among the grounds why deepfakes are dangerous to businesses. Most businesses still have no idea what deepfakes are or how damaging they can be. On the other hand, companies can lower their chances of falling victim to a deepfake assault by informing employees, management, and shareholders about the danger.
Enterprises can build an additional layer of defense with enough training and increased awareness. Employees should be able to identify deepfake-based social engineering efforts through training that emphasizes how technology is utilized in hostile actions and how to spot it. Businesses must take a systematic approach to developing a security-conscious workplace culture. Employees will be better at recognizing deepfakes if they are educated about security threats and preventative strategies.
3. Enforce robust security protocols
Technology may not be the only way to avoid deepfake videos. Rebutting deepfake with good fundamental security practices is surprisingly effective. Automatic checks implemented into any procedure for disbursing payments, for example, might have prevented numerous deepfake and related frauds.

Inform employees and family members about how deepfaking operates and the difficulties it can cause.
Teach yourself and others how to recognize a deepfake.
Ensure that you are media savvy and use high-quality news sources.
Have excellent fundamental procedures in place — “trust but verify.” A suspicious attitude about voicemail and videos will not protect you from being duped, but it will help you avoid many pitfalls.

4. Explore the use of blockchain
Using blockchain as a solution could be a viable option. A decentralized system, or blockchain, allows users to store information online without the use of centralized servers. Furthermore, blockchains are resistant to a wide range of security vulnerabilities that centralized data storage is susceptible to. Although distributed ledgers are not currently capable of storing large amounts of data, they are suitable for storing hashes and electronic signatures.
Individuals may, for instance, use blockchain to authenticate and verify the validity of a video or audio document that is personal to them. The more people that sign film with their electronic signatures, the more likely it is to be deemed an authentic record. This is not the best option. It will be necessary to take additional measures to assess and factor in the competence of those who vote on a file.
5. Adopt a zero-trust approach to online content
Just as anyone can steal images and create phony profiles on the internet, scammers can go one step further using deepfake software. Before you trust anything you see on the internet, adopt a zero-trust approach and use caution. This advice applies to all new stories, images, and videos. You can learn to recognize bogus information by using web tools.
6. Prepare a response strategy
Make sure you are prepared to react to a deepfake in the right way. Prepare a strategy that you can implement if a deepfake is discovered. In this technique, you must outline individual responsibilities and required activities.
Identity checks like validation, device ID and analytics, behavioral analytics, and document verification are all critical parts of a multi-layered protection plan, especially when it comes to how scammers may try to spread or use these deepfakes. It may seem self-evident, but the first layer of defense is crucial: ensuring that only the proper people (and only the right people) have access to all potential areas of vulnerability. 
7. Develop new security standards
Another method of preventing deepfakes is implementing new security standards within your company. A deepfake’s ability to persuade a person is great, but its ability to persuade others drops rapidly when more individuals are involved. A corporation can detect a deepfake assault before it causes damage by adding numerous inspections to instances where deepfakes may be implicated.
Hackers use deepfakes to create phone and video calls while impersonating firm employees. As a result, firms can build security standards that outline an inspection routine that staff should take when answering such calls to detect deepfakes.
8. Keep user data private
Consider restricting the reach of your postings if you still want to be active on social media. Making your profile private is a wise approach to keeping your photos between a recognized network, even if it is not a failsafe solution to protect your pictures. Do not add strangers or connect with them if you do not know them. This is a general principle to follow if you do not want to fall victim to a trolling or phishing scam.

Takeaways 
Today, governments and enterprises across the globe are concerned about the pernicious impacts of a deepfake attack. It could lead to several extremely disparaging and damaging outcomes for institutions and individuals alike, so a foolproof and robust security mechanism is strongly recommended. 
By adhering to deepfake fraud prevention best practices and maintaining a strong digital hygiene policy, companies can genuinely fight back against the many threat actors out there. Finally, it is also important to educate individuals (or your employees) on the insidious impacts of a deepfake attack and the most prudent ways to safeguard oneself from such an occurrence. By building this calibrated and well-articulated defense mechanism, deepfakes, and their creators can be held at bay.

The Pentagon has tapped artificial intelligence ethics and research expert Diane Staheli to lead the Responsible AI (RAI) Division of its new Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO), FedScoop confirmed on Tuesday.
In this role, Staheli will help steer the Defense Department’s development and application of policies, practices, standards and metrics for buying and building AI that is trustworthy and accountable. She enters the position nearly nine months after DOD’s first AI ethics lead exited the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), and in the midst of a broad restructuring of the Pentagon’s main AI-associated components under the CDAO.
“[Staheli] has significant experience in military-oriented research and development environments, and is a contributing member of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence AI Assurance working group,” Sarah Flaherty, CDAO’s public affairs officer, told FedScoop.
Advanced computer-driven systems use AI to perform tasks that generally require some human intelligence. The Pentagon has increasingly adopted AI-based technologies in recent years to enable functions spanning the back office to the battlefield. But with all these benefits AI offers, the technology also poses the potential for risky unintended consequences that could result from its uses.

U.S. defense and military officials are being strategic about getting ahead of such possibly harmful implications.
Formed in 2018, DOD’s JAIC works to help DOD deploy and scale AI capabilities as warfare evolves to be increasingly digital. A National Defense Authorization Act provision the following year in part prompted the Pentagon to craft custom ethical guidance to inform its AI implementations, and the JAIC was tasked with leading that development.
The JAIC’s first responsible AI chief, Alka Patel, joined the department in early 2020 — not long after its ethical AI principles were formally adopted. She departed the role after 20 months in October. Several weeks after her exit, DOD announced a hefty organizational restructure that placed the JAIC, as well as the Defense Digital Service and the department’s chief data officer organization under the newly established CDAO. 
Pentagon officials noted at the time that this reorganization was a necessary point in the department’s technological evolution that marked a critical next step to help integrate AI across the massive enterprise.
“Staheli comes to the CDAO from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory and has vast expertise in AI ethics and research, data analytics, and technology development,” Flaherty also told FedScoop.

At MIT, Staheli headed pursuits focusing on human-centered AI. 
She has master’s degrees in software engineering and human factors, and her main professional interests include human-AI interaction, explainable AI, decision science, autonomy, socio-technical systems, and user-centered design.
