Artificial Intelligence
Ethics and artificial intelligence are not difficult words


We need to talk about artificial intelligence (AI), and not because of the hype surrounding it, but because it is all around us. Without noticing, in one way or another, AI has become a part of our daily lives, and this may be just a hint of what’s to come in the future. Alan Turing pointed out that that at one point, machines will be able to simulate human thought and that's where we should start.






Nobody can doubt that the social impact of artificial intelligence (AI) will be enormous. Although there are clear questions without answers such as: is society prepared for what’s coming? What measures should public leaders take to ensure artificial intelligence improves the lives of human beings in the XXI century?
A recent report by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) – the consultant that emerged from the British weekly of the same name – tries to answer such questions, focusing on four of the sectors that will change as a result of the development of artificial intelligence: industry, health, energy and transport. These are areas in which one can already discern some of the challenges posted by the broad application of artificial intelligence. For example, job destruction in industry, doubts about the security of the private data of patients, cybersecurity of smart grids with predictive functions and regulations on traffic accidents in which self-driving cars are involved.
The report, which was carried out in collaboration with Google, doesn’t go into details in any of these sectors, opting instead to providing generic recommendations on them from a political and social point of view. These are five of the most important of these:
1. Recognize the social risks implied by artificial intelligence
The first step in resolving a problem is to recognize that it exists. According to EIU, the risk for the future of employment and privacy posed by artificial intelligence is undeniable. Faced with this reality, there is no room for complacency or resignation.
2. Explain, educate and boost transparency
To demand blind faith in algorithms is a sure road to misinformation and distortion about artificial intelligence. “The biggest challenge facing AI is the possible lack of confidence in the technology due to a lack of transparency on how machines arrive at their decisions”, says Manuela Veloso, the head of the department of machine learning of Carnegie Mellon University, one of 14 global experts interviewed for the report. Those at the vanguard of the AI revolution need to explain their work and the plans for society in the simplest way possible. They have a lot of power and that brings with it a lot of responsibility, the EIU says.
3. Adapt training and education to the new artificial intelligence society
This involves working with three tools: professional training, which has fallen by the wayside in many countries and needs to be given more importance, the report says; maintaining the focus on STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and not to forget the importance of the humanities whose value will grow as a result of an expected increase in the demand for soft skills such as teambuilding, cooperation and critical thought. All of this in a way that makes close collaboration between teachers, business and lawmakers more necessary than ever in the face of the ongoing evolution of training needs.






Science and technology
What is a recommendation in the era of artificial intelligence?


What happens when you choose a restaurant on the Internet? Or when you want to buy a book? Or find a song? Or get hooked on a new series?  BBVA Data & Analytics in a new item for dissemination explains how the different recommendation systems used by Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify work and how they will extend beyond the consumer and entertainment sectors.






4. Regulation and improving the treatment of data
As the report categorically states, the use of data is going to be one of the defining questions of the 21st century. It calls for the creation of specific regulations that allow the appropriate use of aggregate anonymous data in response to current doubts on cybersecurity and privacy. However, these regulations should not prevent the movement of data beyond state borders.
5. Build bridges and enhance communication
The report notes many gaps in understanding with respect to the development of artificial intelligence, but probably the biggest one is between company technical experts and political leaders.
Good public policies could lessen the negative effects of artificial intelligence without limiting the positive ones, the report concludes –for example, in the labor market,

Consumer goods
Using natural language processing, machine learning and advanced analytics, Hello Barbie listens and responds to a child. A microphone on Barbie’s necklace records what is said and transmits it to the servers at ToyTalk. There, the recording is analyzed to determine the appropriate response from 8,000 lines of dialogue. Servers transmit the correct response back to Barbie in under a second so she can respond to the child. Answers to questions such as what their favorite food is are stored so that it can be used in conversation later.
Coca-Cola’s global market and extensive product list—more than 500 drink brands sold in more than 200 countries—make it the largest beverage company in the world. Not only does the company create a lot of data, it has embraced new technology and puts that data into practice to support new product development, capitalize on artificial intelligence bots and even trialing augmented reality in bottling plants.
PROMOTED
Even though Dutch company Heineken has been a worldwide brewing leader for the last 150 years, they are looking to catapult their success specifically in the United States by leveraging the vast amount of data they collect. From data-driven marketing to the Internet of Things to improving operations through data analytics, Heineken looks to AI augmentation and data to improve its operations, marketing, advertising and customer service.

Creative Arts
Culinary arts require the human touch, right? Yes and no. AI-enabled Chef Watson from IBM offers a glimpse of how artificial intelligence can become a sous-chef in the kitchen to help develop recipes and advise their human counterparts on food combinations to create completely unique flavors. Working together, AI and humans can create more in the kitchen than working alone.
Another way AI and big data can augment creativity is in the world of art and design. In one example, IBM’s machine learning system, Watson, was fed hundreds of images of artist Gaudi’s work along with other complementary material to help the machine learn possible influences for his work including Barcelona, its culture, biographies, historical articles and song lyrics. Watson analyzed all the information and delivered inspiration to the human artists who were charged with the creating a sculpture “informed” by Watson and in the style of Gaudi.

Music-generating algorithms are now inspiring new songs. Given enough input—millions of conversations, newspaper headlines and speeches—insights are gleaned that can help create a theme for lyrics. There are machines such as Watson BEAT that can come up with different musical elements to inspire composers. AI helps musicians understand what their audiences want and to help determine more accurately what songs might ultimately be hits.
Energy
Global energy leader, BP is at the forefront of realizing the opportunities big data and artificial intelligence has for the energy industry. They use the technology to drive new levels of performance, improve the use of resources and safety and reliability of oil and gas production and refining. From sensors that relay the conditions at each site to using AI technology to improve operations, BP puts data at the fingertips of engineers, scientists and decision-makers to help drive high performance.
In an attempt to deliver energy into the 21st century, GE Power uses big data, machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to build an “internet of energy.” Advanced analytics and machine learning enable predictive maintenance and power, operations and business optimization to help GE Power work toward its vision of a “digital power plant.”
Financial Services
With approximately 3.6 petabytes of data (and growing) about individuals around the world, credit reference agency Experian gets its extraordinary amount of data from marketing databases, transactional records and public information records. They are actively embedding machine learning into their products to allow for quicker and more effective decision-making. Over time, the machines can learn to distinguish what data points are important from those that aren’t. Insight extracted from the machines will allow Experian to optimize its processes.
American Express processes $1 trillion in transaction and has 110 million AmEx cards in operation. They rely heavily on data analytics and machine learning algorithms to help detect fraud in near real time, therefore saving millions in losses. Additionally, AmEx is leveraging its data flows to develop apps that can connect a cardholder with products or services and special offers. They are also giving merchants online business trend analysis and industry peer benchmarking.
Healthcare
AI and deep learning is being put to use to save lives by Infervision. In China, where there aren’t enough radiologists to keep up with the demand of reviewing 1.4 billion CT scans each year to look for early signs of lung cancer. Radiologists need to review hundreds of scans each day which is not only tedious, but human fatigue can lead to errors. Infervision trained and taught algorithms to augment the work of radiologists to allow them to diagnose cancer more accurately and efficiently.
Neuroscience is the inspiration and foundation for Google’s DeepMind, creating a machine that can mimic the thought processes of our own brains. While DeepMind has successfully beaten humans at games, what’s really intriguing are the possibilities for healthcare applications such as reducing the time it takes to plan treatments and using machines to help diagnose ailments.
Manufacturing
Cars are increasingly connected and generate data that can be used in a number of ways. Volvo uses data to help predict when parts would fail or when vehicles need servicing, uphold its impressive safety record by monitoring vehicle performance during hazardous situations and to improve driver and passenger convenience. Volvo is also conducting its own research and development on autonomous vehicles.
BMW has big data-related technology at the heart of its business model and data guides decisions throughout the business from design and engineering to sales and aftercare. The company is also a leader in driverless technology and plans for its cars to deliver Level 5 autonomy—the vehicle can drive itself without any human intervention—by 2021.
The AI tech revolution has hit farming as well, and John Deere is getting data-driven analytical tools and automation into the hands of farmers. They acquired Blue River Technology for its solution to use advanced machine learning algorithms to allow robots to make decisions based on visual data about whether or not a plan is a pest to treat it with a pesticide. The company already offers automated farm vehicles to plough and sow with pinpoint-accurate GPS systems and its Farmsight system is designed to help agricultural decision-making.
Media
The BBC project, Talking with Machines is an audio drama that allows listeners to join in and have a two-way conversation via their smart speaker. Listeners get to be a part of the story as it prompts them to answer questions and insert their own lines into the story. Created specifically for smart speakers Amazon Echo and Google Home, the BBC expects to expand to other voice-activated devices in the future.
UK news agency Press Association (PA) is hoping robots and artificial intelligence might be able to save local news. They partnered with news automation specialist Urbs Media to have robots write 30,000 local news stories each month in a project called RADAR (Reporters and Data and Robots). Fed with a variety of data from government, public services and local authorities, the machine uses natural language generation technology to write local news stories. These robots are filling a gap in news coverage that wasn’t being filled by humans.
Big data analytics is helping Netflix predict what its customers will enjoy watching. They are also increasingly a content creator, not just a distributor, and use data to drive what content it will invest in creating. Due to the confidence they have in the data findings, they are willing to buck convention and commission multiple seasons of a new show rather than just a pilot episode.
Retail
When you first think of Burberry, you likely consider its luxury fashion and not first consider them a digital business. However, they have been busy reinventing themselves and use big data and AI to combat counterfeit products and improve sales and customer relationships. The company’s strategy for increasing sales is to nurture deep, personal connections with its customers. As part of that, they have reward and loyalty programs that create data to help them personalize the shopping experience for each customer. In fact, they are making the shopping experience at their brick-and-mortar stores just as innovative as an online experience.
As the world’s second-largest retailer, Walmart is on the cutting edge of finding ways to transform retail and provide better service to its customers. They use big data, machine learning, AI and the IoT to ensure a seamless experience between the online customer experience and the in-store experience (with 11,000 brick-and-mortar stores, something rival Amazon isn’t able to do. Enhancements include using the Scan and Go feature on the app, Pick-up Towers and they are experimenting with facial recognition technology to determine if customers are happy or sad.
Service 
Central to everything Microsoft does is leveraging smart machines. Microsoft has Cortana, a virtual assistant; chatbots that run Skype and answer customer service queries or deliver info such as weather or travel updates and the company has rolled out intelligent features within its Office enterprise. Other companies can use the Microsoft AI Platform to create their own intelligent tools. In the future, Microsoft wants to see intelligent machines with generalized AI capabilities that allow them to complete any task.
When you bring together cloud computing, geo-mapping and machine learning, some really interesting things can happen. Google is using AI and satellite data to prevent illegal fishing. On any given day, 22 million data points are created that show where ships are in the world’s waterways. Google engineers found that when they applied machine learning to the data, they could identify why a vessel was at sea. They ultimately created Global Fishing Watch that shows where fishing is happening and could then identify when fishing was happening illegally.
Always at the top of delivery extraordinary service, Disney is getting even better thanks to big data. Every visitor gets their own MagicBand wristband that serves as ID, hotel room key, tickets, FastPasses and payment system. While guest enough the convenience, Disney gets a lot of data that helps them anticipate guests’ needs and deliver an amazing, personalized experience. They can resolve traffic jams, give extra services to guests who may have been inconvenienced by a closed attraction and data even allows the company to schedule staff more efficiently.
Google is one of the pioneers of deep learning from its initial foray with the Google Brain project in 2011. Google first used deep learning for image recognition and now is able to use it for image enhancement. Google has also applied deep learning to language processing and to provide better video recommendations on YouTube, because it studies viewers’ habits and preferences when they stream content. Next up, Google’s self-driving car division also leverages deep learning. Google also used machine learning to help it figure out the right configuration of hardware and coolers in their data centers to reduce the amount of energy expended to keep them operational. AI and machine learning has helped Google unlock new ways of sustainability.
Social Media
From what tweets to recommend to fighting inappropriate or racist content and enhancing the user experience, Twitter has begun to use artificial intelligence behind the scenes to enhance their product. They process lots of data through deep neural networks to learn over time what users preferences are.
Deep learning is helping Facebook draw value from a larger portion of its unstructured datasets created by almost 2 billion people updating their statuses 293,000 times per minute. Most of its deep learning technology is built on the Torch platform that focuses on deep learning technologies and neural networks.
Instagram also uses big data and artificial intelligence to target advertising and fight cyberbullying and delete offensive comments. As the amount of content grows in the platform, artificial intelligence is critical to be able to show users of the platform information they might like, fight spam and enhance the user experience.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/04/30/27-incredible-examples-of-ai-and-machine-learning-in-practice/,Enterprise & Cloud,27 Incredible Examples Of AI And Machine Learning In Practice,False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-cleaning robots, cloud-based computing, kiosks at nearly every retail store: rapid technological advances such as these have already begun to upend entire industries, with millions of more jobs in their path.

While there is significant debate among economists over the severity and speed of these changes—some studies indicate that as many as 47% of today’s jobs could be replaced by technology, while others are much more conservative in their forecasts—there is little disagreement that automation is a real and growing threat.

One would assume, given the potential size and scope of these changes, that there’d be robust discussion around how best to prepare for this coming economic transformation. There hasn’t been. Even the few policy proposals that have emerged to respond to technology-driven job displacement, such as the idea of a universal basic income, largely just cushion the harms brought by job losses.

The primary goal of policymakers grappling with the future of work should be to ensure that individuals and communities don’t just “get by” after losing a job to automation, but are equipped to lead new lives, with new jobs in new industries. A monthly stipend from the government is a good and needed start, but it only goes so far if an unemployed worker isn’t able to find a new, reliable source of income.

Fortunately, we already have a federal model that, with some modifications, can prepare us to respond to the challenges of technological unemployment: the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA). Created in 1962 at a time when Congress was seeking to bolster public support for trade liberalization, the TAA helps groups of workers that are negatively impacted by trade stay afloat during hard times and find new paths to employment. If an individual loses his or her job primarily due to trade—say, if their company moves production overseas—they can become eligible for enhanced reemployment services.

As international trade has increased over the years—and with it, the impact on American workers—so too has the TAA evolved and expanded. Today the program has a two-pronged approach: first, it lessens the hardships faced by displaced workers (through benefits like extended income support, wage insurance, and maintaining of employer-based health insurance); and second, it redeploys human capital (through support for a wide variety of retraining programs, including post-secondary education, classroom training, and apprenticeships; relocation allowances; and reemployment services such as career counseling).

The TAA is not without its flaws. It has earned a bad rap from some on the left as an attempt to cover up grim economic realities, and by some on the right as an ineffective program. But a closer look at the program’s overall results speak for themselves. In 2015, 73% of TAA participants found employment in the quarter after completing the program, with 92% of those who did still remaining in their jobs six months later. Compared to a similar group of long-term unemployed workers who did not collect TAA, workers in the federal program were 11.3% more likely to be employed. Moreover, TAA recipients who completed training and found a job in that field received a $5,000 to $6,000 per year earnings boost.

In short, TAA represents a prescient solution to a looming crisis. It provides a ready-made, comprehensive model for the delivery of assistance to workers who experience a shock from the economy, one that is not only relevant to trade-related unemployment, but technology-related unemployment as well.

As I outline in a new report for The Century Foundation, updating TAA can be done relatively seamlessly, by porting the program’s structure to both trade and technological unemployment, creating a new “TTAA,” so to speak. A new certification scheme could be instituted whereby the U.S. Department of Commerce designates a list of occupations at risk of being automated, and in turn, states, firms, or unions apply for federal help once occupation levels drop below a designated threshold and there is evidence of technology-driven job loss.

While we don’t know exactly which jobs will be replaced by technology, we do know with some certainty the types of occupations that are at risk. By pre-certifying specific occupations, this streamlined process would take advantage of existing expert consensus, allowing us to prepare a more robust and rapid response to deliver support to workers whose jobs are suddenly made obsolete. In this way, if millions of long-haul truck drivers become unemployed due to the proliferation of self-driving fleets, Congress and state governments will be ready to help them get back to work.

TTAA participants would be eligible for similar benefits available in the TAA program, such as wage insurance, subsidized COBRA, and career counseling and job placement services. They could receive up to two years paid retraining with income support so they could pay their bills while also preparing for a new career. Workers in TTAA-certified occupations could even begin this training while they’re still employed, which would give them a head-start if they were to lose their job, in addition to increasing their chances of finding a new role within their existing company. A machine operator in a factor, for example, could be trained to operate a computer-controlled tool that was replacing his old job.

For years, political leaders have recognized the need to expand active adjustment programs, on which other major nations spend 0.6% of GDP, compared to just 0.1% in the U.S. Updating TAA would provide an easier glide path for Congress, since it expands an existing program (something always done easier than creating a new program) and has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades (many dislocated workers live in conservative districts). And, a TTAA would be directly responsive to changing free market conditions, in the same way that unemployment insurance benefits rise in downturns.

Policymakers could start small, too, and develop a TTAA pilot to study the program’s effectiveness. Based on my estimates, a pilot program from 2020-2025 would see roughly 103,000 workers participate, at the relatively small cost to the government of $1.8 billion. Were the program to be successful and its price-tag rise, lawmakers could consider a number of paths to fully fund benefits without adding to the deficit or cutting spending elsewhere. A vehicle-miles tax on self-driving cars, for instance, could be directed toward retraining programs. As Bill Gates put it last year: “The robot that takes your job should pay taxes.”

To be sure, a TTAA program is no panacea for the millions, perhaps tens of millions, of jobs that are likely to be affected by automation and AI. No amount of planning or policy proposals can fully prepare us for what’s ahead; there’s no way of knowing what jobs will be lost, or how many, or where, or when. What we do know is that many Americans will experience job loss as a result: workers will miss out on pay, their skills will become of little value, and some will face a long and difficult road to finding new work.

A TTAA program would make that road as navigable as possible, not only helping workers and their families stay afloat during hard times, but also strengthening our workforce overall and making America more competitive on a global stage. It is a fiscally-responsible and politically-feasible approach, based on a model with a long track record of success.

While we can’t predict our economic future, we can prepare for it. A technology adjustment assistance program is as good a place to start as any.

Artificial intelligence is a key component of the future of healthcare. Indeed, the era of the AI doctor seems to be unavoidable.

Today, we see AI in hospitals helping clinicians identify medical risks; predict when to provide targeted, life-saving interventions; form treatment plans for patients with rare diseases; and deliver precision medicine.

However, one of the benefits associated with AI may actually be a disadvantage in healthcare. While AI excels at making unbiased, purely logical decisions, it cannot yet appreciate the complex blend of emotional, social, cultural and physical needs of people. If left in the hands of a purely AI-driven doctor, the diagnosis and treatment plan may be correct, but it may not be what the patient will respond best to.

Human doctors understand how to treat people, rather than just diseases. They will read the non-verbal clues, understand when to probe more deeply for a better reading of the patient’s condition, and the type of care plan that is most likely to work for that individual. The human doctor builds a relationship with their patient, even if only fleeting, based on emotional connections.

If the human touch is fundamental to healthcare, can AI ever step in to play a role in the softer side of care?
Crunch time

With the demands placed on the healthcare system by an ageing population, the focus has understandably been on continued efficiency and higher productivity. However, this tends to leave less time for the equally critical, softer, caring side of healthcare.

Discharged hospital patients going home to self-care, with only occasional follow-up medical appointments, may struggle to maintain their care plans. They may be confused about what to do or how to do it; they may feel better and hence decide to discontinue their medicines. They may even forget or lose motivation. This is particularly true for seniors living alone.

When you add social isolation into the mix, and the increased likelihood of depression, keeping people well at home can become a real challenge.

Despite the fact that this softer side of care is less logical and more about relationship building and behavioural nudges, it appears that AI can also play a role here.
The social robot

At the simplest level, AI chatbots at home can help patients keep on top of care plans. AI applications that remind seniors when to take medication, about doctors’ appointments, and even when to eat, can help in removing the anxiety and confusion that many of them face.

Above and beyond this, AI-powered social robots can provide some level of companionship for lonely seniors. We have seen in our own projects that seniors begin to create some form of relationship with AI chatbots. Social robots can also tailor their engagement to begin to nudge self-caring behaviours.

For example, letting seniors know about social activities in their neighbourhood may encourage them to go out of the home and interact with others, reducing social isolation. Sharing stories with health-promoting messages can entertain and subliminally provide education about healthier living. AI suggesting healthier food choices and encouraging them to get active can help to build healthier habits.

These are just some of the ways in which social robots can engage with their senior, helping the senior to build a relationship with their robot as well as sending self-care nudges.
Combating isolation

Integrating social robots with sensors worn on the body can support seniors in managing illnesses such that they feel reassured and more confident about living alone.
 
Integrating social robots with sensors can help seniors feel reassured and more confident about living alone.
One of the biggest fears seniors express when they live alone is that they will fall over in their home and no-one will realise. AI devices that can predict and prevent falls are evolving . This may give seniors with conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease the confidence to leave the house, rather than have the fear of falling keep them prisoner at home.

Sensors within the home can additionally determine when someone has fallen, or has encountered other accidents at home, and can notify emergency services for help, again providing reassurance and building confidence in living well at home.

The benefits of AI for this softer side of care may ultimately produce measurable impacts in our clinical systems. If AI can help seniors to care better for themselves, and to live at home for longer, resources in our healthcare facilities can be freed up.

The power of AI for health appears to lie in a combination of applications. Clinical applications will continue to be invested in, and will become increasingly powerful at keeping people alive. Empathy-based AI applications to support the softer side of care could help us to keep people from requiring clinical treatment altogether.

The business case for AI in the continuum of care could be very powerful indeed, and the impact on health outcomes could be transformative.

Artificial Intelligence Experts: How Much Can They Earn?

How much can tech pros who specialize in artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning hope to earn in any given year? The short answer: an astronomical sum. The New York Times recently analyzed a tax filing by OpenAI, a nonprofit that specializes in A.I. work, and found that its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, made nearly $2 million in 2016. Another researcher earned $800,000. “I turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,” Sutskever told the newspaper. “Others did the same.” His reasoning for rejecting that extra cash? He believes strongly in OpenAI’s mission to help create A.I. that’s friendly to humanity; in pursuit of that goal, the organization not only conducts research and publishes papers on a regular basis, but also offers a variety of tools for building and refining A.I. platforms. Previous reports back up Sutskever’s claim that tech firms are paying out enormous salaries to those with A.I. knowledge. At a conference last summer, for example, Tom Eck, CTO of industry platforms at IBM, said that “top-tier A.I. researchers are earning the same salaries as NFL quarterbacks.” As you can imagine, many quarterbacks make many millions of dollars per year. The Dice Salary Calculator, meanwhile, suggests that a tech pro in San Francisco with at least five years’ experience in technologies related to artificial intelligence (including data analytics and natural-language processing) can earn as much as $121,000 per year; in a “cooler” market like Kansas City, salaries can still approach (and often exceed) six figures. Maybe that’s not what an NFL quarterback makes, but that’s still really good. Take a look:  There’s a simple reason for this cash flood: tech firms believe that whoever “wins” A.I. will “win” the future (whatever it looks like), and nobody wants to lose out. But demand far outstrips supply; a recent analyst report from McKinsey & Company places the number of qualified A.I. experts in the world at fewer than 10,000. That report also suggested that practical applications of artificial intelligence could add a staggering $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in value across various industries over the next several years. For those interested in participating in this burgeoning market, there’s some good news: companies and educational organizations are rolling out more and more tools you can use to learn at least the rudiments of A.I. and machine learning. For example, Google offers a three-hour course on deep learning and machine-learning tools via its Google Cloud Platform Website, and Facebook hosts a series of videos that break down fundamental A.I. concepts such as algorithms. And for those who want to go the MOOC route, there are Coursera and Udacity, which offer instruction in A.I., and the opportunity to self-teach via materials on GitHub. Whichever pathway you choose, you don’t necessarily need to become a top A.I. researcher in order to benefit from the opportunities in this field; even having some basic machine-learning skills can make you exponentially more attractive to a range of employers.
