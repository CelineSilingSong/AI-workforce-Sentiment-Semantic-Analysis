This is substantiated by widespread research:- Accountants have a 95% chance of losing jobs- 29% of legal sector jobs could be automated in 10 years- Intelligent agents and robots could replace 30% of the world&rsquo;s current human labourBeing a trader was an esteemed profession, but with AI systems that can analyse information from markets, social media, corporate filings and economic conditions to quickly decipher trades, these systems can trade better than any human.As per analysis firm Oxford Economics, up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced with robots by 2030. Each robot impacts 1.6 jobs, with lower-skilled regions seeing a higher impact.    Man and Machine Joining ForcesHow we use technology depends on our perspective; we can use it to &lsquo;replace&rsquo; humans or we can leverage it to &lsquo;augment&rsquo; humans. Enhanced productivity leads to economic growth, which in turn can fund new job creation opportunities.A Harvard study involving 1,500 companies shows that significant performance improvement is experienced by firms which combine the forces of man and machine. Man and AI can collaborate to enhance each other&rsquo;s complementary strengths: leadership, team spirit, creativity and social skills of the former, and speed, scalability and data crunching capabilities of the latter.Also, technological advancements are opening up new areas which did not exist before like big data analysis, data security, decision support analysis, predictive analysis. This will boost the requirement of different type of skillsets and also drive demand for specialization. Data scientist was an unknown term a decade ago, but today almost every business, from consumer brands to online pharmacies, needs data scientists to interpret customer data to design product and marketing strategies. Coding is another evolving segment today &ndash; several startups have mushroomed to capitalise on this trend and are tapping kids early-on. We have seen the likes of Vedantu and White Hat Jr ride this wave.As per some of the leading digital strategists, customer service is one of the functions which is likely to see higher AI adoption. Chatbots can be effectively used along with a human interface to answer repetitive questions, reduce the handling time and improve customer satisfaction.Today technology is being increasingly used to assist doctors &ndash; whether it is retrieving digital records, using data analysis for diagnosis or improving precision in surgeries. However, can robots completely replace doctors? Possibly no &ndash; the human touch is very important, especially in healthcare. But it can definitely drive innovation to improve the healthcare infrastructure and improve outcomes.Technology vs CreativityTechnology can never replace human creativity and EQ. Right brain dominated skills are likely to thrive in the changing skill landscape. Theory of left vs right brain was popularised by noble prize winner Roger Sperry in 1981. According to his theory, the left brain is responsible for logic, analysis, reasoning and understanding of numbers, while right brain drives creativity, emotions and big picture thinking. While the left brain dominated people may have a better resume in terms of academic achievements and work experience, right brain people are driven by original and creative expression, which will increasingly become relevant as technology takes over technical and repetitive tasks.AI-driven innovations are relevant, adaptive and seeing increasing adoption, but AI cannot do everything that humans can do:1. AI cannot think or create2. AI cannot conceptualize, do complex strategic planning or take decisions based on EQ3. AI cannot deal with situations where there is an absence of data4. AI cannot, unlike humans, feel or interact with empathy and compassionSome of the jobs which require creativity, empathy and are operating in unstructured environments cannot be replaced by AI &ndash; human resources, writing, coaching, psychiatry, therapy, management, science, teaching, artist, etc.What business leaders need to understand?Supplementing the WONDER called &lsquo;Human Being&rsquo; with &lsquo;Technology&rsquo;.1. How can technology be used to boost innovation rather than just viewing it as a tool to replace jobs?2. How to restructure the organisation and the skill-set of the workforce so that technology can drive results while human workforce can enhance results by strategic and humane interventions?Need of the HourOur education systems need to adapt and change to prepare our kids for the future of jobs. Creative thinking, problem-solving, collaboration and the ability to do things differently are some of the skills which are needed to deal with the ever-evolving scenario. What is relevant today, may not be relevant tomorrow and thus, what is needed is not content knowledge alone, but the ability to adapt and drive innovative thinking.The current workforce needs to reflect on the future of their job and- Reskill/upskill to prepare themselves for the future- Adapt to the new technologies and leverage the opportunities created by itThe author, Ratna Mehta, is Executive Vice President - Wadhwani Catalyst Fund at Wadhwani Foundation.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHRWorld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

What do children & youth think about AI?AI and Your RightsYour AI Questions AnsweredLearn more



What’s the first thing you think of when someone says, “artificial intelligence”?
Robots? 
Self-driving cars? 
Voices assistants? 
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is not something from the future. If you regularly use a cellphone and the internet, chances are that artificial intelligence is already a part of your daily life. You just might not be aware of it.

Voices assistants, which are becoming more and more popular around the world, use AI technology.


So, what is it?
Very simply, AI technology is when computers mimic tasks that are usually associated with humans. This includes things like making suggestions or predictions, recognizing what is in an image, recognizing what is being said or written by someone based on how it has been programmed, developing strategies in games, or even creating music or art. 
And this technology is already being used in so many ways, from recommending what song you should listen to next, suggesting a quicker route to get from A to B, to the latest app designed to improve your selfies. 
AI technology has the potential to help us solve some of the biggest problems facing humanity – like climate change or new diseases – but it could also create new problems if we’re not careful.

What do children & youth think about AI?


 





Transcript
Hear what young people from South Africa, Brazil and Sweden think about AI. 





 
In 2020 UNICEF consulted 245 adolescents from Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States to learn about their views and understanding of AI systems. 
Find out what they had to say in this new report from UNICEF.
 
 
“In general, the digital world and AI world has not been adapted for adolescents, because it is mostly created only by adults. So, clearly, there is an adult-centric bias ....""

AI and Your Rights


 
 
You might be thinking, why do I need to be concerned about AI when there’s so much going on? 
 
1. Impact on our lives
More and more, AI is going to affect all parts of our lives – education, healthcare, communication, transport, jobs and more. When we know how the technology works, we can advocate for  companies and governments to  take the necessary steps to prevent negative impacts, maximize the positive effects on our human rights. 
For example, in some places around the world, AI technology is being used to determine whether someone should be admitted to a university or receive a job interview. If this technology is not programmed carefully to avoid prejudices, some people may be denied an opportunity. Or when facial recognition technology is used to fight crime, if it doesn’t work properly it can lead to innocent people being arrested.

2. AI technology is created by people
AI technology is created by people which means, it can sometimes be affected by the ways in which we see the world – our prejudices and the gaps in our knowledge.​ It is helpful for us to think about the people creating the technology:​ 

​Do they represent diverse backgrounds, places, and experiences? Do they have prejudices that could impact the technology?​ 


Are they willing, or able, to explain to the public how the technology works?​ 


Do they fully understand how their work may impact people's lives ?​ 


Are they considering the needs of children and looking out for their best interests? 

 
3. AI technology relies on a lot of data about us
Finally, AI technology also relies on a lot of data about us. Whenever we use our devices or the internet, we leave behind a digital footprint – the topics we read the most in the news, the things we buy online, the people we talk to the most. This data can be used by companies to create new technologies and impact on our right to privacy.

Have you ever wondered how face filters work?  They use a form of AI technology in which computers can identify a face in an image.




 
“AI might be able to predict some types of natural disasters and we’ll be able to evacuate people out of an area before it happens. And AI might also help us come up with solutions to humanitarian issues” – Zoe, South Africa 


 
Your AI Questions Answered


 
A team of experts from UNICEF is here to answer them!

 
Is AI Good or Bad?​ 
Technology is rarely simply good or simply bad – it depends on who is creating it and for what purpose, who is using it and how. ​

This means we need rules which can help maximize the good and minimize the bad outcomes. ​ But who makes the rules? Do innovators and companies creating new technologies care about the rules? And what should happen to those who break the rules?​ 

Right now, UNICEF is working with governments and companies to help them create and improve rules that protect children’s rights. Learn more about that here: https://www.unicef.org/innovation/GenerationAI



 
Will AI take away jobs? 
Throughout history, great technological advances have had an impact on the job market. As AI technology becomes more widely used it may lead to some jobs no longer being necessary. 

But it is important to remember that this will also lead to new types of jobs being created. Jobs that involve personal interaction, empathy and care, are unlikely to be impacted in the near future. What’s important is that young people are well-prepared and equipped with the rights skills to enter this dynamic job market. 


 
Are robots going to take over?

While this is a very popular theme in movies and books, the technology is not that developed yet. 

But it is important that we are all educated and aware of the presence of AI in our lives, so as the technology evolves, we can hold companies and governments accountable.

How AI can Change the Future of Telemedicine



Artificial Intelligence and telemedicine are no more diverse. It has helped the digital health industry to emerge high from the scratch. This article outlines the various work areas of telemedicine and how Artificial Intelligence can change the life of healthcare systems even with challenges over the years.

Final words

Introduction
When in 1955, John McCarthy came up with the name “Artificial Intelligence” who had thought one day we would be diagnosing our health through the internet to distant locations?
It was a dream by then, but not anymore. The generation has adopted telemedicine rapidly – which refers to the taking care of patients remotely, without being present physically – and the increasing demand is challenging the technology every second to grow further.
However, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the major role player in the telemedicine and healthcare systems. To make the computers more useful in fixing health care challenges and enabling the doctors to consult patients using conferencing tools is the main objective behind Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine.
Though the work areas of Artificial Intelligence are currently limited to Tele-radiology, Telepathy, Tele-dermatology, and Tele-psychiatry, it is already empowering the telemedicine in the world through different services in terms of development and execution. Look at the below stats to understand the telemedicine in detail.
Market and Types of Telemedicine
As we discussed, in recent years the demand in telemedicine has expanded substantially, the market share has increased immensely in 2019 as it was valued at approximately USD 14.0 billion in 2014.
As the chart suggests, in 2019 the telemedicine global market was valued at some 45 billion U.S. dollars. The industry is also projected to rise to more than US$ 175 billion by 2026.

In fact, various telemedicine firms are seeing a spike in simulated visits in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Alone, India shares 41% of respondents who tried to reach the telemedicine services by 2018, which has increased significantly in 2020.
Many factors also contributed to the growth of the market, such as increasing chronic respiratory diseases has already increased telemedicine adoption services. Patients with suspected flu-like symptoms control multiple telemedicine systems for remote access to health-care services.
Telemedicine market that largely encompasses work areas consisting of the major types as follows.
A. Online conferencing
B. Remote surveillance
C. mHealth
D. Real-time functions

These services, however, are a key step forth into providing health access to all patients who are in need, especially those living in areas where local healthcare providers are limited. Moreover, telemedicine, in contrast to conventional in-person consultations, offers a major advantage with decreased prices.
Talking about the present and future of Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine, it can be understood better through the following available possibilities.
Present and future of Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine
1. We can interpret the large data to improve the health care systems
The world has already developed the standardized electronic health record program by Artificial Intelligence to increase the huge data of patient records. Not only that, Artificial Intelligence through computer science, often provides promising opportunities to evaluate insights and new interference to further enhance health care outcomes.
As the world currently suffers from the corona pandemic and yet to develop the vaccine, telemedicine is the biggest hope as it can identify the scope and improvement of patients through the huge data availability using Artificial Intelligence and various machine learning techniques. It also increases the accuracy of the end result through large data, unlike offline laboratory records.
2. The early detection of chronic diseases made possible
The computer-assisted diagnostic support system and software can help doctors and experts identify the early symptoms of different diseases.
It also helps to minimize the economic burden by reducing the errors and can control the overall health progression. For instance, India has developed ‘Aarogya Setu’ mobile application to connect essential health services with the people of India to track the early Coronavirus symptoms of patients. However, it is yet at a basic stage, in the immediate future the data science and telemedicine can do even better with the aid of Artificial Intelligence in the specific area.
How?
The diseases such as Coronavirus and Ebola which have no treatments and vaccines, the world of telemedicine can capture the symptoms from the patients online. Providing that information to machine learning algorithms and by training the machine learning models, we can also reduce the time to develop the vaccine.
More than that, vaccines can be developed more precisely as the availability of huge data enhances the entire development in various predictions.
3. It helps to increase the automatic assistance
Clinical industries are already taking advantage of artificial intelligence in the healthcare infrastructure and successfully combating the numerous diseases. But that’s not all. In the race to grow further, also the individuals are set to participate, as proven by Apple recently, by developing the Apple Watch that can track your heart rate and able to generate an electrocardiogram without being present in the hospital. Because not all patients need treatments, but sometimes only assistance.
Artificial Intelligence can also help in the near future to control the disease like blood sugar by evaluating large data available in the area. The computer can provide drug assistance by developing artificial algorithms in the implementation of various drugs at different levels of the patient’s blood sugar.
This is, however, just the beginning of Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine as there’s a lot more to come in the near future.
But, wait. Before you conclude, there are certain questions in the pile as the challenges of Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine that are as follows.
Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine 
1. What if the doctors never look at the huge recorded data? 
This is a serious concern. Millions around the world are wearing Apple Watches, Fitbits, and other devices capable of monitoring their heart rate and other biometrics that imply health care. But what if the doctors may not take urgent action from the novel sources of broad data, which tend to suggest an emergency?
All in vain.
Telemedicine, therefore, to grow further, must imply the community standards that can possibly be able to handle the large data for strong implementations.
2. Will AI replace the doctors? 
Most probably not. Artificial Intelligence is progressing quickly, no doubt. It is, in fact, hyped over the last years in telemedicine. It has also helped the doctors to reduce clerical work such as typing huge data, that was taking more than half of their clinical time.
But, would Artificial Intelligence and machine learning be able to give value, empathy, and active listening to the patients as the doctors can?
No. It can not.
Artificial Intelligence, however, can be further enabled to listen to conversations for at least active listening, and probably render automated patient charts for doctors to evaluate. But it won’t replace the doctors, that is final.
3. Will everyone gets the benefit of AI in telemedicine?
For sure, the healthcare provisions online is still not easy for everyone, but it is believed that over the five years, it will get there.
But not for all. A lot of people might not be comfortable with digital consultations, while others may have a language gap or lack of devices.
Conclusion
If you conclude, Artificial Intelligence in telemedicine has come a long way already but still has a long way to go. AI has large capabilities to build far more effective and reliable healthcare if implemented successfully. The gradual growth of telemedicine with AI will also raise both human and animal life expectancy.

In all these cases, studies suggest AI outperforms human doctors in set tasks. But when something does go wrong, who is responsible?

There’s no easy answer, says Patrick Lin, director of Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University. At any point in the process of implementing AI in healthcare, from design to data and delivery, errors are possible. “This is a big mess,” says Lin. “It’s not clear who would be responsible because the details of why an error or accident happens matters. That event could happen anywhere along the value chain.”

How AI is used in healthcare

Design includes creation of both hardware and software, plus testing the product. Data encompasses the mass of problems that can occur when machine learning is trained on biased data, while deployment involves how the product is used in practice. AI applications in healthcare often involve robots working with humans, which further blurs the line of responsibility.

Responsibility can be divided according to where and how the AI system failed, says Wendall Wallace, lecturer at Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and the author of several books on robot ethics. “If the system fails to perform as designed or does something idiosyncratic, that probably goes back to the corporation that marketed the device,” he says. “If it hasn’t failed, if it’s being misused in the hospital context, liability would fall on who authorized that usage.”

Surgical Inc., the company behind the Da Vinci Surgical system, has settled thousands of lawsuits over the past decade. Da Vinci robots always work in conjunction with a human surgeon, but the company has faced allegations of clear error, including machines burning patients and broken parts of machines falling into patients.

Some cases, though, are less clear-cut. If diagnostic AI trained on data that over-represents white patients then misdiagnoses a Black patient, it’s unclear whether the culprit is the machine-learning company, those who collected the biased data, or the doctor who chose to listen to the recommendation. “If an AI program is a black box, it will make predictions and decisions as humans do, but without being able to communicate its reasons for doing so,” writes attorney Yavar Bathaee in a paper outlining why the legal principles that apply to humans don’t necessarily work for AI. “This also means that little can be inferred about the intent or conduct of the humans that created or deployed the AI, since even they may not be able to foresee what solutions the AI will reach or what decisions it will make.”

Inside the AI black box

The difficulty in pinning the blame on machines lies in the impenetrability of the AI decision-making process, according to a paper on tort liability and AI published in the AMA Journal of Ethics last year. “For example, if the designers of AI cannot foresee how it will act after it is released in the world, how can they be held tortiously liable?,” write the authors. “And if the legal system absolves designers from liability because AI actions are unforeseeable, then injured patients may be left with fewer opportunities for redress.”

AI, as with all technology, often works very differently in the lab than in a real-world setting. Earlier this year, researchers from Google Health found that a deep-learning system capable of identifying symptoms of diabetic retinopathy with 90% accuracy in the lab caused considerable delays and frustrations when deployed in real life.

Despite the complexities, clear responsibility is essential for artificial intelligence in healthcare, both because individual patients deserve accountability, and because lack of responsibility allows mistakes to flourish. “If it’s unclear who’s responsible, that creates a gap, it could be no one is responsible,” says Lin. “If that’s the case, there’s no incentive to fix the problem.” One potential response, suggested by Georgetown legal scholar David Vladeck, is to hold everyone involved in the use and implementation of the AI system accountable.

AI and healthcare often work well together, with artificial intelligence augmenting the decisions made by human professionals. Even as AI develops, these systems aren’t expected to replace nurses or automate human doctors entirely. But as AI improves, it gets harder for humans to go against machines’ decisions. If a robot is right 99% of the time, then a doctor could face serious liability if they make a different choice. “It’s a lot easier for doctors to go along with what that robot says,” says Lin.

Ultimately, this means humans are ceding some authority to robots. There are many instances where AI outperforms humans, and so doctors should defer to machine learning. But patient wariness of AI in healthcare is still justified when there’s no clear accountability for mistakes. “Medicine is still evolving. It’s part art and part science,” says Lin. “You need both technology and humans to respond effectively.”

The University of Michigan announced Thursday it will launch a new college of innovation and technology.
The new academic unit will open in fall 2021 to educate and prepare students for careers in emerging technology fields.
“The technology-intensive future demands that we prepare our graduates to develop and apply technology in new ways that will benefit society,” UM-Flint Chancellor Deba Dutta said in a press release.
Students in the school will have the opportunity to earn undergraduate degrees in technology as they prepare for employment in automotive, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, health care, aerospace, cybersecurity and other sectors.

Employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow significantly over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with more than 500,000 new jobs opening up by 2029.
To create a talent pipeline that can prepare students for these jobs, other universities across the country are also launching new programs in technology-relate fields, including Bellevue University, the University of North Texas and Penn State.

Ethiopia Gets Artificial Intelligence Center		

 September 20, 2020

ADDIS ABABA – Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has inaugurated on Sunday an artificial intelligence (AI) research and development facility, which will boost technological innovations in Ethiopia.
“Designed to support young entrepreneurs through capacity building and research excellence, I am quite pleased to inaugurate the Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be a site for development of functional and problem solving technological innovations,” the Prime Minister said.



Abiy’s cabinet approved the establishment of the center in the country on January 24, 2020..
Authorities say it will work on safeguarding Ethiopia’s national interests through the development of AI services, products and solutions based on research, among other things.
This was the latest of a series of steps taken by the government to modernize its various sectors and facilitate effort to digitize its economy.
“We do not seek to cultivate youth who only watch from a distance and adopt the world’s industrial revolution,” Abiy said.
AI is the ability to optimize computerized machines for real solutions using special technology practices by focusing human interactions on a number of studies.
The Prime Minister seized the opportunity during Sunday’s event to caution Ethiopians here and in diaspora to not be tools of money laundering.
“In this current period where we’re taking great strides to balance the macroeconomic environment, including through the introduction of technology,” he said, “I would also like to take this opportunity to caution all Ethiopians locally and abroad to not be tools of money laundering”.
He also urged all Ethiopia’s Diaspora community “to use appropriate channels of remittance to ensure that you’re not a channel for illicit currency transfers” amidst a period of currency change.
The East African nation rolled out new banknotes – with birr 10, 50 and 100 denomination and unveiled a new 200 birr note – with enhanced security features and other distinctive elements.
