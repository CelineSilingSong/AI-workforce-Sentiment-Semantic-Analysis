Not these workers.by  Rani MollaApr 10, 2023, 8:00 AM EDTFacebookLink Paige Vickers for Vox/Jorm Sangsorn/Getty Imagespart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Rani Molla is a senior correspondent at Vox and has been focusing her reporting on the future of work. She has covered business and technology for more than a decade — often in charts — including at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.FacebookLinkA lot of what Conor Grennan does as a dean of students at NYU’s Stern School of Business could be done at least in part by bots. Brainstorming and planning are prime examples of tasks that can be easily handled by generative AI tools like ChatGPT. But instead of feeling like he could be replaced by AI, Grennan has become an evangelist of this technology and its potential to make work better. He likens the opportunity to work with AI technology right now to finding material wealth.“It feels like the Gold Rush, like there’s a bunch of people getting to California and seeing little flakes of gold in the river,” he told Vox.Some of Grennan’s new AI-powered workflow is pretty simple. He drops email chains into ChatGPT or Bing or Bard — he uses them all — and asks it to quickly search for details about a student or deliverables he needs to act on. But he admits that using this technology just for menial tasks would be akin to picking up an iPhone just to use its flashlight. He prefers to use AI to research, brainstorm, and learn. “It feels like the Gold Rush, like there’s a bunch of people getting to California and seeing little flakes of gold in the river”For example, Grennan might ask an AI to give him five suggestions of a good place to hold an event for 50 students in lower Manhattan on a Tuesday night, or have it reason through how young people in Ohio could help the climate crisis, or have it explain to him what exactly an API is. He keeps asking and refining the questions until he gets good answers, and he’s constantly coming up with new things to ask. Grennan thinks talking with the AI makes him more creative, stokes his sense of wonder, and ultimately makes him better at his job and life. “Instead of the drudgery of ‘I’ve been given a task, now I’m going to solve that task,’ it’s, ‘I’ve been given a task. What are different ways of looking at it? How can this improve my life? How can I actually get smarter?’” said Grennan. He was recently granted the additional title of head of generative AI at Stern, and is helping develop an AI initiative for Stern’s MBA program so students, faculty, and administrators can become comfortable with AI tools in the workplace.A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT and its more advanced successor GPT-4 — who have a vested interest in hyping their own technology’s capabilities — found that half of workers could have more than half their tasks exposed to large language models, like ChatGPT. Exposure was the highest among high-wage jobs that require degrees and had previously felt relatively safe from the onslaught of technological erasure: financial analysts, web designers, legal researchers, and journalists, among others. While the study said tools like ChatGPT could certainly save those jobs significant time completing tasks, it stopped short of saying those jobs would be fully automated by those technologies. It’s likely, however, that it will change them.While much has been made about AI’s potential to destroy our jobs, Grennan and other American workers whose tasks overlap with capabilities of software like ChatGPT are embracing the technology to do away with drudge work, to be more creative, and to level up their skills. Marketers are using it to write better copy; programmers are using it to take on projects that were previously out of their league or read code in unfamiliar languages. And it seems like everyone’s now using it to summarize or write emails and boilerplate documents. The rise of artificial intelligence, explainedHow does AI actually work? How is AI changing our society?Is AI coming for your job?Should we be worried about AI?Who will regulate AI?Where some see a threat, these workers see possibility. And they hope their mastery of the tools, coupled with their uniquely human skills, will allow them to stay employed even as artificial intelligence gets more and more clever. Back in January, over 40 percent of Americans said they were using generative AI technology at work, and that rate has likely gotten higher. At the same time, about half of Americans think AI could negatively impact the number of jobs in the US. The truth is we don’t know exactly how artificial intelligence technologies will impact work. The fear is that if tools make existing tasks take hours instead of days, employers might hire fewer employees to get the job done or make their work part-time. The hope is that while the new technology could cause some disruption in what people do, it will ultimately lead to more and better work, much like previous technological advancements, such as the personal computer or even the internet, didn’t spell the end of white-collar jobs.For now, we know that Americans who’ve chosen to deploy this technology at work seem to like it. They certainly don’t feel like frogs boiling in a pot. Goodbye to drudgery? It’s important to remember that even the best jobs have parts of them that suck. And those parts are the first ones on which workers are bringing AI to bear. Colin McAuliffe, a filmmaker and founder of the production company Zero One Digital Media, has been using the AI software DALL-E to generate images to illustrate business pitch decks. Rather than scroll through pages and pages of stock images, he simply tells the software precisely what he wants — say, a “photograph of a lemon” — and it pops one out.“It’s something I hated doing or I would make other people do for me,” he said. “And now I do it myself easily, and it’s kind of fun.” Recently, a client gave him a script that had been written by ChatGPT, and while McAuliffe hasn’t had it write scripts yet, he wants to use AI more often to make shooting schedules and plan trips for his company.“All that other stuff just takes me away from making videos,” he said.People say they’re using these tools on tasks they hate, and that allows them to focus on what they love. Vanessa Bowen, a self-employed product designer, used to dread having to come up with the text that would go inside their app prototypes. If something was off, clients would get hung up on the text rather than critiquing the user interface design of the app, and it could derail the whole interaction. Now, Bowen feeds the AI information about the client and the product, and what type of text box they’re trying to fill; then ChatGPT generates that text. “It would leave us more time to do other things like be more creative or not work so much”“It throws out something simple and concise and takes away some of that cognitive load,” they said. That lets Bowen focus on what they really like doing: designing.“I find that we are stuck in the mundane activities of the day-to-day that could be automated, which then in turn could free up our whole lives,” they added. “It would leave us more time to do other things like be more creative or not work so much.”It’s a sentiment white-collar workers expressed over and over again, and it’s part of why companies like Microsoft are leaning into AI so heavily in their workplace tools: Not all work is good work. Soon, Microsoft says workers will be able to ask AI-powered tools to make Excel perform complex equations, to have PowerPoint build presentations, and to summarize Outlook emails — all within seconds and by talking to them like you would a person. Whether that means people will spend that time saved on the parts of their job they really like or whether they’ll simply squander those freed-up hours remains to be seen. It’s also possible that this technology just enables them to make more unnecessary work for everyone else. Take for example, this great cartoon where one person uses AI to make a bullet point into a long email, to which the email’s reader responds by asking the AI to distill the email into a single bullet point. Leveling up at work There’s a lot of doom and gloom about what generative AI will mean for computer programmers specifically. Indeed, these tools can often spin up perfectly functional code, using natural language, in an instant, so it’s fair to wonder what that means for the highly paid people who used to do the same thing more slowly. But the software engineers and developers we spoke to preferred to think of the technology as something that enables them to be better at what they do, likening it to having an incredibly smart assistant or intern at their disposal. Victor Boutté, a software engineer and tech lead manager at the video hosting company Wistia, says AI tools like GitHub Copilot make him more productive, by suggesting how to complete code he’s started so that he doesn’t have to write the whole thing. Boutté, who works remotely, considers AI tools to be a lot like sitting next to a very smart colleague who also happens to have already read through his code and has limitless time for his questions.“I’m using it essentially as I would another engineer to bounce ideas off of. It’s helping me flesh through these ideas more deeply, and the feedback is instant,” he said.“It gets the creative wheels spinning about what can I use this kind of tech to build”AI not only helps Boutté code more quickly, but also elevates what’s possible for him to code in the first place.“Throughout my career, I’ve never seen a technology as advanced as this. And it gets the creative wheels spinning about what can I use this kind of tech to build,” he said. “It’s inspiring me.”For independent developer and researcher Simon Willison, AI tools allow him to be more ambitious because he spends less time researching how to figure things out. That means he has more time to try out time-intensive projects he might have previously had to pass on. Recently, Willison helped his wife with a pottery project. She wanted to see the rate at which a kiln cooled down after being heated in a microwave, in order to estimate its peak temperature while heating. Since she couldn’t put the thermometer in the microwave, after taking the kiln out, she would have to check its temperature over the course of the 90 minutes it took to cool. Instead, Willison asked GPT-4 how to break down a video of the thermometer into 10-second JPEG intervals. He then asked it for commands that would read the temperature from the images and chart it over time. Willison is now thinking about how he could help journalists bring such knowledge to problems like analyzing police body camera footage.“Normally, when faced with challenges like this, I’d be like, ‘It’s gonna take me an hour to figure this out. Just sit down next to the microwave and write the numbers down,” he said. Even in less technical and more creative areas, workers are finding that generative AI is able to make them better at what they do. In addition to letting humans spend more time on their creative tasks, generative AI is showing off its own kind of creativity — with the right prompts. Michael Kaye, director of brand marketing and communications at the dating app OkCupid, has been asking generative AI to come up with in-app matching questions. OkCupid matches people based on how they answer these questions, so coming up with ones that illuminate what’s important to people is incredibly important to how the service functions. At any given time, OkCupid has thousands of these questions available for daters to answer, and Kaye was responsible for creating new ones. For Kaye, this was one of many tasks he does at work, so offloading some of the question creation to AI helped free him up to work on other things. More importantly, he said, the questions that the AI generated — which were based on the simple prompts of “What would you ask on a date?” and “What would you ask on a dating app?” — were actually very good.The first 10 AI-generated questions Kaye ended up adding to the dating service included “How do you balance your own needs with the needs of your partner in a relationship?” “What do you value most in a partner?” and “Are you a morning or night person?” So far, they’ve been popular, with users responding to them more than 675,000 times since the end of January. “They’re high-quality, especially given how generic the prompt was,” Kaye said. “They might sound surface-level, but I think those are things that really help connect people.”He plans to add more ChatGPT questions using more specific prompts every month this year. Why AI probably won’t take our jobs While everyone we spoke to understood that generative AI might be disruptive to some jobs, no one felt it was a real danger to theirs. A common refrain was a version of a tweet from machine learning engineer Santiago Valdarrama that said, “AI will not replace you. A person using AI will.” In other words, they felt that their mastery over generative AI tools would give them a leg up, even if that generative AI made some of what they’re paid to do obsolete. “When I first started using GPT-4, [losing my job] was my first concern. It’s very natural to feel threatened by new technology, especially technology that’s really good at what you do,” said Stephanie Yamkovenko, a group manager for the digital marketing team at Khan Academy, an education nonprofit that has partnered with GPT-4 maker OpenAI since September. “But as I’ve used it more, I’ve realized that it’s going to be a skill that’s going to be in high demand for writing and editing in the future,” she added.Yamkovenko recently was able to work on a much more robust product launch than what her small team normally would have been able to do. She used ChatGPT to write a greater volume of social media copy, which in turn snagged the company 10 times the traffic it would normally get. “It’s very natural to feel threatened by new technology, especially technology that’s really good at what you do”Others were sanguine that their skills, now boosted by their agility with generative AI, are eternally in demand.Somnath Banerjee, VP of data science at the early-stage investment firm Clear Ventures, said there will always be an abundance of work for engineers like himself. He’s been using AI to code projects more quickly and to feel more confident in his email writing as a non-native English speaker. “They will not say, ‘I paid him for two weeks and you did it in two days,’ because there’s always two years of work waiting for you,” he said.None of this, of course, is to say that work will be the same. The acceptance of using tools like ChatGPT will be the first of many changes. Even if they do keep their jobs, what these white-collar workers do and how they do it will likely be different if generative AI technology becomes widely used. That will be a loss to many who like their craft as it is.Take, for example, this 3D mobile games artist who lamented on Reddit recently: “My job is different now since Midjourney v5 came out last week. I am not an artist anymore.”The poster added, “All I do is prompting, photoshopping and implementing good looking pictures. The reason I [wanted] to be a 3D artist in the first place is gone. I wanted to create form In 3D space, sculpt, create. With my own creativity. With my own hands.”Those who’ve embraced generative AI and who are less tied to the specific tasks of their work will likely have an easier time adjusting to a world of work that’s changing in front of their fingertips.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Chatbots Like ChatGPT?Large language models are already good at a wide variety of tasks.Share full article197Read in appVideoCreditCredit...Illustrations by Mathieu LabrecqueBy Kevin RoosePublished March 30, 2023Updated April 8, 2023In today’s newsletter, the fourth in our five-part series, I’m going to try to convince you that large language models are already good at a wide variety of tasks — and they’re getting smarter every day.In the previous edition of this newsletter, my colleague Cade Metz wrote that A.I. large language models (L.L.M.s) can be erratic and unreliable — giving false information and acting strangely toward users.I’ve been using A.I. tools like ChatGPT almost daily for several months now, and I’ve seen them spit out plenty of wrong answers. (And don’t remind me about my creepy encounter with Bing.)But I’ve also seen these A.I. programs do amazing things — feats of creativity, flexibility and efficiency that took my breath away. And I worry that in an attempt to tamp down A.I. hype, skeptics are missing what’s so groundbreaking — and potentially disruptive — about this technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLarge language models write poems and screenplays. One of the latest, GPT-4, scored in the 90th percentile on the bar exam and got top scores on a number of Advanced Placement tests. And the potential productivity gains for workers are enormous. (In one study, programmers who used GitHub Copilot — an L.L.M. for coders — finished a task 56 percent faster than programmers who didn’t.)Here are six things that A.I. is especially good at, right now:Explaining concepts at multiple difficulty levelsFor the last few months, I’ve been using ChatGPT as my personal tutor every time I get curious about a new topic. If it’s, say, fractional reserve banking, I’ll start by asking ChatGPT to “explain fractional reserve banking at a high school level.” (Or, if I’m still confused, “at a middle school level.”)ChatGPT and other A.I. chatbots do well with these types of prompts, using their skills at natural language processing, as long as you don’t ask about very recent events or extremely obscure topics. Calling on an infinitely patient, zero-cost tutor to guide me through new subjects feels like a superpower. Used properly, they can be amazing teaching tools.Editing and constructive criticismI still write my columns (including this newsletter) myself. But over the past few months, I’ve enlisted ChatGPT as my assistant.When I’m stuck, I often paste in a few sentences and see if it can spark any ideas. If I’m trying to tighten an argument, I’ll ask it to poke holes in my reasoning.I’ve found that Bing is particularly good for editing, because it can look things up on the internet. (One of my favorite writing hacks is to ask it to read Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style” and suggest edits based on the book’s principles.)You can use similar tricks to use A.I. to improve your emails, cover letters or any other writing you’re working on. As a reminder, you should always check the A.I.’s work carefully.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGetting creatively unstuckA.I. can also be a good tool for getting your creative juices flowing. Recently, I was trying to come up with questions to ask a podcast guest. I pasted the guest’s bio into ChatGPT and asked it to give me “10 thoughtful, incisive interview questions” for this person. Of the questions it generated, most were pretty good, and I wound up using a few on the show.Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, recommends using A.I. to overcome writer’s block, or get a running start on hard projects. A person who wanted to start a bakery, for example, could ask ChatGPT for a list of all the necessary equipment and permits.“It is very easy to get distracted from a task by one difficult challenge,” Mr. Mollick wrote in a recent blog post. “A.I. provides a way of giving yourself momentum.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRehearsing for real-world tasksI’ve also been using ChatGPT and other A.I. apps as a kind of rehearsal for offline tasks I find unpleasant or hard.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.When I had to have a difficult conversation with a friend, I asked ChatGPT to take part in a role-playing exercise. “Pretend you’re my friend, and react the way you think my friend might react,” I told it. I then held a mock version of the conversation. It didn’t make the real conversation painless, but I felt more confident knowing I’d already practiced with a chatbot.Of course, A.I. chatbots can’t replace human friendships. But they can be a kind of on-demand sounding board, offering us basic feedback and advice without judgment.SparkNotes for everythingOne of the most powerful abilities of A.I. language models is quickly summarizing large amounts of text.I’ve used A.I. programs to “read” long articles for me, and summarize dense academic papers. Usually they get the broad strokes right, even if some of the details are missing.This power really shines when you combine it with other A.I. abilities, like transcribing audio and video recordings. Suddenly it becomes possible to condense a two-hour podcast into bullet points, or get a concise summary of a work meeting while you’re still in the meeting.If you’re bored of reading this newsletter, you could ask ChatGPT or Bing to summarize the rest of it for you, or to rewrite it as a jaunty limerick. I promise I won’t be offended.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCoding, even if you don’t codePeople are already using A.I. to write code, whether or not they know any programming languages.These models weren’t designed to write software. But when they were trained on vast amounts of internet text, including the contents of coding sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow, they learned how to code — a phenomenon known as emergent behavior. Now, if you type in a prompt like “Build me a Chrome extension that translates the text of any website to pirate-speak,” you might get back the code for an app that actually works.In the past few months, social media has been full of examples of astonished people who are using A.I. tools to build websites and apps faster than any human could — at a tiny fraction of the cost.What’s next?All of this raises some pretty obvious questions about the future, such as: If L.L.M.s are helping nonwriters write well, and noncoders code well, what other kinds of powers will they unlock? And how many jobs will these new A.I. abilities eliminate?Tomorrow, Cade will be back to wrap up this series with a look at where all of this progress may be headed.ImageYour homeworkWhat other chatbot skills can you discover?Think of a task that takes up a lot of your daily brainpower, like a tedious chore from work, or coming up with a weekly dinner plan to feed your family. Then work with a chatbot to see how well it can perform.(Last week, The Times spoke with people who use ChatGPT to have more productive conversations with their teenagers, concoct imaginative bedtime stories and draft love letters to their spouses. And Hard Fork, the Times podcast I co-host, featured stories from listeners who are using A.I. to negotiate their rent, understand medical results and affirm their gender identity.)As always, share your best, worst and most interesting results in the comments.

If you’ve been following tech trends lately, you’ve probably heard a lot about ChatGPT and Bard as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google have been rapidly bringing these large language models to the masses. However, tons of smaller generative AI projects have also been rolling out in the past year.


Generative AI tools have made a significant impact on various fields, including music, art, and literature. Some AI tools create images. Some draft emails. Some make videos. But all of the tools were created to save time while making the creative realm accessible to even more people. And while the jury is still out on how fast we move, the legal and ethical ramifications, and the ultimate impact that generative AI will have on work, it’s becoming apparent to most of us that generative AI is here to stay.

So, what else is out there that interested users should be checking out? The following are just a few currently available Generative AI tools that you can try right from your phone or digital device.

PROMOTED
Fireflies
If your call for a meeting notetaker is consistently met with a collective moan, Fireflies is for you. This AI app allows you to record and automatically transcribe the voice conversations from meetings, whether they take place on video-conference apps like Zoom and Google Meet, in audio files, or on the phone on apps like Ringcentral and Air Call. Fireflies can be set to auto-record meetings in your calendar, and once complete, meeting notes can be automatically imported into your CRM. Even more, once transcribed, teams can easily search the meetings to find information that is most relevant to them. Fireflies is already being used by companies like Uber, Nike, Delta, and Netflix.

Ellie AI
If you want email support that isn’t ChatGPT, try Ellie. Ellie is a writing assistant exclusively for drafting email replies. Ellie learns from your own individual writing style, and allows users to pick a “mood” for her replies (i.e. her tone can be casual, professional, irritated, etc.) Ellie is also multilingual and will automatically reply in the language to which she was initially written. If Ellie’s response isn’t 100 percent correct, users can tweak or add more context to help her get it right. Ellie is currently available as an extension in Chrome and Firefox, and Gmail is the only fully supported email client. Others are expected to roll out soon.
Murf AI
Though writing and art are getting the most buzz from generative AI right now, the technology can also create lifelike voiceovers from text commands. Murf AI allows users to make studio quality voice overs for things like explainer videos, podcasts, advertisements and more using text. Just choose from the 120+ voice styles available on the site, including 20+ languages and accent options.
Stockimg.AI
Honestly, there are tons of different apps for AI art generation right now, but I chose Stockimg.AI because it makes content creation for different purposes so easy. When generating an image, you let the AI know if you are looking to make a book cover, logo, icon, wall paper or stock images, and it creates visual content to suit your needs.
Heyday
Heyday calls itself an AI powered memory assistant, but it’s actually more like a research assistant. The app works with browsers, search engines, and apps like Gmail and Google Docs to help “resurface” content you may need to find once you’ve already reviewed it. For instance: if you need to find the source file for the tip, quote, or reference you know you saw somewhere, Heyday will help expedite the process.
Wordtune Read
Wordtune does offer a generative writing option, but what’s more interesting to me is its reading option. Wordtune Read summarizes lengthy documents and helps highlight key points so that users can understand more, more quickly. It can even provide different summaries based on a specific point of view, for instance what the text means for an overall industry or decision-makers within the field.
Regie AI
Yes, generative AI is even getting job-specific. For instance, if your sales team needs help creating winning messaging, try out Regi AI. This app will help research potential contacts and help sales agents create personal emails that feel authentic to your company. Regie uses a large language model to help create a voice specific to your brand. It even uses past content to create new content. Regie can even create sales sequences and publish them to the company’s sales platform.
Resume Worded
It’s never been more challenging to get past the HR bots screening incoming resumes. Luckily Resume Worded can help. The app was designed to provide instant feedback on your resume or LinkedIn profile, including scores on key criteria that real recruiters use when hiring candidates. Users can also use the app to identify keywords most relevant to the job descriptions they’re searching for.
Looka
Want to create a professional logo for your company, but lacking in graphic design skills? Looka allows you to create a beautiful logo with the click of a button. Just input your company’s name, industry type, and color palette, and you’ll have an endless range of logo possibilities at your fingertips.
While ChatGPT and Bard are two of the most popular generative AI tools at this juncture, these are several other tools that I’ve had the chance to explore and I believe are worth trying to create content, assist productivity, support sales, augment HR, and help users find the most useful information online. Generative AI is here, and it’s working overtime.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is what powers tools such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Midjourney, which are trained on human-created content and can generate images or text in response to prompts. It promises to automate a lot of tasks we now do ourselves. That sounds like a boon, but it has also caused people to fear for their jobs. Indeed, Goldman Sachs issued a report on the effects of AI on economic growth that said, ""If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,"" estimating that 300 million jobs could be impacted.Impacted doesn’t necessarily mean terminated, though. The report goes on to say, ""Worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs"" and that 63% of current jobs would be complemented by AI—especially in fields such as customer service. The Wall Street Journal reports that the jobs for which AI can do at least 50% of the scut work include accountant, writer, mathematician, PR specialist, and blockchain engineer. Short-order cooks and motorcycle mechanics, your jobs are safe. As with any emerging tech, generative AI will also create new roles for people to fill—some that even weeks ago, no one had ever heard of. Here are just some of the job descriptions you’ll be seeing more of in the coming years.1. Prompt Engineer

(Credit: Google Bard/PCMag)

Generative AI uses natural language processing (NLP), which lets you ask for something using normal words and syntax. You don't have to be a programmer, but that doesn't mean you can't perfect what you say.Prompt is the term for what you ask of AI. A prompt engineer is someone who can compose an effective string of text that not only helps with the training of the AI but also delivers exactly the results needed and intended. A prompt engineer (PE) has to master the tricks that work on specific generative AIs—what you say to Bard may not be the right thing to say to ChatGPT, for example. Prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. The CEO of OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) says great prompt writing ""is an amazingly high-leverage skill.""
Current advertised pay rates for a PE can range from $250,000 to $335,000 per year, and the job doesn’t necessarily require a computer-science degree. Tech companies won’t be the only places that require successful prompts. Expect to see PE jobs for any business that needs AI automation, including law firms, customer support, and, well, publishing. At online marketplaces such as PromptBase, you can purchase a prompt or sell your own. This is one area of AI where the human touch will be a necessity. 2. AI TrainerAs companies implement generative-AI systems that are meant to interact with the outside world—think AI chatbots doing customer service—AI must learn a few things about the business it's a part of. That's what an AI trainer does.One job post found online as of this writing, for an insurance company that's implementing an AI platform, specifically says that the applicant will not be speaking to anyone on the phone directly; they will assist the AI platform while the AI conducts calls. Perfecting things that aren't human so they'll sound more human is what AI training is all about.3. AI AuditorIt's not enough to get cool or interesting results, the output from an AI should also be accurate and unbiased. We have heard plenty about the bias inherent in AI, and the companies powering today’s AI admit it can still happen. The job of the AI auditor is to make sure those problems are weeded out as much as possible. In some places, that is, or will be, the law—New York City, for example, has a law coming in July 2023 requiring bias audits of tech used for AI hiring.

GPT-4 vs. ChatGPT-3.5: What’s the Difference?





4. AI Ethicists/Ethics Experts

(Credit: Ascannio/shutterstock)

Bing Chat AI (powered by GPT-4) defines this role as the person ""responsible for ensuring that AI is used in a safe and ethical manner."" A recent job posting for Indeed.com says its AI ethicist (“staff data scientist”) will be ""helping all people get jobs by reducing bias and increasing fairness in our algorithmic systems."" We asked Google’s Bard AI about the job. It said, ""AI ethics experts can command high salaries, as they are in high demand by companies that want to ensure that their use of generative AI is responsible and ethical."" The high demand isn’t a given just yet, but the money isn't bad—the job mentioned above and a few others we found online topped out at $160,00 per year.5. Machine ManagersAI isn't going to be all about people typing natural language and getting back text (or pictures or video). Actual machines are going to have to learn to work with AI instructions. That's where machine managers will be needed—to oversee AI-operated hardware and systems.Because of the sophisticated requirements, these job descriptions (which are frequently placed by manufacturing industries) tend to ask for actual computer-science degrees along with commensurate experience in the field in which the AI is being used. The pay can fluctuate, with top salaries of $109K to $251K  a year. That seems a little low, though, if a pipsqueak prompt engineer commands a higher salary and doesn’t have an advanced degree. But this kind of hiring is also, apparently, as much an art as a science.Seeing a lot of overlap in these jobs? You're right. It’s Wild West time for generative AI, and no one knows which related jobs will stick around. But getting in on the ground floor with a job like any of the above is a smart move. And plenty of existing job titles—old-fashioned ones such as programmer—will still be needed, even as AI proliferates.

<p>Generative AI uses natural language processing (<a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp"" target=""_self"">NLP</a>), which lets you ask for something using normal words and syntax. You don't have to be a programmer, but that doesn't mean you can't perfect what you say.</p><p>Prompt is the term for what you ask of AI<em>.</em> A prompt engineer is someone who can compose an effective string of text that not only helps with the training of the AI but also delivers exactly the results needed and intended. A prompt engineer (PE) has to master the tricks that work on specific generative AIs&mdash;what you say to Bard may not be the right thing to say to ChatGPT, for example. Prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. The CEO of OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) says great prompt writing ""is an amazingly high-leverage skill.""</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

<p>Current advertised pay rates for a PE can range from $250,000 to $335,000 per year, and the job doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require a computer-science degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Tech companies won&rsquo;t be the only places that require successful prompts. Expect to see PE jobs for any business that needs AI automation, including law firms, customer support, and, well, <a href=""https://futurism.com/leaked-messages-cnet-red-ventures-ai"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">publishing</a>. At online marketplaces such as <a href=""https://promptbase.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">PromptBase</a>, you can purchase a prompt or sell your own. This is one area of AI where the human touch will be a necessity.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2 id=""2-ai-trainer"">2. AI Trainer</h2><p>As companies implement generative-AI systems that are meant to interact with the outside world&mdash;think AI chatbots doing customer service&mdash;AI must learn a few things about the business it's a part of. That's what an AI trainer does.</p><p>One job post found online as of this writing, for an insurance company that's implementing an AI platform, specifically says that the applicant will not be speaking to anyone on the phone directly; they will assist the AI platform while the AI conducts calls. Perfecting things that aren't human so they'll sound more human is what AI training is all about.</p><hr><h2 id=""3-ai-auditor"">3. AI Auditor</h2><p>It's not enough to get cool or interesting results, the output from an AI should also be accurate and unbiased. We have heard plenty about the <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/ai-is-exactly-as-biased-as-the-information-we-feed-it"" target=""_self"">bias</a> inherent in AI, and the companies powering today&rsquo;s AI admit it can still happen.

<p>Bing Chat AI (powered by <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-new-chatgpt-what-you-get-with-gpt-4-vs-gpt-35"" target=""_self"">GPT-4</a>) defines this role as the person ""responsible for ensuring that AI is used in a safe and ethical manner."" A recent <a href=""https://www.indeed.com/esg/joinaiethics"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">job posting</a> for Indeed.com says its AI ethicist (&ldquo;staff data scientist&rdquo;) will be ""helping all people get jobs by reducing bias and increasing fairness in our algorithmic systems."" </p><p>We asked Google&rsquo;s Bard AI about the job. It said, ""AI ethics experts can command high salaries, as they are in high demand by companies that want to ensure that their use of generative AI is responsible and ethical."" The high demand isn&rsquo;t a given just yet, but the money isn't bad&mdash;the job mentioned above and a few others we found online topped out at $160,00 per year.</p><hr><h2 id=""5-machine-managers"">5. Machine Managers</h2><p>AI isn't going to be all about people typing natural language and getting back text (or pictures or <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerberg-our-ai-program-can-create-video-from-a-line-of-text"" target=""_self"">video</a>). Actual machines are going to have to learn to work with AI instructions. That's where machine managers will be needed&mdash;to oversee AI-operated hardware and systems.</p><p>Because of the sophisticated requirements, these job descriptions (which are frequently placed by manufacturing industries) tend to ask for actual computer-science degrees along with commensurate experience in the field in which the AI is being used. The pay can fluctuate, with top salaries of $109K to $251K&nbsp; a year. That seems a little low, though, if a pipsqueak prompt engineer commands a higher salary and doesn&rsquo;t have an advanced degree. But this kind of hiring is also<em>, </em>apparently, as much an art as a science.</p><hr><p>Seeing a lot of overlap in these jobs? You're right. It&rsquo;s Wild West time for generative AI, and no one knows which related jobs will stick around. But getting in on the ground floor with a job like any of the above is a smart move. And plenty of existing job titles&mdash;old-fashioned ones such as programmer&mdash;will still be needed, even as AI proliferates.</p><div class=""video-parent !mb-0"">

But who exactly will benefit?This article is more than 1 year oldLarry ElliottWith swaths of white collar jobs at risk, the clock is ticking on the development of policy to meet this huge societal challengeFri 7 Apr 2023 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Apr 2023 09.17 EDTShare937937Elon Musk is not most people’s idea of a classic technophobe, so when the owner of Twitter warns of the dangers of artificial intelligence, it is worth sitting up and taking notice. Fearful that a new generation of ever-smarter machines threatens life on Earth as we know it, Musk was one of many at the cutting edge of technological change calling for a six-month timeout in the training of new AI systems.There is nothing new in the idea that the machines are coming, and they are out to get us. Techno-optimists are right to say that the same arguments were aired by Luddites in the early 19th century. By this token, the chatbot ChatGPT is to the fourth industrial revolution what the spinning jenny was to the first – a product that symbolises the dawning of a new era.In the past, there has been a pattern to events. New technology has arrived on the scene and has offered the prospect of doing things quicker and better. Fears have been raised of mass unemployment as machines take the jobs previously done by humans. Eventually, the pessimists have been proved wrong, and the new technology has led to higher levels of employment.There is little doubt that AI will be a gamechanger that can bring to an end a long period of weak productivity and low growth common to western economies since the global financial crisis erupted 15 years ago. As was the case when tractors took the place of farm hands, a single machine will be able to do what countless workers formerly did. That’s really not in question.What is in doubt is who will benefit from the boost to productivity. What if all the gains are seized by a handful of tech giants? What if history fails to repeat itself, and AI destroys more jobs than it creates? What if AI does lead to a net increase in employment, but the new jobs are less well-paid than the old ones? Put simply, what if it is different this time? That may well be the case.Much of the debate around the impact of AI is based on conjecture. There have been studies galore that have sought to estimate the number of jobs that will be affected – potentially running into the hundreds of millions globally – but nobody knows for sure. That said, certain conclusions can be drawn with a reasonable degree of confidence.One is that the pace of technological advance will not slow down, and will probably continue to accelerate. ChatGPT was launched last November, and by March, a new version was available. The call by Musk et al for a six-month moratorium has to be seen in the context of the geopolitical struggle between the US and China. Neither superpower wants to give the other the opportunity to forge ahead. The chances of Washington and Beijing getting together and agreeing to a joint pause seem remote.Despite the speed at which the technology is advancing, a second conclusion is that there will be no immediate root-and-branch transformation of economies. Machines are expensive and workers cheap. Moreover, companies have invested heavily in their existing systems, and these sunk costs mean it will take time for the impact of AI to show up in investment, jobs and productivity figures.View image in fullscreen‘The chatbot ChatGPT is to the fourth industrial revolution what the spinning jenny was to the first – a product that symbolises the dawning of a new era.’ Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesHowever, once the change does occur it is likely to be highly disruptive, because whole swaths of middle-class, white-collar jobs are at risk. This will be a break with the past, when earlier waves of technological advances made it possible for workers displaced from low-paid jobs to find better-paid employment in the new jobs created. People who were no longer needed as farm hands found work in factories.AI poses a challenge to this model because of Moravec’s paradox – the notion that for robots, the hard problems are easy and the easy problems hard. Machines can wipe the floor with chess grandmasters, but have more trouble removing and cleaning the pieces at the end of the game: tasks that involve mobility and perception skills that have evolved in humans over millions of years.But jobs that involve empathy and basic motor skills – social care work, for instance – tend to be poorly remunerated. That suggests the jobs most at risk from AI are likely to be higher paid than the ones created. There will be a boost to productivity and growth from the increased use of AI, but as things stand, the gains will be highly concentrated.The final conclusion is that policymakers need to use the limited time available to them to respond to the obvious challenges. AI has the potential to bring great benefits, but also has risks that go beyond economics into the realms of privacy and ethics.Launching the government’s white paper last week, the science and technology secretary Michelle Donelan said she wanted AI to be used to make the UK the “smarter, healthier and happier place to live and work”. All of which sounds marvellous, with echoes of an essay John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1930, predicting that within 100 years, increased prosperity would allow people to work 15-hour weeks.Keynes’s vision has yet to materialise, and nor will Donelan’s unless urgent attention is paid to the 3Rs of AI: a system of global regulation that sets common standards for the use and development of AI; retraining to prepare the workforce for the inevitable change; and redistribution to ensure that the economic benefits are spread around. As with the climate crisis, the other existential threat of our time, the clock is ticking.

Five days after its launch, ChatGPT exceeded 1 million users1. Generative AI (GenAI), the basis for tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard and Meta LLaMa, is a new AI technology that has quickly moved front and center into the global limelight. 
GenAI’s hallmark is the ability to answer almost any question on demand, converting text-based queries into masterful creations, such as songs, poems, art or college essays. GenAI then builds a network of related topics, generating an enormously expanded base of information, often visualized as a knowledge map. 
GenAI Meets the Enterprise
While we’ve seen initial consumer interest in GenAI tools and use skyrocket, GenAI capabilities are fast moving to the enterprise world. Today, an estimated 60% of IT leaders are looking to implement GenAI2.
At the same time, concerns exist. Most notably, for about 71% of IT leaders, angst about security creates a barrier to adoption, mandating that approaches, infrastructure, data strategies and security be appropriately aligned3. Finding the right, fit-for-use GenAI model for enterprises is the key to mitigating its risks, dispelling concerns and ushering in GenAI’s mainstream adoption in the enterprise world.
Overcoming GenAI challenges holds epic potential for enterprises. From improving customer interactions to automating complex business processes, GenAI models have the power to revolutionize the ways businesses operate, opening new possibilities for every industry in every part of the world.
Pivoting to Purpose-built GenAI
To enable that revolution, the way enterprises use GenAI will likely differ from general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Instead, enterprises are likely to use GenAI models that are trained and tuned to solve specific problems; for instance, to enable automated customer support, financial forecasting and fraud detection. Although LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used for enterprise applications, the accuracy of their results will not match that of a purpose-built model created to meet a specific need.
Other major benefits of purpose-built GenAI include:

Data security and compliance: AI’s unique capability is handling and analyzing huge datasets with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Simply put, if AI is a rocket ship, data is the fuel. The more data that a company can use to tune the purpose-built LLM, the more powerful the GenAI model becomes. Enterprises can tune their LLMs with customer purchase history, support or telesales logs, health records, financial records and other data sources. Consequently, handling this data in a secure manner will become even more important than it is today. Experienced advisors can help guide organizations size up a security strategy with minimal disruption to existing systems and approaches.Additionally, some industries, such as healthcare and finance, must comply with stringent regulations regarding data privacy and security. The privacy of data that is entered into third party LLM services is the subject of intensifying debate. Thus, enterprises that need to retain control over their data must tread carefully. 


Agility and time to market: Most enterprises will need to update their GenAI models regularly, which is easier to do with purpose-built GenAI models. The time required to train general-purpose LLMs can take months. That’s because massive amounts of data are required for training, eclipsing deployment speed and time to market, the very benefits GenAI enables. Reducing time-to-model and facilitating faster data-to-decisions can improve business efficiency.


Performance: Purpose-built models also provide performance benefits over general-purpose models. Specifically, enterprises using third party general-purpose LLMs may not be able to optimize performance and reduce the latency of their GenAI workloads. This is problematic for applications that require real-time processing or low-latency response times, a key attribute of GenAI adoption.


Cost: The smaller amounts of training data needed for purpose-built GenAI models also translate into cost savings. As a result, purpose-built LLMs often cost far less to train and re-train compared to general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT.

Moving Enterprise GenAI Forward 
For enterprises, GenAI holds the profound potential to automate complex processes, improve customer interactions and unlock new possibilities with better machine intelligence—and CIOs are the key to moving it forward. Together with organizations like yours, Dell and Intel are driving the next wave of innovation in the enterprise AI landscape.  
To help organizations move forward, Dell Technologies is powering the enterprise GenAI journey. With best-in-class IT infrastructure and solutions to run GenAI workloads and advisory and support services that roadmap GenAI initiatives, Dell is enabling organizations to boost their digital transformation and accelerate intelligent outcomes. 
Intel. The compute required for GenAI models has put a spotlight on performance, cost and energy efficiency as top concerns for enterprises today. Intel’s commitment to the democratization of AI and sustainability will enable broader access to the benefits of AI technology, including GenAI, via an open ecosystem. Intel’s AI hardware accelerators, including new built-in accelerators, provide performance and performance per watt gains to address the escalating performance, price and sustainability needs of generative AI.

One works with highly organized data collected in tables — the tabular-data-focused data scientist. The other works on deep learning applications including vision, audio, large language models (LLMs), etc. For the purposes of this piece, we call the former the “tabular” or “traditional” group and the latter the “LLM” group. Each group uses its own techniques and models that have, in large part, developed separately. With the recent successes of large language models including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and others, we wanted to see if we could use modern LLM results to help make predictions on tabular datasets.In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, we submitted results to several blind Kaggle competitions (including the popular “House Prices — Advanced Regression Techniques” competition). The typical Kaggle competition supplies tabular data and is dominated by traditional ML approaches. However, we found with little background knowledge, zero data cleaning, and zero feature development required by traditional methods, LLMs were able to return results with predictive power. LLM predictions were not competitive with the leading models produced with lengthy and extensive tabular methods, but were strong enough to place well higher than the median score on the leaderboard rankings.We expect this to be the beginning of a number of techniques that use LLMs on tabular data and would not be surprised to see their use widen and compete favorably to more traditional model development processes.Included in this write up is the first approach we have seen that merges traditional tabular datasets and XGBoost models with LLMs using latent structure embeddings, allowing the tabular approaches to work off of the numerical “features” produced internally by the LLM.To date, we haven’t seen an LLM used this way to date and hope this is the beginning of something exciting.Challenges of Applying Deep Learning to Tabular DataThe typical machine learning application involves cleaning and training a narrow set of data typically collected, held, or acquired by an organization. At a high level, the process can be thought of developing a “context” for which only one specific type of questions can be asked. When that type of question arises, the ML model produces one or more predictions. Further improving models comes from three areas: adding more data, improving methods, or acquiring more and different features. The last is often the most interesting here, as the data scientist is generally always asking herself: “what different data can I get to make my predictions better?”Partitioning, boosting, and/or bagging models have been developed for and do exceedingly well in this domain. Despite much effort, deep learning has not shown to be as effective in this area. Observations show that XGBoost and cousins generalize better in production, where deep learning models tend to overfit. A large number of teams have tried to improve deep learning on tabular datasets, but these efforts have largely lagged behind established, high performing tabular approaches.The Problem of Training with Narrow DataA common deep learning approach is to apply a neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to a relatively “small” dataset consisting of an organization’s data. This approach has been repeatedly shown to require more work (data scientist time), resource consumption (training time), and parameter tuning to get similar or worse performance than tabular approaches. The failure of deep learning here may be a mismatch between the approach and narrow data available to it. Deep Learning seems somewhat gated by its ability to learn from narrow data.Image by authorIn the image above, a large parameter neural network model is trained on the “small data” of a single company. Training a large model on a relatively small dataset causes the model to almost always be over-parameterized. This is because the information contained to make decisions is not that large, there are only so many “error surfaces” related to the data to optimize performance against.Applying a Large Language Model To a Tabular Dataset: Enter Prompt EngineeringLLMs have come to the fore through two innovations. The first is the transformer architecture pioneered by Google and others. The second is the application of these architectures to colossal data sets on the order of dozens or hundreds of terabytes. A reasonable hypothesis is that these LLMs are able to sidestep the “narrow” data problem that beleagures deep learning approaches. By training on Internet-scale data, LLMs have built an internal representation for the context of many applications. This is a needed step in order to have a model that can respond to any number of prompts. A happy and necessary consequence is that the LLMs may have developed the context for answering questions related to an organization’s prediction problems or those of a Kaggle competition.By way of analogy, LLMs have come to understand the context of your problem in a similar way that traditional/tabular machine learning has done in its training step. Surprisingly, this has been done using a broader source of data and not the organization’s specific data. Another way to look at it is that the LLMs has trained a model capable of predictions from all the data it acquired elsewhere. To the data scientist, this provides access to a diverse dataset and a potential treasure trove of information — or they may just provide noise.Unlocking the information in LLMs for tabular models encounters two obstacles. The first is that LLMs are accessed via prompts and not tabular data (DataFrames). The second is that LLMs primarily produce textual output.To overcome the first obstacle, we supply our tabular data through prompts. Here the prompt is created on each row of the table. The construction of the prompt is pretty simple: a paragraph comprised of sentences, one for each cell in the table row, as follows:Image by authorThe “row” prompt consists of the following:“The <column name> is <cell value>. The <column name> is <cell value>. …”Two things to note here:It is not necessary to generate prompts for training data, only the data about which the prediction needs to be made; andIt is not strictly necessary to ask what prediction will be made of the data.The second obstacle is that the LLMs produce textual responses. In some instances, LLMs can provide predictions. As of this writing, the predictions are not very good — likely because the LLMs that are not trained with specific predictions in mind. Instead of accessing LLM predictions, we find the flexibility to work with the features produced by the LLM preferable. In the parlance of LLMs, the features are latent structure embeddings or simply “embeddings.” These embeddings are accessible through LLM APIs. It is important to note that the embedding vectors are typically of values-per-row. Once we extract the embeddings, we can run them through a tabular model (XGBoost).The embeddings will be used in two examples: first, to make predictions for home prices in a Kaggle data competition (this blog); and second, to measure multivariate drift and anomaly detection using embedding drift (an upcoming blog).Workflow: Table -> Prompt -> LLM -> Embedding -> XGboost -> Prediction (Image by author)The LLM provides a great simple feature engineering tool available for use on any tabular dataset, essentially allowing performance gains with almost no feature engineering or parameterization.Towards Harnessing Big Data and Large Language ModelsIn most companies, the data you are training on is small relative to the information contained across the internet.Let’s take an example of home price prediction. Imagine the model you train learns from your data that a certain zip-code has higher priced homes. It also might learn some interesting relationships with other features, such as that homes with pools have higher selling prices. But imagine what you could say about home prices in a zip-code by gathering the entire world’s knowledge about that zip code and applying it in parallel with your current pricing model?Image by authorLarge language models are trained on an immense amount of data, and through that data they learn structure and relationships. Internally, they learn manifolds and surfaces in embedding/activation space that relate to concepts and knowledge that can be applied to almost anything.ResultsThe following approach can be applied to any pandas dataframe with no feature engineering. The results in this case was a 0.14 RLMSE, putting us in a respectable position in the results with little effort.How does it work? The data flows the model generating embeddings that represent the data in the prompt. The embeddings represent latent structure of the data that is flowing through the model. They capture the immense amount of training data that is then projected on the specific data we are looking at in the tabular data set.Image by authorThe image above shows the embedding space of a Kaggle home price data set. You can generate this view with the Colab that accompanies this blog. Here, the predictions mapped onto the UMAP view of the Kaggle Dataset.Image by authorThe embeddings of the LLM have immense structure that is represented by the UMAP view. One can see some of the information contained by mapping original features onto the predictions in the data.Final House Price PredictionIn order to make a prediction, the embedding values flow out of the LLM and to the XGBoost model that is trained on the embedding latent structure space. The XGBoost model then predicts the price of homes. This is all done with no feature engineering.Why not VAE’s?We started this journey looking at applying Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to tabular data. However, we ultimately found that VAE’s are just trained on too little data and are too sensitive to parameters to generate useful value.GPT-4We also tested pasting in the data directly to GPT-4 to see how it would fare just making predictions on the dataset directly with no training on the data directly. In many cases, the results were impressive. We expect there will be approaches to connect tabular data more directly to GPT-4 to help with these predictions directly.“The following is a set of row and column data:Id MSSubClass MSZoning …1 60 RL …”Once the rows and columns of data are pasted into the context you can ask questions about the data.Example of Lookup (image by author)It definitely understands the data, the following is a lookup on the exact ID in the dataset.Pre-Prompt (image by author)The above example is a pre-prompt prior to pasting in the data to predict.GPT-4 Prediction (image by author)The GPT-4 prediction above is a decent prediction without a model or training data. The actual value of the sales price is $130,250. It’s clear there will eventually be methods to connect data with GPT-4 and get fairly decent estimates without any training or in combination with training for state of the art (SOTA).A Look AheadGiven how little effort went into optimizing these outcomes, it is reasonable to expect LLMs to be used on tabular data in an increasingly large set of environments. It is also likely that LLMs will outperform traditional techniques, on small data sets, at some point in the near future. As LLMs and prompt engineering evolve many areas of data science, tabular data problems are not immune.",['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*PjLltDt8OrhLrxuIK0KZAg.jpeg'],https://towardsdatascience.com/boosting-tabular-data-predictions-with-large-language-models-531337f834dc,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aparna Dhinakaran', 'url': 'https://aparnadhinak.medium.com'}",2023-04-19T16:31:15.454Z,2023-04-06T14:46:29.818Z,Boosting Tabular Data Predictions with Large Language Models,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",,,,,,,,,Boosting Tabular Data Predictions with Large Language Models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-06T14:46:29.818Z,531337f834dc,['Aparna Dhinakaran'],,,,,,,,

Enterprise Connect 2023 recap



 
18:47











The rise in generative AI in the enterprise communications world is changing how organizations can make collaboration more accessible and productive to ultimately create a more positive environment for employee experience.
Industry analysts Irwin Lazar, president and principal analyst at Metrigy; Beth Schultz, vice president and principal analyst at Metrigy; and David Maldow, founder of Let's Do Video, discussed the evolution of unified communications (UC) and collaboration technology at Enterprise Connect 2023 and what hybrid work trends should be on IT buyers' radars as they plan their UC and contact center strategies.
The four-day Enterprise Connect conference focused on the latest in UC, collaboration and contact center technology. A hybrid conference, the expo opened with topics on just that -- the hybrid workplace -- as well as the latest in AI technology. The conference featured keynote speakers from Microsoft, Cisco, RingCentral, Zoom, Google Cloud and AWS.
Generative AI was the highlight of the conference, with vendors demonstrating the different ways to use the technology in the workplace. Lazar discussed the demo of Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams, for example, that showed how the generative AI-based service created meeting transcripts, notes and action items and was also able to analyze the sentiment of the meeting.
Additionally, with hybrid work becoming the new norm, companies such as Microsoft and Cisco are finding ways to keep employees engaged and productive in the workplace, no matter where everyone is working from. Schultz noted that IT buyers should pay attention to what they can do with the collaboration data available from their vendors as a way to create a more proactive environment among employees and increase productivity.
Watch this analyst recap of Enterprise Connect to get a deeper look into topics about generative AI and learn more about the advanced features supporting hybrid work trends among employees.

The main aim is to draw valuable information from the raw data and then use it to generate solutions required by business organisations to grow in a competitive market. As an example, in food delivery apps, data from your previous orders and browsing history is used to generate discount offers that you are most likely to accept. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in data science, computer science or a related field. Many employers also prefer candidates with a master’s degree in data science. Entry-level salary – over Rs 5,00,000 per year 3) AI Research Scientist A research scientist is responsible for conducting various experiments on existing models in order to create new algorithms. In simple words, their job is to improve and modify the ways in which a machine thinks and operates. The algorithms generated by them further assist in analysing data and producing patterns. As a result, the opportunities for an AI scientist are innumerable. They have a great scope in industries such as healthcare, finance, marketing, insurance, retail, manufacturing and more. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in computer science or computer programming to show that you know the basics of algorithms. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 3,25,000 4) Robotics Engineer As the name suggests, robotics engineers develop robots that can perform a plethora of tasks without human intervention. They do so by combining the elements of computer science, engineering, cognitive psychology and electronics. In addition, these remarkable creations make sure to simplify repetitive tasks and perform them with utmost precision. Drones, which are great products of this technology, are now being used in industries such as agriculture, military, entertainment and real estate to increase efficiency, accuracy, and reduce cost and time. Educational Qualification – At least a degree in computer engineering, mechanical engineering or robotics. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 3,50,000  5) AI Ethicist AI ethicists are assigned the job of instilling ethical, political and social perspectives in AI systems.

In the past, many tech giants have landed in legal battles due to possible unethical use of the massive amount of data collected from users or customers. To mitigate such ethical risks associated with AI, companies are more than eager to hire expert ethicists. This is probably why there is a huge demand for AI ethicists in the job market. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in ethics, philosophy, computer science or a related field might give you a good start. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 2,00,000 6) UX designerA UX or user experience designer plays an indispensable part in assessing the way a user interacts with a product, programme or website. They design and develop products that are ultra-simple to operate by closely monitoring the expectations, behaviours, desires and triggers of the consumers. For instance, when you visit hotel booking websites, a UX designer makes sure that your entire search process is quick and user-friendly. Moreover, the smart features installed by them boost engagement and traffic. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in technology, science and engineering. Many private colleges also offer a specific UX designer course to equip you with the necessary skills. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 2,60,000 7) Business Intelligence DeveloperA business intelligence developer is responsible for developing and maintaining several software solutions which can be used to access data and support the goals of the company.

(Michael Dwyer / Associated Press)       By Rebecca Ackermann   April 9, 2023 3:01 AM PT      Share       Share via Close extra sharing options    Email     Facebook    X    LinkedIn    Threads    Reddit    WhatsApp    Copy Link URLCopied!   Print        Could a bot write this intro? The hype around AI has pushed this question to the center of public discourse. Conversational bots such as ChatGPT and automated image generators such as DALL-E — both built by OpenAI — are popping up everywhere.Despite a few optimistic case studies of their potential, the current models are limited and the results they produce deeply flawed. But it doesn’t seem to matter that the tech behind AI is not ready for prime time. The models only have to tell a convincing story to the humans signing the checks — and they are.Microsoft, which has developed its own Bing chatbot, invested $13 billion in OpenAI. Early-stage venture companies poured $2.2 billion into generative AI last year alone, and this year Salesforce announced a $250-million fund to invest in the space. Headlines and institutions alike are declaring AI the future of work, poised in particular to replace writers and artists. That these breathless predictions are outpacing the quality of the tech itself says a lot about our cultural moment — and our long-festering trend of devaluing creative work. Advertisement             Technology and the Internet   Column: Afraid of AI? The startups selling it want you to be  ChatGPT and other new AI services benefit from a science fiction-infused marketing frenzy unlike anything in recent memory. There’s more to fear here than killer robots.March 31, 2023   The supposed promise of the AI future is efficient and abundant content. Office workers can now generate entire presentations with a prompt or click. Creative agencies are using image generators to mock up client concepts. Even literary magazines have reported being bombarded with AI-generated submissions, and yes, editors are hitting publish on AI-generated articles and illustrations.But the AI models have proved time and again that they perpetuate biases, misunderstand cultural context and prioritize being convincing over telling the truth. They draw on data sets of creative work by humans, an approach that might otherwise be labeled plagiarism or data-mining. And the models driving ChatGPT and DALL-E are black boxes, so the data’s origins can’t technically be traced.Today, these and other models require humans (with their own biases) to train them toward “good” results and then check their work at the end. Because the tools are built for pattern-matching, their results are often repetitive and thin, an aesthetic of similitude rather than invention.   The impetus to replace human workers, then, doesn’t come from slam-dunk capacities of the tech. It stems from years of companies big and small — especially those in publishing, tech and media — turning the screws on creative work to spend ever less on workers.In today’s financial downturn, even tech companies are cutting costs through mass layoffs (including slashing AI ethics teams) while funding  and selling AI tools. But the situation is more dire for the writers, artists and musicians who have been struggling to make a living for a long time.Pay for writers, editors and illustrators in this country has stagnated over the past two decades. Some nations have started treating art as a public good: Ireland is experimenting with paying artists to make art, and other countries are subsidizing audiences for art. But in the U.S., public funding for the arts is embarrassingly low compared with other wealthy Western nations and dipped further still during the pandemic. Many artists need to migrate from one social media app to another to build an audience for their work and eke out an income.  Advertisement    Meanwhile, ubiquitous streaming subscriptions and algorithmic feeds, with their laser focus on getting the most engagement, have flattened creativity into an infinite scroll of mediocre, repetitive styles — an unsustainable model for original work.         Opinion   Opinion: Worried that ChatGPT is coming for your job? An old assessment tool may have the answer  Bloom’s Taxonomy, a framework that describes levels of thinking, is a better tool for determining AI capabilities than comparing them with humans’.March 5, 2023   Automation is the next chapter in this tale of ever cheaper content. How much lower can art’s value go? Why pay creative workers living wages when you can program machines to churn out interchangeable content units?Well, because these models are no substitute for human creative labor. If we want to break out of repetitive molds, strive to unravel biases and build new possibilities, the work must come from humans.The danger in reducing creative work to widgets for outsourcing is that we lose the steps of reflection and iteration that produce new connections. The language learning models behind chatbots are designed to deliver a single, authoritative response, contracting the world to the span of the information they’ve already been fed. The human brain, on the other hand, has a unique capacity for recursive processing that allows us to interpret ideas beyond a set of rules. Each step of the creative process — no matter how slow, small or boring — is an expansive act, transporting a concept into a new place and imagining a wider world than what exists today.An AI takeover is not inevitable, despite what some business and tech leaders say. This is not the first tech hype cycle, and some regulators, unions and artists are already pushing back. In the wake of the crypto collapse, the Federal Trade Commission established an Office of Technology to support enforcement in emerging tech areas, and the agency has released multiple public warnings that false claims about products’ AI capabilities will be challenged.The Writers Guild of America, which is poised to go on strike, has proposed protections and regulatory standards around the use of AI in script-writing. SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors and TV and radio workers union, has stated that if studios want to use AI to simulate actor performances, they’ll have to negotiate with the union. Some researchers are building tools to protect the work of visual artists from being absorbed into models for image generators, and others have launched open-source systems to highlight biases in AI models.But the broader call to action is a cultural one: to recognize that creative work is not merely a commodity or content, but a necessary and highly skilled practice that deserves robust funding and support. Creativity is how meaning is constructed in culture. This is a task that can’t be done by machines — and shouldn’t be controlled by the companies that build them. A bot may be able to swiftly write an ending to this story, but we have to ask ourselves: Whose voices do we actually need?Rebecca Ackermann has written about tech and culture for MIT Technology Review, Slate and elsewhere.

Early-stage venture companies poured $2.2 billion into generative AI last year alone, and this year Salesforce announced a $250-million fund to invest in the space. Headlines and institutions alike are declaring AI the future of work, poised in particular to replace writers and artists. That these breathless predictions are outpacing the quality of the tech itself says a lot about our cultural moment — and our long-festering trend of devaluing creative work. The supposed promise of the AI future is efficient and abundant content. Office workers can now generate entire presentations with a prompt or click. Creative agencies are using image generators to mock up client concepts. Even literary magazines have reported being bombarded with AI-generated submissions, and yes, editors are hitting publish on AI-generated articles and illustrations. But the AI models have proved time and again that they perpetuate biases, misunderstand cultural context and prioritize being convincing over telling the truth. They draw on data sets of creative work by humans, an approach that might otherwise be labeled plagiarism or data-mining. And the models driving ChatGPT and DALL-E are black boxes, so the data’s origins can’t technically be traced. Today, these and other models require humans (with their own biases) to train them toward “good” results and then check their work at the end. Because the tools are built for pattern-matching, their results are often repetitive and thin, an aesthetic of similitude rather than invention. The impetus to replace human workers, then, doesn’t come from slam-dunk capacities of the tech. It stems from years of companies big and small — especially those in publishing, tech and media — turning the screws on creative work to spend ever less on workers. In today’s financial downturn, even tech companies are cutting costs through mass layoffs (including slashing AI ethics teams) while funding and selling AI tools. But the situation is more dire for the writers, artists and musicians who have been struggling to make a living for a long time. Pay for writers, editors and illustrators in this country has stagnated over the past two decades. Some nations have started treating art as a public good: Ireland is experimenting with paying artists to make art, and other countries are subsidizing audiences for art. But in the U.S., public funding for the arts is embarrassingly low compared with other wealthy Western nations and dipped further still during the pandemic. Many artists need to migrate from one social media app to another to build an audience for their work and eke out an income. Meanwhile, ubiquitous streaming subscriptions and algorithmic feeds, with their laser focus on getting the most engagement, have flattened creativity into an infinite scroll of mediocre, repetitive styles — an unsustainable model for original work. Automation is the next chapter in this tale of ever cheaper content. How much lower can art’s value go? Why pay creative workers living wages when you can program machines to churn out interchangeable content units? Well, because these models are no substitute for human creative labor. If we want to break out of repetitive molds, strive to unravel biases and build new possibilities, the work must come from humans. The danger in reducing creative work to widgets for outsourcing is that we lose the steps of reflection and iteration that produce new connections. The language learning models behind chatbots are designed to deliver a single, authoritative response, contracting the world to the span of the information they’ve already been fed. The human brain, on the other hand, has a unique capacity for recursive processing that allows us to interpret ideas beyond a set of rules. Each step of the creative process — no matter how slow, small or boring — is an expansive act, transporting a concept into a new place and imagining a wider world than what exists today. An AI takeover is not inevitable, despite what some business and tech leaders say. This is not the first tech hype cycle, and some regulators, unions and artists are already pushing back. In the wake of the crypto collapse, the Federal Trade Commission established an Office of Technology to support enforcement in emerging tech areas, and the agency has released multiple public warnings that false claims about products’ AI capabilities will be challenged. The Writers Guild of America, which is poised to go on strike, has proposed protections and regulatory standards around the use of AI in script-writing. SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors and TV and radio workers union, has stated that if studios want to use AI to simulate actor performances, they’ll have to negotiate with the union. Some researchers are building tools to protect the work of visual artists from being absorbed into models for image generators, and others have launched open-source systems to highlight biases in AI models. But the broader call to action is a cultural one: to recognize that creative work is not merely a commodity or content, but a necessary and highly skilled practice that deserves robust funding and support. Creativity is how meaning is constructed in culture. This is a task that can’t be done by machines — and shouldn’t be controlled by the companies that build them. A bot may be able to swiftly write an ending to this story, but we have to ask ourselves: Whose voices do we actually need?

Is Coming for Lawyers, AgainPrevious advances in A.I. inspired predictions that the law was the lucrative profession most likely to suffer job losses. It didn’t happen. Is this time different?Share full article277Read in app Credit...Alejandra BalagueraBy Steve LohrSteve Lohr writes about the impact of technology on work.April 10, 2023More than a decade ago, lawyers were singled out as an endangered occupational species, their livelihoods at risk from advances in artificial intelligence.But the doomsayers got ahead of themselves. While clever software has taken over some of the toil of legal work — searching, reviewing and mining mountains of legal documents for nuggets of useful information — employment in the legal profession has grown faster than the American work force as a whole.Today, a new A.I. threat looms, and lawyers may feel a bit of déjà vu. There are warnings that ChatGPT-style software, with its humanlike language fluency, could take over much of legal work. The new A.I. has its flaws, notably its proclivity to make things up, including fake legal citations. But proponents insist those are teething defects in a nascent technology — and fixable.Will the pessimists finally be right?Law is seen as the lucrative profession perhaps most at risk from the recent advances in A.I. because lawyers are essentially word merchants. And the new technology can recognize and analyze words and generate text in an instant. It seems ready and able to perform tasks that are the bread and butter of lawyers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“That is really, really powerful,” said Robert Plotkin, an intellectual property lawyer in Cambridge, Mass. “My work and my career has been mostly writing text.”But unless the past isn’t a guide, the impact of the new technology is more likely to be a steadily rising tide than a sudden tidal wave. New A.I. technology will change the practice of law, and some jobs will be eliminated, but it also promises to make lawyers and paralegals more productive, and to create new roles. That is what happened after the introduction of other work-altering technologies like the personal computer and the internet.ImageBen Allgrove, a partner and the chief innovation officer at the international law firm Baker McKenzie, tracks the impact of technology on the legal profession.Credit...Tom Jamieson for The New York TimesOne new study, by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University, concluded that the industry most exposed to the new A.I. was “legal services.” Another research report, by economists at Goldman Sachs, estimated that 44 percent of legal work could be automated. Only the work of office and administrative support jobs, at 46 percent, was higher.Lawyers are only one occupation in the path of A.I. progress. A study by researchers at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and the University of Pennsylvania found that about 80 percent of American workers would have at least 10 percent of their tasks affected by the latest A.I. software.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe legal profession has been identified as a ripe target for A.I. automation in the past. In 2011, one article in a longer series in The New York Times on the progress in A.I. (titled “Smarter Than You Think”) focused on the likely impact on legal work. Its headline: “Armies of Expensive Lawyers, Replaced by Cheaper Software.”But the march of A.I. in law turned out to be more measured. A.I. mainly identified, sorted and classified words in documents. The technology’s tools served more as aides than as replacements — and the same could be true this time.In 2017, Baker McKenzie, a large international law firm, set up a committee to track emerging technology and set strategy. Since then, the A.I. software has made steady inroads.“The reality is A.I. has not disrupted the legal industry,” said Ben Allgrove, a partner at the firm and its chief innovation officer.The rapid progress in large language models — the technology engine for ChatGPT — is a significant advance, Mr. Allgrove said. Reading, analyzing and summarizing, he said, are fundamental legal skills. “At its best, the technology seems like a very smart paralegal, and it will improve,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe impact, Mr. Allgrove said, will be to force everyone in the profession, from paralegals to $1,000-an-hour partners, to move up the skills ladder to stay ahead of the technology. The work of humans, he said, will increasingly be to focus on developing industry expertise, exercising judgment in complex legal matters, and offering strategic guidance and building trusted relationships with clients.Technology has eliminated large numbers of jobs in recent years, and not just robots taking over factories. Personal computers, productivity software and the internet have made office work more efficient, replacing many workers.Office and administrative support occupations, including secretaries, clerks, bill collectors and office assistants, employ 1.3 million fewer workers than in 1990, according to an analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Labor Department forecasts further decline, with 880,000 fewer jobs in those occupations by 2031.“Technology is a driver, and there are large changes, but they tend to come gradually over a decade or more,” said Michael Wolf, the division chief for occupational employment projections at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The bureau’s current outlook is that jobs for lawyers and paralegals will continue to grow faster than the labor market as a whole. Mr. Wolf is closely watching the arrival of the new A.I. software, but he said it was too early to assess what the technology’s long-term impact would be.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLawyers are mostly putting the technology through test runs. The issues of data protection and client confidentiality are critical in legal work. The legal profession resisted using email until information-handling rules were established.And the software models’ tendency to make up things confidently is alarming — and an invitation to malpractice suits — in a profession that hinges on finding and weighing facts.To help address those concerns, law firms often use software that runs on top of something like ChatGPT and is fine-tuned for legal work. The tailored software has been developed by legal tech start-ups like Casetext and Harvey.Load in a case’s documents and ask the software to draft deposition questions, for example, and in a few minutes it will spit out a list of pertinent questions, lawyers say.“For the things it can do well, it does them stunningly well,” said Bennett Borden, a partner and the chief data scientist at DLA Piper, a large corporate law firm.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSuccessfully using the A.I. requires ample relevant data and questions that are detailed and specific, Mr. Borden said. More open-ended questions, like what’s the most important evidence, or who are the most credible witnesses, are still a struggle for the A.I.Lawyers at big firms have seen significant time savings for certain jobs and view the technology as a tool to make teams of lawyers and paralegals more productive. Sole practitioners see the technology more as a partner in practice.Valdemar L. Washington, a lawyer in Flint, Mich., was selected last fall to test the software from Casetext, called CoCounsel, which works with the latest ChatGPT technology.Mr. Washington used the software in a suit against the City of Flint claiming that residents were overcharged on water and sewer rates and service fees. He loaded more than 400 pages of documents, and the software quickly reviewed them and wrote a summary that pointed him to an important gap in the defense’s case.The program did in a few minutes what would have taken him several hours, he said.“It’s a real game changer,” Mr. Washington said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut how much the legal profession will change, and how soon, is uncertain.The new A.I. is a challenge to the status quo. Higher productivity means fewer billable hours, yet hourly billing remains the dominant business model in legal work. A.I. should increase the pressure from corporate clients to pay law firms for work done rather than time spent. But top corporate legal officers — the customers — are typically former partners and associates in big law firms, steeped in the same traditions.“There is a huge opportunity for A.I. in legal services, but the professional culture is very conservative,” said Raj Goyle, an adviser to legal tech companies and a Harvard Law School graduate. “The future is coming, but it will not be as fast as some predict.”Steve Lohr covers technology, economics and work force issues.

Since the advent of the transformer architecture in 2017, we’ve seen exponential advancements in the complexity of natural language tasks that these models can tackle from classification, to intent & sentiment extraction, to generating text eerily similar to humans.From an application standpoint, the possibilities seem endless when combining LLMs with various existing technologies, to cover their pitfalls (one of my favorite being the GPT + Wolfram Alpha combo to handle math and symbolic reasoning problems).But what surprised me was that LLMs can also be used as recommendation systems, in and of themselves, without the need for any additional feature engineering or other manual processes that go into common rec systems. This capability is largely due to the nature of how LLMs are pre-trained and how they operate.Table of ContentsA Recap of LLMs and How Transformers WorkLLMs as Recommendation SystemsImplementing/Replicating P5 with Custom DataReplication Attempt 2 — ArabicBenefits and Pitfalls of LLMs as Recommendation SystemsFinal ThoughtsCodeA Recap of LLMs and How Transformers WorkLanguage models are probabilistic models that try to map the probability of a sequence of tokens (words in a phrase, sentence, etc.) occurring. They’re trained on an array of texts, and derive probability distributions accordingly. For the various tasks that they can handle (summarization, question-answering, etc.) they are iteratively selecting the most probable token/word to continue a prompt, using conditional probability. See the example below:An example of probabilities of subsequent tokens based on context (Image by author)LLMs are language models that have been trained on MASSIVE amounts of text with large architectures that utilize significant amounts of compute. These are commonly powered by the transformer architecture, which was introduced in the famous 2017 paper “Attention Is All You Need” by Google. This architecture utilizes a “self-attention” mechanism, which allows the model to learn how different tokens relate to one another during the pre-training process.After pre-training across a large enough set of texts, similar words will have similar embeddings (ex: “King”, “Monarch”) and dissimilar words will have more different ones. Additionally, with these embeddings, we’ll see an algebraic mapping of words in relation to one another, allowing the model to more powerfully determine a correct next token for a sequence.Like the classic example of “King — Man + Woman = Queen” in Word2VecThe added benefit of self-attention embeddings is that they will vary for a word depending on the words around it, making them more tailored to the meaning in that context.Stanford’s Dr. Christopher Manning gives a great high-level overview of how LLMs work.LLMs as Recommendation SystemsIn 2022, researchers from Rutger’s University published the paper “Recommendation as Language Processing (RLP): A Unified Pretrain, Personalized Prompt & Predict Paradigm (P5)” (Geng et. al). In it they introduced a “flexible and unified text-to-text paradigm” which combined several recommendation tasks in a single system: P5. This system is capable of performing the following via natural language sequences:Sequential recommendationRating predictionExplanation generationReview summarizationDirect recommendationLet’s take a look at an example of the sequential recommendation task from the paper.Input: ""I find the purchase history list of user_15466:4110 -> 4467 -> 4468 -> 4472I wonder what is the next item to recommend to the user. Can you helpme decide?""Output: ""1581""The researchers assigned the user and each item a unique ID. Using a training set with thousands of users (and their purchase histories) and unique items, the LLM is able to learn that certain items are similar to one another and that certain users have inclinations towards certain items (due to the nature of the self-attention mechanism). During the pre-training process across all these purchase sequences, the model essentially goes through a form of collaborative filtering. It sees what users have purchased the same items and what items tend to be purchased together. Combine that with an LLM’s ability to produce contextual embeddings, and we suddenly have a very powerful recommendation system.In the example above, although we don’t know what item each ID corresponds to, we can infer that item “1581” was selected due to other users purchasing it along with any of the items that “user_15466” already purchased.With regards to P5’s architecture, it “utilizes the pretrained T5 checkpoints as backbone” (Geng et. al).T5 is another LLM that Google released a few years ago. It was designed to handle multiple types of sequence-to-sequence tasks, so it makes sense to use it as a starting point for this kind of system.Implementing/Replicating P5 with Custom DataI was really impressed with this paper and wanted to see if I could replicate the sequential recommendation capability on a smaller scale. I decided to leverage an open-source T5 model from Hugging Face (T5-large) and made my own custom dataset to fine-tune it to produce recommendations.The dataset I made consisted of over 100 examples of sports equipment purchases along with the next item to be purchased. For example:Input: “Soccer Goal Post, Soccer Ball, Soccer Cleats, Goalie Gloves”Target Output: “Soccer Jersey”Of course, to make this more robust, I decided to use a more specific prompt. Which looked like this:Input: “ITEMS PURCHASED: {Soccer Goal Post, Soccer Ball, Soccer Cleats, Goalie Gloves} — CANDIDATES FOR RECOMMENDATION: {Soccer Jersey, Basketball Jersey, Football Jersey, Baseball Jersey, Tennis Shirt, Hockey Jersey, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Tennis Ball, Hockey Puck, Basketball Shoes, Football Cleats, Baseball Cleats, Tennis Shoes, Hockey Helmet, Basketball Arm Sleeve, Football Shoulder Pads, Baseball Cap, Tennis Racket, Hockey Skates, Basketball Hoop, Football Helmet, Baseball Bat, Hockey Stick, Soccer Cones, Basketball Shorts, Baseball Glove, Hockey Pads, Soccer Shin Guards, Soccer Shorts} — RECOMMENDATION: ”Target Output: “Soccer Jersey”Above you can see the specification of items purchased by the user so far, followed by a list of candidates for recommendation that haven’t been purchased yet (this is the entire inventory).After fine-tuning the T5 model using Hugging Face’s Trainer API (Seq2SeqTrainer for ~10 epochs), I got some surprisingly good results! Some example evaluations:Input: “ITEMS PURCHASED: {Soccer Jersey, Soccer Goal Post, Soccer Cleats, Goalie Gloves} — CANDIDATES FOR RECOMMENDATION: {Basketball Jersey, Football Jersey, Baseball Jersey, Tennis Shirt, Hockey Jersey, Soccer Ball, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Tennis Ball, Hockey Puck, Basketball Shoes, Football Cleats, Baseball Cleats, Tennis Shoes, Hockey Helmet, Basketball Arm Sleeve, Football Shoulder Pads, Baseball Cap, Tennis Racket, Hockey Skates, Basketball Hoop, Football Helmet, Baseball Bat, Hockey Stick, Soccer Cones, Basketball Shorts, Baseball Glove, Hockey Pads, Soccer Shin Guards, Soccer Shorts} — RECOMMENDATION: ”Model Output: “​​Soccer Ball”Input: “ITEMS PURCHASED: {Basketball Jersey, Basketball, Basketball Arm Sleeve} — CANDIDATES FOR RECOMMENDATION: {Soccer Jersey, Football Jersey, Baseball Jersey, Tennis Shirt, Hockey Jersey, Soccer Ball, Football, Baseball, Tennis Ball, Hockey Puck, Soccer Cleats, Basketball Shoes, Football Cleats, Baseball Cleats, Tennis Shoes, Hockey Helmet, Goalie Gloves, Football Shoulder Pads, Baseball Cap, Tennis Racket, Hockey Skates, Soccer Goal Post, Basketball Hoop, Football Helmet, Baseball Bat, Hockey Stick, Soccer Cones, Basketball Shorts, Baseball Glove, Hockey Pads, Soccer Shin Guards, Soccer Shorts} — RECOMMENDATION: ”Model Output: “Basketball Shoes”This is of course subjective given that recommendations aren’t necessarily binary successes/failures, but the outputs being similar to the respective purchases so far is impressive.Replication Attempt 2 — ArabicNext, I wanted to see if I could do this for Arabic, so I translated my dataset and looked for some publicly available T5 models that could handle Arabic text (AraT5, MT5, etc.). After trying out a dozen or so variants I found on the Hugging Face Hub, I unfortunately couldn’t get it to produce acceptable results.The model (after fine-tuning) would recommend the same 1 or 2 items, regardless of the purchase history — typically “كرة القدم”, a “soccer ball” (but hey, maybe it knows that Arabic speakers love soccer and are always looking for a new soccer ball). Even after trying larger versions of these models, like MT5-xl, I got the same result. This is likely due to the data paucity these LLMs have on languages other than English.For my last attempt, I decided to try using the Google Translate API in conjunction with my English fine-tuned T5 model. The process was:Take the Arabic input → Translate to English → Feed into the English fine-tuned model → Get model prediction in English → Translate back to ArabicUnfortunately, this still didn’t help much since the translator would make some mistakes (ex: “كرة القدم”, which we’re using in place of “soccer” directly translates to “foot ball”), which threw the model off and resulted in the same 1–2 items being recommended consistently.Benefits and Pitfalls of LLMs as Recommendation SystemsThe most prominent benefits of this technique revolve around the ease of which it can be implemented as a stand-alone system. Because of the nature of LLMs and pre-training techniques discussed above, we can bypass the need for heavy, manual feature engineering — the model should be able to learn the representations and relationships naturally. Additionally, we can sidestep the cold start problem for new items to an extent — the name/description of the item can be extracted and naturally related to existing items that users have already purchased/selected.There are, however, some pitfalls to this approach (don’t throw away your current rec systems just yet!) which primarily entail a lack of control on what’s recommended.Because there’s no weighting for the different actions/events that a user takes to examine, then purchase an item, we’re solely dependent on what the LLM predicts is the most probable next token(s) for recommendation. We can’t take into consideration what the user bookmarked, looked at for a period of time, put into their cart, etc.Additionally, with these LLMs, we do run the risk that most of the recommendations are similarity based (i.e. items that are semantically similar to the items purchased so far), though I do think with extensive training data of user purchase history, we can ameliorate this issue via the “collaborative filtering” approach that this method could mimic.Finally, because LLMs can produce any text theoretically, the output could be a string that doesn’t exactly match an item in the inventory (though I think the likelihood of this occurring is low).Final ThoughtsBased on the results of the P5 paper and my attempt to replicate this on a T5 model with some fine-tuning and prompting, I would infer that this technique could be used across MANY language models. Using more powerful sequence-to-sequence models could help dramatically, especially if the fine-tuning data is large enough and the prompting technique is perfected.However, I wouldn’t go as far as to recommend (no pun intended) that anyone use this method in and of itself. I would suggest that it be used in conjunction with other recommendation system techniques, so that we can avoid the pitfalls mentioned above while simultaneously reaping the rewards. How this can be done — I’m not certain, but I think with some creativity, this LLM technique can be integrated in a helpful manner (maybe with extracting embedding-based features to use in collaborative filtering, maybe in conjunction with the “Two Tower” architecture, the possibilities go on).CodeMy implementation of T5 as a recommendation system (Github Repository)My fine-tuned T5 model on Hugging Face (Hugging Face Hub)References[1] S.

Advocacy organizations have a lot on their plates, and any tool that can save them time and energy while still producing high-quality work is a valuable addition to their toolkit. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), it’s no surprise that many advocacy professionals are exploring new tools to help them with their work. 
AI can be particularly useful for writing and editing advocacy content, improving email campaigns, and creating multimedia content. As AI technology continues to advance, advocacy organizations that embrace these tools will be able to work more efficiently and effectively than ever before. Whether you’re a seasoned advocacy professional or just starting out, AI tools have the potential to revolutionize the way you work and help you achieve your goals more efficiently and effectively than ever before. 
That introduction was entirely written with the generative AI tool ChatGPT, with some light editing. Impressed? Read on to learn how generative artificial intelligence can help your advocacy efforts.
AI for Small Advocacy Teams
If you work in a small advocacy team (or if you alone are the team), having the budget or personnel needed to get it all done is often a luxury you can only dream of. With 58 percent of government affairs and advocacy professionals on teams of just 1-3 people, according to a recent FiscalNote industry report, the challenges small teams face are common to a large number of advocacy professionals. 
AI tools are one of the ways you can expand your advocacy outreach without hiring additional staff. For example, video editors like Wisecut leverage AI and voice recognition to automatically edit your videos, add captions and take out pauses. This means you can get more done with a lean team, making AI a must-have for organizations operating on a tight budget. 


 ”""Sometimes we hesitate to take the human factor out of things, but time is money."" William DevoeDirector of communications and advocacy, Cerebral Palsy Associations of New York State


Create Advocacy Content with AI Tools
Some advocacy professionals are hesitant to employ AI tools to create content, but William Devoe, director of communications and advocacy at Cerebral Palsy Associations of New York State, said they should be willing to let go of some creativity and control and allow AI to do its thing. 
“Sometimes we hesitate to take the human factor out of things, but time is money,” he advised at a recent VoterVoice advocacy event. “See if you can automate some of that stuff and free up some of your time. I would encourage [you] to play around with ChatGPT and give it some prompts and see what it does for you.”  
ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022, has many potential uses for your advocacy efforts. Generative AI tools can get you started with a press release, a template letter for advocates to send lawmakers, an email update, or an outline for a blog. 
For example, Devoe recently gave ChatGPT some prompts and asked it to write a press release for an advocacy coalition. “It was amazing,” he said. “With only very minor edits, it would have been something we could have sent out.” 
ChatGPT can also help create different versions of an advocacy message to send legislators since they can get tired of seeing an identical message many times. “Legislators catch on if they get the same five emails carbon copied,” said Rachel Coffman, president at Coffman Collaborative. “But with ChatGPT, you can ask it to rewrite the template in several different ways that you can send out to your advocates so you’re not constantly bombarding their inboxes with the same blanket template.” 
ChatGPT isn’t the only AI tool that can help with writing: other popular options are Jasper, Anyword, and INK. These tools can help your content rank higher on search engines, create effective ad copy, and get predictive metrics and insights into how your content will perform with your target audience.
In addition to helping with written content, AI tools like DALL-E can generate realistic images and art from a written description. This can save your advocacy team the cost of purchasing images for use in campaigns and communications. 
Optimize Advocacy Communications With AI Features
Another practical use for AI is to improve your emails to advocates and get them to take action. Since inboxes are flooded with hundreds of emails every day, it’s vital to use the subject lines and email text most likely to hold their attention. 
An advocacy platform like VoterVoice offers built-in AI that uses open and click rate best practices to prompt suggestions to your email copy to get the best results. This makes it easier to compose effective emails by highlighting best practices and offering suggestions as you write. You also get data-driven suggestions on subject line and message length, phrases that trigger spam filters, and the number, type, and placement of links. You can even maximize your impact by ensuring you send messages at peak open and action times with VoterVoice’s email scheduling feature.
And when it comes to making sure your emails’ spelling and grammar is on point, Grammarly is a useful tool. As you write, Grammarly supplies suggestions to fix your spelling, improve grammar, and write more concisely. 
AI as Your Personal Assistant at Work

In addition to helping directly with advocacy work, AI can help with a variety of other daily work tasks. From helping you draft a cover letter or resume to collating information on any topic, AI can act as a personal assistant to help you be more productive and effective in your job. One example is Reclaim, a smart calendar tool that helps you schedule your time. With Reclaim, you can auto-block time for tasks and routines, find the best time for one-on-one meetings, and add breaks and travel time around meetings. 
Another valuable use of AI is the notetaking tools widely available. Coffman uses Notes by Dubber to transcribe meetings as they’re happening so she can pay full attention to the conversation rather than worrying about taking notes. Then, she puts the transcription into ChatGPT and asks it to summarize the meeting in bullet points for her review. 
Pair AI With Your Advocacy Software Solution
The AI built into VoterVoice provides real-time suggestions to instantly improve your communications and campaign effectiveness. You can easily see which issues are firing up your advocates, then maximize email success using SmartCheck, an embedded tool that makes call-to-action recommendations based on the most up-to-date best practices. Plus, VoterVoice’s advocate ranking and issue tracking technology helps you understand which supporters are most active and which issues spur the most responses. 
Leverage cutting-edge technology and fuel your advocacy efforts with VoterVoice, the only AI-driven advocacy platform on the market. VoterVoice uses AI and data science for ease of information, benchmarks, and suggestions. Thanks to that injection of AI, VoterVoice makes it easier to take action with pre-populated contact details, understand your campaign successes (and opportunities for improvement) with peer benchmarking, and drive engagement with AI-powered suggestions.

YORK COUNTY, Pa. — Artificial intelligence is now becoming more sophisticated and it has basically eliminated the old red flags we used to tell you to watch out for when it comes to scams. 

Recently, a scammer tried to trick a FOX43 employee to take a new job, but she was able to spot the red flags before losing any money. 







FOX43 Finds Out how artificial intelligence is making it harder to tell if a job posting is real or fake. 

""The initial person who told me it was a scam was my mom because moms are good at that sort of thing,"" said Melanie Crisamore, who is talking about an email about a potential job. 

""I received an email from somebody named Nicholas Wolf who said he was part of the HR department at the Washington Post,"" she explained. 

Crisamore checked the email address from the sender and it seemed like the real thing. 

""I thought it was off because I never applied for this position,"" said Crisamore, but she knows companies hire recruiters, especially in today's job market. 

The job seemed like a sweet deal too: $55 dollars an hour, flexible hours, and remote work. After an initial conversation, she was told the VP of Human Resources would reach out to her. She started googling his name. 

""His LinkedIn pops up. He's worked at the Post for 17 years. At this point, this LinkedIn looks very legit. He's the VP of HR he has a picture, a person, and an address, everything to me looks legitimate,"" said Crisamore. 

When she took the call, the person kept pushing the idea that she would have to buy an iPad. That was the red flag. 

She said, ""Buy this iPad from your mobile carrier and we will put your bank information into it and give you a reimbursement. So that's their shtick."" 

At this point, she knew it was a scam. 

""They could have easily created a job description just for me enough that I thought to myself 'This is perfect!' and that's their thing,"" said Crisamore. 

Dr. Bruce Young, a cybersecurity expert at Harrisburg University, says artificial intelligence is the technology used in this scam, adding ""Artificial intelligence is able to go out and pull very specific information that's real from social media accounts.""

He says a scam like this may only take a few minutes to create, ""Somebody can go out, pull all this information together, put together a scam, or a campaign, and just target it out."" 

New ways to spot a fake email address 




Remember that email address that looked real? 

Crisamore learned a new way to double check that.  

It took several steps to eventually get the IP address of that email - which led her back to name cheap inc. which is a domain hosting site. 

""It's so scary to think that in our world you have to go through 5 or 6 steps to make sure that you are safe, but it can happen to anybody and it happens every single day,"" said Crisamore. 

Young says your best defense is finding a phone number yourself and picking up the phone to confirm everything you're being told is true.
