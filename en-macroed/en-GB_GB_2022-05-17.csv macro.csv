Artificial Intelligence (AI) job hiring is equal to or better than human hiring, but people react negatively towards it, according to a new study by The Inclusion Initiative (TII) at LSE.
Researchers have systematically reviewed the academic literature that considers the effectiveness of AI in the hiring process.  Their findings illustrate that AI hiring improves efficiency in hiring by being faster, increasing the fill-rate for open positions, and recommending candidates with a greater likelihood of being hired after an interview. Their review demonstrates that while AI had limited abilities in predicting employee outcomes after being hired, it was a substantial improvement over humans.  The authors also assessed whether AI could decrease biased decision-making and improve the diversity of selected candidates. Overall, AI hiring resulted in more diverse outcomes than human hiring.
Finally, the authors looked at how candidates and recruiters are reacting to AI hiring. Their analysis revealed overwhelmingly negative responses to AI hiring. They found that people trust AI hiring less than human hiring because they have privacy concerns, they find AI less personable, and they view organisations deploying AI hiring less attractive than those hiring through humans. 
Paris Will, Lead Corporate Research Advisor at TII, said: “Collectively, these findings lead to a gap between how AI is performing and how it is perceived. While AI hiring practices on average showed an improvement over human methods, people are reacting negatively to it. This is significant for the adoption of AI hiring methods and may be holding back better hiring techniques from being implemented.”
Dr Dario Krpan, Assistant Professor in Behavioural Science at LSE, said: “The media typically portrays AI hiring negatively and emphasises how AI can discriminate against candidates and disadvantage them. Our analysis, however, shows that even if AI is not perfect, it is fairer and more effective than human recruiters. Rather than focusing on AI in isolation, it is important to compare it to the alternative hiring practices to understand the value it brings to the recruitment process.”
Dr Grace Lordan, Associate Professor in Behavioural Science at LSE and Founding Director of TII, said: “There is evidence that current hiring processes are plagued by cronyism and bias.  It is time that humans hand over the hiring process to machines who do not have these tendencies. Biases embedded in algorithms can be mitigated somewhat with more care from those writing them, and compliance folk, who do not have skin in the hiring process can monitor the process to abate any concerns on fairness. Let’s progress AI in recruitment and workplace inclusivity at the same time. ”

Why you can trust Sky News


A new artificial intelligence sleep app has been developed that might be able to replace sleeping pills for insomnia sufferers.Sleepio uses an AI algorithm to provide individuals with tailored cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said it would save the NHS money as well as reduce prescriptions of medicines such as zolpidem and zopiclone, which can be dependency forming.Its economic analysis found healthcare costs were lower after one year of using Sleepio, mostly because of fewer GP appointments and sleeping pills prescribed.The app provides a digital six-week self-help programme involving a sleep test, weekly interactive CBT-I sessions and keeping a diary about sleeping patterns.





The sessions focus on identifying thoughts, feelings and behaviours that contribute to the symptoms of insomnia. Cognitive interventions aim to improve the way a person thinks about sleep and the behavioural interventions aim to promote a healthy sleep routine.Nice predicts up to 800,000 people could benefit from using Sleepio in England.

Are There a Lot of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Jobs Right Now?

Interested in a career in machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.)? Curious about the number of opportunities out there? A new breakdown shows that A.I. remains a highly specialized field with relatively few job openings—but that will almost certainly change in coming years.  
CompTIA’s monthly Tech Jobs Report reveals that states with the largest tech hubs—including California, Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts—lead when it comes to A.I.-related job postings. When you check out the below chart, note the actual numbers:   
  
It’s true that companies don’t need nearly as many machine-learning experts as, say, software developers or data scientists. Smaller organizations might not even have the budget to fill out an A.I. division. But CompTIA’s job numbers keep growing month after month, indicating a sustained appetite for A.I. talent, especially among larger companies with the money to actually afford researchers and specialists.  
How big could those numbers get? According to Emsi Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, the number of job postings requesting A.I. skills will increase 297 percent over the next two years. Over the past 12 months, some 142,346 job postings asked for artificial intelligence skills of some kind.   
Last year, O’Reilly estimated the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent annually. At tech giants such as Google and Apple, compensation can climb even higher—and that’s before you consider perks and benefits such as an ultra-flexible schedule.  
That’s quite a bite out of the budget for all but the largest companies. But A.I. and machine-learning tools are also becoming more ubiquitous and easier to use, allowing even employees without an A.I. or machine-learning background to build models, chatbots, and more. That will help satisfy at least some of the demand for A.I. and machine-learning services, while also expanding the career opportunities for those who have at least some grasp of how A.I. and machine learning actually work. Over the next decade, expect more and more technologist jobs to require at least some familiarity with A.I. and machine learning.

The adoption of artificial intelligence promises to bring large benefits to businesses. However, when something goes wrong, all fingers point to the executive who vouched for the technology. The risks are born by decision-makers themselves. Terence Tse and Sardor Karimov write that this contradiction can explain why AI adoption is moving at a glacial pace in the business world.

 
Companies have long been interested in exploring and using artificial intelligence (AI) to gain a competitive edge. There is no shortage of media outlets and academics stressing the business benefits that this technology can bring. Such blanket coverage naturally gives us the impression that many companies have already deployed AI internally left, right, and centre, and from top to bottom. Nothing, however, can be further from reality: the speed of adoption of AI solutions by companies has been surprisingly slow. We believe one reason is decision-making risk.
Decision-making: an important yet understudied risk
Many risks associated with adopting and using AI in business are widely known, as they have been extensively covered in both academic research and consulting reports. These risks range from bias and discriminatory risk to operational and IT risks, from business disruptions to job eliminations. However, a compelling case can be made that a less recognised risk exists, associated with decision-making. During our client interactions, we have observed that executives perceive various forms of risk when purchasing AI solutions. These risks are perceived as very real – and in some instances real enough to discourage them from adopting the AI technology altogether, despite the business advantages that it would bring. To illustrate decision-making risks, we have framed them as questions that the various stakeholders involved in the decision of buying the AI solution would be asking themselves:
Who among us is taking responsibility if something goes wrong?
It is not uncommon for large companies to benefit from in-house technology assessment teams whose roles in relation to AI involve determining the solution’s technical viability and its technological fit with the company’s needs. Interestingly, at the point of purchasing, what often matters most is not just how sound the technology is. Instead, it is who within the assessment team will be willing to stand up to vouch for the purchase. We have frequently observed that while as a team the members can reach consensus on the evaluation of a solution, as individuals few of them might be inclined to be ultimately responsible for the buy decision. The reason: if down the road something goes wrong and the technology does not work out as intended or expected, fingers would most likely be pointed at the person who “bought” the technology.
The complexity of AI projects makes it difficult to be certain of how the technology will behave once implemented and integrated into the business. Would the AI model work once live data are fed into the system? Would we be able to ensure data security over time? Would the IT infrastructure be capable of supporting the AI solution in the long run? Would the in-house engineering and data science teams be competent to keep the technology going and evolving on a long-term basis? There can be too many questions with too few confident answers.
Do you know what we are purchasing exactly?
In many companies, business leaders are the ones deciding whether to invest in an AI solution. Many of them are totally dependent on their own data science teams to evaluate and tackle the technological aspects of the solution. In turn, the data scientists have to understand the proposed solution inside-out. They need to know exactly and comprehensively what the company is buying.
Of course, vendors and suppliers can and should help by being completely transparent about their product offering, thereby making it easier for the data science team to understand the technology and its application to the business. Yet, this only partially solves the problem given that many perceived uncertainties remain for the data and leadership teams, including whether the vendor will be around in the long term to provide the necessary support, how scalable the solution purchased is, given the state and nature of the existing IT system, who is going to do what to maintain the technology going forward, etc. The result: it is often easier and safer for the data science teams – and hence the executive teams – to simply say no to the purchase and avoid all these risks.
Can we afford to make the wrong decision?
Many organisations, especially public ones, have no other choice than to get the technology right the first time. Any purchase decision must be turned into a future success. This is because failure to get the technology to deliver what was promised is likely be construed as managerial incompetence or worse, a misuse of public funds. Under public scrutiny, any outcome short of the anticipated results being fully met would potentially lead to reputational if not legal damages.
It must be added that this is not a quandary restricted to public entities. Financial services companies, for instance, can also face the same decision-making risk. Take the example of a bank that is contemplating using AI to cut the costs related to due diligence and meet ever-tightening compliance regulations. It can be imagined that if the AI technology does not work properly, the bank may end up facing costly financial consequences in the form of penalties, compensation, and remedial actions. In view of these, the stake may be too high even though the AI solution could be bringing substantial benefits.
Does the technology really work if we cannot figure it out ourselves?
Behavioural economists refer to “reference dependence” to mean that we assess the outcomes of an action by comparing it with an existing reference point or status quo. This phenomenon can sometimes be observed in the process clients follow to decide whether to buy an AI solution. Many non-tech organisations have employed very talented data and AI scientists, who are tasked with building models to achieve specific business goals.
Yet, in some cases, even with heavy investments of time, money and effort, these in-house scientists were not able to develop an AI model that meets the minimum usability standard or the model only gets an accuracy of 60 per cent when it needs to reach at least 80 per cent to be somewhat useful. Business executives would end up subscribing to the belief that it is simply impossible to get to 80 per cent. Even if a vendor was able to offer a model that demonstrates an 85 per cent accuracy, the scientists would take a dim view and discount such possibility. We should of course beware the vendors’ claims of their technological solutions – there are just too many AI firms making exaggerated claims about the performance of their technologies. Yet, this example illustrates just how powerful this perception can be, which leads to the decision not to buy a technology from an external vendor.
Can we justify the spending?
One of the most commonly used criteria to decide whether to invest in an AI solution is return on investment (ROI). Naturally, it is always better to generate as high a return as possible, given a fixed invested amount. So, whereas the cost savings generated from implementing the AI technology in a single department within a company may represent a good return, it would probably be much better to have another department make use of the same AI solution. From the decision-maker’s standpoint, it would be easier to justify the investment with a higher ROI.
In addition, having two sources of return is a safer bet just in case one of them does not deliver the expected financial outcome. The consequence is that executives sometimes only decide to buy an AI solution when two or more departments are willing to commit to its deployment. Investment in AI projects can therefore end up getting delayed, if not cancelled.
Decision-making risks present serious obstacles to the adoption and development of business AI solutions. All too often, our attention on the risks of AI is confined to those risks that relate to such aspects as the AI models themselves, the disruption to business as usual, cybersecurity, etc. By themselves, these risks are often sufficient to discourage companies from adopting AI solutions. However, as discussed here, the risks perceived by decision-makers can actually kill the potential AI projects altogether. This is understandable because, effectively, much of the upside gains of the purchase decision are accrued to the companies, whereas the decision-makers bear the downside themselves. No wonder the adoption of AI can be moving at a glacial pace.

 On May 12, 2022, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a “Technical Assistance” (TA) document addressing compliance with ADA requirements and agency policy when using AI and other software to hire and assess employees. The agency also published a short “Tips for Workers” summary of this guidance.  Neither of these documents has the force or effect of law, nor are they binding on employers; as the accompanying press release notes, this guidance is meant to be educational, “so that people with disabilities know their rights and employers can take action to avoid discrimination.”  Nevertheless, we see several take-aways regarding the Commission’s likely expectations and areas of focus when regulating the use of such tools in hiring or assessing employees:

Accessibility:  Employers should account for the fact that on-line/interactive tools may not be easily accessed or used by those with visual, auditory or other impairment.
Accommodation:  Barring undue hardship, employers should provide alternatives to the use or application of these tools if an individual’s disability renders the use of the tool more difficult or the accuracy of the tool’s assessment less reliable.
Accommodation, II:  Beyond providing reasonable accommodations in accessing/using these tools, employers should ensure that the tools assess an individual in the context of any reasonable accommodation they are likely to be given when performing their job.
ADA vs. Title VII:  The EEOC stresses that disability bias requires different design and testing criteria than does Title VII discrimination, such as access considerations and the potential for inadvertent disability-related inquiries or medical examinations.
Promising Practices:  Noting that employers are responsible for ADA-violating outcomes even when a software tool is created or used by a third-party vendor or agent, the Commission provides examples of so-called “Promising Practices” that employers can engage in to demonstrate good-faith efforts to meet ADA requirements.

Throughout, the TA document uses various illustrative examples of the tools the EEOC aims to regulate.  These range from résumé scanners and virtual assistants/chatbots to video-interviewing software and software that tests an individual’s personality, aptitude, skills, and “perceived ‘cultural fit.’”  Employers using any of these tools in their recruiting, hiring, and review of applicants and employees (which, by some estimates, is up to 83% of employers) should take careful note of the EEOC’s position as to where these tools may run afoul of the ADA. 
The TA document focuses broadly on three themes, specifically, how the use of algorithmic decision-making may violate the ADA with respect to: (1) reasonable accommodation for applicants and employees; (2) where AI decision-making tools may “screen out” individuals with disabilities; and (3) where an AI-based tool may violate ADA restrictions on disability-related inquiries.  Key take-aways from each are discussed below.
Reasonable Accommodation.  Foremost, the EEOC stresses that where an employer uses AI or other algorithmic decision-making software, it is required to provide reasonable accommodation to employees whose disability may make it difficult to be assessed by the tool, or where a disability may cause a lower result than it would for a non-disabled employee.  The EEOC takes the unequivocal position that where a disability might make a test more difficult to take or reduce the accuracy of an assessment, an employer must provide an alternative testing format or a more accurate assessment of the individual’s skills, unless doing so would entail “undue hardship” (defined as “significant difficulty or expense,” and generally a very high bar for an employer to meet under the ADA).  By way of example, the EEOC offers that an employer that uses a test requiring use of a keyboard or trackpad to measure employee knowledge may need to provide an accessible version of the test to an employee with limited manual dexterity (or, where it is not possible to provide an accessible version of the test, to provide an alternative testing format).  Similarly, in its discussion of “screening out” applicants (detailed below), the agency cites tools that measure speech patterns or facial recognition, and the potential negative effect these may have on individuals with certain disabilities.  In line with its prior example, presumably the agency would take the position that an employer must provide such individuals with alternative testing methods, where it can do so without undue hardship.  Finally, the guidance makes clear that where an employer uses a third party, such as a software vendor, to administer and score pre-employment tests, the failure of the vendor to provide a reasonable accommodation required by the ADA would likely result in an employer being liable, even if the employer was unaware that the applicant reported the need for an accommodation to the vendor.
“Screening Out.”  The bulk of the EEOC’s guidance focuses on the use of AI or other algorithmic tools that act to “screen out” individuals with disabilities, where such tool causes an individual to receive a lower score or assessment and the individual loses a job opportunity as a result.  The guidance provides several examples, including a chatbot that screens out applicants with gaps in their employment history, the use of which may violate the ADA if the employment gap was due to a disability or the need to undergo treatment (EEOC appears to ignore the fact that many if not most gaps in employment history are unlikely to be occasioned by a disability).  Perhaps a more common scenario is contemplated in the example of video software that analyzes speech patterns, and which may screen out individuals with speech impediments. 
The guidance also explains in some length that while the typical steps an employer using AI may take to ensure its use is non-discriminatory (such as testing a tool for disparate impact on the basis of race or sex, and modifying the tool to eliminate any such impact if found), these efforts may be insufficient to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability, insofar as “[e]ach disability is unique,” and the fact that some individuals with disabilities may fare well on the test does not mean that a particular individual with a disability may not be unlawfully screened out.  It goes on to state that while a decision-making tool may be “validated” (meaning that there is evidence that the tool accurately measures or predicts a trait or characteristic relevant to a specific job), such “validation” may not be sufficient with respect to individuals with disabilities. EEOC cites, for example, a visual “memory test,” which may be an accurate measure of memory for most individuals in the workforce, but may still unlawfully screen out an individual who has a good memory, but a visual impairment that reduces their ability to perform successfully on the test. 
The guidance also raises the concern that an algorithm may screen out an individual with a disability who can perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation because the algorithm is programmed to predict whether applicants under “typical working conditions” can do the job, and does not account for the possibility that an individual with a disability might be entitled to an accommodation such that they are not performing under “typical” working conditions.  By way of example, it offers an individual with PTSD, who might be rated poorly on a test that measures the ability to ignore workplace distractions without regard to the fact that such an individual may be entitled to an accommodation that would mitigate the effect of their disability (such as a quiet workstation or permission to use noise-cancelling headphones). 
Disability-Related Inquiries.  Finally, the TA notes that the use of AI tools may violate the ADA where software poses “disability-related inquiries,” meaning questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability (directly or indirectly).  While it is unlikely that most screening tools will include such questions (such as asking about an applicant’s workers’ compensation history), the EEOC warns that some seemingly innocuous questions may still run afoul of the ADA’s pre-offer limitation on medical inquiries, or act to “screen out” applicants or employees unlawfully.  The guidance notes that a personality test is not making a “disability-related inquiry” simply because it asks whether an individual is “described by friends as being generally optimistic,” even if being described in such a way may be related to a mental health diagnosis.  What the EEOC giveth with one hand, however, it appears to take away with the other:  as the agency explains, even if a question about “optimism” does not violate the ADA itself, if an individual with major depressive disorder answers negatively and loses an employment opportunity because of that answer, this may be an unlawful “screening out” if the negative answer is a result of the individual’s mental health diagnosis.  Similarly, the EEOC provides no guidance with respect to the “resume gap” it flags as a screening issue.  As mentioned above, the guidance notes that a chatbot or similar AI tool’s disqualifying an individual because of a gap in employment history may violate the ADA if the employment gap is due to a disability; left unclear is whether an invitation from the chatbot to an applicant to explain any gap in employment history is a prohibited “disability-related inquiry.”  There are many reasons an applicant may have taken time away from the workforce, such that a broad inquiry should not be seen as a disability-related inquiry; that said, the EEOC declined to provide any indication of its view on the question.
Practical Application.  The EEOC provides guidance and “promising practices” to employers seeking to use algorithmic tools, whether developed on their own, or provided by way of a third-party vendor, to minimize the risk of violating the ADA.  These include examining:

If the tool requires applicants or employees to engage a user interface, is the interface accessible to persons with disabilities?
Are materials presented in alternative formats?
Has the algorithm been assessed to determine whether it disadvantages individuals with disabilities?
Does the tool clearly indicate that reasonable accommodation, including alternative formats, are available to persons with disabilities?
Are there clear instructions for requesting accommodation?
Does the tool explain to applicants and employees what metrics the tool measures, how they are measured, and whether any disability might lower an assessment, such that a user with a disability would know to ask for a reasonable accommodation?

The EEOC’s guidance appears to raise more questions than it answers, in an area of law that is changing rapidly and already poses compliance challenges for employers.  Indeed, in many instances, it suggests that the ADA’s requirements with respect to accommodation and prohibition on unlawful screening may render the use of AI tools vastly more complicated and legally fraught. This comes at a time where the use of such tools is increasing exponentially. 
As the EEOC continues its AI initiative, we expect that the agency will provide further guidance to employers as to its view of how artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making interact with federal civil rights laws.  Moreover, as the composition of the Commission is likely to shift from a Republican majority to a Democratic majority no later than the end of the year, we expect the agency to ramp up its efforts to regulate in this space.  Littler’s Workplace Policy Institute will continue to keep readers apprised of relevant developments.

EEOC and the DOJ Issue Guidance for Employers Using AI Tools  to Assess Job Applicants and Employees


By Joseph O’Keefe, Edward Young & Dixie Morrison on May 17, 2022







Employers are more frequently relying on the use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tools to automate employment decision-making, such as software that can review resumes and “chatbots” that interview and screen job applicants. We have previously blogged about the legal risks attendant to the use of such technologies, including here and here.

On May 12, 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued long-awaited guidance on the use of such AI tools (the “Guidance”), examining how employers can seek to prevent AI-related disability discrimination. More specifically, the Guidance identifies a number of ways in which employment-related use of AI can, even unintentionally, violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), including if:

(i) “[t]he employer does not provide a ‘reasonable accommodation’ that is necessary for a job applicant or employee to be rated fairly and accurately by” the AI;
(ii) “[t]he employer relies on an algorithmic decision-making tool that intentionally or unintentionally ‘screens out’ an individual with a disability, even though that individual is able to do the job with a reasonable accommodation”; or
(iii) “[t]he employer adopts an [AI] tool for use with its job applicants or employees that violates the ADA’s restrictions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations.”

The Guidance further states that “[i]n many cases” employers are liable under the ADA for use of AI even if the tools are designed and administered by a separate vendor, noting that “employers may be held responsible for the actions of their agents . . . if the employer has given them authority to act on [its] behalf.”
The Guidance also identifies various best practices for employers, including:

Announcing generally that employees and applicants subject to an AI tool may request reasonable accommodations and providing instructions as to how to ask for accommodations.
Providing information about the AI tool, how it works, and what it is used for to the employees and applicants subjected to it. For example, an employer that uses keystroke-monitoring software may choose to disclose this software as part of new employees’ onboarding and explain that it is intended to measure employee productivity.
If the software was developed by a third party, asking the vendor whether: (i) the AI software was developed to accommodate people with disabilities, and if so, how; (ii) there are alternative formats available for disabled individuals; and (iii) the AI software asks questions likely to elicit medical or disability-related information.
If an employer is developing its own software, engaging experts to analyze the algorithm for potential biases at different steps of the development process, such as a psychologist if the tool is intended to test cognitive traits.
Only using AI tools that measure, directly, traits that are actually necessary for performing the job’s duties.
Additionally, it is always a best practice to train staff, especially supervisors and managers, how to recognize requests for reasonable accommodations and to respond promptly and effectively to those requests. If the AI tool is used by a third party on the employer’s behalf, that third party’s staff should also be trained to recognize requests for reasonable accommodation and forward them promptly to the employer.

Finally, also on May 12th, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) released its own guidance on AI tools’ potential for inadvertent disability discrimination in the employment context. The DOJ guidance is largely in accord with the EEOC Guidance.
Employers utilizing AI tools should carefully audit them to ensure that this technology is not creating discriminatory outcomes.  Likewise, employers must remain closely apprised of any new developments from the EEOC and local, state, and federal legislatures and agencies as the trend toward regulation continues.

The fast-rising sector was ranked ahead of construction, electronics, aerospace, robotics, design engineering and IT and cybersecurity in <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/2022/05/19/uae-jobs-engineering-and-tech-employers-struggling-to-find-right-candidates-to-fill-roles/"" target=""_blank"">a poll</a> of technology and engineering employees in the Emirates. The UAE government is driving forwards with ambitious plans to establish itself as a global AI hub. In 2017, the country appointed Omar Al Olama as its first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence and later adopted the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 to promote the growth of the cutting-edge technology. The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi was established in 2019 to develop the skills of top talent from across the world to lead workplaces of the future.  The survey, commissioned by the UK-based Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), and carried out by YouGov, polled 325 employers and employees in the UAE in December 2021 and January 2022. Julian Young, IET president, said artificial intelligence would most certainly continue to grow in prominence. “Alongside that, I would almost add everything to do with digitalisation. Everything in the future in a highly advanced technological community, will be about digitalisation and getting computers to do far more work for us,"" said Mr Young. “So if one has a skilled workforce in this field, one would be able to make a profitable company and a profitable organisation — and be a truly global player. “I'm not surprised to see that these are the skill sets that are required in three years' time, that these are the skill sets required in 10 years' time.  ""If you pick up artificial intelligence and then think about the type of courses that people are undertaking. Do we need courses in artificial intelligence? Yes, of course. But in the more traditional areas of engineering, mechanical, electrical, electronic aerospace, there needs to be a digital component."" He said all of the traditional industries need digital and software and computer science inputs to be able to make the best of their workforce.  Ian Mercer, head of international operations for the Institution of Engineering and Technology, said universities could use the findings to ensure their courses run parallel to the immediate and future demands of the economy. ""If I were an academician, then I would be thinking, 'if that's where the where the industry is going to go then the courses that we're going to offer to students probably need to be ramped up to be where the need is going to be',"" Mr Mercer said. ""At the end of the day, universities want jobs to be available for the people that they put through the system. ""If you look at the the ambitions of the UAE government, they want to become a tech hub of the world."" He said that in a post-oil and gas economy, technology may be one of the main workforce providers in the region.  The UAE is continuing to explore ways in which artificial intelligence can be used to boost business, make government departments more agile and efficient, and support health services. Artificial intelligence could soon be used to tailor <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/tags/uae/"">UAE</a> government employees’ working hours to their own personal productivity.

The course aimed to support UAE government and business sectors. Participants were required to complete 12 rigorous weeks of coursework, lectures and collaborative project work. Dr Jamal Al Kaabi, undersecretary at the Department of Health in Abu Dhabi, joined the programme after the Covid-19 pandemic made him realise the potential of artificial intelligence.

Google has launched Interview Warmup, a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to help people prepare for job interviews.
Part of the Grow with Google and Career Certification initiatives, it asks common interview questions and transcribes answers in real-time.
Originally intended to help Google Career Certificate learners prepare for job searching, Interview Warmup is now open to anyone.
Using voice-to-text or the keyboard, users can practice answering questions commonly asked in interviews, as well as job-specific ones picked by an expert in that field.

The tool then analyzes the answers and offers suggestions for improvement.

Currently, Interview Warmup has field-focused questions for Information Analytics, E-Commerce, IT Help, Undertaking Administration, UX Design or Basic.
Interview Warmup features three types of questions:








Background –  covering past training and experience
Situational – how specific situations were handled in the past or might be dealt with in the future
Technical – covering knowledge and skills, often testing how hypothetical problems would have been handled

Machine Learning Analyzes Responses and Provides Insights
As well as allowing for personal review, Google’s algorithm will employ machine learning to identify patterns and generate insights in a user’s answers. These include:

Job-related terms, which highlights words in answers that are relevant to the specific field
Most-used phrases, which points out phrases that have been used three or more times and provides alternatives.
Talking points uses Google’s artificial intelligence to uncover important points in replies, including skills, experience and lessons learned.

“Insights help you discover patterns in your answers,” Interview Warmup’s FAQ page said. “They don’t ‘grade’ your answer or tell you what part of your answer is right or wrong. Insights include the job-related terms you use, your most-used words, and the talking points you cover.”







Google does not save audio or the transcripts from interview sessions, though users can manually copy or download a transcript upon completion. This feature is currently only available in the U.S.
Since Interview Warmup was designed for Google Career Certificates learners, you may run into questions that are specific each of the certificates. However, the tool is available for everyone to use and has general questions applicable to many fields.
More than 70,000 people have earned a certificate and 75% of graduates report positive career impacts within six months of graduating, Google says.

He wanted to improve their lives now but also investigate the biological underpinning of aging so there could be better therapies or prevention strategies later.The project launched about a year ago, bringing what Walston calls a “big umbrella” of expertise from areas that include medical care, research, artificial intelligence and technology, engineering and business. Hopkins students have a chance to participate, as do some outside businesses and universities that have aging-related innovations to develop.Story continues below advertisementMuch of the research builds on decades of work at Hopkins and elsewhere. Some efforts now under the aging project banner already are in advanced stages. Devices and therapies ready to head to human trials can seek volunteers among a large pool of Hopkins geriatric patients.AdvertisementThere is urgency to the effort. More than 54 million Americans are age 65 or older, or about 16 percent of the population, federal statistics show. The number is expected to grow to nearly 22 percent by 2040, and the number of people 85 and older is projected to more than double.Most older people have at least one chronic condition and many have multiple conditions, which can include physical and cognitive impairments.Story continues below advertisementMany older people desire to “age in place,” with outside and even government support to stay at home, but that becomes less possible the more debilitated people become, Walston said.The aging project will apply for grant funding to pay for specific endeavors. Already, the Hopkins project is one of three academic institutions to be awarded $20 million from the National Institute on Aging that will go specifically for work in artificial intelligence and technology. Hopkins will dole out grants of up to $200,000 over five years, with some money going to outside universities and businesses that want to partner with Hopkins on devices and other innovations for older adults.AdvertisementThe National Institute on Aging sought academic centers that could generate high-tech ideas and get them developed, said Partha Bhattacharyya, a program director for the institute’s Division of Behavioral and Social Research and the official overseeing the grant program.Story continues below advertisementBhattacharyya said the NIA was looking to the centers to develop devices and therapies that would specifically help older adults live independently at home. That means, for example, pursuing technology to help with decision-making, coordinating care among doctors, or supporting cognitive therapy.“NIA takes a big-picture approach to research and development of new technologies, and we realize that technological solutions for use in homes and communities will require coordination across a wide range of disciplines and economic sectors,” he said.AdvertisementHopkins  had won nearly $16 million in other grants from the National Institutes of Health that focused on frailty and resiliency in aging, which included money to train new researchers in these areas.Story continues below advertisementThe project has named several Hopkins “scholars,” who are experts in their fields and were awarded $6 million in philanthropic grants. They are pursuing work in engineering, biology, turning basic science into actual therapies, and social justice. The program specifically called on scholars to pursue science that more deeply engages underserved older adults in Baltimore, as well as other parts of the country, and stated that any device or therapy stemming from the project should be financially and physically accessible.One effort already underway, for example, uses imaging technology to screen for cataracts without an eye expert, who can be in short supply in rural areas and underserved urban areas. Walston said equity and diversity will be an important element of the aging project.AdvertisementAnother arm of the project involves engineering students, who will work with faculty to develop new devices.Story continues below advertisementJoshua Blair, a master’s student in engineering, is gearing up to test a device to promote better sleep and memory retention, a common problem among older adults, particularly those with dementia or other cognitive impairments.The device uses sensors and stimulates part of the brain where experiences are turned into memories during deep sleep. The idea is that people wake better rested and sharper.“We’ll be able to see instantly if it’s working,” Blair said.Physician Peter Abadir, a Hopkins professor of medicine, had brought engineering students to patient clinics to see whether they might spark interest and ideas about ways to improve the lives of older adults. He found many jumped at the chance to develop something they could then test and turn into a real product.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe sleep device is expected to be tested this summer at a Hopkins sleep lab.“We want things to happen today, not in 20 years,” Abadir said. “But we make sure we don’t end up with something not practical or effective.”That’s where some of the university’s business expertise will come into play, Abadir said, assessing markets and turning ideas into products.The aging project also includes work in labs, where researchers assess basic biological processes for clues about why age-related conditions develop and what to do about them.On a recent day, Nick Milcik, a research specialist in the Hopkins geriatrics department, was handling some cortisol samples taken from the saliva of surgical patients over time. Researchers are hoping to see whether levels of the stress hormone eventually can help predict, for example, who will do well after surgery for knee replacement. That could tell doctors when they can go ahead and when they should delay or cancel procedures in patients unlikely to benefit.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementReyhan Westbrook, an instructor in geriatric medicine, is in the lab looking at the role of inflammation in aging and how to control when there is too much. He’s specifically focused on a sleep-regulating amino acid called tryptophan, which has anti-inflammatory effects and could contribute eventually to a therapy.Some inflammation is needed as a defense against infection and injury, Westbrook explained, “but it’s a problem when it’s overloaded. It gets amplified in older people.”Some of the research has moved beyond the lab. One of the project’s scholars is physician Alex Pantelyat, an assistant professor of neurology and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Music and Medicine. He’s not a music therapist, but uses rhythm and music as medicine, sometimes playing the violin for patients.AdvertisementPantelyat said there already is a lot of evidence about the benefits of music in promoting well-being and healing; he’s looking for novel ways of using those benefits.Among the efforts he’s pursuing under the aging project’s banner is a wearable device that uses music to improve mobility in those with Parkinson’s disease, a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement and is common in older people. Sufferers often have trouble walking and are at risk of falling.Falls are a major health issue, leading to disability as well as a significant number of deaths. One in 4 older adults falls each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That leads to tens of billions in medical spending on fatal and nonfatal injuries.Pantelyat is testing a product developed with a Maine-based company that uses rhythmic music to normalize someone’s gait. Human brains naturally respond to a beat, and the device will train people who listen to specific music and walk for 30 minutes a day. A sensor on the wearer’s shoes speeds up or slows down the rhythm with the walker’s speed.“If we can reduce falls, that’s really the holy grail,” he said. “There are no side effects to music-based interventions that embed rhythm. It would really be an important achievement.”Clinical trials are expected to begin this summer.
