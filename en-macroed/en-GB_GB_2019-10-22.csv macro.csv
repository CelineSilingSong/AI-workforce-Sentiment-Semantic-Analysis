Vodafone, Singapore Airlines and Intel are among other companies to have used similar systems.Polling commissioned by the Royal Society of Arts and released on Friday suggests 60% of the public are opposed to the use of automated decision-making in recruitment as well as in criminal justice.A citizens’ jury convened by the charity to explore AI concluded that the growing practice needed independent regulation and warned of public anger at “tech creep” unless citizens were given a greater role in designing systems.A parallel YouGov poll found that only 32% of people are aware AI is being used for decision-making in general. Awareness of automated decision-making in workplaces and the criminal justice system is even lower, at 14% and 9% respectively.Last week the United Nations special rapporteur Philip Alston said the world risked “stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia” in which artificial intelligence and other technologies were used to target, surveil and punish the poorest people.The Guardian reported on how the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions was accelerating the development of welfare robots for use in its flagship universal credit system, and how more than 100 councils were using predictive analytics and other artificial intelligence systems to aid interactions with their citizens.“New technologies are being adopted at a rapid pace, and regulators and the public are struggling to keep up,” said Asheem Singh, acting head of tech and society at the RSA.“An increasing amount of decision-making – in our public services, the job market and healthcare – is taking place via ever-more opaque processes. This is a source of anxiety for the general public. The measures we are proposing – such as a new watchdog to scrutinise decisions made by AI on behalf of the public – are crucial first steps in increasing clarity and accountability.”Last month in a report commissioned by the government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the Royal United Services Institute, a security thinktank, warned of “unfair discrimination” by data analytics and algorithms in policing. Meanwhile, the high court ruled that South Wales police’s use of facial recognition software was legal, despite a claim it breached data protection and equality laws.The RSA panel spent four days examining the spread of AI and automated decision-making into recruitment, healthcare and policing. Members of the panel voiced hopes that algorithms could make fairer, less-biased decisions on things such as pay rises or promotions, and that facial recognition programmes might be more objective than human police officers.But they raised questions about whether automated decision systems would reinforce an organisation’s existing profile, for example as traditionally white and male, and how the public would know the technology was being used.The jury was convened by the RSA in collaboration with DeepMind, a London-based AI firm owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Unilever is using software from a US-company, HireVue, in the UK and abroad, having first trialled it in 2017. HireVue has previously said the software scans the language that candidates use – for example, active or passive phrases, tone of voice and speed of delivery – as well as facial expressions such as furrowed brows, smiles and eye-widening.“It is helping to save 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1m in recruitment costs each year for us globally,” said a Unilever spokeswoman. “It is, however, just one of many tools we use for our graduate recruitment.”She said video interviews were optional and candidates were asked to allow or disallow automated decision-making being used to evaluate their video interview. They were sent information about how to prepare beforehand and could choose to speak to a “talent adviser” instead if they preferred.The system is now used across Unilever’s entire graduate recruitment programme, and HireVue claims it has resulted in a more ethnically and gender-diverse workforce.Unilever said that at the early stage in the recruitment process when HireVue was used, it was not compulsory for candidates to give their gender or ethnicity so it was not able to provide representative data.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Work & careersGraduate careersUnilevernewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

Sci-fi wants to portray artificial intelligence agents as thinking machines, while businesses today use artificial intelligence for more mundane tasks like filling out forms with robotic process automation or driving your car. When interacting with these artificial intelligence interfaces at our current level of AI technology, our human inclination is to treat them like vending machines, rather than to treat them like a person. Why? Because thinking of AI like a person (anthropomorphizing) leads to immediate disappointment. Today’s AI is very narrow, and so straying across the invisible line between what these systems can and can’t do leads to generic responses like “I don’t understand that” or “I can’t do that yet”. Although the technology is extremely cool, it just doesn’t think in the way that you or I think of as thinking.

Let’s look at how that “thinking” process works, and examine how there are different kinds of thinking going on inside AI systems. 

First, let me convince you that thinking is a real thing. Putting aside the whole conversation about consciousness, there is a pretty interesting philosophical argument that thinking is just computing inside your head. As it turns out, this has been investigated, and we can make some conclusions beyond just imagining what thinking might really be. In the book “Thinking Fast and Slow”, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman talks about the two systems in our brains that do thinking: A fast automated thinking system (System 1), and a slow more deliberative thinking system (System 2). Just like we have a left and right brain stuck in our one head, we also have these two types of thinking systems baked into our heads, talking to each other and forming the way we see the world. And so thinking is not as much about being right, as it is a couple of ways for making decisions. Today's AI systems learn to think fast and automatically (like System 1), but artificial intelligence as a science doesn’t yet have a good handle on how to do the thinking slow approach we get from System 2. Also, today’s AI systems make the same sorts of mistakes as System 1, where biases, shortcuts, and generalizations get baked into the “thinking” machine during learning. With today’s AI, there is no deliberative step by step thinking process going on. For example, How can AI “think”, when a major component of what thinking is all about isn’t ready for primetime?

Now that we have a bit more definition about what thinking is, how can we make more human-like artificial intelligence? Maybe representing feedback loops will get us to a sort of thinking machine like System 2. Well, as it turns out, we have not cracked that yet. AI models don’t contain common knowledge about the world. For example, I recall Yann Lecun, a “founding father” of modern AI,  gave an example sentence “He walked through the door” and pointed out that today’s AI models can’t decide what this means. There is a silly interpretation where we can conclude that a person crashed through a door like a superhero, smashing it to pieces. There is another interpretation where either the door was open or the person opens the door to walk through the doorway. Unfortunately, without common knowledge, you don’t really know which situation is more likely. This shows us that even “thinking fast” situations can go poorly using the tools we have available today.

We live in a world where fast thinking AI is the norm, and the models are slowly trained on huge amounts of data. The reason you can’t make a better search engine than Google is not the secrecy of their search algorithms. Rather, it is the fact that they have data you don’t have, from excellent web crawlers to cameras on cars driving around your neighborhood. Currently, the value in AI is the data, and the algorithms are mostly free and open source. Gathering masses of data is not necessarily enough to ensure a feature works. Massive efforts at human labor are often required. In the future, thinking algorithms that teach themselves may themselves represent most of the value in an AI system, but for now, you still need data to make an AI system, and the data is the most valuable part of the project. 
Thinking is not easily separated from the human condition, but we humans are also far from perfect. We may be smart on average, but as individuals, we are not built to do statistics. There's some evidence for the wisdom of crowds, but a crowd holding pitchforks and torches may change your mind. As it turns out, we are adapted through the generations to avoid being eaten by lions, rather than being adapted to be the best at calculus. We humans also have many biases and shortcuts built into our hardware. It’s well documented. For example, correlation is not causation, but we often get them mixed up. A colleague of mine has a funny story from her undergraduate math degree at a respected university, where the students would play a game called “stats chicken”, where they delay taking their statistics course until the fourth year, hoping every year that the requirement to take the course will be dropped from the program.

Given these many limitations on our human thinking, we are often puzzled by the conclusions reached but our machine counterparts. We “think” so differently from each other. When we see a really relevant movie or product recommendation, we feel impressed by this amazing recommendation magic trick, but don’t get to see the way the magic trick is performed. And one is tempted to conclude that machine-based thinking is better or cleaner than our messy biological process, because it is build on so much truth and mathematics. In many situations that’s true, but that truth hides a dark underlying secret. In many cases, it is not so clear why artificial intelligence works so well. The engineering got a bit ahead of the science, and we are playing with tools we don’t fully understand. We know they work, and we can test them, but we don’t have a good system for proving why things work. In fact, there are some accusations even in respected academic circles (slide 24, here) that the basic theory of artificial intelligence as a field of science is not yet rigerously defined. It is not just name-calling or jealousy being hurled by the mathematicians at the engineers. AI is a bunch of fields stuck together, and there really is a lack of connection in the field between how to make things work and proving why they work. And so the question about thinking and AI is also a question about knowledge. You can drive a car if you don’t know exactly how it works inside, and so maybe you can think, even if you don’t know why your thinking works.

Assuming we don’t have a concrete theory underlying the field of artificial intelligence, how can engineers get anything done? Well, there are very good ways to test and train AI models, which is good enough for today’s economy. There are many types of AI, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and more. Engineers don’t tend to ask questions like “is it thinking?”, and instead ask questions like “is it broken?” and “what is the test score?”

Supervised learning is a very popular type of artificial intelligence that makes fast predictions in some narrow domain. The state-of-the-art machinery for doing supervised learning on large datasets is feed-forward deep neural networks. This type of system does not really think. Instead, it learns to pick a label (for classification) or a number (for regression) based upon a set of observations. The way decisions are baked into neural networks during “learning” is not obvious without a strong validation step. More transparent AI models have been around for a long time, for example, in areas such as game theory for military planning. Explicit models like decision trees are a common approach to developing an interpretable AI system, where a set of rules is learned that defines your path from observation to prediction, like a choose your own adventure story where each piece of data follows a path from the beginning of the book to the conclusion. 
Another type of artificial intelligence called reinforcement learning involves learning the transition from one decision to the next based on what’s going on in the environment and what happened in the past. We know that without much better “environment” models of the world, these approaches are going to learn super slowly, to do even the most basic tasks. Systems that learn to solve problems this way rely heavily on accurate models of how the world works. When dealing with a problem related to humans, they need lots of data on what those humans do, or like, or think. For example, you can’t learn to generate amazing music without data on what humans like to listen to. In a game playing simulator an AI model can play against itself very quickly to get smart, but in human-related applications the slow pace of data collection gums up the speed of the project. And so in a broad sense, the AI field is still under construction at the same time as we are plugging lots of things into it.Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the company's ...

Regardless of the underlying technical machinery, when you interact with a trained artificial intelligence model in the vast majority of real-life applications today, the model is pre-trained and is not learning on the fly. This is done to improve the stability of your experience, but also hides the messiness of the underlying technology. The learning tends to happen is a safe space where things can be tested, and you experience only the predictions (also called inference) as a customer of the AI system.  
Despite the hype, AI models that think like we do are not coming around the corner to exceed humanity in every way. Truly thinking machines are definitely worthy of research, but they are not here just yet. Today, AI models and human analysts work side-by-side, where the analyst gives their opinion and is assisted by an AI model. It is useful to think about more general mathematical models like rainfall estimation and sovereign credit risk modeling to think about how mathematical models are carefully designed by humans, encoding huge amounts of careful and deliberative human thinking. The practice of building AI systems involves a lot of reading and creativity. It's not just coding away at the keyboard. 
I feel that AI software developers gradually build a sense for how to think about what an AI model is doing, and it ins’t “thinking”. I wanted to get some input from someone unrelated to me in the artificial intelligence field, to see if they feel the same way. Through the CEO of DTA, I set up a talk with Kurt Manninen about his work on an AI product called AstraLaunch. I asked Kurt a lot of technology questions, leading up to the question “Does the system think like people do?”
AstraLaunch is a pretty advanced product involving both supervised and unsupervised learning for matching technologies with company needs on a very technical basis. A complicated technology like this is a good area to be thinking about “thinking”. The system has an intake process that leads into a document collection stage, and then outputs a chart of sorted relevant documents and technologies. What I wanted to understand from Kurt is the way he thinks about what the matching technology. Is the system thinking when it maps the needs of NASA to the technology capabilities of companies? When diagnosing an incorrect prediction, does he think about the model as making a mistake, or is the origin of the mistake with the model maker and/or the data?
Kurt’s answer was really close to what I expected from my own experience. Technology like AstraLaunch involves humans and AI models working together to leverage the strength information processing approach. But, Kurt felt strongly, as I do, that bugs in AI models are the fault of people, not the model. An AI developer can see where the training wasn’t set up properly to understand language, or vocabulary, or where the dataset collection went wrong, etc.
Returning to the original question about artificial intelligence and thinking, I think we can solidly conclude that these systems don’t do thinking at all. If we only have fast and automatic (System 1) artificial intelligence to work with, can we think of an AI model as a gifted employee that thinks differently about the world? Well, no. AI will probably cheat if the training is unmanaged, and so it is a lazy, deceptive employee. It will use the easy way out to get the highest score on every test, even if the approach is silly or wrong. As we try and build a “System 2” that thinks more like us, we need to remember that thinking is not about passing a test. Instead consider this quote:The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that, when taken together, will make your life yours. And everything, everything, will be on it.

Rise of artificial intelligence means architects are ""doomed"" says Sebastian Errazuriz

Ninety per cent of architects will lose their jobs as artificial intelligence takes over the design process, according to designer Sebastian Errazuriz.



The New York-based designer made the controversial claim in a series of movies posted on his Instagram account.
""I think it's important that architects are warned as soon as possible that 90 per cent of their jobs are at risk,"" he said.
""It's almost impossible for you to compete"" with algorithms he said, adding: ""The thing is you're not that special.""


Born in Chile and raised in London, the artist and designer has courted controversy before, most recently by proposing to turn the fire-damaged Notre Dame cathedral in Paris into a rocket launchpad.
In his latest provocation, he has predicted the demise of the architecture profession at the hands of artificial intelligence.
In one Instagram post, Errazuriz posted an animation of a parametric tool developed by Wallgren Arkitekter and BOX Bygg that can generate plans automatically.
""This is today,"" Errazuriz wrote. ""Now try to imagine what 1,000 times this tech and 10 years will do to the industry.""
Wallgren Arkitekter and BOX Bygg have created a tool that generates adaptive plansMachine learning will soon allow software applications to synthesize vast amounts of architectural knowledge in seconds, he predicted. Architects by contrast take years acquiring the skills and experience needed to design buildings, leaving them unable to compete.
Errazuriz predicted that clients would soon be able to tell an app what kind of building they want, describe the budget, location, size and other preferences and get a range of options in seconds.
Soon a client would be able to ""move the distribution around, see it in augmented reality, check how my furniture will fit inside and approve the one that fits within my budget,"" he said. The app would then recommend a local contractor to build the project.


Only a very few architects will survive, he predicted. ""Architecture as an artistic practice is the only one that will survive and it will be developed by a tiny elite. We're talking five per cent, one per cent of architects max. The rest, they're done, they're doomed, they're gone. Finito. This is the end. Muerte.""

He advised architects to instead become software developers.
""Go into tech,"" he said. ""Understand that those same spatial capabilities can be used in more abstract ways to be able to coordinate giant systems and develop the systems of tomorrow, working with other types of engineers. Not the ones who will pour cement, but ones that will write code. Please make the switch now. Don't lose your job.""
Other provocations by Errazuriz include his 2017 project that vandalised augmented-reality artworks by Jeff Koons, and a range of shoes designed for a dozen of his former lovers.

Image: Oral-BToday, Oral-B launched its $220 Oral-B Genius X electric toothbrush, which Oral-B says uses AI to help you brush better. I never thought AI would come for my teeth.The toothbrush connects to an app on your phone over Bluetooth. When you start brushing, the app will show a timer of how long you’ve been brushing and guide you to where should brush next. That seems handy.At least you get a phone charger with your $220 toothbrush. Image: Oral-BOral-B says the toothbrush uses sensors to know when you’re applying too much pressure or not brushing long enough in a certain spot, and then sends data from the sensors to the app. The app takes this sensor data and uses the “Genius X AI algorithm” to tell you where you need to brush better and give you a rating on how well you brushed. I don’t know if I’d like that feature. It sounds like the toothbrush can brush-shame me.This isn’t Oral-B’s first connected toothbrush. The company released a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush in 2014, which could be “programmed with the help of a dentist.” It launched its Genius line of toothbrushes in 2016, but earlier models needed to use your smartphone’s camera to follow your brushing. That meant you had to plop your phone into a smartphone mount on your bathroom mirror every time you brushed, which I would imagine would get annoying after a while. RelatedBrushing your teeth with a smart toothbrush is unnecessarily arduous This new Bluetooth-connected toothbrush brings a dentist into your bathroomOh, so that's why I never wanted to see inside my mouthPhilips Sonicare and Kolibree have offered toothbrushes for years that seem to work similarly to the Genius X. Kolibree’s even turns brushing into a game. Onvi’s toothbrush will stream footage of the inside of your mouth. And they’re all pretty expensive — a decently affordable option is Kolibree’s, which is available at Best Buy for $149.99, though Kolibree also partnered with Colgate on an even cheaper toothbrush that’s $99.95.Some people have already gotten their hands on the Genius X, and reviews seem... positive? One reviewer at Forbes praised how well the app tracked the toothbrush’s position in his mouth. If you really want to go deep, the YouTube channel Electric Teeth has a 25-minute review of the toothbrush — and the reviewer really liked it.But I still think I’m going to use the toothbrush I get from the dentist every six months.Oral-B Genius X  / Available for $220Order on Best BuyVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

I never thought AI would come for my teeth.

The toothbrush connects to an app on your phone over Bluetooth. When you start brushing, the app will show a timer of how long you’ve been brushing and guide you to where should brush next. That seems handy.

[Image: At least you get a phone charger with your $220 toothbrush. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgeKHkaNLPnaKTEou2h70E_FzP0=/0x0:1200x1200/1200x1200/filters:focal(600x600:601x601)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19319289/oralB_G2_PDP_Secondary_Images_Mi.png]

Oral-B says the toothbrush uses sensors to know when you’re applying too much pressure or not brushing long enough in a certain spot, and then sends data from the sensors to the app. The app takes this sensor data and uses the “Genius X AI algorithm” to tell you where you need to brush better and give you a rating on how well you brushed. I don’t know if I’d like that feature. It sounds like the toothbrush can brush-shame me.

This isn’t Oral-B’s first connected toothbrush. The company released a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush in 2014, which could be “programmed with the help of a dentist.” It launched its Genius line of toothbrushes in 2016, but earlier models needed to use your smartphone’s camera to follow your brushing. That meant you had to plop your phone into a smartphone mount on your bathroom mirror every time you brushed, which I would imagine would get annoying after a while. 

Philips Sonicare and Kolibree have offered toothbrushes for years that seem to work similarly to the Genius X. Kolibree’s even turns brushing into a game. Onvi’s toothbrush will stream footage of the inside of your mouth. And they’re all pretty expensive — a decently affordable option is Kolibree’s, which is available at Best Buy for $149.99, though Kolibree also partnered with Colgate on an even cheaper toothbrush that’s $99.95.

Some people have already gotten their hands on the Genius X, and reviews seem... positive? One reviewer at Forbes praised how well the app tracked the toothbrush’s position in his mouth. If you really want to go deep, the YouTube channel Electric Teeth has a 25-minute review of the toothbrush — and the reviewer really liked it.

But I still think I’m going to use the toothbrush I get from the dentist every six months.

Will Artificial Intelligence Lead to Massive Job Losses?


Artificial intelligence is the next big thing in technology, there is no arguing that. In recent years, AI has become as much a buzzword as a perceived threat to job security.

 



Make no mistake, the “AI” available on devices like smartphones, smart homes, smart appliances and such is not true AI – it’s just a clever interface designed to understand certain voice commands and act accordingly. There are still some huge barriers that have to be overtaken until true AI is developed. Researchers around the world, from laboratories in major Western universities to Google’s AI research centre in Accra, opened this summer, are working on it as we speak, expecting to reach breakthroughs in the coming years.
AI and job loss
One of the things the media often links to AI is job loss. If you search Google for “job loss from AI”, you’ll see a variety of reports stating that artificial intelligence will kill millions of jobs in countries ranging from the United Kingdom and the United States to Russia and Hong Kong. Others liken the emergence of AI and robotics to the Industrial Revolution that introduced machines to manufacturing, saying that, although it will indeed lead to job loss in areas like manufacturing and retail, the emergence of AI will create new jobs as well. And one expert even goes as far as stating that AI will create more jobs than it destroys – a godsend for many advanced economies.


Re-skilling is vital
Kay Firth-Butterfield, head of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the World Economic Forum (WEF), believes that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it destroys – but re-skilling workforce will be vital for the transition.
She pointed out that around 29% of all current workplace tasks are performed by machines – and by 2025, this percentage will grow beyond 50%. This transformation will definitely affect the global labour force. The WEF expects AI and automation to displace about 75 million jobs on a global scale but at the same time, its specialists predict that almost twice as many – 133 million – new jobs will be created at the same time. Of course, this comes at a cost: based on a survey of companies across 12 industries and 20 economies, the WEF predicts that more than half of all the employees will need “significant re- and up-skilling” to harness the opportunities offered by what she calls “the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.
Change is always scary – and it’s especially so when it comes to AI, one of the favourite boogiemen of pop culture in our modern times. There are, in turn, enough specialists that say there’s nothing to worry about in the long run.

Look at the latest Gartner Hype Cycle for artificial intelligence, and you will see most AI elements are rounding the hype curve, and have yet to take their stomach-churning plunge into the trough of disillusionment. Talk to business leaders these days, and no one appears disappointed, yet.


A survey of more than 1,000 executives, released by RELX, confirms this is the golden age of AI. Adoption, for one, has continued to climb in the last year, jumping from 48 percent in 2018 to 72 percent in 2019.

Executives, to say the least, are pumped. No less than 93 percent say that emerging technologies, including AI and its close siblings of deep learning and machine learning, are helping their businesses be more competitive. Among these respondents, 57 percent report that AI tech is helping to improve and develop products, while 54 percent report these technologies are optimizing control and collaboration.

PROMOTED
AI may be an instrument for consolidating and reducing the workforce and operations, but it is having quite the opposite effect, the survey suggests. Close to two-thirds of executives, 64 percent, expanded the areas of their business touched by AI in the last year. A majority of businesses (56 percent) increased their data scientist and technologist headcount to support their AI tech expansion. Another 54 percent created new roles focused on emerging technology. With the increase in hiring, 54 percent of organizations were able to implement additional AI strategies.

Executives acknowledge and report they are actively pursuing education and training opportunities. A vast majority (93 percent) believe that companies should invest in the future artificial intelligence workforce through educational initiatives such as university partnerships. The majority (62 percent) of executives say their company offers AI training currently, up from 46 percent in 2018. Of those who say their company does not offer training, only about half, 53 percent, say they plan to do so in the future.

Brandon, 15 at the time, was receiving special education and social services, but Mr. Dai knew that by 22, his brother would phase out of the services and education provided by the state.“In the autism community, we call that ‘falling off the cliff,’” Mr. Dai said. “It’s what a lot of families are worried about.”Like so many entrepreneurs inspired by personal experience, Mr. Dai’s concern for his brother ultimately became the genesis for a new business. In 2018, Mr. Dai co-founded Daivergent, a start-up that is connecting tech companies with a pool of candidates on the autism spectrum. The company already has 20 corporate clients and has helped 75 people find work. There are about 1,100 candidates in the Daivergent pool.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe employment rate for individuals on the spectrum — even for those who have finished college — is extremely low. Statistics vary, but according to Anne Roux, a research scientist at the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University, about 50 percent of those on the autism spectrum have had at least one job since high school, but often that job is a low-paying part-time position. For those with greater impairment, she added, only 14 percent have employment in the community in which they live.It’s not that their abilities are lacking, said David Kearon, the director of adult services for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Anecdotally what we hear all the time is that autistic adults have the intellectual capability, but, because of their challenges with social skills, they’re often unemployed.” Brandon Dai, for example, “can focus on detail-oriented, complex, repetitive kinds of work that underlie much of the data structure that go into artificial intelligence and machine learning,” his brother said.ImageByran Dai, left, and his brother Brandon at the Grand Canyon. Credit... Mr. Dai, a data scientist, and a high school friend Rahul Mahida, a data engineer who has an autistic cousin, realized that there was no platform to pair those on the spectrum with companies looking for candidates who could work in data and artificial intelligence. The corporate name, Daivergent, is essentially a portmanteau combining Mr. Dai’s name with neurodiversity, the term describing those individuals who have a range of neurological conditions including autism. Most of the general population is considered to be neurotypical.Leon Campbell, 24, who is autistic, was employee No. 1 at the new company. With a computer science degree from Hunter College in New York, Mr. Campbell had technical skills but had never had a job before Daivergent hired him. He initially worked on labeling, but now focuses on quality assurance, overseeing the projects Daivergent’s remote workers complete. “I am one of the last lines of defense,” he said, before the work is sent to the corporate client.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe worried that his new job would be stressful, but because Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida were so accommodating, “those concerns quickly faded away on the first week of the job.”Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida have taken a multifaceted approach to building their company because both the candidates and the tech companies have needs that can be complex.At the outset, Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida reached out to organizations like Autism Speaks and AHRC New York City to find suitable candidates, whose skills are assessed through Daivergent’s readiness platform, which incorporates work experience, technology skills and socialization. Teaching the requisite skills is accomplished through video-based education. Mr. Mahida said the candidates often excel at the ability to vet thousands of images. “They do much better on these assessments than Byran and I did,” he said.The most difficult part may be improving social and communication skills. Daivergent, Mr. Dai said, builds “shared interest groups through community forum and instant messaging tools, and also creates virtual job clubs where folks on the spectrum can swap tips and review resumes. It creates a community by us, and for us.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageMr. Dai and Rahul Mahida, right, co-founded Daivergant. The company already has 20 corporate clients and has helped 75 people on the autism spectrum find work. There are about 1,100 candidates in the Daivergent pool.Credit...Calla Kessler/The New York TimesAnd Daivergent is working with the software giant SAP, which is a leader in employing those on the spectrum through its Autism at Work initiative, which started in 2013.Judith Williams, SAP’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said that Daivergent would be offered for customers who purchased Fieldglass, SAP’s product for managing contingent workers, so that those customers could have access to Daivergent’s work force. In addition, Ms. Williams said, SAP’s managers would have direct access to Daivergent’s work force as well.Daivergent is also working with colleges to help autistic students gain employment. At Drexel, for example, the company is working with the university’s autism support program, to help those students obtain work to fulfill academic requirements, since the school is a co-op system that requires students to complete several internships before graduating. It’s often difficult for autistic students to obtain internships, but Daivergent is helping to bridge the gap. “While I just started working with them in April,” said Amy Edwards, who runs the autism support program, “they’ve been awesome.”Daivergent is not the only company helping autistic workers find employment. Brenda Weitzberg was one of the first entrepreneurs to tackle this issue. More than a decade ago, motivated by her oldest son, she said she read “one sentence about a Danish company that hired those on the spectrum to do software testing.” With neither a technology nor an entrepreneurial background, she shopped her idea with professors at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and asked if there were a group of students interested in an “employment autism project.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageAspiritech has about 130 employees, neurodiverse as well as neurotypical.Credit...John Zich/AspiritechImageFidget items in one of Aspiritech’s four staff sensory break rooms.Credit...John Zich/AspiritechImageAn Aspiritech analyst taking a sensory break in Highland ParkCredit...John Zich/AspiritechWhile the students’ proposal didn’t pan out, Ms. Weitzberg and her husband, Moshe, nevertheless persevered, bootstrapping their fledgling company. They parlayed their first client into others, and now the company, Aspiritech, has about 130 employees, neurodiverse as well as neurotypical. Based in Highland Park, Ill., wages start at $15 per hour, about twice the state’s $8.25 minimum.While Aspiritech doesn’t have specific training, the company has hired support staff to work with its employees. And the employees have formed clubs for after-work activity, increasing their social interactions. While autism inspired the company, Ms. Weitzberg said her company’s focus was on the work. “Autism gets us a foot in the door, since many people have a child or family member with autism, but it doesn’t keep us there. There has to be quality.”Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida know this as well and, as a result, are deliberate in scaling their efforts. That is difficult because there is demand from the tech community, eager for capable employees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTUltimately, those in the field hope this will be the beginning of expanded employment opportunities for the neurodiverse community. As Ms. Williams of SAP said, “One really important thing we have learned — we had an idea of the types of jobs we thought people with autism would be suited for — like jobs where there is a repetitive attention to detail. But that’s stereotypical. We found that those on the spectrum can also work in H.R. and customer experience as well as engineering.”ImageA quality assurance lead at Aspiritech  training two new applicants.Credit...John Zich/AspiritechIn the meantime, Daivergent, like other start-ups, is charting its course securing funding and determining the best way to meet the needs of the community and its corporate clients. Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida have participated in the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator and an SAP accelerator as well earlier this year. And they have raised $1 million in funding to date.Mr. Dai hopes that his brother will eventually be suitable for the platform. “He’s well-versed in his iPad and grew up with computers, so I always thought of his potentially working somewhere in tech, likely more in a support role.”Growing the company has been a learning process for Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida. “We don’t say tech will solve everything. We have to understand the nuance first,” Mr. Dai said. “There are people who have spent decades on accessibility and we won’t be the people who will say we know just what to do.”For companies — whether in tech or other industries — who want to add staff from the neurodiverse community, Mr. Campbell, Daivergent’s employee No. 1, has some advice: “I want an employer to see me as a person. Don’t hire because you want to look better for your investors.”A version of this article appears in print on Nov. 22, 2019, Section B, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Connecting People on the Spectrum With Jobs in Tech.

Every business needs to apply it in their website design, app development, and marketing process. To put it in other words, every business needs to work with AI developers. For example, developers of game apps and gaming consoles are very vast in artificial intelligence. In fact, many of them are AI developers. This is because artificial intelligence makes video games interesting. Whatever video game you play, you’ll get a response from the system and it will be tailored by your input with no human intervention.This article actually discusses the benefits that make both AI developers and AI technology very important. After going through it, you’ll have an idea of what you’re missing if you’re yet to exploit the technology.1. Voice-based search is on the riseVoice command started with Alexa and many people latched on to the convenience of issuing voice commands instead of having to type them. It takes artificial intelligence for any system to be able to process voice commands.Now, a lot of people have already started carrying out online searches with voice commands. Don’t you also prefer to issue voice command instead of typing it out? In fact, it has been reported that half of the online searches will be voice-based by the end of 2020. It is definitely because of the convenience. So, it is necessary to hire AI developers to optimize your website for voice-based searches.2. 24/7 availabilityWebsites and mobile apps are available 24/7 but support staff usually aren’t available 24/7. Any customer care team that is available 24 hours a day must be running shifts. Unfortunately, customers are now too impatient and they want instant response. They no longer want to wait for 24 hours.Artificial intelligence provides the solution to the problem — AI chatbots. Many websites are manned by chatbots that will always respond instantly to customers’ queries anytime every time. You must have observed that live chats are available on so many websites now. Most of them are run by chatbots. Using chatbots will save you the money you’ll pay for hiring people to man your website 24 hours a day. So, AI saves costs and increases your rate of sales conversion.3. Improved user experienceWhen implemented properly, visitors on your website can enjoy great user experience and that will make them come back for more. One way to achieve that is to predict what they’re searching for. When they’re typing the name of any product, your website should present them with the options of the products whose names match those letters so they will just have to choose.Reducing the number of typing visitors do on your website helps to improve their experience tremendously. Another way to achieve this is to present them with their last order. Based on their ordering patterns, bots can present them with their last order so they don’t have to repeat the process all over again. Imagine someone who orders more than 10 items at the same time. It will be a lot of relief if she is presented with her exact order so she won’t have to select the items one after the other again.Now let’s talk about the advantages of AI in other areas.4. Reduced errorsAI robots work on codes and lack emotions. So, they cannot be distracted by anything. They perform their tasks with 99.9% accuracy that humans cannot possibly match. Whether it is data analysis or simple computations, robots will carry it out with reliable accuracy.This is why some companies employ them for data analysis. You understand that important business decisions are based on data analysis figures and it can be catastrophic if the figures are not accurate. For the sake of accuracy, employ AI for your business reports and data analyses.5. Increased speedThis is self-explanatory on its own. Robots, machines, and computers work with astonishing speed. So speed is one of the reasons to exploit artificial intelligence technology. Take Microsoft Excel for instance. To sum up hundreds of figures, you only need to highlight the figures and click on the auto-sum button and the answer appears in a flash. That is exactly how the robots work with speed. So, if you appreciate the speed of computations, think of artificial intelligence.6. Dangerous tasksSome tasks cannot be carried out by humans because of the danger involved. However, these tasks need to be carried out because of the importance of their results. Such tasks are now carried out by robots. For example, some explorations are dangerous because of the gases that may be given off by the act. It is better to design robots to carry out such tasks.These days, robots are designed to explore space, take snapshots and send them over to earth. Some robots can even fly a space shuttle on their own. They were designed specifically for the job. It is all based on artificial intelligence.7. The proliferation of medical appsThe artificial intelligence has yielded the emergence of numerous medical apps. These apps help with mild diagnoses and prescriptions. They only need to input the symptoms and their medical history on the apps. The ailment will be diagnosed and drugs will be prescribed.These apps rely on large volumes of medical data to be able to diagnose and prescribed drugs accurately.To sum it up, artificial intelligence helps with voice commands, 24/7 availability, improved user experience, reduced error, increased speed, dangerous tasks, medical diagnoses and prescriptions, and in many other areas.Author Bio:Melissa Crooks is Content Writer who writes for Hyperlink InfoSystem, a mobile app development company in New York, USA and India that holds the best team of skilled and expert app developers.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to reshape practically every sector of the economy over the next two decades, from healthcare through to agriculture, mining and transport. It has the potential to automate repetitive or dangerous tasks, increase productivity and inform the development of new products and services which change the way that we work and live.
  









Australia is world-renowned for the quality and volume of AI and computer science research we create, and as the national science agency, CSIRO’s work in artificial intelligence is 89% more cited than the global average, according to a Normalised Citation Impact, InCites (Web of Science Articles & Reviews, 2014-2018).
At CSIRO, AI is currently employed across multiple domains, from agriculture and climate science to energy distribution and precision health care. There are many fields of science within AI including: machine learning, natural language programming, deep learning (neural networks), computer vision and robotics.
At D61+ LIVE 2019, we gathered leaders throughout CSIRO to explain how they are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate their science for social and environmental good.
How artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can advance the tools that we have
The combination of historical tools and cutting edge technology has created a plethora of new opportunities, said Dr Simon Barry, Acting Director of CSIRO’s Data61. With the availability of vast quantities of data and the high-powered tools required to understand it, new pathways to accelerate and optimise every aspect of the future have been created.
Using the example of computer processing, Data61’s interim Director explained that while deep learning was widely understood in the ‘80s and ‘90s, it wasn’t until the late 2000s that the methodology was applied to Graphical Processing Units. This collaboration resulted in more efficient training of Deep Learning Models used to perform simultaneous computer tasks.
The CSIRO has applied this concept to agriculture, allowing farmers to make more efficient and sustainable cultivation choices, explained Dr Jen Taylor, Research Group Leader of CSIRO’s Agriculture and Food. “There’s a 70% uptake of unmanned tractors and similar machines rolling around farms making decisions about water, pests and pathogens without a farmer walking up and down the fields.”
“It’s so much more precise and efficient, which is fantastic for the whole system.”
  









Optimising Australia’s energy network using AI and ML
CSIRO’s Energy Business Unit is using AI and ML to model Australia’s extensive energy supply network via a digital simulation, known as a Digital Twin, to improve efficiency, disaster management, and emerging power sources. This process will also help manage over investment and energy distribution in the grid of the future, said CSIRO’s Energy Business Unit Director, Dr Tim Finnigan. He added that AI and ML is crucial to developing an efficient and adaptable system that can be used up until 2040 and beyond.
When it was originally created, Australia’s energy grid was designed to manage only a small number of energy sources, such as coal and gas, however, now there are millions of different derivations, explained Dr Finnigan. A Digital Twin simulation provides insights and results from various methods that could be used to update the network, with automatic programming able to determine the most effective solution.
""We’ll avoid over investment in that, and that could be in the billions in savings. And that’s just one benefit.”
“In the situation where you have faults in the system or environmental impacts, for example bushfires, which with climate change we are expecting more and more intense bushfires with higher peak temperatures, how will a grid system in those environmental conditions operate in the future, and how can it potentially repair itself if it is integrated with some machine learning?
If a fault goes out in a certain part of the grid, can machine learning help the system repair itself or reroute power so that we don’t get a South Australia state-wide blackout? We can actually have a smart enough and well-trained grid that could figure out other pathways for power to flow.” 
Building solid and dependable models for climate analysis
Machine learning is being used by CSIRO’s Climate Science Forecasting team to help better understand complex environmental patterns and emerging weather trends such as natural disasters like floods and droughts by mining insightful historical data, says team leader Dr Terry O’Kane. Being able to find a common underlying driver in similar climate patterns by using this cutting-edge technology to organise immense amounts of statistical information could help predict the future of Australia’s atmospheric conditions.
""We actually don’t really know the dynamics that drive the major climate teleconnection modes,” explained Dr O’Kane, “so if you think of the El Nino southern oscillation, which drives a lot of the large scale weather in Australia, and it’s relation to something like the Indonesia Dipole, the cause and relationships between these large teleconnections (climate anomalies being related to each other at large distances), we only really know them imperially, and machine learning offers a tool for a purely data-driven approach to pull out and mathematically underpin those relations.” 
This approach has been applied to analyse drought prediction, a multi-faceted challenge with a plethora of variables that must be considered when forecasting the future. ""The work we’ve been doing is to try and find, in a mechanistic sense, what other common underlying drivers by going back in time.”
""We have a better understanding of what we don’t know, which is a lot.” 
Using AI to guide farmers future plans
As the Research Leader of CSIRO’s Agriculture and Food department, Dr Jen Taylor appreciates how essential climate prediction is for Australia’s agriculture and aquaculture industries. Dr Taylor explained how a single gram of soil can contain billions of microbes that can, or cannot help a plant grow, machine learning and artificial intelligence provides a system that can interpret a complex growth system to ensure future crops set up for success. 
  









“Farmers have been working hard to get efficient practises for a while now, but there’s a lot more urgency in the system. Everything needs to get a lot more efficient, more sustainable. So farmers need to make some fairly complex decisions about how they use their water, whether they need to worry about pests or pathogens and that sort of stuff, and there are systems around that do that.”
Using the example of state-of-the-art wearable and hands-free sensors Data61 developed for prawn harvesters, Dr Taylor explained that AI and machine learning is helping the nation’s farmers making instantaneous decisions about best practise system management and preventing waste. “There’s a booth outside that’s been talking about how they help aquaculture farmers monitor the water quality in their pond.”
“We wouldn’t have been able to do that without sensors and a way to interpret that data that’s coming in.”
Understanding genetic diseases
Being able to extrapolate data when there are 3 billion letters in the genome was once a near-impossible task before machine learning, says Dr Denis Bauer, CSIRO’s principal research scientist in transformational bioinformatics.
  









With a research pool of 22,000 individuals with motor neurone disease, each who have 2 million genetic differences between them, equalling roughly 80 million features that need analysing, the resulting matrix included 1.7 trillion statistical examples. A dataset of this size could not be analysed fully if using traditional methodology, explains Dr Bauer.
“Using machine learning, particularly when we’re using it as a random forest, that builds individual decision trees that look at subsets of the data, and then ultimately come up with a model that captures the whole 3 billion letters for the genome and make that inference.”
In partnership with the Dementia Team Grant led by Prof Ian Blair of Macquarie University, CSIRO’s Transformational Bioinformatics used machine learning to analyse the full genome simultaneously, identifying the genomic location that jointly contributes to the disease rather than being limited to detecting only the strong individually contributing genes.
This approach resulted in the effective analysis of genomic data from sizeable sample pools, boosting the statistical power needed for disease gene classification.
“Now, for the first time, we’ve built our own  machine learning model that deals with this ultra-high dimensional data that others have not dealt with before. For example, the Googles and the Yahoos of the world typically deal with with tens of thousands of features.”
“It’s nice to know that a little Australian team is at the forefront of big data analysis.”

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Decades of technological advances have led to a revolution in ultrasound machines that has given rise to modern devices that weigh less than a pound and can display images on smartphones. But they still require an expert to make sense of the resulting images.
“It’s not as easy as it looks,” said Richard Fabian, CEO of Fujifilm SonoSite, a pioneer of ultrasound technologies. “A slight movement of your hand means all the difference in the world.”
That’s why SonoSite is focused on a future in which artificial intelligence helps healthcare workers to make sense of ultrasounds in real-time. The idea is that computers can be trained to identify and label critical pieces of a medical image to help clinicians get answers without the need for specially-trained radiologists.
“Using AI you can really quickly interpret what’s going on. And the focus is on accuracy, it’s on confidence, and it’s on expanding ultrasound users,” Fabian said during a talk at Life Science Washington’s annual summit in Bellevue, Wash. on Friday.
Bothell, Wash.-based SonoSite recently partnered with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle on an effort to train AI to interpret ultrasound images. To train the models, SonoSite is using large quantities of clinical data that it gathered with the help of Partners HealthCare, a hospital in Boston.
Artificial intelligence has shown promise in interpreting medical imaging to diagnose diseases like early-stage lung cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. The advancements have drawn tech leaders including Google and Microsoft, who hope their AI and cloud capabilities can one day be an essential element of healthcare diagnostics.

SonoSite was initially launched with the idea of creating portable ultrasounds for the military. Its lightweight units are widely used by healthcare teams in both low-resource settings and emergency rooms.
Ultrasound imaging is significantly more affordable and portable than X-ray imaging, CT scans or PET scans, without the risk of radiation exposure. While the images it provides are not as clear, researchers think deep learning can make up some of that difference.
AI2 researchers are in the process of training deep learning models on ultrasound images in which the veins and arteries have been labeled by sonographers. One application of the AI-powered ultrasound would be to help clinicians find veins much faster and more accurately.
Fabian also gave the example of AI models labeling things such as organs and fluid build-ups inside the body, which could inform care decisions without the need for specialists. He thinks that future ultrasounds could deliver medical insights without ever displaying an image.
“If ultrasound becomes cheap enough, it could become a patch [that gives] you the information that you need,” said Fabian.

Artificial Intelligence System Gives Fashion Advice












A new AI system developed by University of Texas at Austin researchers can offer fashion advice. 









AUSTIN, Texas — People turn to many different sources for clothing style advice, from magazines to best friends to Instagram. Soon, though, you may be able to ask your smartphone.
A University of Texas at Austin computer science team, in partnership with researchers from Cornell Tech, Georgia Tech and Facebook AI Research, has developed an artificial intelligence system that can look at a photo of an outfit and suggest helpful tips to make it more fashionable. Suggestions may include tweaks such as selecting a sleeveless top or a longer jacket.
“We thought of it like a friend giving you feedback,” said Kristen Grauman, a professor of computer science whose previous research has largely focused on visual recognition for artificial intelligence. “It’s also motivated by a practical idea: that we can work with a given outfit to make small changes so it’s just a bit better.”
The tool, named Fashion++, uses visual recognition systems to analyze the color, pattern, texture and shape of garments in an image. It considers where edits will have the most impact. It then offers several alternative outfits to the user.
Fashion++ was trained using more than 10,000 images of outfits shared publicly on online sites for fashion enthusiasts. Finding images of fashionable outfits was easy, said graduate student Kimberly Hsiao. Finding unfashionable images proved challenging. So, she came up with a workaround. She mixed images of fashionable outfits to create less-fashionable examples and trained the system on what not to wear.
“As fashion styles evolve, the AI can continue to learn by giving it new images, which are abundant on the internet,” Hsiao said.
Grauman and Hsiao will present their approach at next week’s International Conference on Computer Vision in Seoul, South Korea.
Like all AI systems, bias can creep in through the data sets for Fashion++. The researchers pointed out that vintage looks are harder to recognize as stylish because training images came from the internet, which has been in wide use only since the 1990s. Additionally, because the users submitting images were mostly from North America, styles from other parts of the world don’t show up as much. Another challenge is that many images of fashionable clothes appear on models, but bodies come in many sizes and shapes, affecting fashion choices. Next up, Grauman and Hsiao are working toward letting the AI learn what flatters different body shapes so its recommendations can be more tailored.
“We are examining the interaction between how a person’s body is shaped and how the clothing would suit them. We’re excited to broaden the applicability to people of all body sizes and shapes by doing this research,” Grauman said.

The impact of artificial intelligence on education, financial instruments, criminal justice and healthcare, are just a few of the topics that will be addressed at this year’s Gordon Gamm Comparative Law and Justice Symposium on Nov. 8.
Leading this year’s Symposium, titled The Implications of Artificial Intelligence for a Just Society,  is Tulane Law Prof. Kristin Johnson, a national leader in the legal issues surrounding artificial intelligence and the law school’s 2019 Gordon Gamm Faculty Scholar. The event will be held in the John Giffen Weinmann Hall, 6329 Freret Street, from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Symposium will bring experts in this burgeoning area of law to Tulane, to discuss the broad societal implications of AI. The rise of artificial intelligence introduces efficiencies and new opportunities in finance, employment, education, criminal law enforcement risk assessments, national security and the automation of various professions, including the development of smart contracts and the automation of various skills associated with the practice of law.
Recursive learning and neural networks enable machine learning algorithms to adapt beyond simple instructions and independently assess data in decision-making processes. Early evidence indicates, however, that learning algorithms may operate in a manner that leads to unfair, biased or unethical and in some cases, discriminatory outcomes.
Among the topics discussed by panels are the impact of AI on finance and employment, including the ethical and discriminatory risks; the displacement of humans in law enforcement, education, digital gaming and law; impact on ethics; and gender bias.
Distinguished panelists include:

Matthew Bruckner, Associate Professor of Law, Howard University Law School ;
Stephen Rea Campbell, Research Assistant Professor at Colorado School of Mines and University of California Irvine, Department of Anthropology;
Wendy Greene, Frances Lewis Scholar-in-Residence, Washington & Lee University Law School;
Dr. Nicholas Mattei, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Tulane;
Suzanne T. Mestayer, Managing Principal, ThirtyNorth Investments, LLC;
Xuan-Thao Nguyen, Gerald L. Bepko Chair in Law, Director, Center for IP & Innovation, Indiana University McKinney School of Law;
Najarian Peters, Faculty Associate, Berkman Klein Center For Internet & Society, Harvard University, and Institute for Privacy Protection, Seton Hall University Law School.

A full program can be found here.
The event is free and open to the public, but registration is required.
 It is available for 2.5 hours of Continuing Education Credits (CLE) in Texas, Alabama and Louisiana.
The Gamm Comparative Law and Justice Symposium is made possible through the generosity of Grace and Gordon Gamm (L ’70) and the Gordon J. Gamm Comparative Law Endowed Fund.  The Fund supports the appointment each year of a Gordon Gamm Faculty Scholar, an early-career Tulane Law professor, and provides the resources to expand their research and engagement with other scholars and the broader public.
Johnson, the 2019 Gamm Scholar, has established herself as one of the first and most influential legal scholars to study the ways in which the algorithms used in artificial intelligence can unintentionally entrench racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination by embodying and reinforcing implicit biases. She testified on these issues before a Congressional committee this summer. 
By sponsoring the event, Gamm continues to support the law school with his passion for comparative law. Past Gamm Faculty Scholars include Profs. Saru Matambanadzo (equality law), Sally Richardson (comparative law), Ann Lipton (corporate law), and Robert Westley (racial reconciliation).
