When Oxford University Professor Nick Bostrom’s New York Times best-seller, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies was first published in 2014, it struck a nerve at the heart of this debate with its focus on all the things that could go wrong. However, in my recent conversation with Bostrom, he also acknowledged there’s an enormous upside to artificial intelligence technology.

You can see the full video of our conversation here:

PROMOTED
Since the writing of Bostrom's book in 2014, progress has been very rapid in artificial intelligence and machine and deep learning. Artificial intelligence is in the public discourse, and most governments have some sort of strategy or road map to address AI. In his book, he talked about AI being a little bit like children playing with a bomb that could go off at any time.

Bostrom explained, ""There's a mismatch between our level of maturity in terms of our wisdom, our ability to cooperate as a species on the one hand and on the other hand our instrumental ability to use technology to make big changes in the world. It seems like we've grown stronger faster than we've grown wiser.""

There are all kinds of exciting AI tools and applications that are beginning to affect the economy in many ways. These shouldn’t be overshadowed by the overhype on the hypothetical future point where you get AIs with the same general learning and planning abilities that humans have as well as superintelligent machines. These are two different contexts that require attention.

Today, the more imminent threat isn't from a superintelligence, but the useful—yet potentially dangerous—applications AI is used for presently.
How is AI dangerous?

If we focus on what’s possible today with AI, here are some of the potential negative impacts of artificial intelligence that we should consider and plan for:
Change the jobs humans do/job automation: AI will change the workplace and the jobs that humans do. Some jobs will be lost to AI technology, so humans will need to embrace the change and find new activities that will provide them the social and mental benefits their job provided.
Political, legal, and social ramifications: As Bostrom advises, rather than avoid pursuing AI innovation, ""Our focus should be on putting ourselves in the best possible position so that when all the pieces fall into place, we've done our homework. We've developed scalable AI control methods, we've thought hard about the ethics and the governments, etc. And then proceed further and then hopefully have an extremely good outcome from that."" If our governments and business institutions don't spend time now formulating rules, regulations, and responsibilities, there could be significant negative ramifications as AI continues to mature.
AI-enabled terrorism: Artificial intelligence will change the way conflicts are fought from autonomous drones, robotic swarms, and remote and nanorobot attacks. In addition to being concerned with a nuclear arms race, we'll need to monitor the global autonomous weapons race.
Social manipulation and AI bias: So far, AI is still at risk for being biased by the humans that build it. If there is bias in the data sets the AI is trained from, that bias will affect AI action. In the wrong hands, AI can be used, as it was in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, for social manipulation and to amplify misinformation.
AI surveillance: AI’s face recognition capabilities give us conveniences such as being able to unlock phones and gain access to a building without keys, but it also launched what many civil liberties groups believe is alarming surveillance of the public. In China and other countries, the police and government are invading public privacy by using face recognition technology. Bostrom explains that AI's ability to monitor the global information systems from surveillance data, cameras, and mining social network communication has great potential for good and for bad.
Deepfakes: AI technology makes it very easy to create ""fake"" videos of real people. These can be used without an individual's permission to spread fake news, create porn in a person's likeness who actually isn't acting in it, and more to not only damage an individual's reputation but livelihood. The technology is getting so good the possibility for people to be duped by it is high.
As Nick Bostrom explained, “The biggest threat is the longer-term problem introducing something radical that’s super intelligent and failing to align it with human values and intentions. This is a big technical problem. We’d succeed at solving the capability problem before we succeed at solving the safety and alignment problem.”
Today, Nick describes himself as a “frightful optimist” that is very excited about what AI can do if we get it right. He said, “The near-term effects are just overwhelmingly positive. The longer-term effect is more of an open question and is very hard to predict. If we do our homework and the more we get our act together as a world and a species in whatever time we have available, the better we are prepared for this, the better the odds for a favorable outcome. In that case, it could be extremely favorable.”

Open Access NewsTechnology News Can artificial intelligence solve our societal issues?

March 3, 2020 









James Lloyd-Townshend, CEO of Jefferson Frank, discusses how artificial intelligence can be used to address societal issues from healthcare to climate change and much more
There are, largely speaking, two camps when it comes to artificial intelligence. On one hand, there’s those who are wary of the negatives that have been reported on in the press and worry that the future isn’t as bright as we’d hoped for. Then there’s those who see the remarkable opportunity it offers and are working hard to mine its advantages.
Undeniably, AI will shape society, it’s unavoidable; history’s not exactly littered with examples of technological advancements that have simply been rejected. While the tightrope of personal intrusion needs to be very carefully walked, it would be remiss of us to reject its benefits outright.
Facial recognition may be a step too far for many, and understandably so, but does that mean such a huge leap of progress in technology should be rejected, regardless of the many positives it can bring? Not wanting to feel like a shopping centre is spying on you is undeniably different to potentially revolutionising medicine, for example.
The government recently announced that it would be investing £250 million in AI technology, and the ramifications of this will be fascinating to watch as an outsider. If we can detect and combat disease, making people happier and healthier, it could truly help to break down barriers when it comes to the public’s perceptions over artificial intelligence.
Employment
Another huge factor which will help are the jobs it will create. Facebook, for example, recently announced it would be creating 1,000 jobs to help the company moderate content via AI. At a time when people are fearing the impact that technology may have on employment prospects, it’s clear that the digital age will be a positive for those looking for work.
According to research by IBM, the number of businesses using AI is set to increase by up to 90% in the next two years. That’s going to require a huge workforce to develop and maintain. This technology isn’t taking jobs away from people, it’s simply shifting the opportunities to a different sector. Regardless of economic factors, companies are increasingly looking to digital solutions, meaning that it’s an area of work that is entirely futureproofed, at the very least in our lifetimes.
There’s already been a boom in tech professionals in the last few years to facilitate a huge number of advances. Since 2015, there’s been an 80% increase in the number of vacancies for data roles, and the need for AI specialists will mean that rise continues in the foreseeable future. According to a recent survey by IBM, 40% of businesses now use AI. This could grow by up to 90% within the next two years, which again underlines just how many opportunities this area of work will create.
Put simply—this isn’t taking jobs away from people, it’s creating a new area of work that will provide a lucrative career path for many, for years to come.
Environmental issues
Aside from our livelihoods and wellbeing, the very world we live in also relies on this technology. There’s no doubting the importance we all place on fighting climate change right now, with a holistic approach being taken towards it all the way from large corporations to individuals. Everybody wants to do their bit, and AI is already being used to help.
Carbon Tracker are one such organisation. They’re an independent think-tank whose aim is to help the UN in preventing new coal plants from being built. Artificial intelligence forms a key part of their operation, as they use it to monitor emissions from coal plants and measuring their impact on air pollution. The UN’s Emissions Gap Report has already pointed towards the need for innovation when it comes to the fight towards climate change.
As the technology is exploited further, there’s no doubt that it’s uses could help to save the very planet that we live on. And for all the bad that be attributed towards AI, that’s one benefit that is close to impossible to ignore.
AI’s future
Artificial intelligence is already here, whether people like it or not. Nearly half of businesses already use it, and many more will join them as they see the tangible benefits it brings to their organisation. There’s much to be done to bridge the gap between the technology and public perception of it. Some of this will be a natural occurrence, but it partly comes down to debunking a lot of myths around it that are simply untrue.
The tech industry will also play its part in this. IBM have acknowledged that the approach to AI needs to be taken from a sound ethical platform, and there really is no shortcut to gaining the trust of the general public on this one. But as long as those creating it and those using it both approach it sensibly, then there’s no denying the benefits available to us if we’re willing to embrace it.

Don’t forget to consider GDPR when using artificial intelligence in the workplace


While references to artificial intelligence in the workplace may conjure up images of future-gazing movies, the use of AI and people analytics by employers is already present at all stages of the employment lifecycle

When applying for a new job, candidates may well find that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools is involved at some point in the recruitment process. New recruitment businesses and technology are entering the market, setting up entirely automated initial conversations with candidates to help them find the right vacancy for their skill set, saving time for applicant and recruiter alike.







CV screening is also becoming more prevalent, with AI screening and tracking tools being used to quickly analyse CVs to ascertain whether the individual has the qualifications and experience necessary for the role – for example, burger chain Five Guys is said to be utilising such technology.
Unilever recently hit the headlines when it announced that, instead of human recruiters, it uses an AI system to analyse video interviews. Candidates record interviews on their phone or laptop, and the system scans candidates’ language, tone and facial expressions from the videos, assessing their performance against traits that are considered to indicate job success at Unilever.
But it is not just the recruitment stage where AI and people analytics are being used by businesses – performance management is another targeted area. Amazon is leading this charge – the company was issued with two patents in the US for a wristband for tracking the performance of workers in their warehouse, which would mean that staff receive a little “buzz” if they place a product near or in the wrong inventory location.
It is also alleged that Amazon uses a computer system to automatically generate warnings or terminations to employees, when their productivity (or lack of) warrants it.
The benefits of such technology for employers are countless and clear, including costs savings, efficiency, and the purported removal of human unconscious bias and prejudice. However, the use of AI in the workplace has come under scrutiny and has posed serious ethical and legal questions, including whether AI itself could in fact be biased.
Another important aspect when implementing AI in the workplace is its relationship with data protection laws such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). So, what data protection considerations should an employer make when considering the introduction of AI technology?

Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been carried out?
The use of AI for processing personal data will usually meet the legal requirement for completing a DPIA.
A DPIA enables the business to analyse how the AI plans will affect individuals’ privacy, and ensures the company can assess the necessity and proportionality of its technology.

As the UK Information Commissioner’s guidance confirms, the deployment of an AI system to process personal data needs to be driven by the proven ability of that system to fulfil a specific and legitimate purpose, not just by the availability of the technology.
The DPIA should demonstrate that the applicable purposes the AI is being used for could not be accomplished in another reasonable way. In doing so, organisations need to think about and document any detriment to data subjects that could follow from bias or inaccuracy in the algorithms and data sets being used.


What is the lawful basis to process the data in this way?
A business cannot simply process personal data because it wishes to do so – data can only be processed where one of the legitimate grounds or conditions of processing has been met. There are various bases, including performance of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, consent and legitimate business interests. For the processing of sensitive personal data (such as health data), the bases are even more limited.
Before using AI or people analytics in the workplace, employers will first need to consider what data is being processed by such activity and second what legal basis can be relied upon in processing the data in that way. If they do not have a legal basis, the data cannot be processed.


Does the privacy notice adequately inform workers?
One of the key principles of GDPR is transparency, requiring businesses to provide individuals with mandatory information about the processing of their personal data, including the reason why it is being processed, the legal basis, who it will be shared with and how long it will be retained. Employers will need to update their privacy notices to ensure anyone subject to the AI technology is made aware of its use. 
The privacy notice needs to be concise and intelligible, using clear and plain language – this will be particularly difficult when including a complex AI system, as businesses will need to provide a meaningful explanation of the technology to meet the transparency principle of GDPR. Opaque or complex descriptions of the tech may result in contention or pushback from the employees and candidates affected.


Remember to consider the specific rules for automated decision-making
GDPR prohibits instances of “computer says no” and contains the right for data subjects not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, which has a legal or similarly significant impact on them. Its aim is to protect individuals against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is taken without human intervention, and will therefore likely capture a recruitment result made without any human input.
There are specific exceptions when automated decision-making is permitted, including where explicit consent was given, contractual necessity, or where authorised by law. Where such an exception is being relied upon, such as with the consent of a candidate, the business must still implement further safeguarding measures, including permitting the individual to request human intervention or to contest the decision. 
Employers will need to ensure that their automated technology is being lawfully used, before relying on its output.

How artificial intelligence is helping to improve people’s quality of life

 6 March 202030 May 2022 Business  Business Matters 





Artificial intelligence is no longer something that provides high-concept drama in sci-fi movies, but it is something that is having tangible benefits in everyday life.

Movies such as 2004’s I, Robot may have attached scarier connotations to the idea of AI, but the reality is that AI is much more subtle (and much more useful) than a bunch of robots running around causing havoc.
We are already seeing the positive effects of AI in key areas such as business, healthcare, and transportation. Here are some examples of how AI is improving the quality of life around the world, with a look at the potential for further AI integration.

Business
askSpoke
 lists 21 ways that AI has transformed the workplace; this includes transcribing meetings, assisting with internal communications, and translating video calls in real time. AI solutions are not designed to replace office workers. Instead, they help staff better manage their workload, allowing them to focus on the most important aspects of their job.
AI is changing the way that businesses provide customer service, with carefully designed bots able to respond to a range of online queries. This enables companies to provide 24/7 customer service, as the bot can operate at all hours to cater to customers in different time zones or on different schedules. In the future, expect AI-driven customer service to be able to respond effectively to unique customer queries or complaints, rather than answering a predetermined range of questions.

Healthcare

AI could potentially play a transformational role in tackling some of the world’s biggest health challenges. Tej Kohlibelieves that biotech solutions and AI can dramatically improve human life, with the use of AI in organ transplantation giving credence to that belief. Algorithms are used to match suitable patients and donor, with AI so far assisting with setting up around 6000 kidney transplants.
That number will increase significantly if AI can be given more patient data to work with, with doctors able to not only identify organ matches but also establish which patient requires more urgent treatment. AI can also enhance existing methods of disease detection, with new AI tech deployed on premature babies to identify those at risk of going blind. Human identification of this eye disease was flawed and contentious, but AI’s ability to process vast quantities of data allows for a more informed decision.

Transportation

When we think about AI in transportation, it is only natural that the mind is drawn to one concept in particular: self-driving cars. Some may find this idea to be unfathomable, while others may relish the notion of relinquishing driving to AI. Self-driven taxis have already been trialled in Tokyo, while ATBS has explored the progress towards autonomous trucks in the United States.
The most significant consequence of AI in transportation for most people may be more discreet than a self-driven vehicle. AI could revolutionize the way that authorities approach traffic management, with the ability to process large swathes of data again making the difference. By analysing big data, AI can help authorities to control the flow of traffic and can inform drivers of potential congestion or alternative routes.
There has already been considerable progress in the development of AI, but, given its proven ability to improve people’s quality of life, that progress is not about to slow down. From its streamlining of office routines and traffic management to its literally life-changing potential in healthcare, AI is providing a future that should be embraced.

When I visited in late January, a gallery two doors down was hosting a reproductive rights-themed show with works listed for upwards of $30,000. Across the street, four floors of the windowless New Museum were taken over by a retrospective of artist Hans Haacke, which included a demographic survey, a portrait of Ronald Reagan and a grass-covered mound of dirt. The seventh floor was occupied by a “mixed reality pop-up,” sponsored by Ruinart champagne, in which visitors could wander about in augmented reality glasses. Minders politely asked those without reservations to “step away from the experience.”Technology and late capitalism similarly intersect in Kurant’s work, though perhaps with a greater degree of self-awareness. A conceptual artist, she explores modern questions over data rights, online labor exploitation and the power of big corporations. With growing public awareness of issues like the commodification of “big data” and the ever-increasing power of artificial intelligence (AI), she’s part of a new generation of artists and curators who are trying to represent the nature of these new technologies, and the ways we are being transformed by them.“To talk about any kind of new media or new technology, sometimes it’s better to use an analogue technology,” Kurant says, showing a photograph of a 2017 piece entitled “A.A.I.” She says the name is based on a phrase coined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, “artificial artificial intelligence,” which describes the process of digitally outsourcing work to human freelancers through distributed labor platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The artwork consists of a series of fluorescent termite mounds created from green, blue, violet, yellow or orange artificial sand. She collaborated with entomologists at the University of Florida to enlist the labor of the termites. “If you give them something else that is not sand … they will not notice the difference and they will still keep building,” Kurant says. She sees termite societies as a kind of “dispersed factory” akin to the mechanism by which large tech companies collect massive quantities of information about users in order to power sophisticated advertising algorithms. “We are all working on a very long, gigantic conveyor belt providing our data or expressing our emotions so that corporations could capitalize on it,” she says. New digitally-enabled economic systems figure even more directly into some of Kurant’s other pieces. In her “Production Line” series, produced between 2016 and 2017, she and co-author John Menick contracted hundreds of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to each draw a single line which were then algorithmically assembled into cohesive drawings. When a painting is sold, the “Turkers” are given part of the profits. Artist Agnieszka Kurant stands in front of ""Conversions 2"" at the de Young museumGary Sexton— the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoCollectivity figures prominently in another of Kurant’s series, “The End of Signature,” in which she used computer algorithms to coalesce hundreds of individual signatures into a single illegible line. Another of her series, “Conversions” (2019), focuses on the ways in which collective “social energy,” in the form of tweets, posts and online searches, is transformed into revenue streams. Consisting of a copper plate covered with liquid crystal paint and attached to computer-controlled heat pumps, the “painting” changes composition in response to algorithmic sentiment analysis of tens of thousands of social media feeds tied to protest movements, continuously transforming collective societal disquiet into physical heat energy. “Even the activities of protest movements are somehow taken advantage of by corporations,” says Kurant, explaining the context of the piece. “There is a price tag on social energies.”Other contemporary artists are also grappling with the intersection of artificial intelligence, data and capitalism. At San Francisco’s de Young museum, an exhibition entitled “Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI” (Feb. 22 – Oct. 25, 2020) takes its name from a term describing how artificial representations of ourselves can come too close for comfort. According to curator Claudia Schmuckli, the installation makes the case that widespread use of AI has brought about a fundamental change in humans’ relationship with machines. “The contemporary uncanny valley is no longer occupied by the image of the machine … but by the statistical data profiles of humans that are compiled by algorithms, which are designed to mine and analyze behavior and project them into tradable or governable futures,” Schmuckli says. She adds that famous pop culture representations of AI, like 2001’s HAL and Schwarzenegger’s Terminator, have been replaced by something even more unsettling: the reflected data profiles generated from our own lives. A still of Stephanie Dinkins in ""Conversations with Bina48"" (2014-present)Stephanie Dinkins; the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoNotions of uncanny resemblance figure prominently into another piece at the de Young, “Conversations with Bina48,” which features artist Stephanie Dinkins speaking with a humanoid social robot built to resemble a black woman. “[I] wanted to see what would happen if I tried to become friends,” Dinkins tells TIME. She’s interested in exploring how communities of color fit into the “new world” being created by companies struggling to become more diverse. “There is a small subsection of the population … that’s creating AI ecosystems that will be contributing to many of our lives,” she says. “What happens if regular people are not a part of thinking about and calling for transparency?”Installation of Ian Cheng's ""BOB (Bag of Beliefs)"" (2018-2019) at the de Young museum in San Francisco.Gary Sexton—the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoOther artists are using AI to take decidedly unconventional approaches to the uncertainties of our time. In “BOB (Bag of Beliefs)” (2018-2019), artist Ian Cheng combines neural networks with a video game engine to create an intelligent simulation named BOB. The digital animal resembles a multi-headed snake. As users interact with it via a smartphone app, BOB develops “beliefs” about the world it inhabits, and its personality evolves over the course of a simulated lifetime. “BOB’s body and BOB’s personality and BOB’s beliefs continue to grow,” explains Cheng. “BOB is quite particular by the end of any of these given exhibitions.”New technologies get blamed for much of today’s collective unease, but for Cheng, that same technology may also provide one of the best ways to come to terms with the times we live in. “I want to feel that the thing I’m looking at is alive, that it has something that can surprise me,” Cheng says of his artificially intelligent artworks. “It mirrors a bit the way that life feels right now where everything is constantly changing — there’s no story that stays stable for too long.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  In the banking sector, supervisory organizations create and oversee the compliance rules that banks and other financial organizations need to follow. These compliance regulations are important for companies to carefully abide by, since non-compliance can potentially result in large fines or in extreme cases, even loss of banking licenses.  Compliance regulations are also subject to frequent change, and banks need to constantly update their processes and workflows in accordance with these regulations. Additionally, with fraud and cybersecurity hacking attempts becoming more sophisticated, many regulatory authorities in the banking sector are placing the onus on banks to mitigate these risks effectively.  What this means for bankers is that, in addition to dealing with day-to-day banking operations, banks need to keep track of compliance mandates that are applicable to them. In the last couple of years, new banking regulations such as the GDPR and BASEL IV have made banks scramble to overhaul some of their workflows to meet these new requirements.  In general, most banks have an internal compliance team for this purpose. The compliance teams at banks are tasked with scouring through thousands of webpages and internal documents in order to stay updated with the latest changes in these rules.  Compliance officers also need to make accurate decisions on which compliance rule changes require immediate action from the bank. This takes time, and none of it offers additional revenue to the bank. AI-based software can help banks and financial institutions improve the accuracy in identifying the rules that apply to them. AI software can help augment the skills of each compliance officer while simultaneously allowing them to scale their operations to do more than what is possible when manually searching through digital documents and government websites. Banks could potentially use AI software to automatically scour through the web and identify only the most relevant ones for each company.  Banks have historically tried to reduce the costs associated with compliance because they don’t drive revenue. Unsurprisingly, banks are already investing money into automation efforts to augment their compliance teams, making them as efficient as possible in accurately identifying which regulations need actions from the banks and in what order. The figure below, from our AI Opportunity Landscape in banking, the number and percent of AI-based compliance applications across AI vendor product offerings in banking. This is a slice of the full splay of where AI is being applied in banking: This is visualized data from our full AI Opportunity Landscape research into the banking industry. Compliance as a category was ranked third-highest by the number of AI vendor products in banking, accounting for 11.5% of them. In addition, AI vendors offering products for compliance received the second-highest total funding amount ($489 million) compared to other banking functions. In addition, AI vendors offering products in compliance on average had the highest density of AI talent on their leadership teams and higher than average funding compared to other functions. Of the top six banking functions in our report, Compliance scored the highest on its Average Expertise and Funding Score (3.3 out of 4.0), revealing that AI vendors offering products for compliance are relatively credible and capable firms.  The banking experts we interviewed, including the former head of AI at HSBC, insisted that compliance was one of the main areas of automation focus for banks right now. In this article, we delve deeper into the following compliance applications in banking using case studies from AI vendors in this space as representative of what is possible with AI today. Specifically, we discuss: Natural Language Processing Applications for Compliance: Narrative Science’s Quill and Digitial Reasoning’s Conduct Surveillance for Suspicious Activity Report generation and monitoring employee conversations with clients respectively Case Study – Ayasdi: Ayasdi’s case study with Citibank in which the vendor helped the bank pass its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review test We begin our analysis of AI in the compliance in banking space with natural language processing applications for compliance processes at banks. Natural Language Processing Applications for Compliance One company offering NLP services for information retrieval in compliance applications is Narrative Science. The company offers Quill, which they claim is an automatic report generation tool. The company claims users of their software can select a data chart automatically generate a few sentences explaining the insights one could garner from the chart. For example, the company claims they worked with an unnamed bank in a project where they helped the bank generate Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).  SARs are mandatory reports that banks and financial institutions need to file with supervisory bodies. These are reports of any incidents of fraud or cybersecurity threats that a bank has investigated. Narrative science claims Quill-generated SARs are robust enough to assist compliance teams and internal audit teams in ensuring a bank remains in compliance. Digital Reasoning offers a product called Conduct Surveillance, a natural language processing tool that can purportedly analyze human conversations that have been recorded in either text or voice to determine whether or not a bank’s employees are acting within compliance when they interact with clients. The company claims their software is used by NASDAQ to extract information from employee work interaction records and ensure internal compliance.  Case Study: Ayasdi AI vendor Ayasdi claims its product, Model Accelerator, uses machine learning to generate AI models appropriate for the client company’s use-case and then allows subject-matter experts to select the most accurately performing models. They claim their Model Accelerator is useful for risk modeling in compliance and regtech.  In a case-study, Ayasdi claims Citibank used the Model Accelerator to help comply with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, that was instituted in order to prevent another crisis like the one that happened in 2008. In the CCAR test, banks need to forecast and provide a justification for supervisory bodies that their revenues and capital reserves are solid enough to withstand any volatile market conditions.  Ayasdi claims the bank used their software input with historical financial performance data to predict what the impact of different types of volatile market conditions might be on their operations. According to the case study, Citibank had failed the test two out of three times before working with Ayasdi and were able to pass the test successfully after the integration.  Existing Automation Efforts Could Help With AI Adoption Banks allocate existing effort to compliance automation; they have large IT budgets for these efforts and often sizeable wings of their compliance departments. What this means is compliance is likely one of the first banking functions to undergo transformation through artificial intelligence, along with fraud and cybersecurity.  Banks won’t need to set up new business infrastructure, hire an entire department’s worth of people, and figure out where they can fit in budget for automation like they would in banking functions such as marketing and wealth management. Instead, banks can focus on hiring data science talent and upskilling their existing IT employees, who are perhaps working on automation efforts such as robotic process automation (RPA). That said, RPA is not AI, and existing IT employees are unlikely to know how to “do AI:” working with data to build machine learning models and then iterating those models. This is to say nothing about the cultural shift that needs to take place at a bank before it’s ready to work with artificial intelligence. AI is not IT; it’s not “plug-and-play.” Automation wings of compliance departments need to involve both data science personnel and subject-matter experts in compliance, who will often need to be pulled away from their usual work to brainstorm with data scientists and provide them a bounding box for the kinds of models they can build. We discuss this further in our executive guide on the critical role of subject-matter experts in bringing machine learning projects to life. Challenges With Legacy Systems The largest banks have been around for, in some cases, over a hundred years, and this affects not only the bank’s culture but its digital infrastructure. Banks still retain many paper documents, and their digital systems and data infrastructures are hardly as up-to-date as tech giants like Facebook and Amazon. Integrating AI into these old systems can be a challenge, and oftentimes, a “ground-up” approach is necessary, in which the bank organizes data lakes and warehouses. Documents at banks, including those relevant for compliance personnel, have not historically been stored in ways that would make it easy to feed them into an AI algorithm. In other words, banks do not usually have the appropriate digital infrastructure necessary to implement AI search functions for augmenting compliance processes. Laying the groundwork for some AI projects may involve data science expertise and, in fact, other AI applications, such as those for document digitization. Uncertain ROI and the Importance of AI Leadership Also, banks might still find that AI projects might not necessarily start giving returns on investment immediately. AI projects can last anywhere between 2 and 6 months before they can be deployed in corporate environments. Even in such cases, banks need to be aware that after all the investment and effort, there is still a chance that existing technologies might perform just as well as the new AI system, at least for an initial period of time during which the AI has not had enough data inputs to learn all the nuances of compliance monitoring.  As a result, risk-averse banking leaders might not be inclined to move into AI until there is a clear, established evidence of returns in the market. Banks might need to hire leaders in their compliance departments who understand what goes into an AI project, with a view of a more long term overall data strategy. Our survey of banking experts found that most cite a lack of a culture of innovation at banks as the major challenge to overcome before banks start adopting artificial intelligence. Given their focus on automation at present, compliance departments are perhaps among the most likely to hire leaders that can steer the department toward AI adoption. These leaders can serve as a champion for AI, making sure that department personnel understand that AI projects are iterative processes that are not guaranteed to yield an ROI while maintaining enthusiasm for experimenting with the technology. They can hire data scientists and advocate for budget to upskill existing IT personnel so that they might help those data scientists clean and harmonize data for machine learning projects.  That all said, despite the associated uncertainty with AI projects, engaging in these projects is the fastest way for banks to understand what goes into developing such as system and gain data handling capabilities that will serve them well in the future.   Header image credit: Analytics Training Blog Related Posts AI for Cybersecurity in Banking - Where Banks Are Investing TodayHackers are cyberattackers are using more sophisticated methods to break into digital networks; they themselves… AI in Banking - An Analysis of America's 7 Top BanksWhile tech giants tend to hog the limelight on the cutting-edge of technology, AI in… The State of RPA in Banking - With Charts and GraphsRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is a rule-based software solution that automates repetitive tasks without any… AI-based Business Process Management in Banking - Current Use-CasesBusiness process management (BPM) in banking involves the automation of operations management by identifying, modeling,… AI Applications in the Top 4 Indian BanksThough in its nascency, the Indian banking sector is beginning to adopt artificial intelligence (AI).… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Free Download: AI in Banking Executive Cheat SheetThis free guide highlights the near-term impact of AI in banking, including critical use-cases and trends: Download White Paper",,https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/artificial-intelligence-compliance-banking,,,,,,AI Sector Overviews,1779,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortly after launch, the company realized that resumes for technical posts that included the word “women’s” (such as “women’s chess club captain”), or contained reference to women’s colleges, were downgraded. The answer to why this was the case was down to the data used to teach Amazon’s system. Based on 10 years of predominantly male resumes submitted to the company, the “new” automated system in fact perpetuated “old” situations, giving preferential scores to those applicants it was more “familiar” with.Advertisement
Defined by AI4ALL as the branch of computer science that allows computers to make predictions and decisions to solve problems, artificial intelligence (AI) has already made an impact on the world, from advances in medicine, to language translation apps. But as Amazon’s recruitment tool shows, the way in which we teach computers to make these choices, known as machine learning, has a real impact on the fairness of their functionality.
Take another example, this time in facial recognition. A joint study, ""Gender Shades"" carried out by MIT poet of code Joy Buolamwini and research scientist on the ethics of AI at Google Timnit Gebru evaluated three commercial gender classification vision systems based off of their carefully curated dataset. They found that darker-skinned females were the most misclassified group with error rates of up to 34.7 percent, whilst the maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males was 0.8 percent.

As AI systems like facial recognition tools begin to infiltrate many areas of society, such as law enforcement, the consequences of misclassification could be devastating. Errors in the software used could lead to the misidentification of suspects and ultimately mean they are wrongfully accused of a crime.

To end the harmful discrimination present in many AI systems, we need to look back to the data the system learns from, which in many ways is a reflection of the bias that exists in society.
Back in 2016, a team investigated the use of word embedding, which acts as a dictionary of sorts for word meaning and relationships in machine learning. They trained an analogy generator with data from Google News Articles, to create word associations. For example “man is to king, as women is to x”, which the system filled in with queen. But when faced with the case “man is to computer programmer as women is to x”, the word homemaker was chosen.Advertisement
Other female-male analogies such as “nurse to surgeon”, also demonstrated that word embeddings contain biases that reflected gender stereotypes present in broader society (and therefore also in the data set). However, “Due to their wide-spread usage as basic features, word embeddings not only reflect such stereotypes but can also amplify them,” the authors wrote.
AI machines themselves also perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Female-gendered Virtual Personal Assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, have been accused of reproducing normative assumptions about the role of women as submissive and secondary to men. Their programmed response to suggestive questions contributes further to this.
Sexist stereotypes are prevalent in AI systems, such as Virtual Personal Assistants. yavi/ Shutterstock According to Rachel Adams, a research specialist at the Human Sciences Research Council in South Africa, if you tell the female voice of Samsung’s Virtual Personal Assistant, Bixby, “Let’s talk dirty”, the response will be “I don’t want to end up on Santa’s naughty list.” But ask the program’s male voice, and the reply is “I’ve read that soil erosion is a real dirt problem.”
Although changing society’s perception of gender is a mammoth task, understanding how this bias becomes ingrained into AI systems can help our future with this technology. Olga Russakovsky, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University, spoke to IFLScience about understanding and overcoming these problems.Advertisement
“AI touches a huge percentage of the world’s population, and the technology is already affecting many aspects of how we live, work, connect, and play,” Russakovsky explained. “[But] when the people who are being impacted by AI applications are not involved in the creation of the technology, we often see outcomes that favor one group over another. This could be related to the datasets used to train AI models, but it could also be related to the issues that AI is deployed to address.”
Therefore her work, she said, focuses on addressing AI bias along three dimensions: the data, the models, and the people building the systems.
“On the data side, in our recent project we systematically identified and remedied fairness issues that resulted from the data collection process in the person subtree of the ImageNet dataset (which is used for object recognition in machine learning),” Russakovsky explained.
Russakovsky has also turned her attention to the algorithms used in AI, which can enhance the bias in the data. Together with her team, she has identified and benchmarked algorithmic techniques for avoiding bias amplification in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.Advertisement
In terms of addressing the role of humans in generating bias in AI, Russakovsky has co-founded a foundation, AI4ALL, which works to increase diversity and inclusion in AI. “The people currently building and implementing AI comprise a tiny, homogenous percentage of the population,” Russakovsky told IFLScience. “By ensuring the participation of a diverse group of people in AI, we are better positioned to use AI responsibly and with meaningful consideration of its impacts.”
metamorworks/ ShutterstockA report from the research institute AI Now, outlined the diversity disaster across the entire AI sector. Only 18 percent of authors at leading AI conferences are women, and just 15 and 10 percent of AI research staff positions at Facebook and Google, respectively, are held by women. Black women also face further marginalization, as only 2.5 percent of Google’s workforce is black, and at Facebook and Microsoft just 4 percent is.
Ensuring that the voices of as many communities as possible are heard in the field of AI, is critical for its future, Russakovsky explained, because: “Members of a given community are best poised to identify the issues that community faces, and those issues may be overlooked or incompletely understood by someone who is not a member of that community.”
How we perceive what it means to work in AI, could also help to diversify the pool of people involved in the field. “We need ethicists, policymakers, lawyers, biologists, doctors, communicators – people from a wide variety of disciplines and approaches – to contribute their expertise to the responsible and equitable development of AI,” Russakovsky remarked. “It is equally important that these roles are filled by people from different backgrounds and communities who can shape AI in a way that reflects the issues they see and experience.”Advertisement
The time to act is now. AI is at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution, and threatens to disproportionately impact groups because of the sexism and racism embedded into its systems. Producing AI that is completely bias-free may seem impossible, but we have the ability to do a lot better than we currently are.
“My hope for the future of AI is that our community of diverse leaders are shaping the field thoughtfully, using AI responsibly, and leading with considerations of social impacts,” Russakovsky concluded.",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.iflscience.com/'}",,,,,,,,['IFLS'],IFLScience Limited,https://www.iflscience.com/favicon/iflscience_logo_narrow.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/iflscience', 'https://twitter.com/iflscience', 'https://www.youtube.com/@IFLScienceOfficial', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/iflscience']",2012,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Woodview, Bull Lane Industrial Estate', 'addressLocality': 'Sudbury', 'postalCode': 'CO10 0FD', 'addressCountry': 'United Kingdom'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'customer support', 'email': 'support@iflscience.com'}",en,,,,,,,,

90.5 WESADelta Trainer's app as it shows up on an Apple Watch and cellphone.





Personal training is a popular but expensive option in the $100 billion fitness industry; it can cost an average of $40-70/hour. Local startup Delta Trainer is using artificial intelligence to make personal training more accessible.Everyone who signs up for Delta Trainer gets an Apple Watch and is connected with a remote personal trainer, who sets up a unique workout plan for each of their clients. But the trainer isn't there in person to monitor someone's squats and lunges; that's the AI's job.Delta CEO and co-founder Matt Spettel said the company's app can tell if someone is executing a particular exercise properly. For example, if someone swings their arms too much while doing bicep curls, their watch will speak up.""You were swinging the weights,"" a voice calls from Spettel's Apple Watch as he demonstrates. ""Make sure to slow down and control your movement.""Apple Watches contain two sensors that track a person's movement through space. Spettel and his team used machine learning to teach their artificial intelligence how to use the sensor data to detect more than 100 types of exercises.""Basically any exercise where your wrist is moving at all, we can track it,"" Spettel said. ""Even if your wrist is on a bar, or on your body like a sit-up or squat, even if your wrist isn't moving with respect to you, the wrist is still moving with respect to the world.""After a workout, the trainer reviews their client's data, gives feedback and modifies the plan as needed. Spettel said the system not only makes personal training cheaper for consumers, but it also benefits the trainers.""Most trainers don't have very highjob satisfaction because they're part time,"" Spettel said. ""Even though their hourly rate may be OK at some gyms, it's hard to fill a 40 hour work week with training. Because of this remote structure, we can have much more predictable hours and work.""Delta Trainer currently employs one trainer as a full-time employee, complete with benefits. Spettel said as the company grows, they plan to hire more full-time trainers to meet demand.About 500 people tried Delta Trainer during beta testing, and Spettel said it was a succesful run. The company officially launched its service to the public Monday. The first month — and the Apple Watch — is risk free; it costs $100/month after that.

Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple all state that each part of our lives will before long be changed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, through innovations, for example, self-driving cars and facial recognition. However, the individuals whose work supports that vision don't much look like the society their developments should change..Students around the world are getting on a tragic reality: dreadfully numerous organizations despite everything are struggling to make a real impact with AI and numerous organizations continue without a culture of collaboration in their analytics teams. The study uncovers that almost 75% of female data science majors are looking for precisely the opposite from their future employment, in particular applied, impact-driven work, while men are conflicted. For whatever length of time that organizations approach and advance their data science and AI as theoretical endeavors without a concrete and measurable value, female students will keep on being lopsidedly hindered from entering the field..In the U.K. the government has recognized the significance of AI and data science by making it one of the four pillars of its Industrial Strategy. It isn't just a critical driver of economic growth, however, the algorithms that support AI are getting transformative and far-reaching. Algorithmic systems are progressively utilized in manners that can legitimately impact our lives, called upon to settle on decisions about employment propositions, advances and even criminal condemning..This could be a brilliant chance to improve decency in decision-making, especially where people don't have the best reputation due to conscious and unconscious bias. However, if we don't guarantee those working in AI are more representative of the society in which they work, this is probably not going to occur and we are in grave peril of further settling in unfairness and, worse still, giving this unfairness a rubber stamp from the innovation business..In spite of these varieties across nations, the issue is essentially a worldwide one, affecting a decent variety over this rapidly developing field. Organizations can't just depend on the media buzz around AI, seeking after the job of a data scientist to mysteriously sell itself to students. They should make a noticeable culture within their data science teams that celebrate the impact and shuns competitiveness and afterwards make this career opportunity truly substantial and alluring to students of the two genders..While organizations advance towards an increasingly deliberate way to deal with AI, they can likewise empower diversity all the more promptly by getting substantially more explicit in their communication with students, legitimately addressing the worries that women feature as significant: the role of data science within the business, how data scientists together work on use cases, and how a career path in data science includes more than coding. They should be moving towards students with real models and value proofs, communicated by real data science practitioners who can make the everyday substantial and can legitimately address negative discernments about work culture..Organizations and governments are betting on AI in light of its potential to let computers settle on decisions and make a move on the planet, in territories, for example, health care and policing. Facebook is depending on machine learning to assist it with battling fake news in places with altogether different socioeconomics to its AI research lab, for example, Myanmar, where gossipy tidbits on the organization's platform led to violence. The dangers AI frameworks will make hurt certain groups are higher when research teams are homogenous. Various teams are bound to signal issues that could have negative social outcomes before a product has been launched. Research has likewise demonstrated diverse groups are progressively productive..Corporate and academic AI teams have as of now, unintentionally discharged data and systems biased against people inadequately represented among the devout ministers of AI. A year ago, analysts at the universities of Virginia and Washington indicated that two huge image collections used in machine learning research, including one supported by Microsoft and Facebook, teach algorithms a skewed view of gender. Pictures of individuals shopping and washing are for the most part connected to women, for instance..The shortage of women among machine learning analysts is not really astounding. The more extensive field of computer science is all around reported as being ruled by men. Government figures show that the extent of women granted bachelor's degrees in computing in the US has slid essentially in the course of recent years, something contrary to the pattern in physical and biological sciences..Ensuring female data scientists are substantially more obvious is one of the main things we can do to begin to fix this. Role models are crucially significant in indicating young ladies and women that they also can work in data science and that this career decision is a possibility for them. This is a part of the more extensive work we have to do in getting young girls excited for coding and innovation at an early age and urging them to examine STEM subjects at A-level and at University..The technology business can unquestionably have its impact in supporting female STEM graduates to seek after careers in technology and in accomplishing more to guarantee women don't leave these professions prematurely with activities focused on child care, work-life balance and more funding available for female entrepreneurs. For whatever length of time that organizations don't get this right, an enormous (and lopsidedly female) portion of the talent pool for data science will keep on making a statement and maintain a strategic distance from the field, propagating the recruiting gender gap in this increasingly mission-critical part of companies' workforces..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

This next step paves the way for the DoD to improve how we manage and leverage data as a strategic asset,” said JAIC Director Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan. “We appreciate the CoE’s commitment to creating a collaborative environment that enables solutions for broader AI governance, technology acquisition strategies, and scaling AI solutions through the Joint Common Foundation.”The GSA CoE program helps agencies accelerate modernization projects. The program added its seventh agency partner earlier this week.“The CoE model gives us an opportunity to share experience gained from industry and federal partners with the JAIC, building on the successes of organizations that have come before us,” said Technology Transformation Service Director Anil Cheriyan. “The AI journey is one we are taking together and it’s essential to get the fundamentals right. We are offering a pathway for agency partners to accelerate their own AI journey.”About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.
