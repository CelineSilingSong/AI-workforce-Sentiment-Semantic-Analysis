OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, estimates that the jobs most at risk from the new wave of AI are those with the highest wages, and that someone in an occupation that pays a six-figure salary is about three times as exposed as someone making $30,000. McKinsey warns of the models’ ability to automate the application of expertise.

I understand the temptation to wave away these warnings as mere projections. Thousands of years of history have lulled many of us into the false sense of security that automation is something that happens to other people’s jobs, never our own.

But for some, the fear that AI may one day take white-collar jobs is already a reality. In an ingenious study published this summer, US researchers showed that within a few months of the launch of ChatGPT, copywriters and graphic designers on major online freelancing platforms saw a significant drop in the number of jobs they got, and even steeper declines in earnings. This suggested not only that generative AI was taking their work, but also that it devalues the work they do still carry out.

Most strikingly, the study found that freelancers who previously had the highest earnings and completed the most jobs were no less likely to see their employment and earnings decline than other workers. If anything, they had worse outcomes. In other words, being more skilled was no shield against loss of work or earnings.

But the online freelancing market covers a very particular form of white-collar work and of labour market. What about looking higher up the ranks of the knowledge worker class?

For that, we can turn to a recent, fascinating Harvard Business School study, which monitored the impact of giving GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most advanced offering, to employees at Boston Consulting Group.

BCG staff randomly assigned to use GPT-4 when carrying out a set of consulting tasks were far more productive than their colleagues who could not access the tool. Not only did AI-assisted consultants carry out tasks 25 per cent faster and complete 12 per cent more tasks overall, their work was assessed to be 40 per cent higher in quality than their unassisted peers.

Employees right across the skills distribution benefited, but in a pattern now common in generative AI studies, the biggest performance gains came among the less highly skilled in their workforce. This makes intuitive sense: large language models are best understood as excellent regurgitators and summarisers of existing, public-domain human knowledge. The closer one’s own knowledge already is to that limit, the smaller the benefit from using them.

There was one catch: on a more nuanced task, which involved analysing quantitative evidence only after a careful reading of qualitative materials, AI-assisted consultants fared worse: GPT missed the subtleties. But two groups of participants bucked that trend. The first — termed “cyborgs” by the authors — intertwined with the AI, constantly moulding, checking and refining its responses, while the second — “centaurs” — divided labour, handing off more AI-suited subtasks while focusing on their own areas of expertise.

Taken together, the studies tell us three things. First, regulation will be key. Online freelancing is about as unregulated a labour market as you will find. Without protections, even knowledge workers are in trouble.

Second, the more multi-faceted the role, the less risk of complete automation. The gig-worker model of performing one task for multiple clients — copywriting or logo design, for example — is especially exposed.

And third, getting the most out of these tools, while avoiding their pitfalls, requires treating them as an extension of ourselves, checking their outputs as we would our own. They are not separate, infallible assistants to whom we can defer or hand over responsibility.

In millennial-speak, generative AI is the white-collar worker’s frenemy. It’s wise to be wary, but this could become a flourishing relationship.

											Artificial intelligence (AI) is an interdisciplinary science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human thought. The implications will change virtually every aspect of our world. Needpix



How does AI work? It helps to start at the beginning. Back in October 1950, British techno-visionary Alan Turing published an article called ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"" in the journal MIND that raised what at the time must have seemed to many like a science-fiction fantasy.
""May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?"" Turing asked.

Turing thought that they could. Moreover, he believed, it was possible to create software for a digital computer that enabled it to observe its environment and to learn new things, from playing chess to understanding and speaking a human language. And he thought machines eventually could develop the ability to do that on their own, without human guidance. ""We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields,"" he predicted.
Nearly 70 years later, Turing's seemingly outlandish vision has become a reality, thanks to monumental advancements in the field of computer science and AI research. Artificial intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, gives machines the ability to learn from experience and perform cognitive tasks, the sort of stuff that was once thought to be reserved for human intelligence.
AI is rapidly spreading throughout civilization, where it has the promise of doing everything from enabling self driving cars to navigate the streets to making more accurate hurricane forecasts. On an everyday level, AI figures out what ads to show you on the web, and powers those friendly chatbots that pop up when you visit an e-commerce website to answer your questions and provide customer service. And AI-powered personal assistants in voice-activated smart home devices perform myriad tasks, from controlling our TVs and doorbells to answering trivia questions and helping us find our favorite songs.

But we're just getting started with it. As AI technology grows more sophisticated and capable, it's expected to massively boost the world's economy, creating about $13 trillion worth of additional activity by 2030, according to a McKinsey Global Institute forecast.
""AI is still early in adoption, but adoption is accelerating and it is being used across all industries,"" says Sarah Gates, an analytics platform strategist at SAS, a global software and services firm that focuses upon turning data into intelligence for clients.

How AI Could Transform the Economy








How Artificial Intelligence Works
 

It's even more amazing, perhaps, that our existence is quietly being transformed by deep learning algorithms that many of us barely understand, if at all — something so complex that even scientists have a tricky time explaining it.
""AI is a family of technologies that perform tasks that are thought to require intelligence if performed by humans,"" explains Vasant Honavar, a professor and director of the Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory at Penn State University. ""I say 'thought,' because nobody is really quite sure what intelligence is.""


Advertisement  

Honavar describes two main categories of intelligence. There's narrow AI, which is achieving competence in a narrowly defined domain, such as analyzing images from X-rays and MRI scans in radiology. Artificial general intelligence, in contrast, describes much more human like thinking processes, like the ability to learn about anything and to talk about it. ""A machine might be good at some diagnoses in radiology, but if you ask it about baseball, it would be clueless,"" Honavar explains. Humans' intellectual versatility ""is still beyond the reach of AI at this point.""
According to Honavar, there are two key pieces to AI models. One of them is the engineering part — that is, building a computer program and computer systems that utilize intelligence in some way. The other is the science of intelligence, or rather, how to enable a machine to come up with a result comparable to what a human brain would come up with, even if the machine achieves it through a very different process. To use an analogy, ""birds fly and airplanes fly, but they fly in completely different ways,"" Honavar. ""Even so, they both make use of aerodynamics and physics. In the same way, artificial intelligence is based upon the notion that there are general principles about how intelligent systems behave.""





AI is ""basically the results of our attempting to understand and emulate the way that the brain works and the application of this to giving brain-like functions to otherwise autonomous systems (e.g., drones, robots and agents),"" Kurt Cagle, a writer, data scientist and futurist who's the founder of consulting firm Semantical, writes in an email. He's also editor of The Cagle Report, a daily information technology newsletter.
And while humans don't really think like computers, which utilize circuits, semi-conductors and magnetic media instead of biological cells to store information, there are some intriguing parallels. ""One thing we're beginning to discover is that graph networks are really interesting when you start talking about billions of nodes, and the brain is essentially a graph network, albeit one where you can control the strengths of processes by varying the resistance of neurons before a capacitive spark fires,"" Cagle explains. ""A single neuron by itself gives you a very limited amount of information, but fire enough neurons of varying strengths together, and you end up with a pattern that gets fired only in response to certain kinds of stimuli, typically modulated electrical signals through the DSPs [that is digital signal processing] that we call our retina and cochlea.""
""Most applications of AI have been in domains with large amounts of data,"" Honavar says. To use the radiology example again, the existence of large databases of X-rays and MRI scans that have been evaluated by human radiologists, makes it possible to train a machine to emulate that activity.
AI systems work by combining large amounts of data with intelligent algorithms — series of instructions — that allow the software to learn from patterns and features of the data, as this SAS primer on artificial intelligence explains.
In simulating the way a brain works, AI utilizes a bunch of different subfields, as the SAS primer notes.

Machine learning automates analytical model building, to find hidden insights in data without being programmed to look for something in particular or draw a certain conclusion.Artificial neural networks imitate the brain's array of interconnected neurons, and relay information between various units to find connections and derive meaning from data.Deep learning utilizes really big neural networks and a lot of computing power to find complex patterns in data, for applications such as image and speech recognition.Cognitive computing is about creating a ""natural, human-like interaction,"" as SAS puts it, including using the ability to interpret speech and respond to it.Computer vision employs pattern recognition and deep learning to understand the content of pictures and videos, and to enable machines to use real-time images to make sense of what's around them.Natural language processing involves analyzing and understanding human language and responding to it.

Decades of Research
 

The concept of AI dates back to the 1940s, and the term ""artificial intelligence"" was introduced at a 1956 conference at Dartmouth College. Over the next two decades, researchers developed programs that played games and did simple pattern recognition and machine learning. Cornell University scientist Frank Rosenblatt developed the Perceptron, the first artificial neural network, which ran on a 5-ton (4.5-metric ton), room-sized IBM computer that was fed punch cards.
But it wasn't until the mid-1980s that a second wave of more complex, deep neural networks were developed to tackle higher-level tasks, according to Honavar. In the early 1990s, another breakthrough enabled AI to generalize beyond the training experience.

In the 1990s and 2000s, other technological innovations — the web and increasingly powerful computers — helped accelerate the development of AI. ""With the advent of the web, large amounts of data became available in digital form,"" Honavar says. ""Genome sequencing and other projects started generating massive amounts of training data, and advances in computing made it possible to store and access this data. We could train the machines to do more complex tasks. You couldn't have had a deep learning model 30 years ago, because you didn't have the data and the computing power.""






AI and Robotics
 

AI systems are different from, but related to, robotics, in which machines sense their environment, perform calculations and do physical tasks either by themselves or under the direction of people, from factory work and cooking to landing on other planets. Honavar says that the two fields intersect in many ways.
""You can imagine robotics without much intelligence, purely mechanical devices like automated looms,"" Honavar says. ""There are examples of robots that are not intelligent in a significant way."" Conversely, there's robotics where intelligence is an integral part, such as guiding an autonomous vehicle around streets full of human-driven cars and pedestrians.

""It's a reasonable argument that to realize general intelligence, you would need robotics to some degree, because interaction with the world, to some degree, is an important part of intelligence,"" according to Honavar. ""To understand what it means to throw a ball, you have to be able to throw a ball.""
AI technologies have quietly become so ubiquitous that they're already found in many consumer products.
""A huge number of devices that fall within the Internet of Things (IoT) space readily use some kind of self-reinforcing AI, albeit very specialized AI,"" Cagle says. ""Cruise control was an early AI and is far more sophisticated when it works than most people realize. Noise dampening headphones. Anything that has a speech recognition capability, such as most contemporary television remotes. Social media filters. Spam filters. If you expand AI to cover machine learning, this would also include spell checkers, text-recommendation systems, really any recommendation system, washers and dryers, microwaves, dishwashers, really most home electronics produced after 2017, speakers, televisions, anti-lock braking systems, any electric vehicle, modern CCTV cameras. Most games use AI networks at many different levels.""
AI tools can outperform humans in some narrow domains, just as ""airplanes can fly longer distances, and carry more people than a bird could,"" Honavar says. AI, for example, is capable of processing millions of social media network interactions and gaining insights that can influence users' behavior — an ability that the AI expert worries may have ""not so good consequences.""
It's particularly good at making sense of massive amounts of information that would overwhelm a human brain. That capability enables internet companies, for example, to analyze the mountains of data that they collect about users and employ the insights in various ways to influence our behavior.

How AI Could Transform the Economy
 

Given AI's potential to do tasks that used to require humans, it's easy to fear that its spread could put most of us out of work. But some experts envision that while the combination of AI and robotics could eliminate some positions, it will create even more new jobs for tech-savvy workers.
""Those most at risk are those doing routine and repetitive tasks in retail, finance and manufacturing,"" Darrell West, a vice president and founding director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based public policy organization, explains in an email. ""But white-collar jobs in health care will also be affected and there will be an increase in job churn with people moving more frequently from job to job.


Advertisement  

New jobs will be created but many people will not have the skills needed for those positions. So the risk is a job mismatch that leaves people behind in the transition to a digital economy. Countries will have to invest more money in job retraining and workforce development as technology spreads. There will need to be lifelong learning so that people regularly can upgrade their job skills.""
And instead of replacing human workers, AI may be used to enhance their intellectual capabilities. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil has predicted that by the 2030s, AI have achieved human levels of intelligence, and that it will be possible to have AI that goes inside the human brain to boost memory, turning users into human-machine hybrids. As Kurzweil has described it, ""We're going to expand our minds and exemplify these artistic qualities that we value.""

Now That's Interesting
Cagle was on a panel at a science fiction convention several years ago with author David Brin, who has written about the concept of uplift, in which AI would be used to enhance the intellectual capabilities of sentient nonhuman life such as dolphins and apes to human level. ""Are we ethically prepared to shepherd a new intelligent species into the universe?"" Cagle asks. ""Are we comfortable enough with our own existence to create others that we will love, argue with, learn from and teach?""

Frequently Answered Questions
What are the 4 types of AI?

There are four types of AI: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware. Reactive AI is the simplest form of AI, and it is what most people think of when they think of AI. Limited memory AI can remember past events and use them to make decisions. Theory of mind AI can understand the thoughts and emotions of others. Self-aware AI is aware of its own thoughts and emotions.

A quick scan of the headlines makes it seem like generative artificial intelligence is everywhere these days. In fact, some of those headlines may actually have been written by generative AI, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that has demonstrated an uncanny ability to produce text that seems to have been written by a human.
But what do people really mean when they say “generative AI?”
Before the generative AI boom of the past few years, when people talked about AI, typically they were talking about machine-learning models that can learn to make a prediction based on data. For instance, such models are trained, using millions of examples, to predict whether a certain X-ray shows signs of a tumor or if a particular borrower is likely to default on a loan.
Generative AI can be thought of as a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, rather than making a prediction about a specific dataset. A generative AI system is one that learns to generate more objects that look like the data it was trained on.
“When it comes to the actual machinery underlying generative AI and other types of AI, the distinctions can be a little bit blurry. Oftentimes, the same algorithms can be used for both,” says Phillip Isola, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
And despite the hype that came with the release of ChatGPT and its counterparts, the technology itself isn’t brand new. These powerful machine-learning models draw on research and computational advances that go back more than 50 years.
An increase in complexity
An early example of generative AI is a much simpler model known as a Markov chain. The technique is named for Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician who in 1906 introduced this statistical method to model the behavior of random processes. In machine learning, Markov models have long been used for next-word prediction tasks, like the autocomplete function in an email program.
In text prediction, a Markov model generates the next word in a sentence by looking at the previous word or a few previous words. But because these simple models can only look back that far, they aren’t good at generating plausible text, says Tommi Jaakkola, the Thomas Siebel Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, who is also a member of CSAIL and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS).
“We were generating things way before the last decade, but the major distinction here is in terms of the complexity of objects we can generate and the scale at which we can train these models,” he explains.
Just a few years ago, researchers tended to focus on finding a machine-learning algorithm that makes the best use of a specific dataset. But that focus has shifted a bit, and many researchers are now using larger datasets, perhaps with hundreds of millions or even billions of data points, to train models that can achieve impressive results.
The base models underlying ChatGPT and similar systems work in much the same way as a Markov model. But one big difference is that ChatGPT is far larger and more complex, with billions of parameters. And it has been trained on an enormous amount of data — in this case, much of the publicly available text on the internet.
In this huge corpus of text, words and sentences appear in sequences with certain dependencies. This recurrence helps the model understand how to cut text into statistical chunks that have some predictability. It learns the patterns of these blocks of text and uses this knowledge to propose what might come next.
More powerful architectures
While bigger datasets are one catalyst that led to the generative AI boom, a variety of major research advances also led to more complex deep-learning architectures.
In 2014, a machine-learning architecture known as a generative adversarial network (GAN) was proposed by researchers at the University of Montreal. GANs use two models that work in tandem: One learns to generate a target output (like an image) and the other learns to discriminate true data from the generator’s output. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, and in the process learns to make more realistic outputs. The image generator StyleGAN is based on these types of models.  
Diffusion models were introduced a year later by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. By iteratively refining their output, these models learn to generate new data samples that resemble samples in a training dataset, and have been used to create realistic-looking images. A diffusion model is at the heart of the text-to-image generation system Stable Diffusion.
In 2017, researchers at Google introduced the transformer architecture, which has been used to develop large language models, like those that power ChatGPT. In natural language processing, a transformer encodes each word in a corpus of text as a token and then generates an attention map, which captures each token’s relationships with all other tokens. This attention map helps the transformer understand context when it generates new text.
These are only a few of many approaches that can be used for generative AI.
A range of applications
What all of these approaches have in common is that they convert inputs into a set of tokens, which are numerical representations of chunks of data. As long as your data can be converted into this standard, token format, then in theory, you could apply these methods to generate new data that look similar.
“Your mileage might vary, depending on how noisy your data are and how difficult the signal is to extract, but it is really getting closer to the way a general-purpose CPU can take in any kind of data and start processing it in a unified way,” Isola says.
This opens up a huge array of applications for generative AI.
For instance, Isola’s group is using generative AI to create synthetic image data that could be used to train another intelligent system, such as by teaching a computer vision model how to recognize objects.
Jaakkola’s group is using generative AI to design novel protein structures or valid crystal structures that specify new materials. The same way a generative model learns the dependencies of language, if it’s shown crystal structures instead, it can learn the relationships that make structures stable and realizable, he explains.
But while generative models can achieve incredible results, they aren’t the best choice for all types of data. For tasks that involve making predictions on structured data, like the tabular data in a spreadsheet, generative AI models tend to be outperformed by traditional machine-learning methods, says Devavrat Shah, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of IDSS and of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems.
“The highest value they have, in my mind, is to become this terrific interface to machines that are human friendly. Previously, humans had to talk to machines in the language of machines to make things happen. Now, this interface has figured out how to talk to both humans and machines,” says Shah.
Raising red flags
Generative AI chatbots are now being used in call centers to field questions from human customers, but this application underscores one potential red flag of implementing these models — worker displacement.
In addition, generative AI can inherit and proliferate biases that exist in training data, or amplify hate speech and false statements. The models have the capacity to plagiarize, and can generate content that looks like it was produced by a specific human creator, raising potential copyright issues.
On the other side, Shah proposes that generative AI could empower artists, who could use generative tools to help them make creative content they might not otherwise have the means to produce.
In the future, he sees generative AI changing the economics in many disciplines.
One promising future direction Isola sees for generative AI is its use for fabrication. Instead of having a model make an image of a chair, perhaps it could generate a plan for a chair that could be produced.
He also sees future uses for generative AI systems in developing more generally intelligent AI agents.
“There are differences in how these models work and how we think the human brain works, but I think there are also similarities. We have the ability to think and dream in our heads, to come up with interesting ideas or plans, and I think generative AI is one of the tools that will empower agents to do that, as well,” Isola says.

One of the most pressing questions for employers and employees alike is how and to what degree the emergence of generative artificial intelligence will change the way people work.
Revolutionary technologies have the power to create new economic activity and entirely new professions, and natural-language chatbots that use AI to create text, images, code and audio with human-like fluency are expected to be especially transformative.
Generative AI—hailed as one of the most disruptive technologies since the smartphone—is expected to have wide-ranging effects on labor and the broader economy. In a recent report, Morgan Stanley Research economists gauged the groundbreaking technology’s near-term reverberations. Their conclusion: More than 40% of occupations might be affected by generative AI in the next three years.
“It is impossible to know for sure, but current generative AI technologies could affect as much as a quarter of the occupations that exist today, meaning that AI has the potential to augment them now or in the future, with associated labor costs that could reach at most $2.1 trillion,” says Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist for Morgan Stanley. “Within three years, this might rise to 44% of occupations affected and $4.1 trillion of associated labor costs.”
Here’s where Morgan Stanley Research thinks generative AI for work could make the biggest ripples:





Balancing Disruption



Generative AI will increasingly augment or automate job roles and tasks, but accurately forecasting any resulting labor displacement remains a challenge. It has the potential for positive disruption—for example, the creation of completely new roles, or increased demand for specific jobs as costs fall and efficiencies rise. However, Generative AI could also cause negative disruption, such as AI replacing humans in certain functions. “As with any period of technological innovation, predictions of related job losses have generally proven unfounded amid increased productivity, lower prices and new products and services,” says Carpenter.
It is too soon to predict how rapidly these technologies will be adopted, analysts caution, with a recent AlphaWise survey of CIOs finding that companies are in the early stages of dealing with the legal, regulatory and implementation issues of generative AI. Of the survey respondents who said they plan to use generative AI in the future, most said they expected initial projects to be implemented in 2024 or 2025.

On the policy front, meanwhile, the White House has recently weighed in, with labor issues featuring in an executive order       (opens in a new tab) signed by President Joe Biden on Oct. 30, 2023, aimed at ""seizing the promise and managing the risks of artificial intelligence."" It calls for a report on AI’s potential labor-market impacts, as well as ""best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers"" in terms of job displacement and labor standards.





Productivity’s Macro Impacts



The adoption of new technologies generally boosts productivity, affecting not just labor markets but inflation, interest rates globally when new technologies diffuse around the World.
In the short term, increased labor productivity could spur faster GDP growth and lower inflation. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in the short run either because it decides to boost economic activity to a new higher production capacity, or inflation slows due to faster productivity growth. However, in the long-run, interest rates might rise amid sustained productivity growth and higher investment demand.
“Over the long term, labor disruptions could herald an unprecedented demand for reskilling displaced workers and require a significant increase in capacity for retraining that may depend on public-private partnerships to address,” Carpenter says.
To that end, he thinks some combination of corporate investment in reskilling and retraining programs together with government social-insurance programs are more likely to emerge as support mechanisms for workers impacted or displaced by generative AI, rather than more sweeping reforms such as universal basic income.
Indeed, the recent executive order calls for the Labor Department to identify and study options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions, including from AI.
In terms of hiring, a shift to prioritizing skills—especially those that are more difficult to replace with AI models—over credentials or occupation seems likely in areas most affected by job displacement.

New Era for Side Hustles



Generative AI is already proving a significant differentiator for the 5% of the population who work more than one job or have multiple earnings streams. A recent Morgan Stanley Research survey shows that multi-earners who use generative AI tools to enhance productivity or efficiency make $8.50 per hour, or 21%, more than those who don't.
Multi-earning in the U.S. has risen 11% in the past year, the survey shows, with the figures for content creation and ecommerce up 7%.
“The multi-earner era is an evolution of the gig economy,” says Ed Stanley, Morgan Stanley’s head of thematic research in Europe. “It centers on platforms from social media and gaming to shared mobility and vacation rentals that offer avenues to earn money outside of traditional employment streams.”
In the most optimistic scenario, income from multi-earning could top $1.4 trillion globally with generative AI adding $300 billion of that, by 2030.

With tech tycoon Elon Musk claiming that ""no job is needed"" in the future because of artificial intelligence and that you can have a job for ""personal satisfaction"" but AI would be able to do everything, does this genuinely indicate a jobless future?During a 50-minute fireside chat with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the end of the AI summit last week (Thursday 2 November), Musk said: “I think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history here. We will have for the first time something smarter than the smartest human. It’s hard to say exactly what that moment is but there will come a point where no job is needed. “One of the challenges in the future will be how we find meaning in life. So I don’t know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable.“That's why I say if you wish for a magic genie that gives you any wishes you want, there’s no limit. You don’t have this three-limit nonsense – you just have as many wishes as you want,” he said, adding that the world would enter “an age of abundance”.Musk added: “We won’t be on universal basic income, we will be on universal high income – because everyone will have access to this magic genie.” However, Sunak disagreed with Musk, saying: ""I am someone who believes work gives you meaning.”He said: “Work is a good thing and gives people purpose in their lives and, if you remove a large chunk of that, what does that mean and where do you get that drive, motivation or purpose?"" The debate comes as, according to The Telegraph, Labour frontbenchers have been considering a ‘robot tax’ which will target companies that sack staff and replace them with artificial intelligence. 
Hayfa Mohdzaini, senior research adviser for data, tech and AI at the CIPD, said a future of “no work” was one of the many possible futures of work, but what happens will depend on how we as a society respond to developments in AI. Mohdzaini added that key considerations will include which uses of AI are widespread and accepted and which ones we need to regulate or even “prohibit” – as well as which tasks we still choose to do ourselves and not rely on AI to complete. “It’s worth nothing as AI is already here and there are many examples within HR; for example, AI-embedded internal talent marketplace and AI chatbots for employee queries,” she said. People Management asked HR experts if artificial intelligence genuinely means a future without ‘work’ and what impact AI will have on the world of work and the HR function. Importance of lifelong learning“We’re in an unprecedented time where something is going to be far smarter than humanity,” said Annee Bayeux, chief learning strategist at Degreed. ""What this means for our future career prospects is yet to be determined,"" she said, adding that, to keep up, we must become lifelong learners who constantly refresh our skills and reinvent our careers.Bayeux added: ""I expect everyone will still want to work in some capacity.“Of course, finances and living standards also need to be considered; if AI takes most jobs, how will people make a living?“Simultaneously, we have some organisations like IBM, Unilever and Ericsson transforming into skills-based organisations, with a view of completely removing the job construct. In which case, we will see jobs disappear from our future... but work, in its essence, won’t.”Bayeux said that while AI will bring many benefits to individuals and organisations, this must be balanced with the risks that such advances can pose. She said employers must “tread carefully”, particularly when using AI in workplaces where adoption is growing exponentially, and that finding the right balance was dependent on employers using solutions with clear employee benefits.AI will complement humansDavid Collings, chair of sustainable business at Trinity Business School, said generative AI has the potential to be hugely disruptive in the world of work, ""on top of a pretty disruptive few years in the context of the pandemic and the impact that had on work for many of us"". He said Musk was ""probably correct in the sense that most work could be done to some extent by technology"", but the reality was that, rather than replacing humans, ""AI will complement humans in the workplace.""Do we want robots to be the default in law enforcement, health care or education, for example? Even if technologically possible, it is highly unlikely that we would choose that path as a society.”Collings added that some jobs would be eliminated and that as a society we needed to plan for and support those whose jobs were replaced through proactive reskilling and upskilling.Collaborative toolSarah Hamilton-Gill, managing director of Globus HR Consulting, said the introduction of AI had fuelled fears of a ""no-work future"", particularly in light of Musk's comments at the AI conference in the UK, but this overlooked its potential as a ""collaborative tool"" rather than one that replaces current roles. “AI is not a harbinger of joblessness but a transformative force in the workplace,” she said, adding that, for HR, AI presents a dual opportunity, optimising operations and enriching the employee experience. However, Hamilton-Gill said AI’s rise “necessitates a reskilling revolution” and HR will play a pivotal role in managing this transition. “Rather than displacing jobs, AI can redefine a fostering culture, fostering a future where human ingenuity and artificial intelligence co-exist to enhance productivity and innovation in the workplace,” she added.Disruption and change According to Gary Cookson, director of Epic HR, while AI will significantly disrupt work and will replace many jobs, it seems “unlikely to render work obsolete”.He said that would require more than just AI; it would take a “fundamental reimagining of our global economy and what the labour market is”. “Currently people work in exchange for money. If AI does the work, who pays the AI? And where do people get their money from? We aren’t ready as a society to address those issues,” Cookson said.Gemma Bullivant, HR coach and consultant, said the long-term future was “impossible to predict with any real accuracy” but it felt “premature” to predict the end of work and the end of jobs. She added that AI brings huge possibilities but also very real and serious risks, and we will need to “embrace the former while managing and mitigating the latter”.For the CIPD's resources on AI in the workplace, click hereCarry on the conversation on People Management's LinkedIn page

As countless organizations race to investigate or adopt artificial intelligence technologies, many are building out an AI skilled workforce. That includes the decision to appoint or hire a chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO).
Indeed, new research from Foundry finds that 11% of midsize to large organizations have already designated such an individual in the role, and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking one.
Foundry / AI Priorities Study 2023
The ideal individual to assume this role should have much more than top technology and AI skills, says Colin Reeves, principal data and AI recruiter at ConSol Partners in Los Angeles. They should be a champion for smart AI adoption, and be able to recognize and balance AI benefits with risks. They should be able to work collaboratively with many departments in developing AI strategy and vision, and they should be able to design and target relevant business use cases, assess project outcomes, and measure ROI in each case.
 
 
 













 
 

Clear expectations are emerging on the top experiences, skills, and traits that a CAIO candidate should bring to the job, Reeves says. Assuming the candidate passes muster on those counts, the individual can expect very positive short- and long-term impacts on their careers by taking up this emerging IT leadership role, he says.

What is a chief AI officer?
A chief AI officer is a senior IT executive who is responsible for setting a company’s overall AI strategy, including the design, development, and implementation of artificial intelligence technologies. Peruse job advertisements for CAIOs, and one might conclude that the majority of these executives are needed at technology vendors. Many certainly are, but opportunities abound — and are increasing — at organizations of all types, Reeves notes. A typical candidate is someone who has a proven track record of leading successful AI programs, and a vision for transforming the organization with AI.
Candidates for the CAIO role are typically mandated to modernize processes with AI, ensuring that AI is used with ethics and governance in mind, and in building an AI-first culture, Reeves explains.
 
 
 













 
 

The CAIO role and responsibilities
Parminder Bhatia is a prime example of the CAIO today. As chief AI officer at GE HealthCare, Bhatia focuses on AI strategy and execution, which includes utilizing AI to help streamline radiology workflows, reduce scan times, automate measurement, and enhance diagnosis, among other activities.
Bhatia’s team is responsible for the AI center-led development of platform, reusable components, and capabilities, such as building large models and advanced visualization with business unit partnerships.
“We’re driven by a mission to revolutionize healthcare interfaces by integrating voice, text, and the latest in AI visualizations,” Bhatia says. “This approach isn’t just about technological novelty. It’s also about creating user-centric tools that aim to redefine how medical professionals interact with and leverage technology, improve their efficiencies, and ultimately improve patient experience and outcome.”
 
 
 













 
 

GE HealthCare recognizes the transformative potential of generative AI and large foundational models, and is taking active steps to harness their capabilities, Bhatia says. His previous tenure at Amazon equipped him with valuable insights and experience, as he spearheaded the company’s HealthAI initiative. This initiative saw the birth of trailblazing services such as Comprehend Medical, which he says stands out as a premier healthcare-specific natural language processing (NLP) tool on the cloud.

Ozzie Coto, chief AI officer and CTO at The Cult Branding Co., provides another model for the CAIO role evolving today. Coto co-founded the company, served as its initial chief technology officer, and was later tasked with overseeing AI investments as well.
Coto views his promotion to CAIO as the result of his extensive experience in key leadership positions in the past, and his deep understanding of AI and its potential impact on the business. His primary mission as CAIO is to align the company’s AI initiatives with its business goals, and to ensure that the company is leveraging AI in a way that is ethical and compliant with regulations.
 
 
 













 
 

“This includes shaping a future-centric AI vision, orchestrating collaboration between different departments, and demystifying AI for all stakeholders,” Coto explains. “Additionally, I am tasked with fostering a culture of curiosity and innovation, promoting responsible use of AI, and ensuring that our AI initiatives are resilient and adaptable to changing business environments.”
Where the CAIO fits in the C-suite
A chief AI officer is considered to be part of the C-suite executive team, whether they report to the CEO directly, or another top officer, Reeves says.
Parminder Bhatia reports to GE HealthCare CTO Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, and is part of the central Science & Technology Organization that works in partnership with the company’s business segments such as Imaging, Ultrasound, Patient Care Monitoring, and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics.
 
 
 













 
 

For the past three years, Bhatia was leading several foundation models and generative AI efforts at Amazon — technology platforms such as Amazon CodeWhisperer and Bedrock, where a lot of these foundation models act similarly to ChatGPT. But he wanted to have a more direct impact himself.  
“At GE HealthCare we get into the devices. You’re a lot closer, so the impact you can have is a lot larger,” Bhatia explains. “I’ve worked on healthcare in the past, but I think GE HealthCare provided the best opportunity to combine those together and have a real impact on the problems that we work on.”
Ozzie Coto reports directly to the CEO. His role is strategic and cross-functional, and he works closely with other key leaders in the organization to drive AI initiatives. The position enables him to have a significant impact on the strategic direction of the company, and he says it underscores the importance that the organization places on AI and its potential to drive business growth and innovation.
 
 
 













 
 

While Coto works closely with other leaders to align AI initiatives with the overall budget, he does have a certain degree of budgetary autonomy.
“I map out a data-driven roadmap that is based on Kurzweil’s predictions,” Coto explains. “This autonomy is crucial in allowing me to make strategic decisions about our AI investments and to ensure that we are allocating resources in a way that maximizes the return on our AI investments.”
Coto typically oversees AI-related initiatives and strategies within the units that his team serves. His team implements advanced initiatives in their own organization, and then rolls out pretested systems. 
 
 
 













 
 

Budgets and staffs the CAIO can expect
A CAIO may have full budget authority for internal AI investments and external partnerships, Reeves explains. Some will state that they go by the CEO/CFO-set budget, and still seek sign-off at the board level. Typically reporting to the CAIO are data scientists and engineers, ML engineers, AI product leads, and software engineers focused on leveraging AI algorithms.

Why an AI-driven strategy is a must to defend against today’s cyberthreats

By Zscaler


21 May, 2024





Bhatia manages the central AI and ML organization at GE HealthCare, consisting of scientists, engineering, AI program and product teams. He works closely with colleagues across each segment and business.
GE HealthCare allocates more than $1 billion annually to R&D, Bhatia says. The company’s follows a hybrid approach to AI development and implementation, combining center-led development of platform, reusable components, and capabilities, such as advanced visualization, with business unit (BU) partnerships.
 
 
 













 
 

“Additionally, we utilize an internal process known as Worldwide Product Planning to ensure alignment across our company, guaranteeing that we meet the needs of both providers and patients,” Bhatia explains. “As part of central Science and Technology Organization, I am responsible for both horizontal capabilities to 10X accelerate the development of AI-enabled applications as well as vertical AI applications that are focused on business units.”
At Cult Branding, a cross-functional team of IT professionals, leading computer scientists, engineers, and data scientists report to Coto.
“Together, we work to implement and scale our AI projects. This team is critical to the success of our AI initiatives, and I am committed to fostering a collaborative and innovative environment that enables them to do their best work,” Coto says. “Additionally, we collaborate with various business units and departments to integrate AI into their processes. The reporting structure can differ from one organization to another.”
 
 
 













 
 

Coto believes he brings a strong technical understanding of AI, business acumen, leadership skills, communication skills, and ethical and legal knowledge to his role. These skills and traits enable him to effectively drive the organization’s AI initiatives, and to ensure that they are aligned with business goals and ethical standards.
“My ability to communicate complex AI concepts in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders is particularly important in ensuring the successful implementation of our AI initiatives,” Coto notes.
The benefits of the CAIO role — for the IT execs and organization as a whole
Success in the CAIO role can have significant short-term and long-term benefits, both for the individual and for their organization. In the short term, a successful CAIO will help enable AI adoption ad digital transformation, Reeves says. In the long term, it can help establish the individual and their organization as a world-class AI leader.
 
 
 













 
 

Both results apply at GE HealthCare. In short term, Bhatia says his role has provided great confidence in his abilities as both a technologist and a business strategist.
“I realized that I could do a lot of things that I didn’t think I could do prior to this,” Bhatia says. “I’ve gained a lot of confidence from this experience, and I feel now that I’ve done this, I can do almost anything.”

Long term, Bhatia says he would love to see his role make impact towards health-care equity. For example, one goal is to empower clinicians — including those without specialized ultrasound training — to conduct quick and accurate assessments, he explains. These tools will run on multiple ultrasound devices, expanding access to high-quality care worldwide, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
 
 
 













 
 

“At GE HealthCare, our D-3 precision strategy focuses on integrating smarter devices, a disease-specific approach, and digital solutions to address workflow inefficiencies and enhance care quality,” Bhatia explains. “We aim to develop scalable technology that can tackle a wide range of diseases using digital prowess. Generative and foundational models are vital here, as they could allow us to quickly adapt to different diseases for screening, early detection, progression, and even pinpointing noninvasive biomarkers with minimal training.”
In the short term, Coto says his role as CAIO has enabled him to solidify his position as a leader in the tech industry. In the long term, he believes it will allow him to play a crucial role in shaping the future of AI and its impact on businesses and society.
“This role provides me with the opportunity to influence the direction of our company and the broader industry, and I am excited about the potential to drive significant change and innovation through AI,” Coto says.
 
 
 













 
 

Skills and traits of successful chief AI officers
As to others that might aspire to a CAIO role, Coto says a best fit would be someone with a strong technical understanding of AI, business acumen, leadership skills, communication skills, and ethical and legal knowledge. They should also be adaptable, forward-thinking, and passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovation and efficiency. This individual should also have a proven track record of leading successful AI initiatives and a deep understanding of the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with AI, he says.

Why you should consider hiring a CAIO
With 21% of companies looking to add a chief AI officer to their IT leadership team, it’s becoming clear that rising interest in AI is translating into a greater desire for leadership around the complexities of AI in the enterprise. And it’s all about keeping on top of this promising, disruptive technology as it evolves, Coto says.
“I see AI becoming increasingly integrated into all aspects of business operations. For organizations not currently using AI, this means they will need to adapt quickly or risk falling behind,” Coto stresses. “It’s not just about implementing AI, but doing so in a way that is ethical, compliant, and aligned with business goals. As AI continues to evolve, it will become an increasingly important driver of business growth and innovation. Organizations that fail to embrace AI risk being left behind by their competitors.”
Bhatia agrees: “For organizations not currently utilizing AI technologies — I say the time is to get started now. There are so many benefits that will be left on the table if you do not embrace this technology.”
 
 
 













 
 

These can start with small steps — such as embracing devices that utilize AI to addressing training and skill barriers to enable more employees to make the most of the technology, Bhatia says. Partnerships will also be key to advancing AI, so organizations should look to find a trusted partner that can help them along the way to make their AI journey as seamless as possible.
And for many organizations, that journey may best be undertaken with a CAIO at the helm, to ensure an effective and ethical AI strategy is in place and that it is executed to advance the organization’s mission.

How generative AI is changing creative work


Text, image and audio generators offer new content creation capabilities, but they raise concerns about originality, ethics and the impact of automation on creative jobs.

Published: 07 Nov 2023


 
Generative AI tools such as Dall-E and ChatGPT are already affecting fields including graphic design, video and music. As these tools continue to evolve and improve, they raise considerations around copyright and attribution.







In some cases, generated content might not be directly copyrightable unless it involves substantial human input. Regulators and courts are also in the early stages of considering when and how intellectual property implications arise when AI is trained on copyrighted content to create new works.
C.J. Bangah, U.S. software principal and digital platform subsector leader at PwC, said AI has been in place in creative workflows in various ways for many years. However, the latest crop of generative AI tools is increasing awareness about how AI can be applied in creative workflows.
""Highly talented creatives worldwide can use AI to help bring their vision, at scale and with speed, to global markets without requiring massive upfront investments to translate an idea to action,"" Bangah said.
Narine Galstian, chief marketing officer at business and technology consulting service SADA, has found that generative AI tools have shifted her team's focus from the early stages of creating content to later stages by making the first draft faster and easier to whip up.
Increasingly, creative talent must be more involved in the middle and later stages of content production. Generative AI tools enable creatives to experiment with more choices in terms of creative direction. But in the middle stage, creatives need to verify that the output is what they intend. And at the end of the process, humans must edit and refine the content to ensure it's on brand and it accurately reflects the creator's aesthetic or intent.

How generative AI is affecting various creative fields
Alex Weishaupl, managing director at digital transformation consultancy Protiviti, said that -- far from earlier doom-and-gloom predictions -- the design and creative community is starting to enthusiastically embrace new generative services and tools.
Teams are finding interesting ways to integrate these tools into their workflows. In some cases, Weishaupl said, he sees a four- to fivefold increase in speed from the initial stages of idea generation and concept development to the final result.
Along the way, designers and creatives are taking advantage of generative AI integrations into tools to make mood boards, storyboards and visual inspirations, which enable teams to start exploring and iterating on interesting ideas much faster. Generative AI tools are also reducing the burdensome work of content operations for localization and personalization across local markets and smaller segments.
Nishant Jeyanth, practice director at research firm Everest Group, also sees generative AI tools playing a broader role in creative content lifecycles in enterprises. Tools such as ChatGPT and Dall-E are especially useful for crafting first drafts.
In graphic design, generative AI could automate repetitive tasks such as resizing and cropping, while ensuring consistency in design and quality. It could also make the processes of conceptualization, prototyping and design verification faster and more cost-effective. However, overreliance on AI could lead to issues such as a lack of human touch, loss of cultural context and aesthetic fatigue.
For video production, AI tools can provide automated transcripts and video tagging, as well as predictive editing and real-time feedback. Generative AI also shows promise for improving efficiency in postproduction and cross-platform optimization. But concerns remain around authenticity, trust, privacy, content pollution and loss of signature style.
In music, generative AI can produce adaptive compositions, synthesize and enhance voices, auto-tag, and generate metadata. AI tools can also offer users personalized song recommendations based on their mood. However, potential pitfalls include emotional deficiency, overemphasis on predictive analysis and difficulty measuring the quality of AI-generated music.





Generative AI raises new copyright and attribution issues
The creative industry, courts and regulators are still trying to figure out how generative AI will affect the future of copyright and attribution.
""No one has a definitive answer on how to handle copyright and attribution when the benefits of using large language models are so widespread and apparent,"" Galstian said.
Copyright and attribution remain gray areas for generative AI because, to date, there are few cases to show how courts will evaluate copyright claims. It helps that major generative AI providers are offering training data indemnity to soften these concerns. However, this will continue to be an area of uncertainty until legislators or judges clearly spell out how they will interpret such claims, Weishaupl said.
An additional complication is that copyright and business practices vary widely across industries. Written works, for example, have high standards and clear protocols for attribution and fair use. The music industry, in contrast, has a much more convoluted legal framework consisting of minute -- and sometimes inconsistent -- distinctions between copy and interpolation.
It's unclear exactly where generative AI creations will fall along this spectrum, including within the same domain and across different types of content. In Bangah's view, attribution specific to AI learning models will need to be considered from the perspective of human creators and AI learning agents.
""The monetization, access rights and responsibility of the enterprise in navigating the right way to harness AI without violating standards or expectations will be a continued area of focus in the future,"" she said.


The threat of automation in creative fields
Automated and augmented content generation tools could erase some jobs at the same time that they create others and make some existing work much easier.
Galstian said most enterprises will approach generative AI as a tool to enhance creativity, not replace it. Because today's crop of generative AI tools can create realistic yet ultimately fabricated content, rigorous evaluation and quality control will be critical aspects of generative AI-driven creative workflows.
John Singleton, co-founder of AI development platform Watchful, warned that automation could replace entire workflows if one worker is able to perform tasks that previously required a team of 10. Although this could let business users and some creatives invest more time into important work, many other creators could lose their jobs, creating friction alongside new opportunities.


Generative AI's potential impacts on the creative process
Marco Santos, Americas CEO at digital transformation consultancy GFT, said that at his firm, generative AI is already removing days and weeks of time that graphic designers previously used to find inspiration and best practices to inform their approach. Designers can now input a description of a general idea into an AI tool and eliminate the process of reviewing other platforms and sites one by one.
For instance, a designer might input a prompt similar to the following: ""A minimalistic mobile banking interface that takes the user fluidly through a four-step process, showing no more than three fields per screen."" The AI tool will then return several concepts based on best practices it identifies across the digital landscape, often within seconds.
Rather than using these outputs as the final design, designers can then use their own skills and creativity to review the elements across those concepts and conceive of something greater than the sum of its parts. This could include other internal considerations to which the AI doesn't have access.
Nisha Krishan, practice director at Everest Group, said that some of the various ways generative AI is affecting creative workflows in the enterprise include the following:

Idea generation, such as AI-assisted brainstorming and content suggestions.
User-centric content design, such as personalized content that is dynamically generated and displayed based on user behavior.
Agile content production, such as automated content drafting based on content briefs and user insights.
A/B testing and optimization, such as many variations of AI-powered A/B tests backed by user data.
Trendspotting and predictive content, such as using AI trend prediction to proactively create content on emerging topics.
Interactive and visual content generation, such as AI-generated quizzes, questions, enhanced visuals and other interactive elements.
Content quality assurance, such as AI-enhanced proofreading and editing to maintain quality and accuracy.
Data-backed insights, such as AI-generated insight reports that summarize user data and content performance matrices.

 Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to automate many work tasks and eventually boost global economic growth: Goldman Sachs Research forecasts AI will start having a measurable impact on US GDP in 2027 and begin affecting growth in other economies around the world in the years that follow.
 The foundation of the forecast is the finding that AI could ultimately automate around 25% of labor tasks in advanced economies and 10-20% of work in emerging economies, Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani write in the team’s report.



 They estimate a growth boost to GDP from AI of 0.4 percentage points in the US, 0.3 percentage points on average in other DMs, and 0.2 percentage points on average in advanced EMs by 2034. In other emerging markets, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts a smaller boost from AI given adoption will probably take longer and AI exposure will likely be lower.
 “We expect this automation to drive labor cost savings and free up workers’ time, some of which will likely be allocated to new tasks,” Briggs and Kodnani write. The ultimate size of those effects will depend on how capable AI actually becomes and how it’s implemented.
 

           
       
 How much can AI improve productivity?
 In the baseline scenario, the Goldman Sachs Research economists estimate AI could increase US productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points annually assuming widespread adoption over a 10-year period. They expect similar effects in other major developed markets, and a somewhat smaller impact of 0.7-1.3 percentage points in most emerging economies given their higher share of employment in sectors with low AI exposure like agriculture and construction.
 Taken at face value, those kinds of productivity gains would suggest a substantial jump in GDP growth around the globe. Assuming workers aren’t permanently replaced by automation and there’s capital to support the increase in productivity, the increase in productivity could boost long-run worldwide GDP by as much as 15%. But Briggs and Kodnani think the net effect will be somewhat lower than that for two key reasons.
 First, our economists already include technological innovation in their economic forecasts. Simply adding their estimates for the boost in productivity from AI to the current trend would likely result in some double counting. They note that information and communication technology (ICT) investment has already been the main driver of productivity growth in major economies over the last 20-30 years.
 And second, the underlying productivity growth has been slowing. Academic research suggests that growth in total factor productivity (calculated by dividing real output by the combination of labor and capital inputs) tends to slow over time as countries develop, except during rare “regime shifts” such as those triggered by the first and second industrial revolutions.
 Predictions of AI superintelligence seem premature
 Is generative AI different? Some observers have argued that it could be a paradigm-shifting technology that ushers in a new regime for productivity growth. Equity analysts in Goldman Sachs Research have identified sectors where they think this could happen, including in healthcare and drug discovery, cybersecurity, design, and software development. Some have gone a step further and view recent advancements in AI as a meaningful step towards a “superintelligence” that is able to process information, formulate views, and innovate beyond the capability of humans.
 For now, the more extreme predictions appear “very premature, especially given the well-documented limitations of current AI models,” Briggs and Kodnani write. “We therefore maintain our view that for the foreseeable future, generative AI will mostly drive efficiency gains by automating less difficult but time-consuming tasks, thereby empowering workers to engage in more productive activities.”
 In the meantime, much will depend on the adoption timeline. Historically, productivity booms driven by prior milestone technologies — such as the electric motor and personal computer — have lagged the initial innovation by more than a decade. These innovations only began to show up in macroeconomic data once roughly half of affected businesses had adopted the technology.
 
  
 “We have been relatively cautious on the AI adoption timeline,” Briggs and Kodnani say. “While a rapid acceleration in AI-related investment is ongoing for leading technology and professional services firms which are developing and pioneering the use of AI, the effects on productivity that we have estimated will require the implementation of AI across a broader set of industries and job functions.”
 AI’s effects on GDP will take time to emerge
 Surveys of businesses and executives indicate that they generally anticipate a small impact from AI on activity and hiring needs in the next 1-3 years but a much larger impact in the next 3-10 years. Likewise, Goldman Sachs Research expects broad-based adoption to accelerate in the US beginning in the second half of this decade. The adoption timeline may be even more drawn out elsewhere, as the US and other advanced economies have historically led in the adoption of milestone technologies.
 Taken together, our economists’ model indicates AI will probably have a positive impact on GDP over the next decade — but it will take a few years to show up in the numbers. Goldman Sachs Research is leaving its forecasts unchanged until at least 2027 for the US and 2028 for other economies. How the timeline for adoption plays out, the amount of ICT investment that’s displaced by AI spending, the extent of AI’s emerging capabilities, as well as potential regulatory barriers, will all influence how and to what extent these economic gains are realized.
 “Our estimates reflect a balanced consideration of these risks, and provide a template for analyzing the longer-run effects of AI on the macroeconomy,” Briggs and Kodnani write. “In our view, the development of capable AI is likely to be among the most consequential macroeconomic stories of the 21st century, with important implications for relative economic performance, financial market returns, and longer-run interest rates.”

A new executive order on artificial intelligence could help immigrants and temporary visa holders with AI backgrounds. The measure instructs government agencies to implement the order’s aspirational language. The possibility the proposed H-1B rule could make it harder to recruit and retain foreign-born AI experts looms over the executive order.


The AI Executive Order
On October 30, 2023, President Biden issued an executive order on the “Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The order recognizes the significant role of immigrants, international students and high-skilled temporary visa holders in AI.

“Immigrants have founded or cofounded nearly two-thirds (65% or 28 of 43) of the top AI companies in the United States, and 70% of full-time graduate students in fields related to artificial intelligence are international students,” according to a National Foundation for American Policy study. “Seventy-seven percent of the leading U.S.-based AI companies were founded or cofounded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. Forty-two percent (18 of 43) of the top U.S.-based AI companies had a founder who came to America as an international student.” (I authored the study.)

PROMOTED
“Within 90 days of the date of this order, to attract and retain talent in AI and other critical and emerging technologies in the United States economy, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take appropriate steps to “streamline processing times of visa petitions and applications, including by ensuring timely availability of visa appointments, for noncitizens who seek to travel to the United States to work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical and emerging technologies.”

“The fast timelines being imposed on USCIS, State and the Department of Labor make it clear that the president wants action quickly,” said Greg Siskind of Siskind Susser.
The executive order asks the State Department to consider adding J-1 research scholars and F-1 students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to the upcoming domestic visa renewal program. The State Department may also initiate rulemaking “to establish new criteria to designate countries and skills on the Department of State’s Exchange Visitor Skills List as it relates to the 2-year foreign residence requirement for certain J-1 nonimmigrants, including those skills that are critical to the United States” and to “consider publishing updates to the 2009 Revised Exchange Visitor Skills List.”

Guidance On EB-1 And EB-2, Schedule A
Expanding the occupations lists on Schedule A and the directive on EB-1 (employment-based, first preference) and EB-2 (employment-based, second preference) are likely the most positive elements in the executive order, according to Lynden Melmed of Berry Appleman & Leiden, a former chief counsel of USCIS.

The executive order asks the Department of Homeland Security (and USCIS) to “clarify and modernize immigration pathways for experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies, including O-1A and EB-1 noncitizens of extraordinary ability; EB-2 advanced-degree holders and noncitizens of exceptional ability; and startup founders in AI and other critical and emerging technologies using the International Entrepreneur Rule.”
Melmed believes the guidance could make it easier to establish grounds for a National Interest Waiver, helping more outstanding individuals to qualify and self-petition.
The executive order assigns the Secretary of Labor to consider expanding the Schedule A list of occupations after soliciting public input and “identifying AI and other STEM-related occupations, as well as additional occupations across the economy, for which there is an insufficient number of ready, willing, able, and qualified United States workers.”
If DOL lists a foreign national’s occupation on Schedule A, their employer can avoid labor certification and lengthy PERM processing. However, the Department of Labor has not updated the list in decades.
“The case for using Schedule A is stronger when DOL’s processing times are long,” said Melmed. “Today, companies face a 6-8 month process to obtain a Prevailing Wage Determination, and then the request for a labor certification can take just as long. A failure to designate an occupation for Schedule A often means a year-long delay and significant operational costs for the government and the private sector.
“When we look at the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the U.S. can’t afford self-imposed delays in attracting and retaining foreign workers with those specialized skills. Leveraging Schedule A for those occupations where the executive branch has already determined a shortage exists is an easy way to advance U.S. interests.”
Melmed thinks DOL should add several occupations to Schedule A, including software developers, computer programmers, computer and information systems managers, computer and information research scientists, operations research analysts, data scientists, quantitative analysts, hardware engineers and silicon engineers.
Adjustment Of Status
The executive order asks DHS to “consider initiating a rulemaking to enhance the process for noncitizens, including experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies and their spouses, dependents, and children, to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident.” This section likely refers to upcoming rulemaking on adjustment of status.
Proposed H-1B Rule: A Cloud Hanging Over The AI Executive Order
The executive order references the proposed H-1B rule that likely would make it more difficult for employers to attract and retain AI and related foreign-born talent.
“The Biden administration’s proposed rule takes crucial language on degrees from a restrictive interim final rule the Trump administration published in 2020,” according to a recent Forbes article. “Courts later blocked the Trump rule. Attorneys and companies warned at the time the rule’s language would stop many talented foreign-born professionals from working in America.”
The Biden H-1B rule uses the phrase “directly related specific specialty” to narrow the positions considered specialty occupations.
“There is an inconsistency between the proposed rule and AI executive order,” according to Kevin Miner of Fragomen. “Unfortunately, there are several aspects of the proposed H-1B regulation that—if implemented as proposed—will have the exact opposite effect and limits the ability of highly skilled temporary visa holders to stay and work in the United States.
“The language in the proposed regulation could be used by adjudicators at USCIS to deny H-1B petitions where the degree field doesn’t precisely match what the adjudicator believes would be required to perform the role, and with fast-evolving jobs like those in AI, this can change quickly. USCIS would be far better off focusing on the entire course of study—including specific coursework completed—rather than the degree field.”
Miner notes the rule’s restriction would ultimately affect immigrants as well since most employment-based immigrants begin working in the United States with H-1B status. “The reality is that a lot of technology roles, including those in AI, are filled by people who have degrees that are not in something traditional like computer science,” said Miner. “A whole variety of engineering disciplines, mathematics, statistics, operations research, physics, and a host of other fields have the kinds of technology content that is required by employers seeking to fill these roles.” Today, USCIS often looks at the actual coursework rather than the degree field, which would likely change if the proposed rule takes effect as currently drafted.
A More Optimistic Take On AI
The non-immigration parts of the Biden administration’s AI executive order have been criticized as alarmist and potentially leading to overregulation that will stifle innovation.
The Conservative Futurist: How To Create The Sci-Fi World We Were Promised by James Pethokoukis adopts a more optimistic take on AI and other technologies. Pethokoukis writes in his book that the absence of heavy regulation in the 1990s allowed the Internet and accompanying innovation to flourish. “That 1990s lesson should strongly inform how government regulations artificial intelligence/machine learning, including generative AI, given the tremendous potential benefits to humanity.”
Pethokoukis argues if America wants to lead and succeed in the industries and technologies of the future, it needs a more open immigration policy. He cites NFAP research on immigrant entrepreneurs in AI and billion-dollar startups to highlight the benefits of immigration. “America needs all the smart people it can get,” he writes. “On that, economists seem unanimous.” He also favors more open trade, which has veered into protectionism during the Trump and Biden administrations.
“We currently stand at a moment when great progress is possible thanks to a host of emerging technologies,” writes Pethokoukis. The Biden executive order recommends America attract and retain talent in AI so that the most significant technologies in the 21st century can be produced in the United States.

Talent   //   November 10, 2023What’s at risk when using ChatGPT to write cover letters? By Hailey Mensik

Roughly half of job candidates are using generative AI to help with their job applications, leaning on the tools to tailor their resumes to best align with a job description, or to come up with answers to potential interview questions. They’re most often using it for one of the more dreaded tasks — writing their cover letters — that survey, which included responses from over 3,500 job hunters conducted this August found.
As more organizations employ other AI tools to filter and sort through hundreds of applications, cover letters remain one of the only opportunities job seekers have to express their voice and individuality, and to tell a more colorful story of their career arc.  
“If your resume does not fully tell the story of why you’re a good fit for this job, your cover letter is the only other opportunity that you have,” said Jamie Kohn, a senior research director in Gartner’s human resource practice. “But whether that cover letter actually gets read becomes another question.”







            ""[Cover letters] can be an opportunity to set yourself apart, especially if you are in the process of changing careers. Generative AI is never going to capture that narrative of your career,”         


 

                Jamie Kohn, senior research director, Gartner’s human resource practice.            







Some industries lean far less on writing samples and cover letters than others, and are continuing to rely less on them — like the tech space — where technical skills matter most. HR software firm Paycor no longer requires cover letters. “They’re definitely not as common as they used to be,” said Shayna Royal, Paycor’s director of talent acquisition.

There’s about a 50% chance your cover letter will actually get thoroughly read by a recruiter, Kimberly Gottschalk, head of innovation at global talent solutions provider LHH, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing a good job on. 
“Theoretically a cover letter is important because it’s your first opportunity to present yourself, and first impressions are very meaningful,” Gottschalk said.
More writing-heavy professions, like marketing and public relations and research roles still depend on those, and candidates using AI to write them could be doing themselves a disservice. “They can be an opportunity to set yourself apart, especially if you are in the process of changing careers,” Kohn said. “Generative AI is never going to capture that narrative of your career,” she said.

The survey found that among job seekers using generative AI in job applications, about half use it to write their cover letters, and slightly less (49%) are using it for their resumes. Some 44% said they’ve used AI on writing assessments during the interview process, while 39% said they’ve used it to write answers to questions in assessments. And 31% said they’ve let AI write their personal biography for their personal pages on hiring platforms.
The rapid adoption of generative AI among job seekers, particularly ChatGPT after it launched a year ago, means recruiters will have to adapt and should already be revisiting their hiring strategies, according to the report.

How companies should respond
Company leaders are approaching this issue from two points of view. Those in the first camp believe candidates are being resourceful using the tools for their applications, and that using AI will likely increasingly become a part of their own jobs. Those in the other camp are now worried about their ability to determine who is actually a high quality candidate. Much depends on how exactly candidates are using AI in the process, though. 
“I think people are less concerned about resumes and cover letters, and more thinking about those interview and assessment implications,” Kohn said.
Some tips for recruiters to better evaluate whether a candidate is actually a good fit or using AI to make them look like it is to look harder at specific examples of situations discussed in interviews, Kohn said. Those on the hiring side should also ask many follow up questions in interviews to better determine the logic behind a candidate’s answer. 
They should also remain cognizant of the way their filters may sort out potentially qualified candidates, and still lean on things like cover letters when possible and other ways for candidates to better express their personality and working experience. 
More recently some job seekers have shifted their efforts from telling their story in strong cover letters, instead writing directly to hiring managers via email or Linkedin. “So they’re still trying to make that personal connection and tell their story, but they’re just doing it in a more direct way. In that situation you can help to ensure that your name at least crosses somebody’s desk,” she said. 
Royal is seeing the same. “People are using the tools available to them to just find the right person,” she said.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

That’s because working with generative AI has profoundly changed the way I work, what I work on and, increasingly, how I think. Here is what I have learned in my 11 months of experimentation and exploration of tools like ChatGPT, Scite and Claude—and the lessons that may help other people make the most of these new technologies, too.1. Ask for a quick prototypeBefore dressmakers sew a silk dress, they make a “muslin”: a version of the dress made from inexpensive fabric, so they can troubleshoot before using the good stuff. That’s how I write with AI: Before I invest in drafting an article or report that may or may not work, I get ChatGPT to do a quick version. It helps me see whether the idea or structure I have in mind is going to work, and then I can adjust and do my own (better) version.Copyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In times gone by, lawyers would spend hours poring over documents and huge amounts of time and energy on research. But for many of today’s law firms, those days are coming to an end. The landscape is being revolutionised, thanks to exciting new technology and automation.
Artificial intelligence tools can now help shoulder the burden of the kind of work that drains lawyers’ time — from reviewing documents and due diligence checks, to drafting legal documents and carrying out legal research. In 2021, Oxford University estimated that around half of all solicitors in England and Wales were using at least one form of AI-assisted lawtech (specialised solutions for the legal sector). 
And generative AI has the potential to make even greater strides in our legal sector. With the advent of increasingly advanced programmes — like ChatGPT and other large language models — we can see just how much power they have to understand and generate meaningful responses to complex questions.
It gives us a tantalising glimpse into the future. Just think of the potential this could offer to law firms when it comes to improving access to legal services — reducing the time and costs from previously labour-intensive work.
Lawtech UK
TNW Conference 2025 - Back to NDSM on June 19-20, 2025 - Save the date!As we wrapped up our incredible 2024 edition, we're pleased to announce our return to Amsterdam NDSM in 2025. Registration now!
Early Booking = Best rates
Each new advancement brings the possibility of faster, smarter, more effective working, freeing up lawyers’ time to focus on the things that really require their expertise. Above all, it’s a real opportunity to make legal services more accessible for the public as they navigate a world of legal rights. That’s a win for law firms, but most of all, it’s a win for those needing their services.
So, now we are in a new and exciting phase of experimentation and exploration. It’s a huge area of interest for the Government, and for me as Justice Minister, as we do even more to improve access to legal services for people in this country.
In the past decade the UK has quickly become a world-leader in lawtech and we want to help our innovators to continue to grow.
In 2019, we set up LawtechUK as an industry-led programme to support the growth of the lawtech industry in the UK. Now in its second phase, and headed up by CodeBase and Legal Geek, it has been a huge success. Backed by £6 million of funding from 2019 up to 2025, it is a cause close to my heart — one I’m incredibly proud of.
We’re also helping our lawtechs promote and sell their products in international markets. The Ministry of Justice’s GREAT Legal Services campaign and Department for Business and Trade have helped UK lawtech make business connections across the world — including high-potential markets like Singapore, Australia, and the US. The GREAT campaign promotes a variety of UK legal services, and in the last financial year helped to generate more than £6 million in projected business wins for UK lawyers, and over 60 business leads.
Lawtech startups leading the way
The sector is going from strength to strength with each new development. Take Harvey AI, which is using natural language processing, machine learning, and data analytics to automate and enhance various aspects of legal work, such as contract analysis, litigation, and regulatory compliance. Genie AI has created a tool for drafting contracts, drawing on extensive data to suggest clauses. And Summize offers legal contract lifecycle management and generates internal summaries of contracts to assist lawyers. 
RobinAI has created a machine learning model using data from over 4 million legal documents, enabling users to draft and negotiate contacts as much as 80% faster while saving people up to 75% of their legal fees. And Legl has integrate a generative AI layer to enhance client due diligence, reducing complexity, and speeding up the collection of information to reduce the amount of data to be assessed by professionals.
The benefits extend far beyond more efficient legal services. A report from the Solicitors Regulation Authority estimated that AI could add as much as £630 billion to the economy by 2035. And it could create upwards of 14 million new jobs by 2027, as more firms bring in tech specialists and upskill teams — so collaboration and support for businesses really is key.
Isambard-AI
It’s why we’re investing in a world-leading AI Research Resource in Bristol, backed by a £900 million fund, to turbocharge scientific discovery and keep the UK at the forefront of AI development. The Isambard-AI cluster will be one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, helping industry experts and researchers harness the game-changing potential of AI.
But amid all this growth and innovation, we have to consider risk if we’re to fully capitalise on the benefits of generative AI. We need appropriate regulation that allows innovation while protecting users.  
We also need transparency in the systems we create, because if we can’t understand how a decision has been made, how can we explain it or trust it in our services? And we need reliable data to draw from and to avoid the risk of bias and discrimination, so that users feel safe to manage information in line with GDPR and data privacy regulation.  
Supporting startups in navigating regulation
The Government is fully behind this work, identifying AI as one of five critical technologies essential for making the UK a global science and technology superpower.
Just last month, LawtechUK brought together lawyers, technologists, regulators, and other experts to explore what generative AI means for the legal sector and how it can benefit consumers of legal services. They are now leading on work to understand how this technology is being used across the country, mapping out areas of work to improve collaboration and truly grasp its potential. And LawtechUK’s Regulatory Response Unit is bringing together regulators into a single, fast response forum to support startups navigating the regulatory landscape.  
And that’s not all. The new Office for Artificial Intelligence is developing a pro-innovation regulatory framework to address risk without stifling growth. This will be underpinned by five principles which guide and inform the responsible development and use of AI.
Ethically future-proofing legal services
Ultimately all innovation carries risk, and Generative AI raises many ethical, social, and practical concerns. But it’s a risk we’re determined to manage. That’s why our Frontier AI Taskforce is helping evaluate the risks of AI, and the UK hosted a global AI Safety Summit last week.
What we can’t risk is our world class legal services sector getting left behind as others surge forward on the rising tide of AI. By gripping the issues, and encouraging safe adoption — we can future-proof our legal services without compromising on ethics, accuracy, and quality.
And as a long-standing legal services world leader, there’s no place we’d rather be than leading the charge on this exciting new lawtech.

To navigate this shift,  employers, employees and policymakers must be prepared . Ensuring workers can harness the true potential of AI, while setting clear rules that uphold job quality, is one of the key themes of this year’s  European Employment & Social Rights Forum  (EESRF). The Forum, focusing this year on  ‘The impact of AI on the world of work’,  is hosted by the European Commission in Brussels and online  on 16 and 17 November  2023. Be part of the dialogue  to help shape fair, safe and inclusive workplaces at a time when AI enters the world of work. Europe’s policies must keep up with technology, and technological innovation requires social innovation. Even many leading players within the AI community are calling for comprehensive legislation to address these challenges, including ethical standards and clear rules on the development and use of AI. And Europe is acting: as part of its  digital strategy , the EU wants to regulate AI through the  AI Act , the world’s first comprehensive AI legislation , creating better conditions for the development and use of this innovative technology. There is no doubt that AI has the potential to create many benefits for workers, such as better healthcare, safer and cleaner transport, more efficient manufacturing, and cheaper and more sustainable energy. AI also has the potential to improve workplace safety and make for more inclusive and stable work environments. According to an OECD study, 63 per cent of workers using AI in the finance and manufacturing sectors found their jobs more enjoyable as a result.

Jessica Lessin, founder and CEO of The Information, explored the symbiotic relationship between generative AI and hybrid work at The Information’s 2023 WTF Summit with three experts: Rosie Sargeant, project leader, Boston Consulting Group Lyra Schramm, vice president, people strategy and innovation, Google Dr. Rebecca Hinds, head of The Work Innovation Lab, Asana  The Intersection of Hybrid Work and Generative AILessin started by asking how forward-looking workplaces are thinking about AI at this moment. Rosie Sargeant answered first: “In considering how generative AI can unlock productivity gains at BCG, we’re also thinking about the kinds of work where it is important to maintain or even augment the human element – and how we can best enable that through our ways of working and collaboration tools and spaces. For instance, rethinking how we spend our days to co-locate as a team for the moments that matter, whilst enabling our people to do certain tasks like focus and admin work remotely if they prefer to do so.”Without question, AI is top of mind and a high priority for companies today. Lyra Schramm said, “Every single company is trying to reimagine and redefine how they work. With generative AI, you’re going to have this mix of human colleagues and AI colleagues.” She added, “At Google, we're using generative AI in HR around chatbots and more tactical work. We’re beginning to use it for predictive analytics. Next up? Skills gaps analysis.”Every company represented on the panel is experimenting to see where AI fits within their organization. Dr. Rebecca Hinds asked her team at Asana’s Work Innovation Lab to use AI for every possible task for a week. The goal was to understand where AI can add value—and where it simply can’t. She agrees with Schramm about where the current use cases are across the company: tactical tasks such as administrative work, data analysis and content productionThe Fear Is RealSkepticism about AI is palpable within the panelists’ organizations. “Right now at Asana, there’s a tension between excitement, nervousness and uncertainty,” said Hinds.Sargeant agreed, but pointed out that feelings about AI vary significantly within corporate ranks. “There is a lot of nervousness—and it centers around the more junior ranks,” she said. “People need to understand how generative AI can really make work better for them.”This is an area Hinds at Asana has been delving into: “More transparency, more upskilling and reskilling around AI, strongly correlates not only with confidence in employees’ ability to use AI, but also excitement and optimism around the technology.”It’s not just important to sell AI internally, Sargeant added. Companies need to be very thoughtful about next steps. “We’re going to have to go very specifically into individual teams and functions and understand how generative AI is really going to change the work for them. And we need to bring workers along on the journey.”Putting AI to WorkBuilding AI into a company’s workflow is time-consuming, resource intensive and expensive. What does that mean for companies today?Schramm advised a gradual approach like the one Google is using internally: “Start small and do pilots to determine where AI will have the most impact—because yes, AI is expensive.”“The biggest problem I see in organizations today is a lack of visibility into how work is happening,” Hinds said. The good news, she pointed out, is that AI is uniquely poised to solve this: “Currently, there isn’t data to concretely say whether a company’s hybrid model is working. With AI, you can start to answer whether your in-office collaboration leads to higher productivity. You can even find out if in-office collaboration on Wednesdays leads to higher productivity than it does on Fridays.”What to Expect in the Next 24 MonthsThe panelists agreed that the immediate future for AI is all about productivity.Sargeant said: “My teams will be able to create content more quickly than ever before—whilst maintaining or perhaps even improving the quality and relevance of our output.”“Right now, AI is doing a good job of boosting individual productivity. What’s really exciting is the opportunity to boost productivity at the team and organizational levels,” said Hinds.Schramm shares Hinds’ excitement. She said: “It will be really interesting to measure the increase in productivity. We’re all going to have to figure out how to reinvest capital to most effectively accelerate the business.”It’s early days, of course, in the partnership between AI and hybrid work, but all of the panelists were optimistic. “AI is at the worst it will ever be right now. The more we can learn with AI, the more we can harness its potential. It’s only going to get better,” said Hinds.RecommendedWhy Many AI Startups Are Consultancies Posing as Software BusinessesBy Stephanie Palazzolo3 months agoGenerative AI’s Open Secret: Everyone Is Copying Everyone ElseBy Stephanie Palazzolo3 months agoFunding for Generative AI Startups Shifts to ApplicationsBy Akash Pasricha3 months agoAmazon, Google Quietly Tamp Down Generative AI ExpectationsBy Anissa Gardizy and Aaron Holmes4 months agoThe Information Subscriber CouncilLearn more VirtusaPerspectives with VirtusaComcast NBCUniversal LIFT LabsPartnering with startups at every stage!TapOnItThe next generation of SMSDownload Clip",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.theinformation.com/articles/wtf-recap-generative-ai-the-secret-weapon-for-a-hybrid-workforce'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.seo-paywall-content'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discover the transformative synergy of Generative AI and intelligent search in the workplace, as explained by Jeff Evernham, vice president of product strategy at Sinequa. Learn how grounding GenAI in accurate, up-to-date information ensures reliable results and empowers efficient decision-making.
Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming how businesses operate. From writing marketing content and helping developers code to delivering customer service, the range of possibilities for businesses is extraordinary. Its popularity has caused organizations and industries to rethink their business processes and the value of human resources, pushing generative AI to what Gartner calls the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Hype CycleOpens a new window . Amid all the attention, there are now two questions businesses are asking about leveraging GenAI: how can we teach it about our internal content, and can we be sure it’s safe?
What’s the Hesitation?
 Generative AI and LLMs(large language models) like ChatGPT are designed to process and produce text that resembles that of humans. These models understand language and can answer questions in a natural, conversational manner. However, they’re limited by what they’ve been trained on — or, more accurately, what they haven’t been trained on, and that’s the information in your company. LLMs are trained to generate text based on language patterns, and they are proficient, for example, in writing perfect prose and confident, convincing arguments. However, the writing is based on probabilities of words in the language, not on understanding how the world works, so these models can’t be relied on to convey accurate information. This is a crucial linchpin for most business applications. 
When applied to business cases with complex and knowledge-intense environments, GenAI and LLMs suffer from four common problems:


“hallucinations” (confidently presenting fabricated misinformation)
opaqueness (no ability to give or cite sources)
obsolescence (no knowledge of events since the model was initially trained)
ignorance (no knowledge of internal corporate information)  

Combined, these vulnerabilities create a perfect storm for falsehood, risk, and even irreparable reputation damage. For instance, the cringe-inducing case of the lawyer who relied on ChatGPT to craft a motion full of made-up case law and was unaware that the chatbot could lead him astray.

AI Guardrails
As a result of these concerns, the public, experts, industry, and governments are calling for measures and regulations to limit these risks. Progress will undoubtedly be made, but improving the generative AI models themselves won’t eliminate these challenges. Further, the impact on business use is much more significant than private, individual use. A recent Harvard Business Review articleOpens a new window  described it best:
A business using generative AI technology in an enterprise setting differs from consumers using it for private, individual use. Businesses need to adhere to regulations relevant to their respective industries (E.g., healthcare), and there’s a minefield of legal, financial, and ethical implications if the content generated is inaccurate, inaccessible, or offensive. For example, the risk of harm when a generative AI chatbot gives incorrect steps for cooking a recipe is much lower than when giving a field service worker instructions for repairing a piece of heavy machinery. If not designed and deployed with clear ethical guidelines, generative AI can have unintended consequences and potentially cause real harm.”
Adding Search to Generative AI Eliminates These Risks
For enterprises, a different approach is needed, and in the past few months, a straightforward process has emerged as the answer. Use the power of search to find information that grounds the generative AI in the truth. In other words, let GenAI be the knowledge interface and use search as the knowledge source.
This is done with prompt engineering by including the information from the search in the prompt and asking the GenAI to respond based only on that information. With intelligent search providing the information, the response is constructed from accurate, up-to-date, and traceable information – without hallucinations.
 This approach capitalizes on the strengths of each tool: the knowledge comes from the most relevant information found by the search, and the phrasing comes from the GenAI. The result is an intelligent assistant who can answer any question about any information in your enterprise! And it can do it safely – combining GenAI with search provides all the guardrails needed to ensure it’s accurate and unbiased. It also safeguards against security concerns by only working with information the employee can access. 
The Future Is Bright
AI has enormous potential to revolutionize the workplace, making it easier for businesses to manage their knowledge, save time, and improve efficiency. However, the future of using these tools relies on implementing the proper safeguards. 
If we can’t trust the models to provide accurate results, the tools will never be broadly usable in the enterprise. Search provides precisely what’s missing – grounding the GenAI with search results provides all the guardrails needed to leverage GenAI in the workplace. Combining generative AI with a proven and intelligent search platform ensures results are driven by the latest, most accurate, and most specialized information inside and outside your organization.  From there, your team will be able to work efficiently with confidence that their efforts are supported with accurate and reliable information.  
Today, almost everything we do in the digital world starts with a search — asking questions and looking for answers. Search is at the core of everything we do. Still, the search included as part of most applications has lagged far behind the quality and efficacy we expect in our daily interactions with the likes of Google, Amazon, and Netflix. Generative AI changes that. Now that computers can speak our language, powering GenAI with search will transform everything about how work gets done, accelerating the next breakthrough, innovative product, and market to expand into. The future is bright with AI-enabled search.

Our Artificial Intelligence analyses explore the most compelling challenges that generative AI will bring to legal professionals in the year ahead.“This copyright dispute tests the boundaries of fair use,” Judge Pierre N. Leval wrote at the beginning of the Second Circuit’s 2015 opinion in Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. In this case, the author-plaintiffs sued Google for copyright infringement for scanning digital copies of books, without permission from the copyright holders, and establishing a publicly available search function. The court ultimately decided on summary judgment that Google’s copying was fair use under the doctrine by that name.  In 2015, it was inconceivable that those boundaries would be tested again by the creation of generative artificial intelligence and large language models. Now, as we head into 2024, there’s no doubt that generative AI tech companies will seek refuge in the fair use doctrine, as several plaintiffs allege that OpenAI LLC and Meta Platforms Inc. ingest copyrighted books without permission in order to train their large language models. It’s unlikely that courts will unravel the intricate, cutting-edge development of generative AI models in support of copyrighted works. Rather, courts will rely on the fair use doctrine to allow the transformative use of copyrighted works to train generative AI models for public enrichment. The Fair Use DoctrineAuthors have an exclusive right under the US Constitution to their respective writings, for a limited time period, in order “to promote the progress of science and useful arts.” Understandably, US copyright laws were intended to encourage authors to create and release for public consumption “informative, intellectually enriching work,” in exchange for a limited monopoly over their own work. Many courts, however, recognize that the primary and ultimate beneficiary of copyright laws is the public, who consume copyrighted works in order to expand their knowledge and understanding of the world. In furtherance of public enrichment, Congress enacted the 1976 Copyright Act, which codified the doctrine of fair use, allowing the copying and use of copyrighted work in certain circumstances. Fewer than 10 years later, the US Supreme Court took up the issue of fair use for the first time in Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., where the court found that the use of video-tape recorders at home to record material broadcasted on television was a fair use of copyrighted works and didn’t constitute copyright infringement. In 1994, the Supreme Court elaborated on the fair use doctrine in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., where it first considered “whether and to what extent the new work is transformative.” A transformative work is one that adds something new, with further purpose, the court said. It was this very reasoning that led the Supreme Court to reject the fair use argument most recently in Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts Inc. v. Goldsmith. Affirming the Second Circuit’s decision in favor of the plaintiff, photographer Lynn Goldsmith, the court recognized that whether a secondary work is transformative depends on “whether it is in service of a fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character.” The Warhol painting shared substantially the same purpose and function as the original photograph by Goldsmith. They were both portraits of the same person, one imposing its style over another, without more, the court said. However, the fair use analysis doesn’t stop at “the purpose and character of the use.” Courts evaluate three other factors, with varying degrees of importance. The fourth factor is the most important, and considers “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.” Does the secondary use reduce the market or value of the original work and its potential derivatives? Is the secondary use “unrestricted and widespread”? The first and fourth factors are undeniably intertwined. The more transformative the use, the less of an adverse impact it will have on the market, as compared to a work that supersedes the original. In addition, courts recognize that only “traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets” can be considered in connection with potential licensing revenue under the fourth factor. A Groundbreaking Decision to ComeThere’s currently no fair use case that explores the abundance of information consumed by large language models. Any decision rendered on the issue will have far-reaching consequences on a wide range of industries, either crippling the advancement of generative AI or diminishing the exclusivity of copyright. A strong argument can be made that OpenAI’s and Meta’s use of the copyrighted works is highly transformative and doesn’t usurp the original copyrighted work. The copyrighted works, along with a large volume of other data, are used to train large language models on word usage, semantics, grammar, and sentence structure. The statistical data derived from these works serves an entirely different purpose than the copyrighted works themselves. It allows the models, for example, to “generate creative text, solve mathematical theorems, predict protein structures, answer reading comprehension questions, and more.” These capabilities are quite distinguishable from the original work. One of the reasons for OpenAI’s and Meta’s ingestion of the original copyrighted works is to make available significant information about those works (and others) that is otherwise not available—similar to what Google did in Author’s Guild. The copyrighted works are also not being used in the manner originally intended. Moreover, even if the copyright holders establish a market for licensing their works for ingestion by large language models, there’s no evidence that this is a traditional market. Copyright holders can’t prevent fair use by creating or licensing a market for that very use. This may be an unpopular opinion, but one that courts hearing the generative AI copyright infringement claims are likely to make in the year to come.

It’s Time to Build a Career in AI: Here’s How to Get Started
The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020 states that by 2025, greater adoption of technology will transform many jobs, tasks, and skills. According to the study, 43% of businesses intend to downsize their workforce as a result of technology integrations. The report also indicates that in 5 years, employers will equally divide tasks between machines and humans, displacing over 85 million jobs.
PwC, the world's second-largest professional services network, predicts that automated operations will jeopardize 38 percent of jobs in the United States by 2030. 35 percent of jobs in Germany, 30 percent of jobs in the United Kingdom, and 21 percent of jobs in Japan are also exposed to high risk because of automation. Along the same lines, Forrester Research estimates that cognitive technologies, including AI and ML, will replace 16 percent of jobs in the U.S. by 2025.
The data cited above point to the fact that, in this age of disruption, upskilling is mandatory for survival.

In a broadcasted interview with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday, Elon Musk told Sunak at the close of the AI Safety Summit last week, ""I think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history; we will have something that for the first time is smarter than the smartest human...There will come a point where no job is needed.""


This startling statement quickly became viral online, and re-ignited what is becoming an age-old debate: will AI really eliminate the need for jobs?

Yes...and no.

After all, the global AI Safety Summit hosted by the UK—the first of its kind—in which global tech business leaders and heads of 28 countries were delegates, was intended to bring awareness and address the key global threats poised by AI. The focus was not merely on the kind used for specific tasks (such as ChatGPT), but frontier AI, the supercharged artificial intelligence of the future that encompasses foundational models with the potential for dangerous capabilities.

PROMOTED
Some of the likely risks highlighted by the delegates included intentional and unintentional misuse, disinformation, and negative impact on cybersecurity and the labor market. In the subsequent policy paper, the Summit's delegates noted that we should work globally towards a ""human-centric, trustworthy and responsible AI.""
Having humans at the center therefore, means creating an environment where artificial intelligence is run by humans and works for humans, not the other way around. So while some jobs will no longer be needed, others will remain or be created.

AI Is Replacing Jobs—And Creating Jobs
Artificial intelligence has already made ground-breaking shifts and caused major disruptions to industries including justice, retail, marketing, transportation, media, and the biosciences. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2020, an estimated 85 million jobs are predicted to be impacted by a shift ""in the division of labour between humans and machines, while 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms.""

This indicates that although AI has the potential to eliminate many roles, it also promises the advantage of not only replacing them but adding an extra 12 million jobs to the labor market, in addition to boosting the economy.

Some of the jobs that are most easily susceptible to being completely replaced by AI include customer service, executive assistant and administrative jobs, graphic design, data entry roles, transcription services, and market research analysts.
However, while the loss of these roles will be keenly felt by those who have built entire careers and fortunes around them, the key thing to remember here is that the labor market is evolving; and as with any dramatic market shift underpinned by technological advancements, there will be significant disruption which will be uncomfortable and potentially result in millions of job losses. But to survive this evolution, one should prepare themselves and proof their careers to adapt to the changes imposed by AI.Forbes5 Skills For The Future: How To Proof Your Career For The AI RevolutionBy Rachel Wells
AI Jobs In Demand
AI has already begun to create and popularize previously unheard of roles, which will become more of a necessity as the strategic initiatives of the AI Safety Summit are implemented. Some of these in-demand roles include AI research scientist, prompt engineer, deep learning engineer, AI chatbot developer, AI ethics and bias analyst, director of responsible AI, and AI ethics programme manager.
Beyond technology itself, it's essential to recognize the fact that technology is not the answer to all problems. There are fields that demand the human touch and cannot be completely replaced by artificial intelligence, although they may assist in delivering these roles more efficiently.
The job market appetite is increasing for roles that require leadership skills and strategic problem-solving. For example, people managers, program managers, early years practitioners, and doctors will have a very difficult time being replaced by AI—it's virtually impossible. These all require some aspect of human intelligence, empathy, and intuition that cannot be mimicked or left to technology alone.
Humans Can't Live Without Work, So AI Will Complement Work
As humans, we thrive on work as part of our daily lives. Work is more than a means of survival, it's essential to meaning in life. Scientific research demonstrates that we work for reasons other than a salary. It boosts our mental health, and is part of the way we are wired to desire purpose, fulfilment, satisfaction, and pride through making a contribution, and working with others, which in turn, promotes happiness.
One of the most significant benefits of artificial intelligence is its boost to productivity, and performing ""boring"" repetitive tasks for you, which in turn, free you up to endless possibilities and creativity in your work. Professionals will begin to enjoy doing more meaningful work as the mundane is removed and their human creativity is supercharged.
Bearing this in mind, it is critical to focus your attention now on three key aspects of personal development:


Stay aware of ongoing developments within AI—they are progressing at a phenomenal rate.
Explore other career possibilities so you are not left out of work.
Learn how to use AI to augment your work.


Will Elon Musk's vision of a world without jobs become reality? Most likely not. However, the role of work in our lives will certainly evolve as technology advances.

But every once in a while, in someone’s head, a special light bulb clicks on. Years ago, as an example, the mind of George R. R. Martin conceived a story of dragons, ice and betrayal, capable of enchanting millions of readers. This was an idea, a work of art, a talent… culture, essentially. And culture is considered to be so important for a society that it’s vehemently protected with copyright law, so that the creators of this culture are properly credited and compensated. These regulations are also meant to protect — in theory — other individuals from stealing or copying said cultural material. But in practice today, intellectual property faces a colossal threat that legislators of the past couldn’t have imagined: artificial intelligence (AI). Several artists have complained — either via public statements or through the courts — about the massive theft of their work, so that machines can be trained to imitate creators. Actor Stephen Fry recently shared his indignant astonishment at a documentary that used his voice, with phrases that he had never recorded. Scarlett Johansson has taken legal action against an application that used her image and name for an advertisement, without even asking for her permission. It turns out that the future –—with all its opportunities and dark clouds — is already here. One of the pillars of the strikes organized by the Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild has been the issue of AI. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, UNESCO held its first conference on the impact of AI in the world of cinema. Similarly, the EU is preparing a series of regulations that are scheduled to come into force between 2024 and 2025, which are intended to make this technology fairer, including in the creative field. A question increasingly hovers over workshops, studios and parliaments: is AI robbing artists of their work? History, in some way, is repeating itself. In the past, the appearance of the internet drew tens of millions of viewers around the planet, while also offering a world of opportunities to the arts. But, at the same time, the number one public enemy of the last decades emerged as a result: piracy. This isn’t just about culture. The dangers to the privacy, stability, or even health of citizens is of such concern that President Joe Biden recently resorted to a law from the era of the Korean War (1950-1953) to force technology companies to notify the American government about any advancement that poses a “serious risk to national security.” The dilemmas affect everything from the running of the White House to the day-to-day life of any household. The concerns and complaints in the field of copyright don’t stop multiplying. “[This widespread occurrence] cannot be described as theft. Generative AI systems draw on pre-existing texts and images to learn to produce their own. If [the materials are] protected by intellectual property rights, their use may require authorization. What the authors are denouncing is that they didn’t give permission [to the AI systems],” explains José María Méndez, a lawyer at Baker McKenzie who’s an expert in the sector. He insists, however, on distinguishing each incident on a case-by-case basis. David Fuentes Lahoz — a lawyer specializing in intellectual property at Bird &amp; Bird — seconds this. ”The correct thing would be to talk about a potential infringement of intellectual property rights.” This results in an economic benefit only for the companies that own these programs, while the artists don’t even get the crumbs. Both experts also mention another possible risk: that the works generated in such a manner actually represent plagiarism. Iban García del Blanco — a socialist member of the European Parliament for Spain, who is involved in the preparation of the EU regulations on AI — has spoken about the evasion of the law when it comes to AI. While he acknowledges that this is a matter of interpretation, he has pointed out that the European copyright directive — approved in 2019 — does permit data mining and the use of licensed content without authorization, but only for scientific research and development. García del Blanco has denounced the fact that generative AI often tries to hide under this umbrella term. “We’re facing the exploitation of rights of owners, [via the] use of a standard that wasn’t designed for [this purpose].” He has suggested that the European Commission issue an official clarification on the matter, or even modify the article in question. At the same time, future EU regulations want to register generative AI systems and require maximum transparency regarding what data they use, how much they use and how they use it. This is key so that creators can claim their piece of the pie — including the one that big tech firms have already eaten. Brussels is also considering an explicit notice that accompanies any work not created by humans, to distinguish them and avoid deepfakes (modifications made by AI based on videos or real images). Keanu Reeves has thrown credibility to this initiative: the actor is already signing contracts in which he vetoes being subject to digital touch-ups. There’s also another front in this battle — perhaps the most devilish one. Once trained, the machines are ready to generate their own cultural offerings. And, therefore, they compete with the same artists whose work they have been swallowing up. First they steal the creations… then, they steal the audience. “They could have used millions of works [that are already available] in the public domain, but they choose to work with the current ones. It’s evident that [these tech companies] want to compete in the market,” García del Blanco sums up. That’s exactly why the Screen Writers’ Guild got the studios to commit to limiting the role of this technology in the writing of movies. The current actors’ strike is also putting forward the proposal to limit the use of AI in the filming of movies. Companies that want to generate culture through AI may also find themselves facing a specific problem, according to lawyer Fuentes Lahoz: “To speak of copyright, [a creation] must be the result of at least one person. If said [creation] came substantially or exclusively from an artificial intelligence system, copyright protection could hardly be recognized. Hence, the spread of [certain creations] that lack authorial protection could occur.” “Let’s think about a company that decides to invest millions of [dollars] into a system that creates songs. These [productions] could be free of copyright and, therefore, the company wouldn’t have the right to object to the unauthorized use of said music.” “There’s something that’s glaringly absent from texts generated by AI: the soul that is born from desires, hope, pain, violence. The machine has none of that… [All you can do] is teach it to simulate [those things],” explains writer Lorenzo Silva. He — along with many other storytellers — aren’t so concerned about competing with works created by AI, which they consider to be “empty.” Rather, they take issue with the use of their books to train these systems. The novelist Javier Sierra adds: “Perhaps it is easier to copy novels from a genre that follows a structure — such as detective stories or romances — but, in general, books written by AI will cause discomfort in their readers, due to the feeling that they’re always reading the same thing.” Identity theft, professional replacement and precariousness are all fears that have shaken up the cultural sector. Just look at the number of promotional campaigns that already save on commissioning an illustrator, as the machines draw for free. A movement among photographers is encouraging all professionals to make explicit in each image that they prohibit its use for AI. More and more groups — from the plastic arts to the publishing industry — are loudly demanding compensation and justice. Obviously, the arts always draw on past influences. For instance, every author recommends reading a lot before facing the blank page. And there’s no filmmaker or musician who hasn’t watched and listened to something before recording. Isn’t AI then a disciple like any other? “These are machines that imitate a certain style through mass reproduction. They can replicate it [in just] a few moments. The future writer who intends to be inspired by George R. R. Martin will at least have had to have [purchased] and read his books,” answers García del Blanco. “At a legal level, a book or a movie isn’t protected in the same way as other assets, because we consider them to be different [from other products]. We find it acceptable that an author draws on the works of his predecessors to generate his own, because this is the only way in which human creativity can develop. The absence of the human element is what leads us to a different reasoning with AI. [However, this doesn’t stop some parties from] advocating for the protection of works generated by AI through intellectual property rights,” explains attorney José María Méndez. Generative AI — which has been developing for about seven or eight years now — is fed with all the information available on the web. Through the algorithm used to analyze the codes of websites in search of information, it collects everything: from the images that an illustrator uploads, to products available in the public domain. “[These systems] have fed on data that was available on the internet: they haven’t stolen it or hacked any computer,” explains Jordi Torres, a researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. But does this also include data posted illegally? “I couldn’t say if each image or text that is added to these massive databases is reviewed, or if the use [that a company] wants to apply to it complies with the licensing terms of each product,” admits Enzo Ferrante, who holds a doctorate in Computer Science from Paris-Saclay University. Precisely in his legal complaint, George R.R. Martin claims that ChatGPT obtained his A Song of Ice and Fire literary saga from illegal online libraries. EL PAÍS tried unsuccessfully to communicate with the developers of ChatGPT, OpenAI, and Stability to ask about the origins of the information that they feed their large language models (LLMs). Not everything, however, is bad news. AI also offers a universe of possibilities to the entire planet, creators included. García del Blanco himself is aware of this. “Some cartoonists told me that they’ve stopped wasting time drawing repetitive cartoon backgrounds to be able to concentrate on the creative parts that stimulate them the most and are considered essential. The same [mechanism] can be applied in the audiovisual sector or the music sector.” “In the history of humanity, whenever a new tool has emerged, it has never been dismissed,” Torres emphasizes. However, he advocates for its democratization through legislation that everyone can participate in drafting. “Let it not just be a few people who do it for us. We have to get closer [to the process], we have to learn from it and not leave it in the hands of a few politicians or engineers,” he affirms. García del Blanco agrees. “AI is coming to give us a hand. But controls must be established.” It’s all about carefully considering how to regulate and which regulations to ultimately impose.

Large language models, such as GPT-3.5, are at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation. With their colossal neural networks encompassing billions of parameters, they possess a remarkable ability to comprehend and generate human-like text. Trained on massive datasets culled from the internet, these models have honed language understanding, context awareness, and even rudimentary reasoning skills.
These technological marvels are driving a seismic shift across industries. They're the powerhouse behind natural language processing tasks, including translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis, while also lending their creative touch to content generation and problem-solving. The impact of large language models extends to healthcare, education, entertainment, and beyond, promising a future where human-computer interaction is more intuitive, insightful, and transformative than ever before.
What are the Large Language Models?
Large language models, such as GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. These LLM models are built using deep learning techniques and have been trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet.
These models use self-attention mechanisms to analyze the relationships between different words or tokens in a text, enabling them to capture contextual information and generate coherent responses.
These models have significant implications for various applications, 
including virtual assistants, chatbots, content generation, language translation, and aiding in research and decision-making processes. Their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text has led to advancements in natural language understanding and human-computer interaction.
What are Large Language Models Used For?
Large language models are utilized in scenarios with limited or no domain-specific data available for training. These scenarios include both few-shot and zero-shot learning approaches, which rely on the model's strong inductive bias and its capability to derive meaningful representations from a small amount of data or even no data at all.
How are Large Language Models Trained?
Large language models typically undergo pre-training on a broad, all-encompassing dataset that shares statistical similarities with the dataset specific to the target task. The objective of pre-training is to enable the model to acquire high-level features that can later be applied during the fine-tuning phase for specific tasks.
The training process of LLM involves several steps:
1. Text Pre-processing
The textual data is transformed into a numerical representation that the LLM model can effectively process. This conversion may involve techniques like tokenization, encoding, and creating input sequences.
2. Random Parameter Initialization
The model's parameters are initialized randomly before the training process begins.
3. Input Numerical Data
The numerical representation of the text data is fed into the model for processing. The model's architecture, typically based on transformers, allows it to capture the contextual relationships between the words or tokens in the text.
4. Loss Function Calculation
It measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the next word or token in a sentence. The LLM model aims to minimize this loss during training.
5. Parameter Optimization
The model's parameters are adjusted through optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, to reduce the loss. This involves calculating gradients and updating the parameters accordingly, gradually improving the model's performance.
6. Iterative Training
The training process is repeated over multiple iterations or epochs until the model's outputs achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy on the given task or dataset.
By following this training process, large language models learn to capture linguistic patterns, understand context, and generate coherent responses, enabling them to excel at various language-related tasks.
How do Large Language Models Work?
Large language models leverage deep neural networks to generate outputs based on patterns learned from the training data.
Typically, a large language model adopts a transformer architecture, which enables the model to identify relationships between words in a sentence, irrespective of their position in the sequence.
In contrast to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that rely on recurrence to capture token relationships, transformer neural networks employ self-attention as their primary mechanism. 
Self-attention calculates attention scores that determine the importance of each token with respect to the other tokens in the text sequence, facilitating the modeling of intricate relationships within the data.
Applications of Large Language Models
LLM has a wide range of applications across various domains. Here are some notable applications:

			73 Percent Of Lawyers Expect To Be Using Generative AI Next Year... But To Do What Exactly?		

			Survey says AI is rolling into the profession sooner rather than later.

Only around 15 percent of lawyers may be using generative AI for work right now, but that’s set to change in a big way. And quickly. This morning, Wolters Kluwer released the 2023 edition of its Future Ready Lawyer Report, and in addition to insights about ESG work and diversity programs, respondents sounded off on artificial intelligence and a whole lot of them see AI entering their workflow soon.


These are just the folks expecting to be using AI next year. Add in the poor schlubs who will get dragged into AI against their will and it’s likely somewhere north of three-quarters of attorneys will be getting answers from “MachineLearned Hand” by this time next year.
But what exactly will AI do for these attorneys? Probably not explaining international airline law.
According to the report, 77 percent of attorneys “expect it to be in the areas of big data and predictive analytics.” Which is interesting because those are use cases that get a little lost in all the pie-in-the-sky talk about whipping up first drafts of briefs. They’re also not use cases that present much risk. Legal tech has used artificial intelligence to find answers in the data for years. At the risk of oversimplification, generative AI just adds a bit more maturity and polish to the output.




This 77 percent figure is down slightly from 80 percent offering that answer last year, which is probably just noise, but could indicate more attorneys looking outside the comfort zone of crunching big data for ways to use AI.
Regardless of the answers in this survey, this tech is evolving so quickly that it’s doubtful the industry even knows how it’ll be best deployed by next November.
And while most lawyers recognize that GenAI will have an impact on the legal profession, there’s no clear consensus on whether these applications are an opportunity, a threat, or both. Almost half (43%) see it as an opportunity, a quarter as a threat, and 26% as both a threat and opportunity.
Isn’t there a Chinese character for that? Threatotunity?
Homer Simpson references aside, it’s encouraging that so many lawyers see value in advancing technology. That’s certainly not always been the case. The legal community isn’t exactly known for operating on the cutting edge of tech.

But here we are.

<h2>U.S. Survey Shows Generative AI Is Here to Stay</h2>
Puntoni’s research revealed that generative AI has reached a critical threshold, experiencing significant and rapid adoption, leading to substantial changes in business practices. He polled 672 respondents based in the U.S. “Over 50% of the sample is already using generative AI in their work, with many use cases indicated as being already under exploration or soon to be. This shows the tech has already passed a crucial tipping point,” he said.

Furthermore, the study predicts that the situation is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. In the next 12 months, enterprises plan to increase their spending on generative AI by an additional 25%.<strong> </strong>Much of this spending will be allocated to internal teams that are tasked with developing generative AI strategies.

However, the research also suggests that external partners will play a significant role, with half of the businesses surveyed expecting to bring in external consultants, partners, or contractors. “I expect we’ll see very fast-growing lines of businesses for the main consulting and IT outsourcing companies,” Puntoni said.

<h2>What Industries Benefit Most From Generative AI Investments?<strong> </strong></h2>
The study highlights how the most significant growth in generative AI investment will occur in sectors and functions where current adoption is still in its nascent stages. This includes larger corporations, the professional services and retail industries, as well as marketing, sales, HR, and operations departments.

Smaller companies are more agile in leveraging the potential of generative AI compared to their larger counterparts (57% vs. 18%). This reflects their ability to adapt tools and processes quickly, driven by the greater pressure to realize the efficiency gains of generative AI. “The technology can streamline processes and reduce operational costs, potentially giving smaller firms a competitive edge,” explained Puntoni.
<h2>Will Generative AI Investments Impact Jobs? Executives Are Mostly Optimistic</h2>
Despite the anticipated surge in generative AI investments, the executives surveyed are optimistic that generative AI will not lead to widespread job cuts. Rather, they believe it will enhance employee skills in some tasks (48% of those using AI said this) rather than replace human skills (36%). “At the end of the day, generative AI is producing content — that’s what many office workers are doing. On the other hand, this will be a way for existing employees to do a much better job, or more jobs. Which scenario — skill enhancement or replacement — prevails will depend on the function, company, and specific employees,” Puntoni said.

Business leaders polled in the survey anticipate a wide array of tasks that generative AI will undertake in the coming years, with a strong focus on data analysis (89% cited this task), marketing content creation (87%), and customer and competitor research (84%).<strong> </strong>The use of generative AI in software development, particularly coding, also receives high endorsements. “The quip now is that the hottest programming language is English — you can just tell the algorithm what you want it to code,” said Puntoni.<strong> </strong>

The majority of those surveyed believe that generative AI will be used for managing supply chains (71%) and recruiting employees (67%). However, a smaller proportion (58%) expects AI to assist in drafting legal contracts, possibly due to concerns regarding accuracy.

Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that generative AI will deliver substantial benefits to businesses, with executives expecting enhanced employee efficiency and optimized business operations. “A lot of companies can use this technology not just to cut costs but to help employees do a better job. Those who believe the tech is powerful think it will raise both efficiency and effectiveness,” Puntoni stated.

<h2>Businesses Continue to Wrestle With Pros and Cons of AI</h2>
However, the research shines a spotlight on the challenges that executives face when implementing generative AI into their businesses. Key concerns revolve around the accuracy of results (AI has been known to produce “hallucinations”), the risk to customer privacy, internal resistance, and ethical considerations. Decision-makers express a range of emotions about AI, including caution (reported by 64% of those who don’t yet use generative AI) and skepticism (35%).<strong> </strong>

“Concerns revolve around privacy and data: to what extent can we use these algorithms when we’re feeding them with data we might not want to be outside the company?” noted Puntoni. However, these concerns are balanced by feelings of optimism (expressed by 62% of AI-users) and excitement (55%) about AI’s potential.
<h2>Key Recommendations for Leaders Using Generative AI</h2>
<strong> </strong>For those looking to harness the positive benefits of generative AI, Puntoni offered three key recommendations. Firstly, he stressed the importance of embracing an intentional “test and learn approach,” ensuring there is a method in the madness. “Leaders should maximize organizational learning while minimizing risks and share the new insights with others,” he said.

Secondly, companies should establish policies for dealing with company and customer data. “They must ensure technical and legal support in the intentional testing and learning approach, incorporate quality-control systems -- especially for front-line service deployment -- and invest in training for staff,” Puntoni said.

Lastly, he advocates for using generative AI to make humans more productive and capable rather than seeking to make them obsolete. “Far from the doomsday scenarios we often read in the media, generative AI offers organizations the opportunity to help many employees find more meaning in their work and creativity, fostering human flourishing,” concluded Puntoni.",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Knowledge@Wharton', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/themes/knowledge-wharton/includes/img/logo-katw.svg', 'width': 500, 'height': 30}}",,,,,N/A,N/A,"
Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November last year, there has been a wave of ground-breaking generative AI launches. Companies like Microsoft are developing new AI tools, providing productivity-enhancing software that potentially empowers millions of workers to automate tasks like document and email generation or spreadsheet creation.
In a new study carried out in collaboration with marketing consultancy GBK Collective, Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni unearthed fresh insights into the adoption of generative AI and its impact across the U.S. economy. He said that generative AI is relatively new, and no blueprint or recipe exists for its implementation. “Everybody is experimenting, the technology is changing very fast. This paper helps us understand the state of play,” he explained.

AI algorithms imitate real-world systems. The more repetitive a system is, the easier it is for AI to replace it. That’s why jobs in customer service, retail and clerical roles are regularly named as being the most at risk. That doesn’t mean other jobs won’t be affected.   The latest advances in AI have shown all kinds of creative work and white-collar professions stand to be impacted to various degrees. However, there’s one important point that’s usually not addressed in discussions about AI’s impact on jobs. That is: where you work may be as important as what you do. Current trends and projections suggest people in developing countries, where a higher proportion of jobs involve repetitive or manual tasks, will be the first and most affected.   Privileged by geography   According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, emerging technologies and digitalisation are among the biggest driving factors for job displacement. The report states: The majority of fastest declining roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with bank tellers and related clerks, postal service clerks, cashiers and ticket clerks, and data entry clerks expected to decline fastest.   Let’s take an office clerk as an example, whose responsibilities include answering phones, taking messages and scheduling appointments. We now have access to AI tools that can perform all these tasks. They can also work non-stop, for free (or a fraction of the price), without being affected by personal problems, and without having to mentally strain to optimise their workflow. Of course, they’re going to be attractive to employers!   At first glance, you might assume an office clerk living in a developed country is more likely to lose their job than their counterpart in a developing country, since the former seems more likely to implement new AI tools. In reality, however, it’s expected more people in developing countries will lose their jobs. The success of each nation will depend on how well it can adapt to the displacement of its workforce.   In 2009, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union created the information and communication technologies (ICT) development index to benchmark and compare ICT performance within and across countries. This index measures, among other things: 1. The level and evolution over time of information and communication technologies in different countries 2. How each country’s experience compares to others’ 3. The extent to which a country can develop and use these technologies to boost its own growth and development in the context of the capabilities and skills available. In other words, a country’s score on this index can be correlated with how well it adapts to emerging technologies such as AI.   Unsurprisingly, developed countries rank higher than the rest of the world. In 2012, the top five ranking countries were the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Finland. The bottom five were Eritrea, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Niger. Wealth and opportunity makes a difference The World Bank has divided the world by income and region, showing developing countries are among the lowest earners.   Generally speaking, employing people is much easier in developing countries, due to lower wages, tighter competition and less regulation to support employees. The World Bank estimates about 84 per cent of the world’s working-age population lives in developing countries. Similarly, a 2008 report from the International Labour Organisation estimated 73 per cent of all the world’s workers lived in developing countries, while only 14 per cent lived in advanced industrial countries.   That means whatever clerical jobs aren’t taken by AI in developing countries will become more competitive than most people can handle. As World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos wrote in 2016, in reference to the digital revolution,”[…] the jobs where workers are likely to lose out are disproportionally held by the least educated and the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. As a result, the biggest risk from the digital revolution is not massive unemployment but widening income inequality.” These factors will result in an employer-ruled ecosystem in developing countries. These countries have both a higher occurrence of jobs that can be replaced or displaced (such as call centre jobs), and less of the money and skills needed to implement AI tools effectively.   The cost and affordability of AI programmes and algorithms will also speed up this process in certain regions. Critical thinking remains important Experts note AI will create many employment opportunities, including jobs that don’t yet exist. It’s just that not all countries will be well-equipped to make the transition when the time comes.   The Future of Jobs report says “analytical thinking and creative...",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Hans India', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/thehansindia/', 'https://plus.google.com/+HansIndiaHyderabad/posts', 'https://twitter.com/thehansindiaweb', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hansindia'], 'logo': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'The Hans India - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png'}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '1', 'name': 'Latest News', 'description': 'Latest News', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/latest-news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '2', 'name': 'Hyderabad', 'description': 'Hyderabad', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/hyderabad'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '3', 'name': 'Cricket', 'description': 'Cricket', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/sports'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '4', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'description': 'Entertainment', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/cinema'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '5', 'name': 'Photo Stories', 'description': 'Photo Stories', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/photo-stories'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '6', 'name': 'Festival of Democracy', 'description': 'Festival of Democracy', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/festival-of-democracy'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '7', 'name': 'Telangana', 'description': 'Telangana', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/telangana'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '8', 'name': 'Andhra Pradesh', 'description': 'Andhra Pradesh', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/andhra-pradesh'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '9', 'name': 'Visakhapatnam', 'description': 'Visakhapatnam', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/visakhapatnam'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '10', 'name': 'Delhi Region', 'description': 'Delhi Region', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/new-delhi'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '11', 'name': 'Karnataka', 'description': 'Karnataka', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '12', 'name': 'Lifestyle', 'description': 'Lifestyle', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '13', 'name': 'Education & Careers', 'description': 'Education & Careers', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/education-careers'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '14', 'name': 'Business', 'description': 'Business', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/business'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '15', 'name': 'Editorial', 'description': 'Editorial', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/hans-editorial-'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '16', 'name': 'Technology', 'description': 'Technology', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/tech'}]",Whose job will AI replace?,,https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/whose-job-will-ai-replace-835713,News Analysis,N/A,N/A,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'The Hans India - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/images/logo.png'}",,,"['https://www.facebook.com/thehansindia/', 'https://plus.google.com/+HansIndiaHyderabad/posts', 'https://twitter.com/thehansindiaweb', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hansindia']",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/whose-job-will-ai-replace-835713'}",,,,,,,,News Analysis,,,,,,,en,,,,mixed,The Hans India,,,

Quick Hits

President Biden signs first-of-its-kind executive order addressing the growing use and development of artificial intelligence.
The order directs various federal agencies to take certain exploratory steps in the coming year.
Most relevant for employers, the EO focuses on new immigration policy, civil rights issues, wage-and-hour compliance, and labor risks and opportunities.

As various state, local, and international jurisdictions continue to propose and enact legislation relating to AI, the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence is the first broad-based roadmap of the federal government’s approach to the quickly developing AI space.
Consistent with trends in other AI-regulatory developments, the Biden Administration’s focus is on both procedural safeguards surrounding AI (such as auditing/vetting of AI tools) as well as substantive safeguards (steps designed to ensure, for example, equity and fairness in the use of AI tools).
A core theme of the EO is the inherent tension between the promise of AI to help “solve urgent challenges while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure” with the potential perils of irresponsible use “such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation.” The EO lays out the administration’s initial playbook for balancing these promises and perils by encouraging the development of AI through various mechanisms while also setting in motion exploratory steps to impose checks and balances on AI use/development.
Guiding Principles
As relevant to the workplace, the EO identifies certain guiding principles and priorities for the development and implementation of AI, including:
“Artificial Intelligence must be safe and secure.”
According to the EO, meeting this goal “requires robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized evaluations of AI systems, as well as policies, institutions, and, as appropriate, other mechanisms to test, understand, and mitigate risks from these systems before they are put to use.” The concept of testing and evaluation of AI systems is not new in the evolving guidance on workplace AI use. For example, mandatory testing is required in New York City’s law regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has also recommended employers implement testing of AI tools pre- and post-implementation.
“The responsible development and use of AI require a commitment to supporting American workers.”
The EO ties this commitment to labor issues, flagging that as AI “creates new jobs and industries, all workers need a seat at the table, including through collective bargaining, to ensure that they benefit from these opportunities.” The EO further states that “[i]n the workplace itself, AI should not be deployed in ways that undermine rights, worsen job quality, encourage undue worker surveillance, lessen market competition, introduce new health and safety risks, or cause harmful labor-force disruptions.”
“Artificial Intelligence policies must be consistent with [the] Administration’s dedication to advancing equity and civil rights.”
The EO further states that the administration will seek “to ensure that AI complies with all Federal laws and to promote robust technical evaluations, careful oversight, engagement with affected communities, and rigorous regulation.” Interestingly, the EO underscores guidance previously provided by the EEOC that both developers and users of AI may have potential liability, stating that “[i] t is necessary to hold those developing and deploying AI accountable to standards that protect against unlawful discrimination and abuse.”
Immigration
The EO contains new immigration policies focused on spearheading United States leadership in AI development. For example, the EO instructs the Departments of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to streamline visa processing times for noncitizens traveling to the United States to “work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical and emerging technologies.” Additionally, the EO encourages DHS to evaluate rulemaking to ease the process for noncitizens “including experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies and their spouses, dependents, and children, to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident.”
Further, the EO instructs the Department of Labor (DOL) to solicit public input on AI and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) labor shortages for purposes of considering updates to the “Schedule A” list of occupations. Finally, the EO encourages the State Department to initiate changes to J-1 visitor exchange program to attract and retain experts in AI and related fields. Through these—and likely further—steps, the Biden administration seeks to continue to position the United States at the forefront of AI progress.
Department of Labor
The EO also requires the DOL to take certain actions designed to address the risks of AI in the workplace.
1. AI-induced worker displacement
First, the EO requires the DOL, within 180 days, to issue a “report analyzing the abilities of agencies to support workers displaced by the adoption of AI and other technological advancements.”
2. Best practices
The EO further requires the DOL, within 180 days, to “develop and publish principles and best practices for employers that could be used to mitigate AI’s potential harms to employees’ well-being and maximize its potential benefits.” The EO requires these best practices to address, at a minimum:

“[J]ob-displacement risks and career opportunities related to AI, including effects on job skills and evaluation of applicants and workers”;
“[L]abor standards and job quality, including issues related to the equity, protected-activity, compensation, health, and safety implications of AI in the workplace”; and
“[I]mplications for workers of employers’ AI-related collection and use of data about them, including transparency, engagement, management, and activity protected under worker-protection laws.”

Notably, to develop these standards, the EO directs the DOL to consult with “other agencies and with outside entities, including labor unions and workers, as the Secretary of Labor deems appropriate.” Absent from this list is a direction that the secretary consult with the employer community. The best practices structure contemplated by the EO may ultimately look similar to the technical assistance guidance issued by the EEOC relating to employer use of AI, which recommended employers deploy various “promising practices” as they use technology like AI.
3. Wage-and-hour
Interestingly, the EO requires the DOL to “issue guidance to make clear that employers that deploy AI to monitor or augment employees’ work must continue to comply with protections that ensure that workers are compensated for their hours worked, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act.” Wage-and-hour issues have not historically been a focus in the development of AI employment regulatory guidance; this latest guidance may be a sign of more to come in this area.
4. Federal contractors
Finally, the EO requires the DOL to publish, within the year, “guidance for Federal contractors regarding nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems.”
Next Steps
The EO follows up on the Biden administration’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” released in October 2022, which outlined nonbinding recommendations for the design, use, and deployment of AI and automated decision-making systems and guidance from the EEOC on the potential disparate impact of employers’ use of such technology.
As companies increasingly utilize and rely on AI for a variety of purposes, including making employment decisions, guidance from various regulatory bodies will continue to issue.
Employers may want to consider reviewing their current and planned use of AI and the impact on employees in light of increasing federal scrutiny and carefully watch for additional forthcoming guidance.
Ogletree Deakins will continue to monitor developments and will provide updates on the Employment Law and Technology blogs.

The EO directs US immigration agencies to streamline the immigration process for individuals who possess AI expertise, amend the J-1 exchange visitor program and modernize the existing immigration pathways for AI experts, including the EB-1, EB-2 (both of which are employment based green cards) and O-1 (non-immigration visas for those with extraordinary abilities) categories and the International Entrepreneur parole program.Timelines relating to smoothing the immigration processes and ushering in suitable policies, have been set for various agencies to ensure that the objective of the EO is met.1. Visa processing: Within 90 days, the US Department of State (DOS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are required to streamline processing times for visa petitions and applications, including ensuring continued and timely availability of visa appointments for foreign nationals who seek to work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical emerging technologies in the US. They are also required tofacilitate continued availability of visa appointments in sufficient volume for applicants with expertise in AI or other critical and emerging technologies.2. J-1 exchange program: Within the next 180 days, DOS is ordered to consider changes to the J-1 exchange visitor program that could enhance opportunities for AI talent. These include reviewing the J-1 Exchange Visitor Skills list to potentially reduce the number of J-1 nonimmigrants in AI and related fields who are required to return to their home country for two years after completing their J-1 program in the US. The EO urges DOS to consider new regulations governing the two-year home residency requirement for J-1 exchange visitors, including updates to the 2009 list of countries and skills subject to the home-residency requirement.3. Review and initiate policy changes in existing immigration pathways: DHS is required to within 180 days review and initiate any policy changes that it determines necessary and appropriate to clarify and modernize existing immigration pathways for experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies, including the EB-1, EB-2 and O-1 categories, and the International Entrepreneur parole program.The EO also asks DOS to consider AI workers who are already in the US in the development of its upcoming domestic visa renewal program and eventually this is to be expanded to F-1 students and J-1 exchange visitors.Mitch Wexler, partner at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm sums up: “While the new EO emphasizes the Biden Administration’s interest in promoting AI innovation through recruitment of foreign talent, immediate changes are unlikely, though some process and policy developments may emerge in the future as a result of the required reviews.” He explains that some changes, like the directive for increased visa appointment availability at US consulates, are likely to depend on agency staffing and resources. Changes that require a regulation would generally be implemented through notice and comment rulemaking, which can take several months or more.",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Times Of India', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-92877370/92877370.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,Joe Biden’s executive order on artificial intelligence could help experts who aspire to work in the US,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-bidens-executive-order-on-artificial-intelligence-could-help-experts-who-aspire-to-work-in-the-us/articleshow/105042535.cms,N/A,N/A,"

 Washington UniversityWashington University students study computer science at the McKelvey School of Engineering. AI-ACCESS will include engineering students and students within other disciplines to use artificial intelligence to tackle environmental issues and its effects on communities.





Scientists and students at Washington University are using artificial intelligence to tackle social and environmental issues, thanks to a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation.The Artificial Intelligence Advancements and Convergence in Computational, Environmental and Social Sciences program aims to find new ways to use AI across multiple disciplines.The program adds an environmental focus to the Wash U's AI research efforts across computer science and social sciences, AI-ACCESS Director William Yeoh said.“We wanted to also expand to the environmental science space, especially given the reasons, immediate concerns about climate change and the effects of climate change on the different communities within the U.S.,” said Yeoh, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Wash U. “We felt that this intersection between these three different areas, AI, social science and environmental science is something that would require a lot more attention and tools of different disciplines to work in this interdisciplinary space.”The university is recruiting 49 students for the program, which has received $3 million in funding from the National Science Foundation over five years.The program starts as scientists continue to ring the alarm on the threat of climate change. Many scientists say that the world's countries can limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as established by the Paris climate agreement.Using AI to help researchers in environmental and social science can help policymakers better understand and make policy changes and help local communities, Yeoh said.“What we realized is how much homelessness resources are needed has a large dependency on weather and how cold does it get in St. Louis,” Yeoh said. “All these effects of climate change can contribute to the need for people to require temporary shelter. That’s how we realized that this intersection of AI, social science and environmental science that there can be some cross-disciplinary synergies that can be exploited to help solve or inform these decisions better.”Researchers said the initiative allows them to use AI to analyze datasets quickly and process information to quickly respond to problems.“When it comes to issues with climate change and public health in general, we're starting to get these really large datasets that are difficult for one person or even a team of people to go through in a quick time,” said Drew Crenshaw, a Wash U doctoral student and fellow in the AI-ACCESS program. “When it comes to things like making quick decisions for disease surveillance or disaster preparedness, we really need a tool like AI to kind of help us make quick responses and notify the public in a timely manner.”
