The firm estimated about 20% of jobs would be automated over the next 20 years and no sector would be unaffected.AI and related technologies such as robotics, drones and driverless vehicles would replace human workers in some areas, but also create many additional jobs as productivity and real incomes rise and new and better products were developed, PwC said.Increasing automation in factories is a long-term trend but robots such as Pepper, created by Japan’s Softbank Robotics, are beginning to be used in shops, banks and social care, raising fears of widespread job losses.'It's going to create a revolution': how AI is transforming the NHSRead moreHowever, PwC estimated that healthcare and social work would be the biggest winners from AI, where employment could increase by nearly 1 million on a net basis, equivalent to more than a fifth of existing jobs in the sector.Professional, scientific and technical services, including law, accounting, architecture and advertising firms, are forecast to get the second-biggest boost, gaining nearly half a million jobs, while education is set to get almost 200,000 extra jobs.John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: “Healthcare is likely to see rising employment as it will be increasingly in demand as society becomes richer and the UK population ages. While some jobs may be displaced, many more are likely to be created as real incomes rise and patients still want the ‘human touch’ from doctors, nurses and other health and social care workers.“On the other hand, as driverless vehicles roll out across the economy and factories and warehouses become increasingly automated, the manufacturing and transportation and storage sectors could see a reduction in employment levels.”PwC estimated the manufacturing sector could lose a quarter of current jobs through automation by 2037, a total of nearly 700,000.Transport and storage are estimated to lose 22% of jobs – nearly 400,000 – followed by public administration and defence, with a loss of almost 275,000 jobs, an 18% reduction. Clerical tasks in the public sector are likely to be replaced by algorithms while in the defence industry humans will increasingly be replaced by drones and other technologies.View image in fullscreenImpact of artificial intelligence on jobs.

But it warned there would be ""winners and losers"" by industry sector, with many jobs likely to change. Opinion is split over AI's potential impact, with some warning it could leave many out of work in future.The pessimists argue AI is different to previous forms of technological change, because robots and algorithms will be able to do intellectual as well as routine physical tasks.Northern jobs 'most at risk from robots'Automation 'puts half of NI jobs at risk'However, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Major new technologies, from steam engines to computers, displace some existing jobs but also generate large productivity gains. ""This reduces prices and increases real income and spending levels, which in turn creates demand for additional workers. ""Our analysis suggests the same will be true of AI, robots and related technologies, but the distribution of jobs across sectors will shift considerably in the process.""PwC said about seven million existing jobs could be displaced by AI from 2017-2037, but about 7.2 million could be created, giving the UK a small net jobs boost of around 200,000.Some sectors would benefit disproportionately, however, with jobs in health increasing by 22%, scientific and technical services by 16% and education by 6%.By contrast manufacturing jobs could fall by 25%, transport and storage by 22% and public administration by 18%, PwC said. Digital skills""As our analysis shows, there will be winners and losers,"" said Euan Cameron, PwC's AI lead in the UK. ""It's likely that the fourth industrial revolution will favour those with strong digital skills, as well as capabilities like creativity and teamwork which machines find it harder to replicate.""A growing body of research claims the impact of AI automation will be less damaging than previously thought. In April, the OECD criticised an influential 2013 forecast by Oxford University that found about 47% of jobs in the US in 2010 and 35% in the UK were at ""high risk"" of being automated over the following 20 years.The OECD instead put the US figure at about 10% and the UK's at 12% - although it did suggest many more workers would see their tasks changing significantly.AI 'poses less risk to jobs than feared'Northern jobs 'most at risk from robots'Automation 'puts half of NI jobs at risk'",http://schema.org,,ReportageNewsArticle,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44849492,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44849492,AI will create as many jobs as it displaces - report,,2018-07-16T23:07:54.000Z,2018-07-16T23:07:54.000Z,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'noBylinesPolicy': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342#authorexpertise', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E176/production/_99381775_robot-ma.jpg'}",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E176/production/_99381775_robot-ma.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A majority of people think that artificial intelligence will steal jobs away from human workers. They’re not wrong, but that’s not the whole story.
In a recent survey conducted by Quartz, more than 1,600 respondents in 84 countries said that half of positions would be made redundant by automation in the next five years. A separate survey conducted by Gallup in the U.S. found that 75 percent of adults believe AI will “eliminate more jobs than it creates.”

Xsolla Announces New Backend with Cross-Platform Support, Expanded Payment Solutions in Asia, Instant Access To Core Solutions, and Streamlined Mobile SDK Payments



“[AI is] superhuman, and we think [it] will be in every industry [and] replace 50 percent of human jobs,” Kai-Fu Lee, founder of VC firm Sinovation Ventures, told CNBC in an interview last April. “It is the decision engine that will replace people.”
The data doesn’t bear that out, though.
This week, a study published by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) suggested that by 2037 in the U.K., widespread adoption of AI could generate more jobs than it displaces. The health care market alone stands to grow by 1 million (about a fifth of its existing jobs), according to PwC, while law, accounting, and advertising firms could gain as many as half a million jobs.
PwC’s findings jibe with Gartner’s, which in December predicted AI would create a net 500,000 jobs by 2020 and 2 million by 2025. Researchers at the McKinsey Global Institute, meanwhile, concluded that while as many as 73 million jobs are at risk of being automated by 2030, new ones will be created in their wake.
That’s not to discount the concerns of workers in manufacturing, transport, and storage industries, which are forecast to be the hardest hit. As economists at MIT and Boston University noted in a March 2017 study, automation doesn’t just affect the workers it directly replaces — the economic pain reverberates, triggering further unemployment.
Luckily, there might be recourse around the corner.advertisement
I recently spoke with futurist Martin Ford, author of the New York Times bestseller Rise of the Robots, about the coming AI revolution. He subscribes to the notion of a universal basic income (UBI) in the form of fixed, regular payments from nations’ governments to citizens, regardless of their employment status or wealth.
Ford isn’t the only one. Universal income advocates include Stanford’s Andrew Ng, Y Combinator president Sam Altman, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes, among others.
Others, like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, suggest retraining as a partial solution to the AI dilemma, and a few tech titans have already begun to lay the groundwork for such an effort. Microsoft has committed millions of dollars to Skillful, a nonprofit organization that connects people with IT and health care jobs. And Amazon offers to cover 95 percent of the cost of training warehouse employees for careers outside of the company.advertisement
Still others propose a tax or penalty on the use of AI. Last February, European Union lawmakers considered levying a tax on robot owners to cover training for workers who would lose their jobs, and those lawmakers aren’t the only ones. In September, San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim launched a campaign to push for a “robot tax” on business owners who choose to replace humans with algorithms.
One thing’s clear: The AI transition isn’t going to be easy. In developed countries like the U.S., automation is likely to lead to greater income inequality. A report from U.K. charity Sutton Trust forecast that wealthier workers’ access to education, the rising importance of “soft skills” like communication, and a reduction in “stepping stone” jobs and internships could entrench the divide between rich and poor.
But executives like Mimi Spier, vice president of VMware’s internet of things (IoT) business, take the optimistic view.advertisement
“We’ve long believed that the AI fear of ‘man vs. machine’ is hyperbole, and that ‘man alongside machine’ is the real opportunity — not a threat to today’s workforce,” Spier told VentureBeat in an email. “[There’s a] widen[ing] skills gap between traditional and machine-augmented work, but it also creates a real need for new training, new types of experts, and, ultimately, a shift from the workforce we know to a workforce open to endless possibilities, as far as new skills, productivity, and contributions by humans made hand-in-hand with machines.”

It’s impossible to say precisely how artificial intelligence will disrupt the job market, so researchers at PwC have taken a bird’s-eye view and pointed to the results of sweeping economic changes.

Their prediction, in a new report out Tuesday, is that it will all balance out in the end.
More automation in trucks, factories and elsewhere could cost around 7 million existing jobs in the U.K. by 2037. But the rise in robots and machine-learning software will make the country more productive over the next two decades, growing at a 2% annual clip, to put nearly the same number of jobs back in the system: 7.2 million, PwC estimates.
To be clear, those new jobs won’t involve building robots or coding AI-powered software, which will make up only around 5% of employment, says John Hawksworth, PwC’s chief economist.
PROMOTED
Instead, around 1.5 million, or 22%, of the new jobs will be in health and social work. Demand will rise for areas “that require a human touch and aren’t so easy to automate,” Hawksworth told Forbes, all the more necessary as the population ages.

Most of that growth, though, is just a by-product of a bigger economy.
More taxes will go into government coffers, which will mean more funding for the U.K.’s National Health Service. “Economic growth will promote higher tax revenues for the government to spend more on the NHS, including bringing in more staff,” he says.
Other studies have come to broadly similar conclusions, including one by Oxford Economics in December 2017, Hawsworth adds.
The public and press have become obsessed with the notion that AI will blow a gaping hole in the global economy and leave us all jobless and penniless, but they tend to tend to dismiss the potential productivity gains that AI will bring to boost GDP, says the economist.

Such shifts and rebalancing have happened before, albeit in a more painful way. “In previous industrial revolutions in the U.K., huge numbers of people moving from farms to factories had to develop new skills. Initially that was bad news for people who didn’t want to make that adjustment.”
The Nottingham weavers who were replaced by automatic looms didn’t benefit from a welfare state or government programs aimed at retraining people.
These modern programs will probably become more visible in the coming years.
France’s President Macron has recently pushed for an $18 billion training program to help lower unemployment, and the British government also announced a national retraining program in November 2017, in partnership with industry bodies and trade unions.
That may be helpful, as the coming shift will affect everyone, even consultants who write reports about the impact of AI on jobs.
When PwC combed through OECD data for jobs most likely to be automated, it was a task too big for humans to do quickly.
“We analyzed it using machine-learning algorithms,” Hawksworth says. “There’s a sort of irony in it.”Follow me on Twitter. Send me a secure tip. Parmy OlsonI cover developments in AI, robotics, chatbots, digital assistants and emerging tech in Europe.

One of the most important aspect of this research work is getting computers to understand visual information (images and videos) generated everyday around us. This field of getting computers to perceive and understand visual information is known as computer vision.During the rise of artificial intelligence research in the 1950s to the 1980s, computers were manually given instructions on how to recognize images, objects in images and what features to look out for. This method are traditional algorithms and were called Expert Systems, as they require that humans take the pain of identifying features for each unique scene of object that has to be recognize and representing these features in mathematical models that the computer can understand. That involves a whole lot of tedious work because there are hundreds and thousands of various ways an object can be represented and there are thousands (or even millions) of different scenes and objects that uniquely exist, and therefore finding the optimized and accurate mathematical models to represent all the possible features of each objects or scene, and for all possible objects or scene is more of work that will last forever.Then, in the 1990s, the concept of Machine Learning was introduced and it ushered in an era in which instead of telling computers what to look out for in recognizing scenes and objects in images and videos, we can instead design algorithms that will make computers to learn how to recognize scenes and objects in images by itself, just like a child learns to understand his/her environment by exploring. Machine learning opened the way for computers to learn to recognize almost any scene or object we want them too.With the emergence of powerful computers such as the NVIDIA GPUs and state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms for image recognition such as AlexNet in 2012 by Alex Krizhevsky et al, ResNet in 2015 by Kaeming He et al, SqueezeNet in 2016 by Forrest Landola et al, DenseNet in 2016 by Gao Huang et al, to mention a few, it is possible to put together a number of pictures (more like image books for computers) and define an artificial intelligence model to learn features of scenes and objects in these pictures by itself and use the knowledge gained from the learning process to recognize all other instance of the type of scene or objects it will encounter after.To train an artificial intelligence model that can recognize whatever you want it to recognize in pictures, it traditional involves lots of expertise in Applied Mathematics and use of Deep Learning libraries, not to mention the amount of time involved and stress you have to go through to write the code for the algorithm and fit the code to your images. This is where we have provided our solutions.Our team at AI Commons has developed a python library that can let you train an artificial intelligence model that can recognize any object you want it to recognize in images using just 5 simple lines of python code. The python library is ImageAI , a library built to let students, developers and researchers with all levels of expertise to build systems and applications with state-of-the-art computer vision capabilities using between 5 to 15 simple lines of code. Now, let us walk you through creating your first artificial intelligence model that can recognize whatever you want it to.To train your artificial intelligence model, you need a collection of images called a dataset. A dataset contains hundreds to thousands of sample images of objects you want your artificial intelligence model to recognize. But you don’t have worry! We are not asking you to go and download thousands of pictures right now just to train your artificial intelligence model. For this tutorial, we have provided a dataset called IdenProf. IdenProf (Identifiable Professionals) is a dataset that contains 11,000 pictures of 10 different professionals that humans can see and recognize their jobs by their mode of dressing. The classes of professionals whose pictures are in this dataset are as below:· Chef· Doctor· Engineer· Farmer· Firefighter· Judge· Mechanic· Pilot· Police· WaiterThis dataset is split into 9000 (900 pictures for each profession) pictures to train the artificial intelligence model and 2000 (200 pictures for each profession) pictures to test the performance of the artificial intelligence model as it is training. IdenProf has been properly arranged and made ready for training your artificial intelligence model to recognize professionals by their mode of dressing. For reference purposes, if you are using your own image dataset, you must collect at least 500 pictures for each object or scene you want your artificial intelligence model to recognize. To train any image dataset you collect yourself with ImageAI, you must arrange the images in folders as seen in the example below:idenprof//train//chef// 900 images of chefsidenprof//train//doctor// 900 images of doctorsidenprof//train//engineer// 900 images of engineeridenprof//train//farmer// 900 images of farmersidenprof//train//firefighter// 900 images of firefightersidenprof//train//judge// 900 images of judgesidenprof//train//mechanic// 900 images of mechanicsidenprof//train//pilot// 900 images of pilotsidenprof//train//chef// 900 images of chefidenprof//train//police// 900 images of policeidenprof//train//waiter// 900 images of waitersidenprof//test//chef// 200 images of chefsidenprof//test//doctor// 200 images of doctorsidenprof//test//engineer// 200 images of engineeridenprof//test//farmer// 200 images of farmersidenprof//test//firefighter// 200 images of firefightersidenprof//test//judge// 200 images of judgesidenprof//test//mechanic// 200 images of mechanicsidenprof//test//pilot// 200 images of pilotsidenprof//test//chef// 200 images of chefidenprof//test//police// 200 images of policeidenprof//test//waiter// 200 images of waitersNow that you have understand how to prepare own image dataset for training artificial intelligence models, we will now proceed with guiding you training an artificial intelligence model to recognize professionals using ImageAI.· First you must download the zip of IdenProf dataset via this link. Also you can view all the details and sample results of artificial intelligence models trained to recognize professions in the IdenProf GitHub repository whose link is below.https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/IdenProf· Because training artificial intelligence models require high performance computer systems, I strongly advice that you ensure your computer/laptop that you want to use for this training has NVIDIA GPU. Alternatively, you can use Google Colab for this experiment has it offers a free NVIDIA K80 GPU for experiments.· Then you have to install ImageAI and its dependencies.Install Python 3.7.6 and pip(Skip this section if you already have Python 3.7.6)Python Release Python 3.7.6Release Date: Dec. 18, 2019 There are now newer bugfix releases of Python 3.7 that supersede 3.7.6 and Python 3.8 is…www.python.orgInstall ImageAI and dependencies(Skip any of the installation instruction in this section if you already have the library installed )- Tensorflowpip install tensorflow==2.4.0- Otherspip install keras==2.4.3 numpy==1.19.3 pillow==7.0.0 scipy==1.4.1 h5py==2.10.0 matplotlib==3.3.2 opencv-python keras-resnet==0.2.0Install the ImageAI librarypip install imageai --upgrade· Create a python file with any name you want to give it, for example “FirstTraining.py”.· Copy the zip of the IdenProf dataset into the folder where your Python file is. Then unzip it into the same folder.· Then copy the code below into the python file (e.g FirstTraining.py).That’s it! That’s all the code you need to train your artificial intelligence model. Before you run the code to start the training, let us explain the code.In the first line, we imported ImageAI’s model training class. In the second line we, created an instance of the model training class. In the third line, we set the model type to ResNet50 (there are four model types available which are MobileNetv2, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121). In the fourth line, we set the data directory (dataset directory) to the folder of the dataset zip file you unzipped. Then in the fifth line, we call the trainModel function and specified the following values: • number_objects : This refers to the number of different types of professionals in the IdenProf dataset.• num_experiments : This is the number of times the model trainer will study all the images in the idenprof dataset in order to achieve maximum accuracy.• Enhance_data (Optional) : This is to tell the model trainer to create modified copies of the images in the IdenProf dataset to ensure maximum accuracy is achieved.• batch_size: This refers to the number of images the set that the model trainer will study at once, until it has studied all the images in the IdenProf dataset.• Show_network_summary (Optional) : This is to show the structure of the model type you are using to train the artificial intelligence model.Now you can start run the Python file and start the training. When the training starts, you will see results like the one below:=====================================Total params: 23,608,202Trainable params: 23,555,082Non-trainable params: 53,120______________________________________Using Enhanced Data GenerationFound 4000 images belonging to 4 classes.Found 800 images belonging to 4 classes.JSON Mapping for the model classes saved to  C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\json\model_class.jsonNumber of experiments (Epochs) :  200Epoch 1/100 1/280 [>.............................] - ETA: 52s - loss: 2.3026 - acc: 0.25002/280 [>.............................] - ETA: 52s - loss: 2.3026 - acc: 0.25003/280 [>.............................] - ETA: 52s - loss: 2.3026 - acc: 0.2500..............................,..............................,..............................,279/280 [===========================>..] - ETA: 1s - loss: 2.3097 - acc: 0.0625Epoch 00000: saving model to C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\models\model_ex-000_acc-0.100000.h5280/280 [==============================] - 51s - loss: 2.3095 - acc: 0.0600 - val_loss: 2.3026 - val_acc: 0.1000Let us explain the details shown above:1. The statement “JSON Mapping for the model classes saved to C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\json\model_class.json” means the model trainer has saved a JSON file for the idenprof dataset which you can use to recognize other pictures with the custom image prediction class (explanation available as you read further).2. The line Epoch 1/200 means the network is performing the first training of the targeted 200  3. The line 1/280 [>………………………..] — ETA: 52s — loss: 2.3026 — acc: 0.2500 represents the number of batches that has been trained in the present experiment 4. The line Epoch 00000: saving model to C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\models\model_ex-000_acc-0.100000.h5 refers to the model saved after the present training. The ex_000 represents the experiment at this stage while the acc0.100000 and valacc: 0.1000 represents the accuracy of the model on the test images after the present experiment (maximum value value of accuracy is 1.0). This result helps to know the best performed model you can use for custom image prediction.Once you are done training your artificial intelligence model, you can use the “CustomImagePrediction” class to perform image prediction with you’re the model that achieved the highest accuracy.Just in case you have not been able to train the artificial intelligence model yourself due to lack of accessing an NVIDIA GPU, for the purpose of this tutorial, we have provided an artificial intelligence model we have trained on the IdenProf dataset which you can use right now to predict new images of any of the 10 professionals that is in the dataset. This model achieved over 79% accuracy after 61 training experiments. Click this link to download the model. Also, if you have not perform the training yourself, also download the JSON file of the idenprof model via this link. Then, you are ready to start recognizing professionals using the trained artificial intelligence model. Just follow the instructions below.Next, create another Python file and give it a name, for example FirstCustomImageRecognition.py . Copy the artificial intelligence model you downloaded above or the one you trained that achieved the highest accuracy and paste it to the folder where your new python file (e.g FirstCustomImageRecognition.py ) . Also copy the JSON file you downloaded or was generated by your training and paste it to the same folder as your new python file. Copy a sample image(s) of any professional that fall into the categories in the IdenProf dataset to the same folder as your new python file.Then copy the code below and put it into your new python fileView sample image and result below.waiter  :  99.99997615814209chef  :  1.568847380895022e-05judge  :  1.0255866556008186e-05That was easy! Now let’s explain the code above that produced this prediction result.The first and second lines of code above imports the ImageAI’s CustomImageClassification class for predicting and recognizing images with trained models and the python os class. The third line of code creates a variable which holds the reference to the path that contains your python file (in this example, your FirstCustomImageRecognition.py) and the ResNet50 model file you downloaded or trained yourself. In the above code, we created an instance of the CustomImageClassification() class in the fourth line, then we set the model type of the prediction object to ResNet50 by calling the .setModelTypeAsResNet50() in the fifth line and then we set the model path of the prediction object to the path of the artificial intelligence model file (idenprof_061–0.7933.h5) we copied to the project folder folder in the sixth line. In the seventh line, we set the path of the JSON file we copied to the folder in the seventh line and loaded the model in the eightieth line. Finally, we ran prediction on the image we copied to the folder and print out the result to the Command Line Interface.So far, you have learnt how to use ImageAI to easily train your own artificial intelligence model that can predict any type of object or set of objects in an image.If you will like to know everything about how image recognition works with links to more useful and practical resources, visit the Image Recognition Guide linked below.Image Recognition GuideNow that we know a bit about what image recognition is, the distinctions between different types of image recognition…www.fritz.aiYou can find all the details and documentation use ImageAI for training custom artificial intelligence models, as well as other computer vision features contained in ImageAI on the official GitHub repository.OlafenwaMoses/ImageAIAn open-source python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems with self-contained Deep…github.comIf you find this article helpful and enjoyed it, kindly give it a clap.

With artificial intelligence, machines can now examine thousands of medical images – and billions of pixels within these images – to identify patterns too subtle for a radiologist or pathologist to identify.
The machine then uses this information to identify the presence of a disease or estimate its aggressiveness, likelihood of survival or potential response to treatment. 
We are engineers at the Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics. Our team works with physicians and statisticians to develop and validate these kinds of tools.
Many worry that this technology aims to replace doctors. But we believe the technology will work in tandem with humans, making them more efficient and helping with decisions on complicated cases.
Machine learning and medical images
In one study, researchers at Stanford showed that machines were just as accurate as trained dermatologists in distinguishing skin cancers from benign lesions in 100 test images. 
In another, computer scientists at Google used an AI approach called deep learning to accurately identify which patients had diabetic retinopathy – a constellation of changes in the retina due to diabetes – from high-resolution photographs of the retina. Another deep learning project at Google successfully predicted cardiovascular disease risk from retina images. 
Our group has been developing new ways to identify disease in scans like MRI and CT, as well as digitized tissue slide images. 
In biopsied images of heart tissue from 105 patients with heart disease, our algorithms predicted with high accuracy which patients would go on to have heart failure. 
In another study involving MRI scans from prostate cancer patients, our computer algorithms identified clinically significant disease in more than 70 percent of cases where radiologists missed it. In half of the cases where radiologists mistakenly thought that the patient had aggressive prostate cancer, the machine was able to correctly identify that no clinically significant disease was present.

Predicting outcomes and treatment response
Our team has also been developing approaches to predict a patient’s response to specific therapies and monitor early treatments.
Take the case of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy drugs boost the body’s own immune defenses to fight against the cancer. They have shown tremendous promise in comparison to traditional chemotherapy, but certain caveats limit their widespread use. Only about 1 in 5 patients with lung cancer might actually respond to immunotherapy regimens. Additionally, these therapies cost upwards of US$200,000 per patient per year and can have toxic effects on the immune system. Physicians need a way to determine accurately which patients might benefit. 
To identify the likelihood of a successful response before therapy begins, our lab is building software to examine routine diagnostic CT scans of lung tumors. The software looks at tumor texture, intensity and shape, as well as the shape of vessels feeding the nodules. This information might help oncologists optimize the therapy dosage or alter a patient’s treatment plan. 
There are many cancers and other diseases where computational tools to predict disease aggressiveness or treatment response could aid physicians. For example, a study published in 2018 compared women with breast cancer who had been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or standard endocrine therapy. For about 70 percent of the patients, the chemotherapy had no demonstrated benefit compared to the standard approach. Preventing unnecessary and often deleterious chemotherapy thus becomes a key issue for doctors. However, currently, the only way to predict outcome depends upon expensive genomic tests that destroy tissue. 
We have been working on a new way to interrogate digitized tissue images from biopsies of the breast. Our new project is testing the technology on women with breast cancers at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India.
Making it possible
There is a massive opportunity for clinicians, radiologists and pathologists to enrich their decisions with artificial intelligence. That’s particularly true when it comes to building treatment plans tailored to the individual patient. 
Before such technology can be used in hospitals, researchers like ourselves need to do further tests to ensure it’s reliable and valid. This can be done by carrying out tests at multiple medical institutions. 
It’s also important for physicians to be able to interpret the technology. They’re unlikely to adopt technology that cannot be explained by existing biology research. For example, our lung tumor software looks at vessel shape because studies show that the degree of convolutedness of the vessels feeding the tumor can negatively affect drug delivery. 
That’s why it’s crucial artificial intelligence researchers like ourselves engage clinicians early in the development process as equal collaborators.

Thousands of AI researchers sign letter forgoing work on autonomous weapons.

More than 2,400 people at 160-plus tech companies, including the founders and top researchers at Google’s DeepMind subsidiary, have signed a pledge not to work on autonomous weapons. Their vow is contained in a July 18 letter to “governments and government leaders” that asks for “strong international norms, regulations and laws against lethal autonomous weapons.”“Thousands of AI researchers agree that by removing the risk, attributability, and difficulty of taking human lives, lethal autonomous weapons could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression, especially when linked to surveillance and data systems,” reads the letter, organized by the Future of Life Institute. “The unilateral actions of a single group could too easily spark an arms race that the international community lacks the technical tools and global governance systems to manage. Stigmatizing and preventing such an arms race should be a high priority for national and global security.”Among the signers are Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founders of the neural-networking software company DeepMind. Acquired by Google in 2014, DeepMind made headlines around the world last year when its AlphaGo neural network defeated the world’s best human Go player. This feat, a first for an artificial intelligence, represented an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous efforts to apply AI to simpler endeavors, such as chess, in part because Go is an exponentially more complex game. While there are roughly 30 branching moves in chess, there are more than 200 in Go.Hassabis, in particular, has not been shy in expressing reservations about the militarization of artificial intelligence; he has signed similar letters from the Future of Life Institute.The U.S. military is keenly interested in advancing AI projects similar to Project Maven, an Air Force image-classification program developed with Google’s help. About a dozen Google employees resigned in protest against the contract, and Google leaders decided not to renew it when it expires next year.Still, Google Cloud head Diane Greene has been courting Pentagon business and, in particular, the huge JEDI cloud contract. Google’s artificial intelligence prowess is seen as key to their pitch for the contract.The pledge does not keep DeepMind from doing work for the military, or even applying a neural net like AlphaGo to an image-classification problem — all of which helps the military as an institution become more lethal.Air Force and other military officials generally contend that neither artificial intelligence nor Google workers are involved in designating, much less striking, targets. The military operates under a 2012 directive that requires human involvement in any decision about taking a life.

News Tech   A.I. Would Create “Winners And Losers” Equally In Job Sector: Report ByCharanjeet Singh 
July 17, 2018         Source: TM Magazine  Billionaires and philanthropist argue from time to time whether Artificial Intelligence would help the society, or, instead, manifest into something horrifying (John Connor might be needed) A recent report claims that AI would create “winners and losers,” not in the resistance, but in the job sector. The PwC Global Artificial Intelligence Study concluded that Artificial Intelligence would create as many jobs in the UK as it will displace over the next 20 years.          The report also claims the “no human in the loop” approach will ultimately mean few job displacement in the industrial sector. A.I. would take over manufacturing jobs by 25%, transport, and storage by 22% and public administration by 18% However, AI would also generate new opportunities compensating the displacement by boosting at least 200,000 jobs alone in the UK.        “Major new technologies, from steam engines to computers, displace some existing jobs but also generate large productivity gains,” said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC “This reduces prices and increases real income and spending levels, which in turn creates demand for additional workers. The report also concluded that China and North America would see the greatest gains from AI, boosting their GDP by 26% and 14% by 2030 respectively. Source: BBC The report predicts that few sectors will see the biggest gain as AI would increase productivity, product quality, and consumption.         Retail Financial services Healthcare  We have been seeing some major advancements in the A.I in the recent months. So far, A.I has worked towards helping the human species of this world.

The Bengalurean now teams up with his brother to stage the world&rsquo;s first Artificial Intelligence art show in New Delhi on August 17. Raghava is also among a few artists in the world to have had embraced multi-disciplinarity and artificial intelligence in his work. He tells Ralph Alex Arakal how art is undoubtedly the most powerful tool of expression.    Finding new ways bridge art with a new, seemingly unrelated has kept multi-faceted artist Raghava K.K. on his toes for decades. Hacking, brain mapping, world exploration &ndash; if Raghava is to be believed, art has a role to play in all these things. Well, that&rsquo;s just a taste of what the 38-year-old Bengalurean has been working for since he decided to give up on a formal education two decades ago, choosing instead to become a newspaper cartoonist.  Having lived and worked in the United States for many years, Raghava is making his return to the country to team up with his brother Karthik Kalyanaraman. Titled 64/1, the international movement will begin with India&rsquo;s first tryst with Artificial Intelligence-powered art show - an explosive beginning. It will bring artists, scientists and technologists from around the globe under a single umbrella in India.   &ldquo;It is essential for artists to think like scientists and be rigorous in their perception and thought process. At the same time, scientists need to be more creative in how they look at the world. We thought it is very important to bring these worlds together for a better tomorrow,&rdquo; Raghava says.  The first show of 64/1 which is scheduled to take place in August in Nature Morte, a gallery in New Delhi, will feature seven artists, one each from Turkey, New Zealand, England, Germany, Japan, USA and India. &ldquo;This will also make India the pioneer of the world&rsquo;s first Artificial Intelligence (AI) art show and we are very excited to make this happen,&rdquo; adds Raghava.  The campaign will also be their outreach towards discovering the &lsquo;cyborg age&rsquo; which will also see an official launch at the Kochi Biennale later this year. The duo with New York based Ben Tritt is working on using AI to paint alongside a human artist.   The first artist to be inducted as a National Geographic explorer, Raghava, who began his career as a newspaper cartoonist has already progressed in his career as a newspaper cartoonist, storyteller, artistic producer and much more.   Ask him what inspires him to expand the horizon of his professional career cutting across various disciplines and he says embracing the possibility of transcendence in the modern world is all what he aspires for. &ldquo;There is a part in each individual that is unsettled and craving for more. The realisation that we are not defined by who we are, but by who we will be is what inspired me to embark on my journey of life,&rdquo; Raghava says, proving just why he is a motivational storyteller and a four-time TED speaker.    Flashback to 1998 when he chose to leave formal education for good, Raghava recalls with a smile how he convinced his father Kalyanaraman Durgadas, a retired entrepreneur and now author (who won best debut author award at the recent Pune Literary Festival) to let him explore the world himself. &ldquo;As an 18-year-old who had just completed Class 12 in Science at Bishop Cotton Boys&rsquo; School, I was brainy enough to use his philosophical arguments against him. The world will be my classroom, I said, and promised him I would be both emotionally and financially independent to make a difference in the world and keeping my health and mind alert. And then began my new journey,&rdquo; he says. While his father taught him how to lead a respectable life, he credits his mom Leela Kalyanaraman with inspiring him to see life and art though the lens of love, compassion and commitment.    Raghava, still a teen, then approached a top tourism department official in Delhi used his convincing skills of mediation to ensure that his first ticket expenses to Strasbourg, France were met by the central government itself.   &ldquo;My pitch for cartooning people in Europe in an Indian backdrop, to make them feel like they&rsquo;re revisiting their home won me that. Once that happened, meeting new people and associating with them for different causes added a global perspective to my thoughts and ideas, later contributing to me settling down in New York till early this year when I chose to shift my base back to Namma Ooru,&rdquo; he says.    On being asked which avatar of his life he likes living, the witty-yet-thoughtful Raghava pauses for a moment before saying, &ldquo;I have no idea what be the next one is likely to be and I guess that&rsquo;s my favourite as of now.&rdquo; The same reflects further when he explains why training...",,en,,,,mixed,

We saw an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to improve that process. This article is all about how we did that, and where we are going with the technology.Let’s start with describing what an internal audit really is:Internal audits are mandatoryHumans review a large corpus of unstructured data looking for risk and controlsThis sounds like a good problem to address with artificial intelligence. But wait… Is this complex task even possible to automate?Yes it is.The rest of this article is about how we went from knowing nothing about audits to building an audit enhancement tool, starting from requirements gathering from subject matter experts, progressing to problem statements, and finally landing at a solution that helps auditors to do their thing.The AuditMap.ai process involves configuring an audit universe, dumping in internal reports and documents, and then using the output of the tool to gain insights on programs, activities, entities, risks, controls, and so forth.My first experience with internal audit was in the medical devices space (nuraleve.com), where we undergo regular ISO, Health Canada, and CE audits. Internal audit is a standard part of the medical devices manufacturing and distribution process on a global basis, and so Mathieu Lemay and I already had some exposure to the structure and function of an internal audits. What we didn’t see while working on the medical devices internal audits for a small company was the scale of internal audit at the enterprise level. It’s absolutely enormous.The internal audit function of many organizations — especially at public companies and governments — is gigantic, mandatory, and not very effective. It took some deep work with audit professionals for us to fully understand the scope of the problem, and to implement the solution.First Things First: Understanding Internal Audit in 3 Easy StepsLike all good projects, we started with the help of our industry partners to briefly create a definition of Internal Audit. This led us to the use cases for applying deep learning.Step 1: Why Internal Audits ExistGaining a fundamental understanding of the purpose of Internal Audit (IA) was a prerequisite before we could begin throwing deep learning around (AI for IA. hahaha) for this highly unstructured data. And so, we turned first to the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) for clarifications:“The internal audit activity should monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the organization’s risk management system.” — IIA-Standard 2110.A1The documentation goes on to further explain:“The internal audit activity should assist the organisation by identifying and evaluating significant exposures to risk and contributing to the improvement of risk management and control systems.” — IIA-Standard 2110 –Risk ManagementSo basically, IA is there to find problems. Now that we had this clear definition of IA from IIA, we set off to understand at both management and process levels, how audits are conducted.Step 2: How Internal Audits Are OrganizedHow enterprises of all sizes achieve “evaluating the effectiveness of [their] risk management system” is through the performance of several internal assessments (“audits”) to get the pulse of various segments of their organization’s operations. We dug deeper into this, to outline these assessments’ underlying methods and processes, and came across this key structure of any risk management system: The Audit Universe. Each company defines the components of their Audit Universe by distinctly identifying:Corporate Structure, and accountability frameworksInternal subdivisions & External ComponentsPrograms of operationsActivities within each programEssentially, the boundary outlined by the Audit Universe identifies all things that can, and are subject to the supervision of the organization. It is within this audit universe that all internal audits and assessments are conducted, thus leading to step 3.Step 3: Conducting an Internal Audit 101Internal auditing, simplified, boils down to being an evaluation of how a segment of the organization performs when compared to their appropriate compliance or policy requirements. Similar to ISO, you say what you do, do what you say, and then verify that you did what you said you should do. Since internal audits are mandatory for all organizations’/groups’ intents and purposes, these activities are expected to adhere to a set of standards. Planning and undertaking these tasks requires a human’s review of a large corpus of unstructured data. This is where AI excels.Auditors want to identify and understand the risks and controls in the operations they’re called to audit through a few different lenses. These variants in perspective are used to comb for potential issues in processes, and involves inspecting entities:By Control Objectives, Strategic objectivesBy Frequency of risk occurrenceBy TypeThe reason for these different views is simply to look for problems. Notably, should a risk area be recurrently identified as consistently lacking for multiple years for which no control is being enforced, then this would be highlighted as an additional note to include in the management audit report. Similarly, if no risks or controls are identified, this can indicate to the auditor that there is a hidden risk within a program or process that is not being evaluated.Oh No! Internal Audit is BrokenThis manual process of doing internal audits is super broken. I described above what intrernal audits are supposed to do. As we worked to understand the nature of internal audit, we discovered an increasing amount of more and more breakages along processes, ranging from bias in audit selection and completeness to inadequate personnel training methods and highly manual labor intensive audit processes.Today internal audit is a broken window into the risks and controls hiding within mountains of internal reports from across the organization.Here are a few examples we found in our requirements collection:Quantifiable overview is not available. Numbers are hard to generate, and so the 50,000 foot view is often misleading. The content’s corpus is generally sampled, as there is too much documentation to analyze manually.The process is dependant on non-quantifiable human decisions: Risks aren’t identified as they should, Controls are ineffectively associated. Not to mention the “Humans have feelings” factor; bias in both background and experience.Knowledge transfer is poor — leading to silos of knowledge and heavy reliance on key staff members.Some programs are over-evaluated while others are rarely audited. Example: credit card audits are too common, and management audits are too rare. If the only risks addressed in audit are financial risks, then other critical factors such as technology risk.The goal of the audit function is to demonstrate process performance and expose problems, rather than to just check a box and say you did an audit.The list goes on…The main pain points for internal audit are audit completeness, better report investigation, and ensuring best practices during the audit. This grindingly manual process of doing internal audits required some significant rework, and was clearly an area that could benefit from our implementation of deep learning models.Example of how to define the audit universe template and risk management framework within AuditMap.aiExample Audit Universe (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment). The full tree is available here.How AuditMap.ai Improves Internal AuditHaving collected end-user requirements and identified flaws in the IA process with subject matter experts, our team was left with an opportunity to improve things. In short, we established our vision as, applying deep learning to internal audit, to bring better business outcomes without compromising audit quality.AuditMap.ai is a natural language understanding tool that enables auditors to direct their assessments to known industry-wide issues: audit completeness, better report investigation, and ensuring best practices during the audit. Applying deep learning accelerates audit functions by resolving routine legwork bogging down the auditors’ ability to assess and report with no compromise on quality.Consider a motivating example…Example — As a Director, knowing what you’re working withThe ability to paint a high level picture for the audit function shouldn’t be hard. Right now, it is. It is the top-of-mind item of audit directors, new or established. AuditMap.ai uses a digital and interactive Audit Universe, and so knowing the lay of the land becomes the new standard. Say, for example, Acting Audit Director “X” needs a big-picture understanding of the risk environment associated to each of the programs under her supervision. Our tools provides the following key capabilities:Automatically identify risks, controls, and other key entities within all audit universe documentation.Map out a knowledge graph of entity relationships to accompany the risk summary.Map and relate risks and controls to documents within the audit universeSegment off the risk statements having high similarity, in an effort to identify areas of possible audit efficiencies, andReveal at a roll-up of the risks by program, revealing where there are no audit documents or risk statements within the audit universe, indicating a program that has been ignored by the audit function.AuditMap provides quantifiable overviews and puts the director and her team of auditors in a position where the critical focus of their efforts is placed on understanding the universe in which their work evolves, and working to deliver the work products the C-suite expects of them.Having a profound understanding of an assessment scope can lead to more discoveries of efficiencies as more people involved in planning are empowered to ask questions along the lines of “How can our work be improved? Can it be simplified? Are there means being conducted outside of the scope of this program that we could leverage?”Our solution required a lot of data labelling on sample audit reports, in order to form a basis for training a model to understand various types of sentences and their meaning. Applied deep learning lends itself quite well to benefiting the performance of a planning phase exploration of programs. Leveraging the capabilities suggested in the examples above, AuditMap.ai can use deep learning models to combine the results of risk and control reports created by AI-powered inferences indexed in an enhanced search engine (ElasticSearch with Kibana) capable of identifying text fragments of interest using syntax and/or semantics. Needless to say, this solution presents a leap forward in business processes automation for audit managers, leaving them more time to coach their teams and share their knowledge without consistently relying on key staff for mundane document understanding tasks.Conclusion and Future WorkIn conclusion, AuditMap.ai uses deep learning to accelerate a wealth of processes within the internal audit function. This holds especially true for contexts requiring a largely resource-intensive effort using digitized documentation, ranging from advanced search methods to document segmentation. In the case of internal audit, the way forward to better, faster, business outcomes is paved by applied deep learning.The few examples demonstrated in the article above, among others, are fully operational and deployed in our AI-powered internal audit solution, AuditMap.aiWe are in the sales cycle now (finally) and our target market is audit shops, the big 5, and large enterprise clients as early adopter customers.

This is to say that the machines can imitate human behavior and replicate humans. In a way , it reduces human efforts , thereby , increasing efficiency at work. But on the other hand , machines taking place of human labour also have negative impact since it takes the place of employment of people.Artificial Intelligence poses a great threat to humanity.  Stephen Hawking who is a cosmologist and theoretical physicist has also cautioned of the forthcoming threats that are likely to happen with the use of AI in the development of weapons.There is a serious need among people to contemplate about the effects and impacts that artificial intelligence will have on human race. Scientists have warned that if these artificial machines and facets take place of human labour , then such a development will lead to mass unemployment. According to World Bank’s 2014 report, countries such as Macedonia, Mauritania and Lesotho had an unemployment rate of 30.2%, 31.9%, and 34.9% respectively (Ford, 2015). There would be increased poverty, hunger, illiteracy, dependency, crime, reduced life expectancy among other things. Earlier , people embraced this ideology, but soon they realised that this is at the cost of such loss of employment.Though , if we look from the context of companies , they are giving positive response. And why not , since the machines do not ask them pay checks after every month. The machines do not look at the clocks or work as per restricted hours.Unemployment has caused anguish in the mindset of youth. Also , they have valid reasons as well. Money spent on education , struggles involved and then scholarly results lead them nowhere , hence it is bound to frustrate them. This takes a negative turn and hampers their growth and then they are indentured to explore the criminal world. To earn money , to fulfil their needs and to accomplish their goals and mainly to live as per what they dreamt of are the few reasons because of which they participate in criminal activities. It has been observed that some of the biggest dons/mafia are highly qualified people. So that leaves us with no question that scholars do get attracted towards the villainous world.Therefore , there should be proper method followed so that the harmony and compatibility between artificial intelligence and youth employment be maintained. The youth should not be made to suffer or lead to reprehensible conditions.         AffairsCloud Recommends Oliveboard Mock TestIBPS RRB Officer - Free Mock TestIBPS RRB Assistant - Free Mock TestSBI Clerk - Free Mock TestSBI PO - Free Mock TestIBPS Clerk - Free Mock TestRBI Grade B - Free Mock Test
